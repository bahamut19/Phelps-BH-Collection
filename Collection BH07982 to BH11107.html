<p>O Manzar, upon thee be the Glory of God! O thou who art named after the Most Sublime Vision! In the name of the Goal of all the worlds! O Manzar! Thou art mentioned in the Most Sublime Vision. Every mention among mentions and every thing among things shall be seized by the hand of extinction according to the exigencies of divine wisdom, save the Sun of the Word of God, exalted be His glory, which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Supreme Pen. It shall endure through the eternality of the kingdom and the realm above. If thou wouldst ponder on this Word, thou wouldst forever utter “Thine is the praise, O God of the worlds!” This is the day of service and the day of deeds. Blessed is the soul whom the clamor of the world hath not prevented from the Dayspring of light and the Dawning-place of revelation, who hath rent asunder the veils of idle fancies and hath arisen with complete steadfastness to reform the world. Such a one is accounted among the people of Baha in the Crimson Book by the Supreme Pen. Blessed is he! Blessed is he!</p>

<p>His honor Haji Mehdi, who has attained</p>
<p>He is the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O Mehdi! God willing, may you be assisted through the grace of the True One, exalted be His glory, and be adorned with the ornament of steadfastness. All on earth sought and yearned for the presence of this blessed Day, and when the dawn of the Day appeared, shining and radiant with the lights of the Divine Countenance, all turned away save a few souls. By the life of God, these souls were and are the most exalted of creation, and all are, in the sight of God, on the same plane. Were the station of faith to be made manifest today, all the sincere ones, the near ones, and the unitarians would perish from joy and gladness. The bounty for which all were waiting - while the learned ones, the mystics, and the princes of the earth remained heedless of it - you have attained through the grace of God, exalted be His glory, and time after time you have drunk from the Kawthar of reunion. Forget not this bounty. Thus does He command you, from Whose presence is the Mighty Book. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Nabil, upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness and My mercy which hath preceded existence. We have made mention of every name that was in thy book and have sent down for each one that which shall speak at the heart of the world. The All-Merciful hath come with manifest sovereignty. Be thou steadfast in the Cause and speak amongst the servants that which will attract them to My most exalted horizon and draw them nigh unto God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. The servant in attendance hath appeared before Us with letters from My loved ones, and in each one of them are mentioned names. Each one of them hath attained unto a token from My Most Exalted Pen and the choice wine of My beloved remembrance. Glory be upon thee, O thou who hast attained unto My presence and heard My call and drunk the water of immortality of My love and spoken in remembrance of Me amongst My servants. Verily thy Lord doth witness and behold, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>

<p>O Himmat! We have made mention of thee with a mention before which all mentions bow down, and with an utterance around which circle the utterances of the chosen ones. Say: My God, my God! With what tongue can I recall Thy gifts and bounties? I was heedless - the breezes of Thy Revelation awakened me. I was asleep - the fingers of Thy grace pinched me and raised me up to Thy Cause. I was ignorant - Thou didst guide me to the ocean of Thy knowledge and learning. I was silent - Thou didst cause me to speak forth Thy praise. Thou art He Who, O my God, guided me to Thy path and made me know the Dawning-Place of Thy lights, the Source of Thy inspiration, and the Manifestation of Thy Self. I beseech Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all created things, to assist me in that which its fragrance will never cease to endure through the perpetuity of Thy dominion and kingdom, and Thy might and power. Then write down for me, O my God, my Goal and my Object of worship, the good of this world and the next. Verily Thou art the Lord of all mankind. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the Most Great.</p>

<p>O my leaf! When the rapture of My call takes hold of thee, say: My God, my God! Thou seest one of Thy handmaidens turning toward the horizon of Thy prison and clinging to the cord of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the letters of Thy Book and by the Ha through which Thou didst manifest the station of pure Identity, to make me patient in the occasions of Thy decree and steadfast when the tempestuous winds blow. Verily Thou art the Creator of names and attributes. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, detached from all else but Thee, and beseeching the ocean of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy giving. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne and the manifestations of Thy grandeur, and by the Tablet which none hath known save Thee, to make me in all conditions holding fast to the hem of Thy generosity, and speaking amongst Thy handmaidens in Thy remembrance and praise.

<p>O My leaf! Upon thee be My Baha! Praise be to God that thou hast drunk from the hand of bounty the wine of everlasting life, and hast attained unto that which hath been the hope of them that are near unto God and of the sincere ones. The hands of divine grace and mercy have revealed from the Mother Book, in thy name, that which is adorned with eternal life. Every word that hath been revealed from the Mother Book is better than a hundred thousand children, both high and beloved. These children require no sustenance or clothing, existing as they do in the cities of praise and glorification, mentioned by thy name. Events affect them not. They have endured and shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endureth. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this mighty remembrance, this manifest grace, and this exalted Word from God, the Lord of all mankind. The glory from Us be upon thee, O My handmaiden, and upon My handmaidens who have believed in the One, the All-Informed.</p>

Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God and the God of all names, my Creator and the Creator of the heavens! And glory be unto Thee, O God of the world and Lord of the nations! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy verses and the effulgences of the Sun of Thy grace to aid me to manifest great steadfastness before the faces of the handmaidens. O my Lord! Thou seest Thy leaf clinging to the Tree of Thy bounty and generosity. I beseech Thee not to disappoint her of that which is with Thee. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Effusive, the Forgiving, the Generous. O My handmaiden! Thou hast mentioned that handmaiden of God who hath ascended to the Supreme Companion. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to cause her to enter the Most Glorious Paradise, to send down upon her mercy from His presence and grace from His own Self, and to forgive her through His bounty which hath encompassed existence and through His generosity which hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>

Rejoice, rejoice, O My Leaf, in that the Divine Lote-Tree remembereth thee from this spot wherein the call of God, the Lord of Lords, hath been raised. We have adorned thee with the ornament of My kinship and have made mention of thee in such wise that the near ones shall find from it the fragrance of thy Lord’s garment, the Lord of the Final Return. Say: My God, my God! The sweet fragrance of Thy utterance hath enraptured me and the choice wine of Thy Most Great Name hath intoxicated me. Thou seest me, O my God, turning toward Thee, gazing upon Thy horizon, and awaiting the wonders of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by the breathings of Thy Revelation and the lights of Thy countenance to ordain for me and for my son the good of this world and of the world to come. Then write down, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which befitteth the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy grace.

<p>In the Name of the One Incomparable God! O Yari! The One Incomparable Friend declares: The whole world hath been created for the recognition of the Ancient Lord in this Most Great Announcement, and hath been brought from nothingness into being. Yet when the morn of the divine Day dawned from the horizon of Will, all were found to be debarred and deprived, save whom God pleased. Well is it with thee for having drunk the Choice Wine sealed with My Self-Subsisting Name, and for having turned toward the Supreme Horizon on a Day wherein the limbs of all names trembled. Verily thy Lord is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed. We counsel thee to observe wisdom, for the people are weak. The Lord, exalted be His glory, hath shown forbearance out of pure grace. Therefore must all be mindful of wisdom and treat mankind with kindliness and compassion. He, verily, is the Compassionate, the Bountiful. The Glory rest upon thee and upon those with thee and upon them that have attained unto the days of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>Here is Yaqub, upon him be the Glory of God. He is the One Who speaks before all faces. O Yaqub! We have been with you and heard your cry regarding this irrevocable Cause. Hear the call from the Supreme Horizon: “Verily, there is no God but Me, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty.” His Holiness Moses conveyed the Word of God to the Pharaoh of his time, and in the early days a strong party secretly supported him. However, the King of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and unseen summoned all kings without any veil or barrier, and guided them to the Supreme Horizon, at a time when there was no helper visible and no supporter apparent. The might of the divines and rulers did not prevent Him from speaking the word of truth. He spoke that which was the cause of exaltation and ascension. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to confirm you with a confirmation that the oppression of oppressors cannot prevent. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Joseph! Your letter has come and been read by the servant who stands before the Throne. Verily your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have heard your call and answered you, and turned toward you from this exalted station. We found your letter sanctified from the allusions of those who have denied God, the Most High, the Most Great. Blessed art thou for having turned to Him from Whom the world has turned away, though it was created for His manifestation - to this testify the Books of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We mentioned thee before with a mention through which the Concourse on High perceived the fragrance of My Most Glorious Robe. Rejoice thou and be of the thankful ones. Beware lest anything prevent thee from this Remembrance, through which all things and the Lord of Names have called out. God hath come with His wondrous Remembrance.

<p>In the name of God and humanity we protest to you against the plight which we have been subjected to from the Turkish government. Six years ago we were invited at the Ottoman suggestion and we have accepted. Later, without having committed any fault and at the request of Persia we were sent from Baghdad to Constantinople. After a stay of 4 months, we were exiled to Adrianople.</p>
<p>Now, once again, we are being exiled from Adrianople without the knowledge of where we are destined and without any reason, all our possessions were disposed of. If the Turkish government does not welcome us any more, and as we are not of this country let us be free to go into a country of another power. It is to the sovereigns of Europe who like to help the oppressed that we plead, supplicating them to release us from this bondage.</p>

<p>Today the people of God are souls who have, with the strength of certitude, shattered the idols of vain imaginings. Neither the might of princes nor the clamor of divines could hold them back from the Lord of Names. The All-Knowing, the All-Informed, says: Today the world is illumined by the lights of Him Who conversed with God on Sinai, and the Divine Call is raised. Blessed is the eye that hath beheld it and blessed is the ear that hath heard it. Thy mention was made in the presence of the Wronged One, and these exalted words were revealed from the Source of verses: I swear by the Sun of knowledge which hath shone forth from the horizon of the world that all the earth and whatsoever is found therein cannot be compared to a single word from the divine words. Know thou the worth and station of the Word of God and preserve it with thine eye. These days are God’s days. Blessed are they who possess true knowledge, blessed are they who have attained, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

Great indeed is this Day, for the Mighty Announcement hath been manifested therein, and whatsoever was mentioned and promised in the divine Books of the past and present hath become clear and evident. All the peoples of the world, throughout the nights and days, beseeched to attain the presence of the Day of God; yet when the Sun of Revelation shone forth and the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree was raised up, all arose in opposition save whom God, the Lord of the worlds, did will. While time remaineth and opportunity existeth, strive that perchance thou mayest attain to that which beseemeth the days of God. This is the counsel of the Wronged One unto the friends of God. Blessed is he who heareth and acteth, and woe unto the heedless. We counsel thee and thy brother to manifest the most great steadfastness in this mighty and exalted Cause.</p>

<p>In the Name of the One God! Today is a day when the gates of heaven are opened and the rain of mercy descendeth continuously, yet the people are seen to be deprived and veiled. The cause and reason for the veiling of the people hath been and will continue to be the most great veil, which is the ignorance that the ignorant ones of the earth have bound unto themselves in the name of knowledge. Therefore ask thou God, thy Lord, to protect His servants from those through whose tyranny the dwellers of the cities of names and the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise have lamented. They have forbidden all servants from the Truth and have summoned them to the dawning-places of vain imaginings and their manifestations. Away with them and with those who have followed them without any clear proof or enlightening Book! God willing, thou shalt in all conditions hold fast to the hem of the grace of the Self-Subsisting Lord, remain turned toward His horizon, and act according to that which He hath revealed in the Book.</p>

Give thanks unto God for having caused thee to know His Self and bestowed upon thee the knowledge of His Cause and made thee to be numbered among those who are guided, as recorded in the Mother Book. Beware lest thou waver when the winds blow from near and far. Be steadfast in thy love for thy Lord and turn thy heart toward the holy and resplendent Beauty. Thus doth the Dove counsel thee and inspire thee with that which will gladden thy soul, if thou be possessed of insight. Then convey Our remembrance to all who have believed in God and His signs and who are well-pleased in God’s religion.</p>

<p>He is the Most Exalted, the Most Holy, the Most High!</p>
<p>O Mirror of Bounty! Bear thou witness to that whereunto God Himself hath testified at the midmost heart of eternity, that verily I am alive in the Most Glorious Horizon. Say: By God! He doth in truth, at this very moment and from this Horizon, both hear and see, and He proclaimeth: “O people of the Bayan! Did We not promise you My manifestation? Yet when I revealed Myself, wherefore did ye turn away and become numbered with the idolaters? Did We not command you to cling to naught at the time of the Manifestation from amongst all that hath been created in the heavens and on earth? Did We not teach you that ye should not regard Him with your own eyes but with His eyes, and that whoso regardeth Him with any eye save His own shall never know Him, even should he ponder His Cause for as long as God, the Mighty, the Powerful, endureth?</p>
<p>“Therefore do I ask of you, O people, one word of pure truth - be ye fair in it and be not of the heedless. By what proof did ye believe in My Self on the Day when the clouds were cleft asunder and the Ancient Beauty came in My Most Great Name? If ye believed in My Self, by God, this is My Self come unto you with manifest sovereignty. And if ye believed in what was revealed unto Me of God’s verses, by God, that which hath flowed from His Pen hath filled the East and West of the earth with My verses, as ye yourselves have witnessed and are among those who bear witness.</p>
<p>“O people! Fear ye God, and make not your deeds null and void, and follow not in His Cause every rebellious satan, and make not His recognition dependent upon the testimony of any created thing, for all else besides Him hath been created by His Word, if ye be of those who perceive. Have ye not witnessed God’s sovereignty in His manifestation and His power in His arising against all who dwell on earth, in days wherein souls were troubled and the feet of the mystics did slip? By God! He is verily the Glory of God in the heaven of eternity, and His radiance unto all who dwell in the kingdom of names, and His manifestation and His grandeur unto all the worlds.</p>
<p>“Whoso denieth Him this day and writeth the Bayan - his own pen doth curse him, were he to hearken, and addresseth him in its inmost tongue saying: ‘O thou who associateth partners with God! By what proof dost thou write His verses while denying His Self, the Merciful, the Compassionate? I verily disavow thee and seek refuge with God that He may deliver me from thy wicked fingers, and I turn unto Him in repentance from having met thee, and I am the first of the penitent.’ And whoso readeth today the verses of God while believing not in this manifest, resplendent, luminous Revelation - his own tongue belieth him and curseth him with the tongue God hath ordained in its essence, saying: ‘O thou heedless one! Thou deniest the Ancient Beauty, yet readest what hath proceeded from His finger. Woe unto thee from the punishment of a grievous day!’</p>
<p>“By God! This is He through Whose manifestation the light of His radiance hath shone forth upon all things according to their nature. There is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. O people! Look ye this day with the proof whereby your faith and the mission of all the Prophets and Messengers is established. Were ye to purify yourselves from the defilement of self and desire, ye would surely find in all that appeareth from Him the fragrance of God, the Sovereign, the Powerful, the Exalted, the Wise.”</p>
<p>Thus hath your Lord, the Most High, spoken forth in the Most Glorious Companion, that perchance the people may become aware within themselves and make up for that which they have neglected in the Cause of God, and be numbered with those who have recognized God by His Self and who have detached themselves from all else.</p>
<p>Know thou moreover that the previous Manifestation complained unto thee concerning all the Mirrors, and I complain unto thee concerning all in this Mirror which hath opposed God and warred against His Self.</p>
<p>By God! She warred against My Person, disputed My verses, and sought to shed My sanctified, holy and luminous blood. By God! She looks upon Me with aspects which none can enumerate save God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers. By God! She hath done to Me what no one hath done to another, and were I to mention it, I would be unable due to the intensity of grief that overtakes Me at its remembrance. Then would weep for My wronged Self the Eye of God upon the thrones of all possible things, and My own Self sufficeth as witness to what I say. And if thou desirest to become aware of this, go forth from thy house, then proceed outside thy city to a place where thou findest thyself alone. Then turn thy face toward God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, raise thy hands to God, thy Beloved and the Beloved of them that know, and say:</p>
<p>O Lord! I have come from the west of fancy that the lights of certitude might dawn upon me from the dawning-place of the sovereignty of Thy Most Great and Most High Name. O Lord! I am the one who hath fled from myself, from all that I had known before, and from all the worlds, for whatsoever Thou hast taught me of the knowledge of Thyself in one moment will not profit me in another, as I am certain that in every instant Thou art upon a new manifestation, and I know that Thou manifestest Thyself to all created things through Thy name, the All-Knowing, in every moment as Thou hadst not manifested before, for the manifestations of Thy creation shall never end, by the everlasting nature of Thy Self that standeth over all creation. And I, O my God, am he who hath not limited Thy manifestation by the limitations of myself nor by the indication of any existent thing, for I am certain that Thou canst not be indicated by any indication, nor limited by any limitation, for limitations are the attribute of Thy creation, while Thou hast ever been sanctified above the knowledge of every knowing one, and none can encompass Thy knowledge save Thyself. To this do my tongue, my being, my heart and my inmost heart bear witness, and I am possessed of clear certitude.</p>
<p>O Lord! I am he who hath confessed that Thou art not known save through Thyself, and I bear witness that Thou doest what Thou willest in Thy dominion. And whoso beareth witness to this word will never object to Thee in Thy Cause, nor will he hesitate in Thy wondrous and mighty Cause. O Lord! Purify my heart from the veils of all who are in the heavens and the earth, that there might be imprinted upon it the effulgences of Thy shining and luminous lights. O Lord! Sever me from all else save Thee, then inspire within me that which will draw me to the court of Thy holiness and cause me to soar in the atmosphere which Thou hast made sanctified from the cloying of the wings of the doubtful ones.</p>
<p>O Lord! Deprive me not of the breezes that waft today from the right hand of the throne of Thy mercy, and exclude me not from beneath Thy glances. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful. O Lord! Cause to shine forth upon me from the horizon of the Garment the Sun of glory and sanctification, that I might know Thee in this wondrous Garment. Make me not, O my God, of those who believed in Thee in the garment of one of Thy names, then, when Thou didst change the garment and didst manifest Thyself in the garment of another name, they dispersed from around Thee and were among the rejectors. Then do all things testify that they believed not in Thy Self but in the garment which is a name among Thy names. Had they believed in Thee, they would not have disbelieved in this Manifestation, the like of which hath not appeared in creation and whose lights have encompassed all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>O Lord! Make me pure for meeting Thee, then honor me with visiting Thy Beauty, then send down upon me from the heaven of Thy mercy that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, then make my feet firm upon Thy Path that is evident, manifest and straight.</p>
<p>Lower then thy hands in sublime submissiveness and humility, and with the ear of thine inmost nature hearken unto all things. By God! Thou wilt hear the lamentation of all created things, and then the sighing of the Concourse on High, for what hath befallen My soul at the hands of him whom We taught and supported throughout the nights and days. None is aware of this save God, the Most High, the All-Knowing. I shielded him with Mine own breast against the darts of the enemies, protecting him lest the arrows of the idolaters reach him, while he, in his innermost heart, lay in wait to slay Me. When God unveiled the hidden designs of his soul, he rose up against Me with calumnies, that he might instill rancor in the breasts of those who had taken vain imaginings as their lord instead of God, the True Sovereign, the Just, the All-Wise. Thou hast indeed associated with Me - didst thou ever find Me willing to harm any created thing? Be fair, then, and be of the equitable. Had I desired to harm My brother, was I not able to do so? Yet despite My power over him and My knowledge of his condition, I sheltered him beneath My wing for twenty years, while he would veil his face in fear of both friend and foe. When at last he felt secure, he emerged like a serpent to sting Me at every moment, until no spot remained on My body that bore not the mark of his venom, wert thou but of those who hear. Consider then, given My forbearance, tranquility, patience and concealment, what hath caused Me to cry out between the heavens and the earth. By God! Wert thou to reflect, thou wouldst know that which none among all the worlds hath known. Would that thou hadst been apprised of the root of this matter! We had desired aforetime to mention it to thee, but God decreed what He decreed, and verily He inspireth His servants with whatsoever He willeth, and He hath power over all things. Step forth, then, from behind the veil of silence and patience, and make mention of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Fear no one, but put thy trust in God, the Mighty, the Beauteous. Say: O people! Board ye the Ark of Glory which saileth upon the crimson sea in the name of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted. By God! Whoso holdeth fast unto it hath attained salvation, and whoso turneth away is drowned and numbered among the perishing.</p>
<p>Glory, then light and radiance, be upon him who was named after the first letter of My name, and upon those who surround thee, whether female or male, young or old. We have heard that thy son hath ascended unto God. We share in thy sorrow and beseech God to cause him to dwell nigh unto His mercy, to give him to drink from the cups of His bounty, to purify him from transgression and clothe him in the robes of forgiveness - verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful - and to place him in the highest companionship, in fellowship with His chosen ones and loved ones, and to send down upon him at every moment a mercy from His presence. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. But grieve thou not. By God! If thou wert to look with the eye of the heart, thou wouldst behold him even now freed from all opposition, detached from those who disbelieved and associated partners with God, and in communion with those on whose faces thou findest the freshness of bliss. We beseech God to grant thee the reward for this and to aid thee to be patient. Verily He is the Rewarder of the patient. Verily unto God do we belong, and unto Him shall we return.</p>

<p>O Mirza ’Abdu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God, He Who is the Protector over all names! We have remembered thee and do remember thee at a time when sorrows have encompassed Us through that which the hands of the heedless have wrought. This is a day wherein the dwellers of Paradise lament because of the tyranny that hath appeared from the divines of the earth. They are indeed among the most lost in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. They have imprisoned and plundered and taken captive the friends of God with an injustice at which the rock hath cried out, the Divine Lote-Tree hath called aloud, and the Faithful Spirit hath struck his face in grief. Soon shall the evidences of wrath seize them from every direction, as testified by this mighty Book. Say: O people of Baha! Ye have attained unto tribulation in the path of God, the Lord of all names. We counsel you to patience and steadfastness. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Wise Counsellor. Thus have the rains of My loving-kindness poured forth from the heaven of My bounty. Blessed are they that have attained, and joy be to them that have understood.</p>

<p>He is the One Who speaketh from the most exalted Station, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>We have adorned the heaven of knowledge with the stars of meaning and utterance. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto the heedless ones who have cast the Book of God behind their backs by following every remote ignorant one. Say: The Promised One hath come with the truth. Fear God, O people, and be not of the wrongdoers. Should your desires prevent you, cast them aside by a command from God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: By God! That which ye possess shall profit you not this day. He Who hath spoken before all faces beareth witness to this, that there is no God but I, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Give thanks unto God for My remembrance of thee and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast remembered me and guided me to Thy straight path. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me the outpourings of the ocean of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>

<p>The Most Great, the Most Glorious! We have adorned the heaven of souls with the sun of trustworthiness and the moon of truthfulness and the stars of virtuous character, yet most of the people are heedless. Blessed is the soul who acts according to what was commanded by God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: Virtues are the stars of this heaven, and steadfastness is its sun and its sovereign, were you of those who know. O you who speak in praise of your Lord, hearken unto My call and My cry and My lamentation at what the hands of the oppressors have wrought. Verily, He Who created the world by a sign from His Pen - they say concerning Him what none of the ancients ever said. We commanded all to the Most Great Steadfastness, but when the croak of the croaker was raised, the feet of every heedless and remote one slipped. Be thou thankful to God for having caused thee to recognize the Manifestation of His Cause and guided thee to the straight path. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken when the Beloved was in evident sorrow.</p>

Among the people are those who turned away and denied after having testified, and among them are those who turned towards God and recognized Him, saying: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds, for having caused me to know Thee and made me one of those who have attained unto the lights of Beauty.” Say: O people! Fear God and follow not those who follow vain imaginings. Respond to Him Who calleth you to the Dayspring of lights. We have found from thee the fragrance of My love, and We have sent down verses unto thee that thou mayest recite them at eventide and at dawn.

<p>Verily, We were walking in the prison of ’Akka, detached from all created things, and speaking in remembrance of the Lord of Names, when I was bidden to make mention unto thee of that whereby God’s proof hath been perfected unto all else, and His testimony made manifest to all who dwell in earth and heaven. When the irrevocable decree came forth from the presence of the Ancient King, My limbs trembled with fear of God, the Omnipotent, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and weeping overtook Me to such extent that all things wept at My weeping, and the Daysprings of Names cried out by reason of what I beheld of the people’s turning away from Him by Whom the Sacred Scriptures were adorned. Hearken unto the Call from the precincts of eternity, from the Divine Lote-Tree raised upon the white earth at the right hand of the luminous spot: “Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Choosing!”</p>
<p>By My life! It grieveth Me to see thee silent in this time of utterance, and seated in this time of rising up. Beware lest knowledge debar thee from the Known One. Abandon idle fancies through the Name of thy Lord, the Self-Subsisting, and arise amidst mankind with such steadfastness as cannot be followed by sitting, and say: “O people! The Promise hath come, and the Promised One hath appeared with such sovereignty as neither the might of princes nor the signs of the learned can withstand.” When asked by what proof, recite thou this Tablet from whose horizon hath shone the Sun of wisdom and utterance. We have desired to give thee to drink of the Living Waters from the hands of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. This is not from Me, but from thy Lord, the Revealer of verses. The winds of the Divine Will move Me as they please. The Command is in His grasp; He doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty that encompasseth all lands.</p>
<p>We desired to show thee the Supreme Horizon and cause thee to hear the Call of God, the Lord of the latter and the former days, that it might attract thee to the most exalted Station. O thou who circlest round the Fire! Enter thou therein through the power of faith. Verily it is light and mercy from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. How many a great one hath been withheld from the Most Great Ocean, and how many a child hath drawn nigh and been immersed therein by God’s leave, the Transcendent, the All-High. Verily, he who hath attained today is among the most exalted of creatures before the Truth, and he who hath been withheld is but a brayer, though he be among the most learned of men.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Move across the Tablet by the leave of the Creator of Heaven and the Lord of Names, then make mention of him whom thou wert commanded to remember, with verses whereby the fragrance of the garment of reunion hath wafted to all regions. Say: Look, then remember those days wherein the Sun of Truth shone forth from the horizon of Hijaz. The learned and the literary opposed Him until they spoke of Him that which rent asunder the heaven of knowledge and disturbed the hearts of the righteous, while those who had no standing among the people believed in Him. Thus was the matter decreed in the Book. Then observe when the Spirit came with clear signs, those possessed of mere learning opposed Him, and he who was deemed the most learned of his age denied Him, until God raised Him to a station whereunto the birds of hearts and imaginations cannot soar. Verily, all sacred Books were revealed for the knowledge of God. He who is debarred therefrom, neither the scrolls of earth nor devotions and prayers shall profit him.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of divines! How long will ye remain slumbering upon the couch of heedless negligence? The inhabitants of the cities of divine names have been seized with yearning at the wafting of the fragrance of the Divine Presence, inasmuch as He Who was recorded in the books of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, hath appeared. Say: Abandon what ye possess and hold fast unto that which ye have been given from the presence of Him Who is the Lord of all men. Cast aside oppression, then gaze with the eye of fairness: can any one of you soar with the bird of inner meanings in the atmosphere of knowledge and utterance? Nay, by your Lord, the All-Merciful! The Cause hath appeared in such wise that none can deny it save every heedless doubter. Beware lest the veils of glory prevent you from the All-Possessing, the Most High. Rend asunder the greatest veil through the power of your Lord, the Possessor of Destiny. By God, the Truth! The Hour hath passed and the mountains have been scattered. Blessed are they who are endowed with vision. We have neither studied the sciences nor perused the arts. To this beareth witness every fair-minded and discerning soul. I was seated when the Command of God raised Me up, and I was silent when He Who hath caused all things to speak forth the praise of His Self, the All-Subduing Lord of all horizons, gave Me utterance. Blessed is he who pondereth that which hath been revealed through truth and recognizeth that which lay concealed in the depths of allusions. He is of them that are possessed of insight in this Most Great Scene. To this testifieth the Lord of men, through Whom this Sealed Wine was unsealed and clear proof was made manifest. If thou wouldst ponder upon that which hath befallen the Dayspring of Divine verses in successive years, thou wouldst be assured that He speaketh not of His own desire, but rather through that which He hath been taught by Him Who sent Him with an evidence whereat every possessor of knowledge and understanding hath been confounded. We have summoned all unto God: among them are some who have turned away, and among them are those who have turned with humility and repentance toward the Most Great Ocean. By My life! If thou shouldst find the sweetness of utterance, thou wouldst arise to assist thy Lord, the All-Merciful, detached from all possibility, and would proclaim at the top of thy voice between earth and heaven, by this Name whereby all who are in creation were thunderstruck, save them whom God did rescue through power and sovereignty. Thus have We illumined the horizon of utterance with the sun of the remembrance of thy Lord’s name. Blessed is he who hath turned toward it; woe unto every froward deceiver. The glory from the people of glory be upon them who have been attracted by the breezes of revelation and whom no blame of any blamer among the infidels hath deterred from God.</p>

<p>He is the Ever-Abiding, Manifest and Visible from the Most Glorious Horizon</p>
<p>Many sublime Arabic Tablets have been revealed. Now the wondrous holy words of God are being uttered in the Persian tongue. Blessed are they that hear them! The Truth, exalted be His mention, hath ever been and shall forever remain sanctified above manifestation and appearance - an unknowable Mystery, an unfathomable Concealment, an unrevealed Inner Reality, an unhidden Treasure, and an unwitnessed Secret. For the term “mystery” holdeth true only when it remaineth unwitnessed; in such case it is not manifest and thus cannot be known. And after it becometh witnessed, the designation “mystery” no longer existeth whereby it might be known. Therefore, the Mystery hath been and shall ever remain unknowable. Blessed is the soul that pondereth this perfect, firm and divine Word, and attaineth unto the gem of its meaning treasured within. Should anyone claim to know the Mystery in its essence as Mystery, he hath been and shall ever be among the falsifiers. That Most Ancient Beauty is too exalted to be known except through Himself, and too sublime to be described save through His own holy Being. For whatsoever the created ones comprehend at the utmost degree of their understanding is but a fancy they have themselves conceived for themselves. Exalted is He above being known by that which is contingent!</p>
<p>And since the gates of knowledge and comprehension were closed, and the ultimate degree of the servants’ understanding rejected, the Sovereign of existence, through His grace and bounty, caused the Manifestations of Oneness and Daysprings of Divine glory to appear from the horizon of “Verily, I am He Who is manifest above all things,” so that all people might attain unto the knowledge of God through recognition of these Suns dawning from the horizon of truth, and might be blessed with obedience to God and submission to His will through obedience to these holy Beings. And in accordance with justice and the manifestation of grace, He bestowed upon each of these eternal and glorious Manifestations a proof and testimony, that no soul might find cause for turning away or making excuses, and that God’s proof might be complete and perfect unto all. The purpose of this supreme favor is that they might educate souls so that perchance they may enter the kingdom of the Divine Countenance and attain unto the station wherein “the Face of thy Lord endureth” - which is the ultimate goal of human existence - and may abide forever. I swear by the Ancient Beauty that if a soul should but once become pure and detached from this world and ascend unto the Supreme Companion, it shall never perish but shall attain from existence unto existence, and neither extinction nor annihilation shall ever find their way unto such existence and immortality. Yet what benefit is there when these people, with their impure hearts, fail to comprehend this divine melody?</p>
<p>These Manifestations of transcendent oneness have appeared from time immemorial until the time culminated in the first wondrous Manifestation in the final Vesture, and the Primal Point - exalted be His grandeur, sublime be His traces, and glorious be His majesty - arose from the Most Exalted Horizon and guided mankind to the pathway of immortality. Yet all the people clung to their religious leaders from among the divines and turned not to that Essence of Divine Unity, although He appeared with such compelling proof that all found themselves powerless to produce the like thereof. Then they arose in opposition and demanded supernatural signs. That Ancient Being composed the treatise of proofs known as the Seven Proofs, wherein He showed that all evidence and proof culminate in verses. From His sanctified Pen flowed that today these verses which descend from the clouds of glory are a proof to the East and West of the world, and there hath been and shall be no greater proof than this. Thus when the Crown Prince summoned that Essence of Eternity to his court and demanded proof, that Ancient Beauty declared that verses are the proof today. Yet in the end they accepted it not, and all gave verdict for the death of that Essence of Pre-existence, save a few who became assured through the divine verses and turned from the west of unbelief and error to the east of faith and recognition.</p>
<p>And thereafter that Ancient Being gave in all His revealed Tablets the glad tidings of this Most Great Manifestation, such that not a single line was revealed in the Bayan except that this most glorious mention was recorded therein, and He counseled all lest at the time of His appearance they remain veiled from the Beauty of the All-Merciful by the letters of the Bayan and the words revealed therein, as did the people of the Qur’an. Despite these admonitions, and this Most Great Manifestation and Most Holy Dawning which hath appeared with all divine power and with all the proofs of the Manifestations of eternal glory, all have turned away. Would that they had been content with what the people of the Qur’an perpetrated, for the people of the Qur’an merely gave verdict for the death of the Beauty of the All-Merciful, but this people have striven to cut down the Divine Tree. Finding themselves powerless to do so, they loosened their tongues in calumny. Assuredly by now the clamor of the idolaters hath reached that land. Yet praise be to God that they have attributed to this Most Pure Essence such things that any soul possessing the least grain of discernment or the tiniest particle of insight would perceive that these calumnies have issued from the source of rancor, the treasury of envy, and the mine of hatred. Therefore do the tongues of all atoms proclaim: “The curse of God be upon the first oppressor who wronged the Primal Point in His latter Manifestation, who warred against Him, who disputed His verses, who denied His presence, and who slandered Him.”</p>
<p>Yea, O servant! Such is the station of these unseemly and immature servants that for twenty years the Ancient Beauty was in the hands of His enemies in such wise that at every moment He was in peril of destruction - now in the prison of His foes, now in chains and fetters, and now at the mercy of the wicked. Yet despite this they have attributed worldliness and love thereof to this Essence of Spirit, even though the whole world and all that is therein were His creation. And if His Temple, the Throne itself, were to rest upon a ground of diamonds, it would be befitting - nay, worthy of His threshold’s servants. Yet I swear by the Ancient King that they who circle round His court have been and ever shall be sanctified from the world and all that is therein. Indeed, were one to observe, not a farthing of the world and its trappings would be found with the emigrants. Praise be to the Beloved that He hath created all patient and thankful, and they have uttered not these words and their like save to cast doubt in hearts. They are heedless that the deed of God is manifest and evident as the sun, and every possessor of sight hath perceived and will perceive it.</p>
<p>O servant! With spiritual wings soar to the holy heaven of God, and having purified thyself from the hints of all else but Him, gaze upon the Most Great Scene. I swear by the Truth that My affliction is greater than can be mentioned, and My tribulation mightier than can be recorded by the pen. I do but complain of my grief and sorrow unto God, and verily He is the best Lord and the best Helper. God willing, in these days ye shall not be deprived of the wondrous favors of the eternal King, nor be forbidden the peerless wine of the All-Glorious. And the Glory be upon thee and upon all who are with thee among the steadfast, patient, thankful and assured believers.</p>

God willing, may you remain firm in His Cause and steadfast in His love in such wise that no matter may prevent you from the Lord of Command. The glory be upon you.</p>

<p>In the Name of the One Friend! O ’Izzatu’llah! May you ever gaze toward the One Beloved Friend and remain detached and sanctified from all else. The glory of all today lies in the glory of God, which is the recognition of Him. And this recognition is not complete except through acknowledging His oneness and confessing His singleness, in such wise that no likeness, peer, similitude or equal be seen for Him. For if any likeness were to be seen for the Ancient Being and the Dawning Place of the Most Great Name, such a truth would be like creation and ever remain so. Hearken unto the counsel of the Faithful Counselor and strive that thou mayest attain unto the most great gift, which is the good-pleasure of the One Friend, and become free and independent of all else. This is God’s counsel to His loved ones. Hold fast unto it, detached from all the worlds. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

Blessed is the one who hath arisen with strength to serve the Cause, and woe unto every man whom the might of the mighty and the power of princes hath weakened - they who have cast the Book of God behind their backs and have uttered that which hath caused the denizens of the most exalted Paradise to lament. And they who aid the Cause of their Lord at morn and eventide. Beware lest the affairs of men sadden thee. Hearken unto the Call of thy Lord - verily He calleth thee from the precincts of the Prison with a call whereby the hearts of them that have recognized Him have been attracted. Take My Book in My Name, as bidden by Me, and I am verily the Ancient Commander. By My Word were the heavens raised up, and by My Name was the Throne established upon this glorious, wondrous station.

Thou seest how I have been imprisoned in this city wherein none dwelleth save its inhabitants, and which is the most hideous and ruined of all the cities of the world. The heedless ones have prevented us from leaving it and have shut all doors before our faces. By Thy glory! I am not dismayed by this, for I have accepted all tribulations in Thy love and have chosen all ordeals in Thy path. But what perplexes me is certain of Thy decrees and ordinances - how Thou hast unsealed the musk-vessel among those who know not its fragrance but rather flee from it. I bear witness, O my God, that in every one of Thy deeds there is wisdom upon wisdom, and mystery upon mystery, which Thou revealest in its time and manifesteth in its season. I beseech Thee by Thy Self not to withhold from those who love Thee this musk whose sweet scents have been wafted abroad. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, to send down upon them that which will gladden their hearts and give peace to their beings. Thou knowest that the fire of separation cannot be quenched save by the waters of Thy reunion and presence, and their agitation cannot be stilled except by beholding Thy beauty.

By God, the Preserved Tablet and the Hidden Book have appeared, and He doth speak in the Most Great Prison: “There is none other God but Me, the Forgiving, the Generous.” The hosts of earth did not prevent Him, nor the might of those who were heedless of God’s Cause, the Lord of the worlds. He summoneth all to the supreme horizon and the uttermost abode. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Wise. The conditions of the world do not frustrate Him, nor the gathering of nations. By His sovereignty He doeth what He willeth. He, verily, is the Self-Sufficient, the Bountiful, the Mighty, the Powerful. When thou attainest unto the Tablet of God, give thanks to Him and say: “Praise be to Thee, O Lord of the mystics!”</p>

Beware lest anything withhold you from God, the Creator of all possibilities.

<p>Say: O Lord of destiny and Sovereign of humanity! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Scene - the station wherein every hidden matter was revealed more swiftly than the twinkling of an eye - to make me one of those who have attained unto the Kawthar of Thy utterance and have drunk the choice wine of steadfastness from the hands of Thy bounty. O my Lord! Thou art He through Whose Name all things have spoken, and through Whose Manifestation the Cause was revealed in the kingdom of creation. All things have testified to Thy sublimity and power, Thy transcendence and authority. Do with me, O my God, as befitteth Thy generosity and grace. Then write down for me by Thy Most Exalted Pen that which befitteth Thy days, O Lord of the Throne and the dust, Sovereign of the hereafter and of former times. Then assist me in that whereby my remembrance shall endure through the permanence of Thy celestial and earthly dominion. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>

Not every soul hath been or shall be worthy of the Kawthar of inner meanings and receptive to the choice wine of divine love, as is evident when, despite the dawning of the Sun of bounty from the horizon of the world, most remain veiled from it. O people of Baha! By the Lord of Names I swear, a station hath been ordained for you the like of which no one hath understood or shall understand. This station requireth guardians and protectors, and these have been and shall ever be goodly deeds and virtuous character. Say: O friends! Know ye the value of the days of the All-Merciful and act according to that which ye have been commanded in the Book.

Yet thou, without any effort, hast achieved the goal, and without any search hast obtained the object of thy quest. And after all these stations and ranks, thou didst remain so veiled by the veils of self that thine eye beheld not the beauty of the Friend, nor did thy hand touch the hem of the Beloved. Now observe ye how great would be the reward and recompense ordained by God for one who would rend asunder these veils through the power of His Name. Today the people are seen to be blind and deaf, save the soul who, through the breezes of the grace of the Dawn of Manifestation, lifted its head from the couch of heedlessness and turned toward the supreme horizon.

O ye who drink from the wine of inner meanings, be ye aware, for thieves lie in ambush, waiting and watching, and have appeared with utmost cunning and guile, that perchance they may hold back the servants from the supreme horizon and deprive them of the ocean of divine mercy. Blessed is the servant whom the intimations of the people have not withheld from God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.

<p>Here is a tablet revealed by Us for him who desires to drink from the Kawthar of life in the days of the All-Merciful, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of the Lord of the worlds and be of those who are at peace. O ’Ali-Akbar! Blessed is thy father who believed in God when every ignorant one turned away from Him. Beware lest anything prevent thee from the remembrance of God. Hold fast unto that which thou art commanded in the Book and cling to His mighty cord. We have adorned the horizon of the world with the Most Great Name, whereupon all things proclaimed: “He Who is the Lord of Names hath come with a sovereignty that the hosts of evil ones and the might of the oppressors could not withhold.” He alone speaketh at the midmost heart of creation, saying: “O people of creation! Turn ye toward the Countenance with illumined hearts. He hath appeared from the most exalted horizon after the passing away of all things, and He is in truth the One promised in the scriptures of God, the Most High, the All-Glorious.”</p>

This is the year wherein Hasan sacrificed himself in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds, and after him Husayn, who attained the most great martyrdom. By the life of God, all things wept for them both and for those who preceded them, yet the people are in evident joy. They denied the right of God and His chosen ones, having followed every ignorant one who turned away from God, the Exalted, the Great. Whoso ponders what befell the family of the Messenger would weep with the weeping of the bereaved, or like one who has lost his father and mother and son. This speaking, all-seeing Book bears witness to that. Blessed art thou for having drunk the wine of everlasting life from the hand of thy Lord, the Most Glorious, when most of the people turned away from Him - they whom vain desires kept back from the most exalted horizon and who were, in the days of profit, among the losers.</p>

When We commanded the people to wisdom, We concealed from them certain stations lest the fire of yearning wrest from their hands the reins of choice. Verily thy Lord is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. Remember God thy Lord, then thank Him for having sent down unto thee that whereby thy mention shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Merciful. O My loved ones! Rejoice in My Name, then make mention of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Be not grieved by those who have turned away. God shall soon seize them with a mighty wrath from His presence. Verily He destroyed the generations of old and shall exalt your names in truth. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>

Repeatedly have the receptive ones been blessed with the favors of the Supreme Pen. We beseech God not to deprive any from the heavenly feast and eternal bounty, that all may attain to that for which they were brought from nothingness into being. The laws and commandments of God have been and ever shall be the cause of the tranquility and comfort of the peoples of the world.

Blessed is he who hath held fast to the assistance of My Cause, clung to the hem of My loving-kindness, and circled round My commandments and laws.

By God’s life! The seas of inner meanings lie concealed in his words and hidden in the treasuries of his knowledge. Blessed are they who, despite the peoples of the world, turned unto him and drank therefrom. The sealed wine is the divine utterances which none had attained unto until this Revelation, but the Finger of Power in this Most Great Revelation hath unsealed it that all may drink thereof and attain unto it. In these days the Wronged One is afflicted by the fire of hatred and malice of the idolatrous souls, yet tribulations in the path of the Lord of Names are beloved to the soul and are the desire of the hearts of the people of certitude. O My loved ones in Ta! The Supreme Pen is moved at all times to make mention of you, and likewise to make mention of the loved ones in the cities and regions. This is a great bounty - know ye its station. Verily, He is with you, He seeth and heareth. Goodly deeds bring Him joy, and from praiseworthy conduct boundless delight is obtained. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist you in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Lord of the Hereafter and of the former life. He aideth whom He willeth through His grace, and He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Say: […]</p>

I beseech Thee by Thy prevailing Will and Thine all-encompassing Purpose to aid me under all conditions to serve Thy Cause and to achieve that whereby my remembrance may endure in Thy Book. O Lord! Strengthen me through Thy power to serve Thy Cause in such wise that the words issuing from the mouths of Thy servants may not deter me, nor the doubts of Thy creatures and the intimations of the people of Thy realm sadden me. O Lord! I am weak and have turned toward the direction of Thy strength and Thy might. I beseech Thee by the breezes of the morn of Thy Revelation, whereby Thou didst quicken them that lay in their graves through Thy bounty and favor, to make me under all conditions vocal in Thy remembrance and praise, aflame with the fire of Thy Sacred Tree, and active in that which Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book.

Such heedlessness hath seized upon the servants that they have forsaken the imperishable kingdom for the sake of two fleeting days, and are occupied with transgression and wickedness.

When thou hast attained unto the Tablet of thy Lord, read it again and again, that thou mayest inhale the fragrance of the verses of thy Lord and be of them who have detached themselves in His love from all directions. Thus doth My Most Exalted Pen make mention of thee and give thee glad-tidings, whilst thou wert wronged at the hands of such as were heedless of this Cause whereby the horizons have been illumined. Beseech thou God that He may vouchsafe unto thee the Kawthar of steadfastness and draw thee nigh unto Him under all conditions.</p>

<p>Today all things are engaged in the remembrance and praise of God, and are crying out with the most exalted call in these supreme words: By God the Truth! The door of the treasury hath been opened, and the hidden mystery hath been revealed, through a Cause unlike all causes, through a remembrance unlike all remembrances, through a path unlike all paths, and through a thought unlike all thoughts of the servants. Blessed is the soul whose will hath been submerged in the Will of God and whose volition hath been dissolved in His good pleasure. We have heard thy call and witnessed thy turning unto Us. This Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath been sent down as a token of grace that thou mayest inhale the sweet fragrances of the All-Merciful and remain firm and steadfast in His Cause with supreme steadfastness. Glory shining from the horizon of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon those who have held fast to the Strong Cord.</p>

<p>In the Name of the All-Knowing Speaker! This Day hath been mentioned and is known in all the divine Scriptures and Books as the Day of God. Blessed is the soul whom vain desires have not kept back from the Dayspring of the light of oneness, and who hath rent asunder the veils of idle fancies with the arm of certitude. Reflect upon former ages: whenever the Dayspring of Light dawned above the horizon of manifestation and appeared, all arose to oppose and object, except whom God, thy Lord, willed. And now the Manifestation of the Cause, while imprisoned, turneth toward thee and summoneth thee, purely for the sake of the Lord of Names, unto the most exalted horizon. Praise God, then thank Him, for having revealed unto thee that which was hidden from most of mankind. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the Answering.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-Baqir of Zarqan! He is sanctified above mention and description.</p>
<p>Today is a day when the horizon of the world is illumined and bright with the lights of the Sun of Manifestation. Yet the birds of night remain heedless of it, nay, turn away from it, for they were not and are not worthy to behold it or capable of facing it. They are of the essence of darkness, returning to it and intimately associated with it. There has been and will be no remedy for divine wrath. By their own deeds they have become deserving of discord and opposition and darkness and ignorance. Otherwise, the Truth created all through one Word and called all through one Call. Verily He is the Just, the Wise. God willing, may you be confirmed and remain firm and steadfast in the Cause of the Beloved of the worlds. This has been and will ever be among the greatest of deeds. Blessed are the steadfast ones, and woe unto the wavering ones.</p>

None save God, exalted be His glory, is aware of the greatness of this wondrous Day. Whosoever desireth to attain unto the recognition of the Lord of this Day must needs detach himself from all that he hath seen and heard, and must, with an eye sanctified from the film of vain imaginings, observe within the very Essence of Truth, and ponder upon His signs. Then will he find himself upon the straight path. Blessed is he who, for the sake of God, acteth in accordance with that which hath been mentioned.

And grief is forbidden, save for that which hath befallen My own Self at the hands of these idolaters. Be thou at peace through the mercy of thy Lord, which hath preceded all worlds. Were He to will it, He would send down from the clouds of His mercy that which would purify all created things. Verily He hath power over all things. But He hath ordained for every soul its turning unto God. Thus hath it been inscribed by the Pen of Holiness on a preserved tablet.

<p>O Handmaiden of God, Darvish Khuda! In the name of the one peerless God, the All-Seeing! O handmaiden of God! Your prose was heard and the verse you sent also attained the honor of being heard. Blessed are those souls whom today the veils of glory did not prevent from the Beloved Who never perishes. Take hold, with the hand of certitude, of the hem of thy Lord’s mercy, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. How many were the divines and princes who remained deprived of the Water of Life, while thou, praise be to God, didst attain unto it and drink therefrom. It behooveth thee to thank Him with a remembrance that will endure throughout the duration of the Kingdom and the heavenly Dominion. The glory be upon thee and upon those women who have heard and turned with their hearts toward a station round which circle the Concourse on High and the dwellers of this glorious station. He verily recordeth for whomsoever He willeth the reward of attaining His presence. Thy Lord is, verily, the Almighty, the All-Compelling.</p>

<p>O Jamshid! God grant that thou mayest be blessed by God’s manifold bounties and drink deeply from the ocean of the knowledge of the Beloved of all the worlds. Thy letter hath reached the Most Great Prison and come to the attention of this Wronged One. The perfume of thy love was inhaled therefrom. God grant that, under all conditions, thou mayest be engaged in the remembrance of Him Who is the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted. Make thou an effort that there may appear from thee during the days of God that which will perpetuate thy name for as long as the kingdoms of earth and heaven will last. This is what thy Lord, this wronged exile, enjoineth upon thee.</p>
<p>Deliver My greetings to the friends in that land and bid all to rejoice by reason of the illimitable divine bestowals, for the glance of His loving-kindness is and will continue to be directed towards His true friends. May providence itself be a sacrifice for His providence, and may the essence of bounty be a ransom for His bounty. The glory of God rest upon thee and upon those who turn towards God with a sanctified heart.</p>

Praise God that thou hast returned from the north of sorrow to the right hand of joy, and hast transformed the darkness of error into the light of guidance. Thou hast purchased the Joseph of faith with thy very soul, and hast sold the Pharaoh of unbelief for naught. Therefore must thou remain steadfast in faithfulness, that thou mayest drink of the chalice of eternity and taste of the fountain of divine presence. What sorrow remaineth, and what grief persisteth? So long as the rose is in the market, the nightingale is wrapt in the remembrance of the Beloved. The lover hath no sorrow save separation, and the yearning one groweth not dispirited save through remoteness. Praise be to God that the Sun of Beauty is manifest, and the Beloved is beheld without door-keeper or guard, and is visible without veil or covering. And the Spirit be upon thee.</p>

However, when the horizon of the world was illumined with the light of the Manifestation, most forgot the divine command and heavenly counsel, becoming occupied with their own vain imaginings. The countenance of the Sun of Justice remained veiled and concealed behind the clouds of the vain imaginings of the ignorant. In such circumstances, if the movements of the bat should become manifest, it would not be strange.

When the Throne was established, We sent down verses in such wise that the hearts of the mystics were attracted, and We were gladdened there by God’s favor, the Lord of the worlds. Therein We made mention of God in the morning and at noontide until the sun set. Verily thy Lord is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. Blessed art thou for having been mentioned before the Face on this day. Be thou thankful to God for this and be of the thankful ones.</p>

The fire of tyranny hath been kindled in the world and by it have been consumed the hearts of those who have believed in God, the Single, the All-Informed.

Say: Woe unto thee, O heedless and remote one! If thou hast believed in God, why hast thou turned away from Him Who hath come unto thee with that wherewith came the Prophets and Messengers? By God!

All remembrances have been effaced through the remembrance of thy Lord, the Lord of all mankind, and the dwellers of the Mount were struck with awe when the Tree of the All-Merciful spoke forth: “Verily, I am God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Bountiful.” When We manifested the Word from the horizon of Will, among the people were those who turned towards it and those who turned away and denied their Lord, the All-Merciful. When thou hast attained unto the garment of Revelation and found from it the fragrance of thy Lord, arise amidst the concourse of earth and say: The Promised One hath appeared with sovereignty, grandeur and power. Beware lest the affairs of the world withhold you from your Lord, the Most High, the All-Glorious. Cast them behind you and take what hath been given you from the presence of Him Who causeth the morning to break. Thus have We sent down unto thee the verses - verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. O people of Baha! Beware lest ye follow those who follow vain imaginings. Break the idols of those who speak according to their own desires. Blessed is he who is mighty and triumphant.</p>

<p>He is the Speaker in the Kingdom of Sanctity! We behold the mountains humbled and shattered through the fear of God, yet the people rejoice in what they possess and are of the heedless ones. The overwhelming calamity stalks behind them while they play with their idle fancies and remain among the negligent. Death approaches them at all times while they are unaware of it - verily they are among those who perish. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the recognition of God - this is of His bounty toward thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Leave the people and what they possess, and take what thou art commanded in a mighty Book, from whose horizon hath shone forth the Sun of the commandments of thy Lord. By My life! It is indeed the water of life for all who are in the heavens and on earth. Through it God quickeneth whomsoever He willeth of His creation. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>

The fire of the Divine Utterance has been kindled at the heart of contingent being, yet mankind perceives it not. They imagine they see, but I swear by My life they are a blind people. They hear the call of God, yet turn away from it. Say: O people! Fear God and purchase not for yourselves the torment of the fire. Turn ye and ponder on that which We have truthfully revealed, that haply ye may recognize it. He who turns away from God has lost, while he who turns to Him has gained. Soon shall he find his treasure with his Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. We have remembered thee for the sake of God, that thou mayest arise to serve Him and make mention of Him with such remembrance as will cause hearts to soar.

Your letter has arrived on a single page, thus demonstrating your unity, your orientation, and your agreement in the Cause of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. By the life of God! We found it blessed with the name of your Lord, the Possessor of existence, and We beseech God to ordain for you the good of the hereafter and of this world.

This is the sealed Book which God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, hath sent down unto him who hath turned unto the Countenance and believed in God, while every heedless and veiled one turned away. Say: This is the Day of God, did ye but know it, and this is the Book of the All-Merciful, did ye but understand. The earth hath related its tidings and the Tree hath disclosed its mysteries, yet the people perceive not. They have forsaken the God of earth and heaven, and followed their vain desires in that they followed every learned one who turned away from God, the Lord of the seen and unseen. O people of the earth! Abandon that which keepeth you back from God, then turn with radiant faces unto the most exalted Horizon. Thus doth the Lord of Names command you from this glorious station.

The pavilion of bounty hath been raised aloft, and the Lord of Eternity summoneth the peoples unto the Most Exalted Horizon which hath been illumined by the lights of His Most Glorious Name. This, verily, is the manifest station. We have sent down the Command and expounded the verses that perchance men may ponder upon God’s sovereignty and His firm and mighty Cause. Woe betide them for having denied and turned away from God, the Lord of all worlds! Say: Blessed are ye, O people of Baha, in that ye have quaffed the wine of everlasting life from the chalice of the loving-kindness of your Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Rejoice in what ye have been given from God - verily He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the All-Wise Judge.

<p>In the Name of the One Desired One, the Ancient Lord: From the horizon of the world He calls and proclaims: O My party and O My branches! Reflect upon that which has appeared. The vain imaginings of the past closed the door of mercy, grace and knowledge, as was witnessed when limited souls, due to their vain imaginings, were all seen to be deprived of the Dayspring of the Light of Oneness. Now again the people of the Bayan are clinging to those same vain imaginings. Beseech ye God that He may preserve the essences of being from the contingencies of the world and protect them from the evil of the barking ones. Verily He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer. Those vain imaginings appeared on the Day of Resurrection with sword and arrow, and were visited upon the Truth and His companions. God protect us and you from the evil of the barking ones who prevent people from this straight and manifest Path.</p>
<p>O people of God! Strive that perchance the helpless servants may not again become afflicted with the vain imaginings of the Shi’ites. But the people of the Bayan will not permit it - they have again clung to those same vain imaginings. For one thousand two hundred years they called the son of the Imam a liar by their own admission and he became known as Ja’far the Liar, while that helpless one spoke but one word in truth. Now reflect upon the creation and their words and deeds and thoughts and vain imaginings, that perchance ye may strive according to your capacity, for the sake of God, to exalt the Word. Verily He is the All-Knowing Commander and the All-Wise, the Almighty.</p>

Verily the heaven calleth out with this Most Great Name, and the sun crieth aloud saying: “The fragrance of the All-Merciful hath been wafted, and the Promised One hath come with a Cause against which neither the hosts of the heavens nor of the earth can prevail.” The Tree proclaimeth and saith: “O people of the earth! The seal of the choice Wine hath been broken, and the Desired One giveth with snow-white hands. Hasten ye unto Him, and be not of them that have turned away from this manifest, resplendent, mighty and all-encompassing bounty.” All things speak, and behind them the Dawning-Place of Names proclaimeth between earth and heaven: “By God! The Hidden hath appeared and the Treasured One hath been revealed. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of meeting with God, the Mighty, the Wise.” Thus hath the Nightingale warbled and the Divine Lote-Tree spoken, yet most of the people are heedless.</p>

Hearken unto that wherewith the Wronged One makes mention of thee, then give thanks unto thy Lord at eventide and at dawn. He has manifested the Dawning-Place of His signs and caused it to speak forth that which draws all near unto the Most Exalted Horizon. The pebbles and kernels of the earth bear witness to this, and beyond them the Tongue of God, the Lord of lords. We desired the joy of all who are in the kingdom, yet they desired My sorrow. Behold, O ye who are endued with insight! The dwellers of God’s Kingdom, the Lord of all mankind, have lamented by reason of what hath befallen the Wronged One. Soon shall the wrongdoer witness his deeds and say: “Woe unto me for what I neglected in regard to God, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing!” Hold fast unto the Sure Handle and cling to the hem of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Cleaver of the dawn.</p>

The Speaker of Sinai was seated upon the throne of Revelation, yet they heard not His call and comprehended not His utterance. The recompense of the deeds of the peoples of the world hath deprived them of the recognition of the Ancient King.

They have cast away My Sealed Wine and turned away from My Self-Subsisting Name, following every doubting learned one who hath denied the meeting with God and His Manifestation and turned away from Him Who hath spoken and speaketh “Verily there is no God but I, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.” We have witnessed thy being stirred by the breezes of My loving-kindness, and have thus remembered thee in this Clear Book.

In brief, heavenly destiny did not grant enough time for us to gather in an assembly or meet together in a dwelling. From exile to fresh exile were we subjected, and from separation to boundless separation were we caught. In any case, we are thankful - you too must be thankful. And peace be upon you.</p>

<p>When the horizon of Manifestation was illumined and the birds burst into song, trembling seized the dwellers of the earth save those whom God caused to dwell beneath the shadow of His Name, the Self-Subsisting. Say: He spoke a word whereupon the heavens were cleft asunder, the earth was rent, and every stubborn tyrant returned to his abode. Say: When He entered the Most Great Prison, He proclaimed unto the nations with His most exalted call. To this testifieth what hath been sent down from His Supreme Pen in His preserved Tablet. He is the One Who arose to proclaim the Cause in such wise that the hosts of the world could not deter Him, nor could the ranks of men prevent Him from His firm and wise command.

Woe unto him and unto those who followed him among such as disbelieved in the All-Merciful when He came unto them with manifest sovereignty! Say: When We returned from Our exile to Zawra (Baghdad), We found that he had taken possession of the sanctuary of the Point. At this, the eye of My inner being wept and My heart melted. By God’s life! I concealed this with all diligence lest any hateful rejected one should become aware of it. By God! The Pen is powerless to recount what he committed in his vain life, for it is ashamed to mention that which is unworthy of mention this Day. To this testify those who were with him and associated with him, and beyond them the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. Thou dost ponder My forbearance despite My power, and My concealment despite My knowledge, and that which every ignorant oppressor doth utter. We have mentioned unto thee some of what hath befallen Us at the hands of those who know not their right hand from their left, let alone this exalted station. When thou receivest this Tablet, recite it unto thyself, then read it to those who have quaffed the wine of life in the days of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have cast away idle fancies through the Name of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen.</p>

Say: O people of the earth! Gather ye at the table of your Lord, the All-Merciful, which hath descended once again from the heaven of divine decree after its ascension, and hath appeared in the temple of man at the midmost heart of contingent being. O concourse of the worlds! Deprive not yourselves of that which hath been ordained for you by God, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. Say: O people! Purify your hearts from rancor and hatred, and sanctify your souls from transgression and iniquity, then adorn your bodies with the robe of faithfulness and your tongues with truthfulness in the land of creation.

Deprive not yourselves of the sanctuary of His knowledge, and differ not concerning Him, that ye may be numbered among the monotheists. Blessed art thou for having drunk the Kawthar of life from the hand of the favors of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. We beseech God to make thee steadfast in His love and established in His Cause, for verily He is powerful over all things. Say: Through Him hath God given life to the world and created the world for His own Self, yet the people of the world have wronged Him and knew Him not, and were of the heedless ones. And if thou desirest to become acquainted with My Cause and what hath befallen My person, know thou that the tribulations have reached such a degree as to transcend all mention and utterance, and none knoweth the afflictions of the Youth save His Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. And We thank God for what He hath decreed for Us by His command, and We shall be patient even as We were patient before, and We seek help from no one, and help cometh only from thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.

<p>O Muhammad! God willing, thou shalt abide beneath the shade of the divine Lote-Tree and be nourished by its fruits. Thy name hath been mentioned before the Throne, and divine favor hath been directed towards thee from the prison. Blessed art thou, and blessed are thy father and mother. Ye are among those who have believed in God and turned away from every idolatrous infidel. Beseech and implore the True One, exalted be His glory, that He may guide all to such a degree that the winds of contingent being shall not prevent these souls who have turned towards Him from the direction of His oneness. Verily, He hath power over all things. In the acquisition of perfection, negligence is not permissible. Exert thy utmost endeavor. This is what hath been inscribed by thy Lord, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

Hearken with thy soul’s ear to the call of the All-Merciful, and turn to Him with all thy heart and spirit. Whosoever today has drunk of this eternal wine has attained eternal life, and whosoever has been deprived is accounted as among perishable forms in the sight of God. Until the Ancient Beauty appears with the Most Great Name, strive that ye may attain through His grace to the fruit of creation, and that fruit is the knowledge of the Beloved.

<p>Hassan Agha! He is the Most Wondrous, the Most Wonderful! Blessed art thou, O Hassan, for having entered within the fortress of My love, which hath been built up from the tablets of the Cause and is verily the frequented Fane amidst the Concourse of the Manifestation, and the Sacred Sanctuary in the Most Great Paradise, and the Holy House for all who dwell on earth. Say: O people, take refuge therein that God may protect you from the arrows of Satan in these days wherein the veils of fancy have encompassed both the lowly and the noble. Go forth therefrom by My sovereignty, then witness thyself in such wise that thou beholdest all who are in the heavens and on earth as a coin in thy palm, which thou canst turn as thou pleasest. Thus hath the power of thy Lord encompassed all created things, yet the people are in evident heedlessness. O Hassan! Take thou this Tablet with the spirit and fragrance of God, then preserve it within thyself, then enter upon those who believed and then denied, and say: By God the True One! I have come to you from the Dayspring of God’s Cause with this News which hath been recorded in the Mother of Tablets by the Pen of God. Say: By God! This is the Mother of Tablets and what is mentioned therein is what flowed from the divine Finger on that Day, if ye be informed thereof. Then recite unto them what the Spirit hath cast upon this Tablet. Thereupon thou shalt find the dust of hatred upon their faces. Say: O people! Die in your wrath, for the Sun of the Cause hath dawned from the horizon of a brilliant dawn. O people! By what proof did ye believe, and by what evidence did ye deny? Bring it forth if ye have something more wonderful than what We possess, or the like thereof. Therefore fear ye God and be not tyrannous and wretched. O servant! Observe with the glance of the beginning what We have ordained for Our servants and what they have chosen for themselves, that thou mayest discover what every remote idolater’s soul hath perpetrated. We commanded them in the Tablets and counseled them not to be veiled at the time of the dawning by all that hath been created in the horizons, yet they were veiled by a name among the names which We created by Our command and Our sovereignty, and none were aware of this save a few souls. And thereby they turned away from the Ancient Beauty and spoke as spoke the peoples of old when the Cause came from the heaven of an exalted Name. O servant! Recount unto them what the Tongue of Grandeur recounteth unto thee, that perchance they may find a way unto the Lord of Majesty. Say: When the hosts of God’s revelation descended in the guise of verses upon the Temple of Words, the dwellers of Sinai were thunderstruck upon the Sinai of nearness and the mountain of every learned one was crushed. And thereby were the breasts of the fettered ones constrained, such that they arose to war against His Beauty. Thus have We detailed the matter unto thee in detail, that thou mayest know the state of those who claim faith within themselves and consider themselves among the most exalted of servants, though today not one of them is mentioned before thy Lord. And thou, give thanks unto God for having confirmed thee in the Cause and made thee among those whom He hath chosen, and provided thee with ripe and holy fruits from the Tree of Knowledge. Be thou steadfast in thy love such that no fettered and obstinate one may cause thee to slip. Then remind those who are with thee from Us, those who have shattered the idols of desire through the power of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and have embarked upon the Crimson Ark through My Most Glorious Name. By God! They are servants whose presence is longed for by those in the heaven of grandeur and all discerning ones besides them. Witness thyself in such a station that were thou to find no helper for thy Lord on earth, thou wouldst arise by thyself to help thy Lord. Then would thy relation to My Self, which encompasseth the worlds, be confirmed. Say: The musk of the All-Merciful hath been diffused from the trace of the All-Glorious, and God hath made it a proof from Him unto all who are in the heavens and earth, and no peer hath been ordained for it in the kingdom. Verily those whom the cold of heedlessness and desire hath seized will never find from this Garment the fragrances of a beloved glory. Blessed is he who hath inhaled the divine fragrances from the trace of his Lord and was steadfast on the path. Then remind from Us the handmaidens of God who have believed in God and His signs and were among the devoutly obedient ones inscribed in the Tablet.</p>

He hath sent down verses from the heaven of holiness in wondrous remembrance, and with Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth. He knoweth what passeth through the hearts of His servants, and verily He hath knowledge of all things.</p>
<p>O Nabil-i-’Ali! Hearken unto that which We reveal unto thee from the direction of the Throne, the station which God hath raised above the comprehension of the worlds, that He may make thee strong in this Cause wherein every mighty one hath been brought low, and may purify thee from all things and from whatsoever the people utter, and may cause the springs of wisdom and utterance to flow from thy tongue, that all creation may be enriched thereby.</p>
<p>Arise to serve God, then detach thyself wholly from all who are in the heavens and on earth, that the drops of grace may take hold of thee from this cloud which hath been raised in the heaven of holiness. Be thou of such countenance that the faces of the heavens and earth may be illumined thereby. Thus doth command thee the tongue of holy love. Be thou of such manner that should the idolaters behold thee, their foundations would be shaken, and should the monotheists see thee, their hearts would surge with the surging of love from this Fire which hath been kindled in the blessed Mount Sinai.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Know thou the worth of these days, the like of which God hath not created in all creation, wherein the dwellers of the heavens and earth were stirred up, and the pillars of a mighty throne were made to quake. In them the wealthy became poor, the strong became weak, and every renowned scholar became ignorant. Purify thou the hem of thy sanctity from all created things, then ascend by the wings of holiness unto this heaven, that thou mayest witness all beings in the shadow of thy Lord as aged clay.</p>
<p>Stand thou firm in the Cause and turn not unto anyone, though all things rise against thee. Thus did We command thee before, and thus do We command thee now, that thou mayest stand firm in the Cause of thy Lord. Say: O people! Do ye deny Him through Whom God’s Cause was exalted, His beauty appeared, His proof dawned, and His evidence was perfected unto all creation assembled? Thus do We make mention of thee in this Tablet in these days wherein the Youth hath desired to veil His face from eyes, by reason of that which the hands of every sinful hypocrite have wrought.</p>
<p>Say: O people! By God, were ye to cut off your ears it would be better for you than to hearken thereby to the words of any rejected idolater, and were ye to sever your heads with your own hands it would be more excellent in God’s sight than to associate thereby with any hateful hypocrite. And thou, O Muhammad, cast behind thee all remembrances, then hold fast to the remembrance of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, Who hath appeared with a glorious and radiant beauty. Then give thanks unto God for having made thee a servant to His Most Exalted Self in the kingdom of earth and heaven. By God, this is a bounty which no other bounty in the dominion of creation and the kingdom of eternity can equal, and to this doth testify the Tongue of Grandeur from behind the pavilion of intimate nearness.</p>
<p>We beseech God to recompense thee with the most excellent recompense, to grant thee the best of the hereafter and of the former days, and not to withhold thee from the splendors of the light of His Face for less than what can be counted. Verily, He is wise in all things.</p>
<p>He is.</p>
<p>These are days the like of which no eye in all creation hath ever seen, and no soul among all created things hath ever perceived. At all times must ye take refuge in God, that perchance ye may remain safe beneath the protection of the Lord of the Day of Judgment from the schemes of the schemers and the deceits of the deceivers. For the craft of the plotters hath reached such heights that were all the pens in the universe to attempt to enumerate them, they would surely prove powerless and fall short. And if for a moment they should tire of their deceptions while awake, or find themselves unable to pursue them, they reach into the realm of sleep and make mention of dreams, that perchance they might cause some innocent soul to stray from the straight path. They remain heedless that the Hand of Divine training and the Grasp of the Power of the Eternal doth raise up such servants as will never take their eyes from the Beauty of the Friend, though the arrows of tribulation should rain down from the clouds of destiny, and should regard the world and all that is therein as utter nothingness, as though it had never been mentioned.</p>

We send greetings to the friends of God and counsel all to fear God and to that which conduceth to the exaltation of His Word. Glory be upon thee and upon the sincere servants of God.</p>

<p>God, exalted and glorified be He, doth mention His servants and handmaidens, by day and by night, through the Supreme Pen. Blessed are they who have turned towards the horizon of God’s Cause and in whose hearts are reflected the effulgences of the light of the divine countenance. The hearts of the servants are mirrors of God - they must at all times be cleansed and sanctified with the burnishing of His knowledge. And His knowledge is to acknowledge His Manifestation and to confess that which hath proceeded from Him. I counsel all servants and handmaidens to guard themselves against false pretenders, for We have previously announced that the cawing of the crows shall be raised. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>In the Name of the One Friend! The sweetness of divine utterance is of such magnitude that were all who dwell on earth to attain unto its hearing, they would all turn to the most exalted horizon and would shun the world and whatsoever is therein. The Wronged One of all lands hath turned toward thee from this mighty prison, and with utmost kindness and compassion declareth: That which is today greater than all else in God’s Book hath been and shall ever be steadfastness in His Cause. Take thou the chalice in My Name, then drink therefrom through My wondrous remembrance. Thou must strive with utmost endeavor to be ever mindful at all times and to remind the people of this most exalted station. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who have drunk thereof in My Name, the Steadfast, the Straight.</p>

<p>O honoured Afshar, upon whom be the glory of God! 24 Rajab 1301</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be unto the King of the realm of earth and heaven, Who hath, through His Most Exalted Word, adorned the realities of existence with the ornament of recognition and illumined all hearts with the light of true knowledge. Today, praise be to God, the Sun of true unity hath dawned from the horizon of divine Will, yet the deluded ones shall not attain unto this station nor achieve success therein. Beseech ye God that He may, purely for His sake, strengthen all faces and hearts in such wise that the affairs of this world and its ornaments and colors may not prevent them from the Most Exalted Horizon, and may establish them firmly in His manifest Faith. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thy noble letter, which was as a vessel bearing the fragrance of love, when its seal was broken, diffused its sweet perfume throughout all existence. Praise be to God Who granted confirmation and, through countless means, bestowed the grace of recognition, acceptance and attention. His bounty brought existence into being and guided it to the path of His justice. After perusing and reading it with joy and delight, it was taken to the Most Exalted Court and Supreme Height, and presented before the countenance of the Lord of Names, after which permission was granted. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke after hearing it. His word, exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof, and there is no God but Him:</p>
<p>In My Name, through which the ocean of God’s knowledge, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling, hath surged!</p>
<p>O thou who gazeth upon the Face and speaketh among the servants! Say: O peoples of the earth! By the True God, the Call hath been raised from the prison of Akka - a Call in whose yearning to hear it countless souls have perished. My Tongue in this glorious and wondrous station beareth witness to this. This is the Day wherein the ocean of God’s utterance, the Lord of all worlds, hath surged. Blessed is he who hath turned towards it and been moved by His Most Great, His Most Bountiful Name. Say: O people! Deprive not yourselves of this bounty wherewith God hath adorned the brocade of His Books, His Scrolls, and His holy and luminous Tablet. Cast away what ye possess, turning unto the Most Exalted Horizon, and shatter the idols of vain imaginings with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. This is better for you than all ye possess. Thus hath the Tongue spoken in the kingdom of utterance. Blessed are they that hear! O thou who soarest in My atmosphere! With complete determination, guide the heedless ones to the horizon of divine knowledge. Blessed is the breast that, having been sanctified from the tales and traces of the past, hath turned unto the Mother Book. Today the Euphrates of wisdom and utterance floweth from the right hand of the throne of the All-Merciful, and from the treasury of the Most Exalted Pen appear and shine forth the pearls of knowledge and the gems of understanding. Say: O people! Be fair! Defile not existence with unseemly false statements and fabricated stories. By the Sun of knowledge that shineth resplendent from the most exalted horizon of utterance, from the beginning of the world until now no Revelation like unto this hath appeared. He is the Interlocutor of Sinai Who sitteth upon the throne of Revelation. He is the Great News mentioned in the former Books, Whose advent the Prophets and Messengers foretold unto all peoples. Take ye, O people, the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him, and be not of the heedless ones. God hath ordained for them that turn unto Him, the Lord of all worlds, that which no tongue or pen can recount or enumerate. Fear ye God, then turn with radiant faces unto this Cause by the command of this Wise Ordainer.</p>
<p>O Mim! Upon thee be My Baha and My loving-kindness! Aid thou the Cause of God through the hosts of wisdom and utterance, and through that which draweth the people nigh unto His glorious and wondrous horizon. He, verily, will be with thee and will strengthen thee through His sovereignty and will reinforce thee through His hosts. He, verily, is potent over all things. Blessed is thy pen for having caused to flow from it that which hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance, a mercy from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>The affairs of the Shi’ih sect are well known to thee. In truth, that which thou hast mentioned is the cause of the people’s acceptance and guidance, were ye to be fair-minded. This Wronged One hath, through divine power and might, openly proclaimed before the faces of both high and low, without any veil or concealment, whatsoever would lead to the guidance, salvation and tranquility of mankind. The hindrance of the hinderers and the tyranny of the oppressors did not prevent Him from revealing mysteries. In all conditions We have spoken forth counsels and admonitions, and when the light of the Sun of Proof shed its radiance from the horizons of hearts, all arose to extinguish that manifest and gleaming Light, save whom God wished.</p>
<p>Although We have, in the Books, Tablets, Scriptures and Epistles, forbidden conflict, corruption and strife, and have commanded that which leadeth to salvation, nearness unto God, goodly deeds and praiseworthy character, yet glory be to God! Though the Sun of Truth is shining, the ocean of knowledge and wisdom is surging, the rivers of bounty are flowing, and the Sacred and Blessed Tree is speaking, all are found to be veiled save a few, and few of My servants are truly thankful.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear ye God and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who hath come unto you with a clear authority. In the great city, a few have arisen in opposition and are occupied in destroying the Most Exalted Word. One who hath dwelt for more than forty years beneath the pavilions of grandeur, in comfort and at rest, hath today united with a few others and is manifesting boundless oppression. Each day they have committed that which hath caused grief to those who are nigh unto God and are sanctified. They have seized upon the calumnies of armies and the lies of multitudes, and are engaged in warfare. Thus hath God revealed what was hidden in their breasts and the treachery of their eyes.</p>
<p>His Honour Afnan, A. and H., upon whom rest My Baha and loving-kindness, turned towards this direction. Subsequently, through telegraph they informed that Siyyid Ahmad and his companions had stolen a sum of cash as well as paper currency and had gone to Akka. And regarding His Honour the Great Afnan, upon whom be the Most Glorious Baha of God, who in this land had and hath no thought save seclusion, they have written that which they themselves testify is false. These matters have come to light so that all might recognize Yahya and become aware of what this Wronged One hath endured. The mysteries of the Surih of Luqman have in these days become manifest and visible. However, these matters and their like are absolute nothingness. Their mention is due to consummate wisdom, that the loved ones might discover and recognize.</p>
<p>Say: O people! By God, the Tree speaketh, the Fire uttereth, and the Light mentioneth and calleth out: “The Beloved of all in the heavens and earth hath come!” Thereupon the call was raised from every direction: “Blessed art thou, O Akka, in that God hath made thee the dawning-place of His revelation and the dayspring of His inspiration, and hath honored thee with His presence. Happy art thou, O Akka, in that the Call hath been raised within thee and there hath appeared that which was hidden and treasured in knowledge and concealed from eyes of those who are related.”</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to each one from this Wronged One and give them glad tidings of the verses revealed from the heaven of oneness, that all may behold themselves freed and detached from that which the people possess and turn unto that which is with God. The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of bounty be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and love thee and hearken to thy words concerning this Cause which God hath made sanctified from all likeness and similitude, and hath caused it to dawn and shine forth from the horizon of grace unto all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>A hundred thousand thanks unto the Purpose of all the worlds Who, through the breezes of His verses, hath made hearts and minds receptive and bestowed fellowship. Glory be unto Him, glory be unto Him! His is the greatness and the power, the might and the choice. He is the Potent One Who illumined the breasts of the sincere ones with the light of His favor and set hearts ablaze with the fire of His love. This fire hath diverse effects - it sendeth some to the field of sacrifice and establisheth others upon the throne of detachment. In the nights and days the Tongue of Grandeur uttereth that which uniteth hearts. How many nights did the Eye of Grandeur, out of love for His loved ones, remain sleepless and slumberless. Verses are sent down like copious rain. Glory be to God! The unfair ones in the world remain heedless and veiled unto this day. They distinguish not between the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree and the fire of self and passion. Their nature is to turn away and their practice is to close their eyes. In truth, perplexity upon perplexity! The people of the Furqan cling to the Book of God - all have seen and read it. The companions of the Spirit - peace and glory be upon Him - cling to the Gospel, and all have seen that the entire utterance of that All-Knowing Expounder doth not exceed a portion. And now, at every moment, there is being revealed that which all the pens of the world are powerless to record and all the tongues of the nations are unable to recount.</p>
<p>Now, with utmost humility, I submit: O my God, my Beloved, my Generous One, my Merciful One! Thou didst create Thy servants and bring them from nothingness into being for Thy recognition. Deprive them not now. Thou art that Maker Whose craftsmanship throughout the world and Whose evident means among the nations all testify to Thy power and acknowledge Thy grace and bounty. Were Thou to withhold these from them, who would acknowledge Thy power and confess Thy sovereignty? O my Lord! Every person void of understanding beareth witness to Thy power, sovereignty and greatness. Deliver Thy loved ones, by Thy generous hands, from the clay of idle fancies and preserve them through the hosts of Thy revelation and inspiration. Thou art the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The expressions of gratitude, sincerity, evanescence and nothingness which thou didst manifest before the appearance of Him Who conversed upon Sinai - may the spirit of all who are in the kingdom of command and creation be a sacrifice unto His remembrance - verily from these the fragrance of detachment, purity, submissiveness, humility and faithfulness wafteth. And after the presentation of this matter in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, these words shone forth from the tongue of the Beloved of the worlds - exalted be His utterance and His proof:</p>
<p>In My Name, the One Who appeareth before all faces […]</p>
<p>O thou who soarest in My atmosphere, who gazest toward My horizon, who turneth unto the lights of My countenance, who speaketh in My praise, and who holdeth fast unto the cord of My bounty! Hear thou My call on this Day which hath been named the Day of God in the Books and Tablets. Say: O people! Hear ye, hear ye! The call hath been raised from the direction of Akka, and the ocean of utterance hath surged before the faces of all religions, and the Sun of proof hath shone forth with a light at whose appearance all other lights have bowed down. O people! Fear ye God, then judge with fairness concerning that which hath appeared in truth. Verily it draweth you to the most exalted station. O people! Deny not the proof of God and His evidence. Turn with your hearts unto God, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>We have heard that wherewith thou hast called upon God, and We found from it the fragrance of thy love, thy turning and thy devotion to the Mighty, the Bestower. Glory be to God! The people of the Furqan, despite what hath appeared from the Tongue of Grandeur - that He is verily the Messenger of God and the Seal of the Prophets - assert that the breezes of revelation and the fragrances of inspiration have been cut off after His Holiness, and this blessed word concludeth with His exalted saying: “The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.” By the testimony of the Furqan, the Day is the Day of God and the Manifestation is the Manifestation of God. Nevertheless, none hath understood. The source of ignorance, falsehood, conflict and corruption hath said that the Surih of Unity must be translated, for the Babis believe in Lordship and Divinity. Say: O people! Be fair! If the breezes of revelation are cut off, who shall guide the servants and who shall be? If ye hearken to the words of the Truthful Informer, after the Seal cometh the Manifestation of God, and all books bear witness to this.</p>
<p>They have likewise said that the prayer recited at dawn during the blessed month of Ramadan, which is adorned with this Name, must be abandoned - despite their having given glad tidings that the Most Great Name is present and mentioned in this prayer. The signs, manifestations and allusions of this Most Great Revelation have encompassed the whole world, yet the people remain veiled from that which is with God by that which is with them. In brief, they have denied the virtue of this prayer and forbidden its recitation. Such is the condition of the divines, let alone the condition of the ignorant. We testify that they are the ignorant ones, and those beneath them are superior to them.</p>
<p>The Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - hath said: “Verily He speaketh in every condition, ‘I, verily, am God. There is none other God but Me, the Lord of all things. All besides Me are My creation. O My creation! Worship ye Me.’” In the beginning of the Bayan He hath described the One Who shall be made manifest with that which hath been mentioned. Blessed are they who behold and they who attain!</p>
<p>O thou who gazeth upon the Countenance! It is incumbent upon you and upon all to take hold of the reins of the Cause by God’s leave, that perchance this people may not be afflicted with the vain imaginings of the previous people. This is accounted among the most excellent of deeds before the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! The ears of the world were created to hear this Call. This Call is a radiant light that awakens the friends and shows the way, and is a blazing fire. One manifestation of it struck the Tree of Sinai, raising the cry “Verily, I am God,” and struck the Spirit, whereupon it departed from the realm of body and flesh, seeking the eternal station, and the fourth heaven became the seat of ascendancy. O Ahmad! They knew not the Day of God and are deprived of the Sun of Truth. But what says the Shi’ih party? If their deeds matched their words, where is the fruit thereof? And if the Tree of Branches was planted, where are its leaves and boughs? They recite “the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord” yet are deprived of it. Read what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “Though it be of the weight of a grain of mustard seed and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth. Verily, God is subtle and informed.” O Ahmad! The Pharaoh of the age hath emerged from behind the clouds with the sword of hatred. Surely thou hast heard the details. The Wronged One of the horizons counseleth all to protect the servants, that perchance the veils of idle fancies may not again intervene and prevent the people from the manifestations of the Luminary of the Revelation. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Say: O people, fear God! That which was never manifest in creation hath appeared, and that which was inscribed by the Supreme Pen hath come. Cast aside what the people possess, turning unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We beseech God to assist thee and enable thee to do what He loveth and pleaseth. Verily, He is the Protector of the doers of good.</p>
<p>Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having caused my name to flow from Thy Pen. I testify that Thou hast appeared and manifested what was hidden in knowledge and concealed in the treasury of Thy protection. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful. I beseech Thee, O Desire of the world and Quickener of nations, by the Light which the veils of the peoples could not withhold, to assist me to arise to serve Thee and to aid Thy Cause with wisdom and utterance. Thou art, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>This servant also conveyeth to them greetings, praise, remembrance and glory, hoping that they may rend asunder the veils of the people with the finger of steadfastness, that they might attain to that for which they were adorned with the ornament of existence. The Command is in God’s hands, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne.</p>
<p>As to the matter of printing, praise be to God, it hath been accepted. The Most Great Branch of God - may my spirit and being be offered up for the dust of His footsteps - hath, according to the command, considered it. In truth, the ignorance and waywardness of the former people is evident from what hath been mentioned. Blessed is he who hath been just in what hath appeared, and blessed are they who have attained. Glory and praise and remembrance be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you and hear your words concerning the proof of God’s Manifestation, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>In this hour the servant attained the presence. The Ancient Beauty turned to him and said: We wish to make mention of the son of him who loved Us, who turned to God, attained, arrived, received and drank the Kawthar of utterance from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Lord of all beings. We have made mention of him before and at this moment, and We testify that he is among those who have attained. O Muhammad, upon thee be the glory of God! Convey My greetings to him and give him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness. He hath attained to the standing which was foretold in the Qur’an: “The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the Worlds.”</p>
<p>This servant also conveyeth greetings and glory unto him, and beseecheth from the Dawning-Place of the Most Great Bounty His favors for him. Verily our Lord is the Hearer, the Answerer, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. That which he sent hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance, as a grace from our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of this flourishing Prison. The glory and the remembrance and the praise be upon thee once again, and upon him, and upon every patient and grateful one.</p>

Rather, look upon the servants of the All-Merciful throughout creation and turn unto that which benefiteth the peoples of all the worlds.

But you are the chicory of the paradise of sanctification and the leaf of the Divine Lote-Tree - from you every taste perceives a flavor. You are the divine sugar of Egypt, yet in the taste of lovers, while being colocynth in the mouths of polytheists. For the people of divine unity you are the fruit of detachment, and for the people of limitation you are the effect of the severe day.

Every day We have called them unto God, and every night We have revealed unto them that which hath caused the hearts of the mystics to soar. We behold those who follow vain imaginings and those who have drawn nigh unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. Each faction rejoiceth in that which it possesseth, yet God is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing, the Ordainer, the All-Wise. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

We beseech Thee by the Mystery that lay hidden within Thy knowledge, and by the Pearl that remained concealed within the shell of Thy decree and destiny, to ordain for those who have heard Thy call and responded to that which Thou hast prescribed for the sincere ones among Thy creatures–those whom neither the might of the world could dismay nor the power of the nations enfeeble, who hastened with their hearts to the horizon of Thy Revelation and attained unto that which the Tongue of Thy grandeur had uttered on the Mount–that which Thou hast ordained for them. Thou art He to Whose generosity the entire creation hath testified, and to Whose munificence both the seen and the unseen have borne witness.

Thereupon were raised the banners of oppression until the idolaters drove us out from the Land of Mystery and imprisoned us in the Most Great Prison.

The manifestation and emergence of this most exalted station hath appeared in this most great Revelation, inasmuch as His grace hath embraced all, and the clouds of His mercy have rained upon all parties.

<p>Thereafter, two letters were received from that honored one and esteemed friend. As to the first, it was deemed inexpedient to present it before His presence, but the second was presented and achieved the honor of being heard. This is what the Lord of the Final End spoke in reply, blessed and exalted be His words:</p>
<p>He is the Hearer, the Answerer!</p>
<p>Hear the call of God, the Mighty, the Loving. Verily the Divine Lote-Tree speaketh and the fruits cry out, and the Herald before His face saith to thee: “Praise be unto Thee for having manifested Thy Beauty and that which lay concealed in Thy knowledge and was recorded in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures, and Thy Tablets. There is no God but Thee, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>
<p>This is the Day wherein the countenance of the world hath been illumined by reason of the advent of the Ancient King with His Most Great Name. Rejoice, O people of the earth, then hearken unto that which the Speaker of Sinai uttereth. Beware lest what the people possess prevent you from His Choice Sealed Wine. Draw nigh with radiant hearts and take the cup of the Choice Wine in His Most Glorious Name, then drink thereof in remembrance of Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.</p>
<p>O Rasul! Thou wert present before the Wronged One, thou didst witness His signs, hear His utterance, and recognize His character. It behooveth thee to make mention of Him among the religions with joy and fragrance. Verily thy Lord is the Commander, the Protector over what was and what shall be. Know of a certainty that nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
<p>We beseech God to assist thee and ordain for thee that which shall make thee steadfast in His Cause and hold fast to His Extended Cord. We have made mention of thee time and again, before and after thy presence, whereunto bearer witness honored servants. Preserve what thou hast been given in thy Lord’s name and say:</p>
<p>“Praise be to Thee, O Lord of existence, for having enabled me to turn toward Thee and attain Thy presence, despite Thy knowledge of my transgressions. I testify that Thou art indeed the All-Kind, the Forgiving.”</p>
<p>Say: “My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy greatest favors, and Thy mighty signs, and the waves of the ocean of Thy forgiveness, and the effulgences of the Orb of Thy pardon, to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. Then assist me, O my God, in that whereby Thy Cause may be exalted. Verily Thou art God, the Single, the One, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>
<p>The End</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The grace and favors of God, glorified be His majesty, have encompassed your circumstances. You have spent some time here and have witnessed with your own eyes the manifestations of God’s favors, exalted be His glory. Before any request was made, He bestowed His grace and extended hospitality. You yourself can testify to the effulgent rays of the Sun of grace and mercy. At the time of departure, that which indicated the absence of means was done. This much I submit: the debt for what was given to that group on that day remains to this day. This servant, both due to the abundance of correspondence, as your honored self knows, and because he was perplexed as to what to write, delayed in sending a reply. In any case, I beseech God, exalted be His glory, and hope that He may open the door of His favor and transform these constraints into abundance. He is the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent. Be not grieved! I swear by the Sun of Truth that rises from the horizon of the prison, there was a time when the Ancient Beauty Himself had no spare garment to wear. He would wash the one He had, dry it, and put it on again. Keep this matter confidential. The purpose is that you should know how circumstances were in the past and not be saddened by the hardships that have befallen you. In the eyes of people, poverty and wealth are causes of elevation and abasement, but in the sight of God, rank and station depend on acceptance, steadfastness and certitude. You have been in the prison and have witnessed the conduct and association of the Truth. There is no need for this evanescent one to elaborate. Praise be to God, the love of God exists in your heart, and the appraisers of the world cannot determine the value of this precious pearl, being utterly incapable of setting its worth and station. Convey my greetings and praise to the friends. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who hold fast to God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. And praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

Whenever I manifest among them the revelations of Thy sovereignty and might, they gather against me with swords of hatred. Whenever I expound to them the mysteries of Thy knowledge and the gems of Thy wisdom, they say “We find not this in the books of our forefathers.” And whenever I seek to illuminate them with the lights of Thy countenance to deliver them from the darkness of their own selves, they flee and conspire to slay me. How long, O my God, wilt Thou forbear them in Thy land? Seize them through Thy power, might, wrath and vengeance. Then send down upon the hearts of Thy loved ones that which will purify them from all else but Thee and cause them to speak Thy praise, that Thy remembrance may be spread through them amongst Thy servants.

Grieve not over anything but place thy trust in God, the Mighty, the Exalted. Verily He will protect thee in truth from those who have disbelieved and joined partners with God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Generous. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon the sincere ones.</p>

Be united in the love of God - this is better for you than all that hath been created in the realm of possibility.</p>

Yet the servants and handmaidens have been prevented from the Lord of Names by the veils of the divines. They martyred the Purpose of the world, and night and day they strive and struggle to extinguish the Light of the One Who conversed on Sinai. Glory be to God! They walk in the path of vain imaginings and move according to the dictates of self and passion. This day is the Lord of days. Blessed is the soul that hath been illumined by the recognition of the Day of God and hath attained unto the signs of the utterance of the Purpose of all worlds.</p>

Hearken thou unto My call from the precincts of My prison, the Spot which God hath made sanctified from mention of station and rank and place and possibility, and from whatsoever floweth from the tongue and is comprehended by the heart. Verily thy Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

The faces have been illumined by the lights of the Countenance, and the horizons by My luminous horizon. Remember thy Lord with joy and fragrance.

Today from the right hand of the Throne the pavilion of the feast is adorned, and from the left the field of battle is visible. The clamor of the heedless has become the cause of a great celebration in the Supreme Concourse - the tribes of angels and the Spirit give each other glad tidings and prepare to welcome, for verily the blessed spirit of Mahdi has intended the Supreme Companion. By the life of God, he took and drank the wine of steadfastness from the hand of his Lord, became intoxicated, intended the meeting, and attained unto it. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to preserve you for the service of His firm and mighty Cause. Verily He is the Answerer of those who call and the Beloved of the hearts of those drawn nigh.</p>

The attributes of all beings, from the most exalted to the lowliest, ultimately refer to those steadfast, firm, upright, content and well-pleasing souls. These are the Hands of God’s Cause amongst creation, and these are the trees in the divine garden, their leaves moved by His will and their fruits manifested through His decree. These are the dawning-places of the power of the Almighty Lord - the changes of the world and vicissitudes of nations did not prevent them from the Most Great Name and the Ancient King. They gaze toward the horizon of the unique Manifestation, desiring sight for witnessing and hearing for listening. Praise be to God, they are illumined by the light of true unity and nourished by the fruits of the blessed Tree, having drunk from the choice wine of “Say: God.” “Leave them to their vain discourse.”</p>
<p>The servant beseeches his Lord to grant them success, confirm them, and aid them with the hosts of the seen and unseen.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Distributor of the sustenance of all beings and Breaker of the might of the contentious! I beseech Thee by the dominion of Thy Most Exalted Pen, its rustling, its influence and its power, and by Thy pervading Will, its force, might and sovereignty, to assist Thy loved ones in manifesting Thy Cause among the people of creation with wisdom and utterance. O Lord! Thou seest them among Thy enemies and what hath befallen them in Thy path. I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Self-Subsisting, and by Thy sealed choice wine, to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will draw them closer to Thee in all conditions, and ordain for them that which will accompany them in all Thy worlds. O Lord! Thou hearest the mention of Thy servant Majid and Thy loved ones who have turned to Thee, desiring the Kawthar of Thy utterance and the choice wine of Thy riches. Ordain for them that which will solace their eyes and gladden their hearts. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful. There is no God but Thee, the Hearing, the Answering. O God! Magnify them and bless them through the perpetuity of Thy dominion and Thy kingdom, and ordain for them through Thy generosity and grace that which befitteth Thy Name, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the letter of that spiritual friend arrived on the seventeenth day of the blessed month of Ramadan. It was as if the letter were a musk-laden fragrance, from each word of which wafted the sweet scent of praise for the Lord of earth and heaven. God is witness and testifier that it was the cause of joy and the source of delight. From the mention of the gathering and the assembled loved ones, the breezes of gladness were wafting, and after its reading it ascended to the Most Exalted Station and the Ultimate Summit before the Divine Presence, attaining the honor of being heard. Then the face of the Lord of the Worlds turned toward me and revealed that which none can reckon save His all-numbering, all-knowing, all-wise Self. His word, exalted be His glory and mighty be His utterance:</p>
<p>In My Name, the One Who dominates all names</p>
<p>O Majid! The servant who was present has arrived with thy letter and read it before Our face. We have answered thee through this perspicuous Tablet. The breezes of revelation stirred thee in the days of thy Lord, caused thee to hear His sweetest call, and brought thee to a station wherein thou didst attain to that which was recorded in the Books of God and was heralded in the Mother Book. Blessed is the servant who hath attained, and woe unto the heedless ones.</p>
<p>O Majid! Thou hast turned to the Most Exalted Station and the Supreme Summit until thou didst attain to a station which was the hope of them that are nigh. Thou hast inhaled the fragrance of the utterance of the All-Merciful, beheld His signs, and been illumined by the lights of His countenance. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>We have perceived from thy words the fragrance of thy steadfastness in the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Give glad tidings to My loved ones of My loving-kindness, remind them of My verses, and illumine them with the light that shineth from this luminous horizon. Blessed is the house wherein the remembrance and praise of God are raised, and blessed is the tongue that uttereth His beauteous praise, and blessed is the heart that turneth with steadfastness toward the Supreme Horizon - a steadfastness which the opposition of the opposers could not prevent, they who disbelieved in Him in Whom they had believed in former ages and pronounced judgment against Him with such tyranny as caused the Books of God to lament and the eyes of them that know to weep.</p>
<p>We, from this station, send Our greetings upon thee and upon My loved ones in My lands who were not frightened by the ranks of the pharaohs of the earth, and who said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the world, for having guided us unto Thy path, caused us to hear Thy call, and revealed unto us that which lay hidden in Thy knowledge.” I bear witness that through Thee the trumpet was sounded and the hidden secret was revealed, through Thee the standard of power was raised amidst the righteous, and all things proclaimed: “The kingdom belongeth unto God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” Glory be upon you and upon those who have taken the choice wine of utterance in the name of their Lord, the All-Merciful, and have quaffed thereof at the bidding of an Ancient Commander.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The fragrance of the Kawthar of utterance hath encompassed all possibilities. The eyes of the chosen ones have been blessed with beholding the lights, and the ears of the righteous have been honored by hearkening to the call of the Chosen One. This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth the True One, exalted be His glory, to assist the loved ones that they may, with wisdom and utterance, guide people to the Straight Path and the Great Announcement. The promotion of the Cause is accounted as the king of deeds before the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. His grace is present and His aid is evident. Whosoever holdeth fast unto that which hath been revealed and sent down from the Divine Pen shall assuredly receive His assistance. However, in all circumstances they must not let go of wisdom, lest the clamor of the opposers and the uproar of the heedless be raised.</p>
<p>As to the mention of the Most Great Festival and the gathering of the loved ones in meetings, their occupation with remembrance and praise, their being set ablaze with the fire of the love of the Lord of Names, and likewise the mention of Karbila’i Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be the glory of God and His loving-kindness, and his request regarding the loved ones of M, R, B, N and another place - these matters were presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and after being blessed with hearing them, these verses were revealed from the Supreme Pen in mention of the loved ones. This is what was revealed for Karbila’i Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be the glory of God. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, Which speaketh in the Most Great Prison before the faces of the world</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down by the All-Merciful to those in the realm of existence, calling them to the Dawning-Place of Lights. O people of the earth! We have manifested Ourselves amongst you to guide you to the horizon from which has shone forth the Sun of Wisdom and Utterance. Blessed is he who has turned towards it, whom the turning away of the people has not deterred; and blessed is the steadfast one whom the tempests of the wicked have not moved; and blessed is the speaker whom the veils of idle fancies have not barred and whom the clouds of glory have not frightened.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali! Verily My Most Exalted Pen in the prison of ’Akka has turned toward thee and makes mention of thee with that which will draw thee nearer to God, the Lord of all men. How many learned ones have been kept back from the All-Knowing, and how many heedless ones have turned and attained to the Dawning-Place of verses! Thy name was present before the Wronged One, Who remembers thee with a remembrance that no other remembrance can equal, that thou mayest arise to serve the Cause and summon the people with wisdom and utterance to the Repository of mysteries. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the traces of My Most Exalted Pen in a station which God has made among the most exalted stations.</p>
<p>When thou hast drunk the Kawthar of utterance from the hand of My bounty and the attraction of the proof has drawn thee to the kingdom of My knowledge, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having caused me to hear the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen and for having made known to me Thy path and Thy balance, and for having strengthened me to turn toward Thy horizon after Thy creatures turned away, and for having given me to drink the Kawthar of Thy love on a day wherein the servants arose to extinguish Thy light. I beseech Thee by the mysteries of Thy knowledge and the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance, and by Thy Command whereby Thou hast subdued the kingdom of earth and heaven, and by the signs of Thy greatness, O Possessor of the hidden and the manifest, to make the tongues of Thy servants keys of Thy bounty wherewith to open the doors of the hearts of Thy creation. Then make me, O Lord of all beings and Lord of the hereafter and the former times, one who speaks Thy praise and who stands firm in the service of Thy Cause in such wise that neither the happenings of the world nor the dissension of the people of discord shall hinder me. Then write down for me, O my God, that which will draw me nearer to Thee in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The Light of Providence has risen from the horizon of grace and the rains of loving-kindness are pouring from the heaven of the bounty of the Lord of existence in such wise that the description of all created things cannot attain unto it and the praise of all beings cannot comprehend it. A hundred thousand thanks to the Goal of all the worlds that the petition of the honored friend, Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, has been accepted, and for each of the souls mentioned therein was revealed that which has had and has no likeness. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Compassionate, the Generous, the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! The Possessor of Power has turned toward thee from the direction of the Most Great Scene and makes mention of thee that thou mayest soar on the wings of detachment in this infinite atmosphere through the Most Generous Name. His mention gives life to hearts and strength to limbs, bestows power and grants might. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Jinab-i-Abu’l-Qasim Aqa, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Qasim! The servant present has mentioned thy name before the Face. This perspicuous, manifest Tablet has been revealed for thee. Ask of God that thou mayest attain unto the fragrance of His verses. By the Sun of Utterance! Whosoever has attained will arise with complete steadfastness to serve the Cause of the Lord of all beings in such wise that neither the might of kings and subjects nor the people of the world shall prevent or keep him back from turning to the Most Exalted Horizon. Blessed are they that attain!</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Jinab-i-Mulla Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God</p>
<p>O Hussein! The Kawthar of life has flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful, yet most people know it not. We have sent down from the heaven of Will the rains of grace and bounty, whereby We have quickened those who lay in the graves of their bodies. Verily, thy Lord is the Mighty, the Powerful. That which was hidden in knowledge and treasured in the hearts of the Messengers hath appeared and been made manifest. When thou drinkest the choice wine of revelation from the utterance of thy Lord, turn with thy heart to the Most Exalted Horizon and say:</p>
<p>My God, my God, my Goal and my Beloved! Thou seest Thy servant turning unto Thee, clinging to the cord of Thy grace, and hoping for that which Thou hast ordained for Thy trusted ones and chosen ones. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the signs of Thy grandeur, and by the Most Exalted Word through which Thou didst create all things, to ordain for me that which will render me detached from all else save Thee and holding fast to the hem of the robe of Thy loving-kindness. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for His Honor Mulla Abdul-Ahad, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>O Abdul-Ahad! Blessed art thou for having turned to My horizon, held fast to the cord of My loving-kindness, and believed in My signs. I beseech God to strengthen thee, to prosper thee, and to ordain for thee the good of the hereafter and of the former life, and that which He hath ordained for those of His servants who are near unto Him and those of His creatures who are sincere. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for His Honor Mirza Abdul-Hussein, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>O Abdul-Hussein! We have heard thy call and have answered thee; We have seen thy mention and have mentioned thee. Dost thou know Who mentioneth thee and Who hath turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison? By the life of God! Wert thou to discover this, thou wouldst forsake the world, arising to serve the Cause of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great. The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon those whom the doubts of the people, nor their insinuations, nor their might, nor their wealth have deterred from God, the Lord of the worlds. We love those who love Us and We desire those who desire Us, but the people have come between Us and Our loved ones. Know ye that they are in manifest loss. We beseech God, exalted be He, to open before thy face the door of His grace and to ordain for thee the reward of attaining His presence. Verily, He is the Powerful over what He willeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for His Honor Mulla Abdul-Ahad, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>O Abdul-Ahad! Remember when thou wert at the gate and didst hear the call of the Wronged One while He was in the hands of the heedless. Thou didst turn to the Most Exalted Horizon until thou didst attain the presence and didst behold what was inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the tablets of thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. We bear witness that thou didst attain the presence, and didst hear and see what was concealed from the eyes of the heedless. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God, my Hope and my Desire! Aid me to remember Thee and to praise Thee and to do that which befitteth Thy Revelation and Thy days. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds and Goal of the nations, by the river of Thy mercy and the signs of Thy grandeur, to make me in all conditions one who uttereth Thy praise, who is steadfast in Thy love, and firm in Thy Cause whereby the feet of the learned have slipped and the hearts of the aggressive have been troubled.</p>
<p>The Glory be upon thee and upon whoever heareth thy word concerning this Most Great Announcement.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for His Honor Mir Muhyi’d-Din, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>O Muhyi’d-Din! We beseech God to make thee the manifestation of thy name, and through thee to guide His servants to His straight path and draw them nigh unto Him. Upon beholding thy name, We have revealed unto thee that which cannot be equaled by all that the people possess, to which every discerning soul doth testify. This is a Day wherein the Herald calleth out amongst the servants and summoneth them, without veil or covering, unto the All-Informed. We were standing before all faces, and when the light of the Cause shone forth, there emerged from behind the veil a band of wolves who sought to shed My blood without any proof from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: O people! Fear ye God and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who hath come unto you with a manifest Command. But for Him, who would guide the servants? Be fair and be not among the oppressors. Blessed is he whose vision the veils of idle fancies have not obscured, and the learned one whom the doubts of the suspicious have not caused to slip.</p>
<p>Thou didst desire My tablet which We sent unto thee, from whose horizon hath shone the light of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Forgiving, the Merciful. This is a Day which God’s Books have heralded aforetime, yet the people are in a strange slumber. When thou attainest unto the waves of the ocean of My utterance, say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me and turned me toward Thy countenance. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne and by the station that hath attained unto Thy presence, wherein Thy most sweet call was raised and the tracing of Thy Most Exalted Pen was heard, to make me attracted unto Thy verses and holding fast unto Thy favors. O Lord! Ordain for me and my son that which befitteth the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy bestowal. Thou art verily the One Who hath power over what He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.”</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for His Honor Karbila’i Samad, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Samad! Upon thee be My glory! Thou hast turned, hearkened, and attained unto that which cannot be described by mentions and words. Verily God created His servants for His recognition, yet when He manifested the Dawning-Place of His signs, the Dayspring of His lights, the Source of His laws, the Treasury of His mysteries, and the Recipient of His knowledge, they turned away from Him until they disbelieved in Him and in His signs. Thus did their souls entice them, and they are today numbered among the transgressors in the Book of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Blessed art thou for having cast away idle fancies, turning unto the Luminary of thy Lord’s proof, the Kind, the Generous. Say: O people of the Bayan! Be fair in the Cause of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Do ye deny the waves while beholding them? Come ye, come ye, that I may show you what was hidden from eternity of eternities. Fear ye God and be not among the deniers. Verily the pebble crieth out and the kernel speaketh, yet ye are among the heedless. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Remembering, the All-Knowing. He hath called thee and guided thee unto His bright horizon. Say:</p>
<p>“Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the world and Desire of the nations, for having guided me and honored me with attaining Thy presence. Thou art verily the Strong, the Triumphant, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for His Honor Haji Mahmud, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Mahmud! The Wronged One remembereth thee and counseleth thee with that which hath been revealed in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. Hearken unto the call from the precincts of eternity, which hath been mentioned in God’s Book as the Most Great Prison. Verily there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We counsel thee to manifest supreme steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of the nations have slipped. Beware lest anything among all things veil thee in this Day wherein hath been revealed that which cannot be equaled by all that the people possess, as doth testify this Most Great News through whose mention all things were attracted and by whose call God quickened the moldering bones. Glory be upon thee and upon thy son who hath been named Muhammad, and upon those who have believed in God, both in private and in public.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Karbala’i Pasha, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O party of God! The Truth has loved and continues to love His chosen ones. Each has been blessed with the traces of the Supreme Pen, and the Ancient Beauty has manifested Himself for their presence and meeting. However, the oppression of the oppressors, the obstinacy of the transgressors, and the clamor of the ignorant have become barriers and prevented the seekers from reaching the supreme goal and the highest summit. Beseech God to ordain for you the reward of those who have attained. He is the Hearer, He is the Answerer.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Karbala’i Muhsin, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Muhsin! Reflect upon the benevolence of God, exalted be His glory. He showed the way and guided until you attained the Most Great Ornament and the Great Announcement. Preserve this supreme station through the name of the Creator of Heaven. He is the Preserver, He is the Helper, He is the Succourer.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Aqa Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Muhammad! The Countenance of the Ancient One has turned toward you and makes mention of you, and counsels the party of God regarding the education of children. If a father neglects this mighty command which has been revealed from the Pen of the Lord of Eternity in the Most Holy Book, the right of fatherhood will be forfeited and he will be accounted among the negligent before God. Blessed is the one who inscribes the divine counsels in his heart and holds fast unto them. Verily He commands His servants that which strengthens them, benefits them, and draws them near unto Him. He is the Ancient Commander.</p>
<p>O beloved of God! The Supreme Pen has been occupied day and night in counseling the friends of God, that all may attain the lights of true unity and be freed and delivered from the superstitions of the past. For thirteen hundred years they cried “O Truth!”, yet in the end they pronounced the death sentence upon His most pure blood. All must seek protection from God, exalted be His glory, lest they arise in oppression like the abominable Shi’ih sect. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Glory be to God! Those superstitions have not ended; other delusions have appeared from the direction of the people of the Bayan. God protect us and you from the evil of these people.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Karbila’i Muhammad Ja’far, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>O Muhammad Ja’far! You seek the presence of God, and the Truth is the Bestower, the Bountiful, the Kind. But the oppressors have abandoned justice and prevented the friends from attaining His presence. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! You see me advancing toward You and turning to the lights of Your countenance, that I may enter the city honored by Your footsteps and wherein Your call was raised, and that I may stand before the gate which was opened to all on earth and in heaven, and drink from Your hands of bounty the Kawthar of meeting, and from Your generosity and grace the cup of reunion. My God, my God! You see my state and hear the sighing of my heart in separation and remoteness from You. If the veils of Your servants and the clouds of Your creatures prevent me from drawing nigh unto You, ordain for me from Your Supreme Pen the reward of those who attained Your presence, who drank the choice wine of revelation from the hand of Your bounty, who testified to that which Your tongue has spoken, who beheld Your most glorious horizon, and who heard Your sweetest call. Verily You are the One Who has power over what He desires. There is no God but You, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>We make mention of your son who has believed in God and His signs, and We give him the glad-tidings of his Lord’s grace, the Kind, the Trustworthy. And We make mention of your other son and counsel him with that which We have counseled Our servants in various tablets. And I am the Counselor, the All-Knowing. The glory be upon you from God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Nasru’llah Khan, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>O Nasru’llah! Victory has come, yet most people know not. The banner of unity has been raised, yet people understand not. The Promised One has come with the standards of triumph, yet most of mankind perceive not. Your name was mentioned before the Wronged One, and He has revealed for you that which all the riches of the world cannot equal. Your Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, bears witness to this. When you attain unto My verses and find the fragrance of My utterance, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be to You for having made known to me Your path, revealed to me Your proof, and taught me what was hidden in Your knowledge and treasured within the shells of Your wisdom. I beseech You, O Quickener of moldering bones, by Your Most Great Announcement, to make me steadfast in Your path, speaking in Your remembrance, and holding fast to the cord of Your grace. O Lord! You see me hoping for what You have ordained for Your loved ones. I beseech You not to disappoint me through Your generosity and bounty. Verily You are the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Aqa Mir Hashim, upon him be the glory of God</p>
<p>O Hashim! Hear thou the call of the Wronged One. He maketh mention of thee through His verses and giveth thee glad tidings of His mercy that hath preceded all creation. We have arisen before all faces in such wise that neither the veils of the Pharaohs nor the might of tyrants deterred Us. We called all to God, the Lord of the seen and unseen. When the horizons were illumined, there emerged from behind the veil a band of hypocrites who committed that which none before them had committed. They violated the Covenant and denied Him in Whom they had believed throughout ages and centuries. Thus have We recounted what befell Us from those who denied the right of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. We beseech God, thy Lord, to assist His servants to hold fast to His extended cord.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Jenab Aqa Mir Sayfu’d-Din, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>O Sayfu’d-Din! The promise hath come to pass and God hath come with manifest sovereignty. They that denied God’s Manifestation and His proof have lost, having followed their desires. Verily they are in manifest loss. Say: O peoples of the earth! Husayn hath come, and in His shadow are the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the pavilion of glory, if ye be of those who know. This is He Who was promised in the books of old, yet most people are heedless. Blessed is the strong one whom the might of the people hath not weakened, and the steadfast one whom the doubts of the transgressors have not caused to slip - they who turned away from the Truth when it came from the horizon of power with wondrous adorning. Say: Blessed are ye, O people of Baha, for having believed in Him Who was recorded in the books of old by One All-Knowing, All-Informed.</p>
<p>This was revealed for him who was named after the Desired One:</p>
<p>O thou who art named after My name! Hear My call from the direction of My prison. It draweth thee to the kingdom of My utterance and the heaven of My knowledge. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous. We have sent down to the Persians the verses of My grandeur in the eloquent tongue, and to the Arabs in a wondrous Persian language. Verily He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the Powerful. Blessed is the servant who hath taken My Book with strength from God, the Lord of the worlds. Woe unto him who hath turned away from the Truth and followed every sinful denier. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and acknowledge that which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy will and the kingdom of Thy desire. I beseech Thee by the hearts that have soared in the atmosphere of Thy love and by Thy loved ones who have advanced toward the seat of sacrifice with a devotion the like of which the eye of creation hath not seen - I beseech Thee, O Lord of the world, by Thy Most Great Name, to assist me in Thy remembrance and praise. Then send down upon me from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will draw me nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Verily Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Jenab Mirza Abbas-Ali, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>O Abbas-Ali! The Wronged One calleth thee with that which attracteth thee to the supreme horizon, as a grace from God, the Lord of all mankind, that thou mayest be thankful and be of those who remember. Know thou with certain knowledge that what exists in the world of creation cannot equal one trace of My Most Exalted Pen. To this beareth witness the Lord of the throne and of the earth. Blessed is he who hath heard and witnessed, and woe unto them that turn away. The Mother Book hath come at the final return, yet most people are asleep. The cry hath been raised and that which was hidden in God’s knowledge, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, hath appeared. Let not the happenings of the world and the doubts of the nations sadden thee. Take what hath come to thee with a strength that the power of the heedless ones cannot prevent. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them to thee that thine eyes and the eyes of those who know might be consoled.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Jenab Pasha Aqa, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>O Pasha! Hearken unto the Call of the Lord of all things. From the Most Exalted Horizon of the world He calleth, that all may attain unto that for which they were created from nothingness into being. Blessed is he whom neither the swords of the oppressors nor the tyranny of the aggressors hath debarred from the Lord of the Day of Judgment. We beseech God to aid thee in that which beseemeth His Cause and is worthy of His days.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for his honor Mirza Vahhab, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Vahhab! The All-Bountiful hath come in His return, yet the people are in strange doubt. The Hidden One hath been made manifest and the Self-Subsisting hath come from the horizon of proof with the standards of signs. That which delighteth the eyes of the Most Exalted Paradise hath come, yet the people have denied it and have committed that which hath caused the dwellers of the cities of justice and fairness to lament. When thou hearest the call of the Wronged One and findest the fragrance of My Name, the Self-Subsisting, say:</p>
<p>O Lord of the invisible and the visible! I beseech Thee by the Fire whereby Thou didst guide Moses, and by the Light whereby Thou didst manifest Thy bountiful favor, to make me lowly before Thy Cause and humble before the manifestations of Thy grandeur. O my Lord! Aid me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with, then ordain for me the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily Thou art God, the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for his honor Aqa Mu??afa-Quli, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Mu??afa-Quli! During the nights and days the Pen of the Lord of all beings moveth, making mention of His loved ones and guiding them to the straight path. Blessed is he who hath found the path and held fast unto it. Today the world is illumined by the lights of the Most Great Luminary. Know ye the station of this blessed Day, be ye engaged in the praise of its Lord and in His service. Soon all that is visible shall return to nothingness, and there shall endure for him who hath held fast unto the Most Firm Handle that which hath been ordained by God, the Lord of all beings, the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below. Blessed are they that have turned unto God, and blessed are they that have held fast unto the Sure Handle and have found themselves detached from all that dwell on earth. These are the people of Baha, who are recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Tablet.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for his honor Aqa Mu?sin, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Mu?sin! The Euphrates of mercy floweth, the Kawthar of utterance is manifest, and the Tasnim is present before all faces, yet the servants are heedless and veiled save for a numbered few. We beseech God to aid all and purify them from the smoke of self and desire, that they may turn toward the horizon of godliness and attain unto that which God hath willed. These days have no peer or likeness, for the surging ocean is in motion and the Sun of Truth is shining. Ask thou God to make the heedless servants aware and guide them to the Most Exalted Horizon. He is the Bestower, the Kind.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for his honor Aqa Ahmad, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Ahmad! The banners of verses and standards of clear signs appeared from the Dayspring of the Divine Cause in the land of Batha and Yathrib. The people arose in opposition, called Him a liar, and some attributed it to sorcery, as all the peoples of the world have heard and known of the events that transpired in those lands. Then His community arose in division, different sects appeared, each speaking according to their desires and inflamed with the fire of self, until on the Day of Judgment they martyred the Lord of that Day and pronounced the verdict of His infidelity. Ask ye of God that the people of God may not be afflicted with the vain imaginings of the past, that they may find the Word of Unity and hold fast unto its cord. Glory be upon those who follow the Truth.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Karbala’i Isma’il, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>O Isma’il! Reflect upon the Days of God and that which hath been manifested. How many holy, assured, content and well-pleased souls laid down their crowns of life at the feet of the Beloved of the world and returned not alive from the place of sacrifice. Yet the people, though they have witnessed with their own eyes that which had no likeness, have nevertheless remained unaware and have not awakened from the slumber of heedlessness. They mention from their pulpits the sacrifice of old and lament, while they remain utterly heedless and veiled from those holy souls. Ask thou of God to grant awareness and bestow insight, that perchance they may hear and find and see and come. Thus hath spoken My Most Exalted Pen on this darksome night, as a grace from Me, and I am the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing. We make mention of thy son Asadu’llah in this station, that he may rejoice in the favors of his Lord and be among the thankful.</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, for having enabled me to turn towards Thy horizon and to be drawn to the light of Thy countenance. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by the movement of Thy Most Exalted Pen, through which Thou hast upraised the religions and ordained whatsoever Thou didst desire through Thy sovereignty and might, to make me steadfast, firm and immovable in Thy love, and to enable me to drink what hath flowed from Thy Most Exalted Pen - the Kawthar of Thy knowledge. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Dadash Nayib, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Nayib! The Great News hath come and hath spoken a Word which hath agitated the hearts of all peoples. Throughout all days and nights He hath mentioned and reminded all, that they might become aware and bear witness to the Divine Word. Yet for most, grace became the cause of heedlessness. They accepted not the Cause of God and mocked the Divine Book. The people of the Bayan committed what even the Shi’ih party had not done. Praise thou the Goal of all the worlds Who enabled thee to turn towards Him, to acknowledge and confess. This station is mighty - preserve it through the Most Great Name.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Karbila’i Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Hasan! The names which were presented before the Wronged One - each hath been blessed with the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. We have mentioned all, living and dead, and remembered them with the blessed word of forgiveness. This is a covenant which flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful on the first day of arrival in Ridvan. Blessed are they who have attained! Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Goal of the world, for having remembered me in the prison when I was in the hands of the opposers.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Karbila’i Ali, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Ali! The Fire is ablaze, the Light is radiant, and the Cause is manifest. Blessed is the soul whom neither the affairs of the world nor the doubts of the peoples have prevented from this Most Great Revelation. Neither the smoke of the might of the oppressors nor the dust of the power of the aggressors became a veil or hindered him from turning towards it. At every moment the opposers manifestly objected. All were waiting, yet when the Sun of Revelation shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the Divine Will, all turned away and denied, save whom thy Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful, willed. Praise the Goal of the worlds Who enabled thee to attain and granted thee success. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Sheikh Kazim, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Kazim! God is witness and aware that from the first days until now the Most Exalted Pen hath been in motion and engaged in recording divine verses. Yet the unjust people have denied this manifest proof and have not accepted this perfect evidence. They are occupied with their desires and hold fast to vain imaginings. By the Sun of the horizon of utterance, they are far removed and veiled from the lights of certitude, and they cling to the hem of idle fancies. God shall assail them! Ask thou of God that through His preceding mercy and all-encompassing grace He may guide this handful of dust to His horizon and enable them to attain unto His straight path. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing.</p>

<p>O my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me to Thine all-highest horizon and revealed unto me that which shall not change throughout the duration of the Kingdom and the realm of sovereignty. I beseech Thee, O Lord of all beings and King of earth and heaven, by Thy Most Exalted Word whereby all names were shaken and Thy servants and creatures were thunderstruck, to aid me in accepting that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. O Lord! Thou seest me agitated in Thy days and saddened at the manifestations of the lights of Thy countenance. I desire naught from Thee save nearness unto Thee and meeting Thee. Thou art He Who testified with Thy tongue of truth, saying: On the day when the earth shall be changed into another earth, change Thou my absence into presence before Thy face, my standing at Thy gate, my circling round Thee, and my hearkening unto that which hath been sent down from the heaven of Thy will. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>O Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued all things, both seen and unseen, and by Thy praiseworthy station, to make me of those who have fulfilled their Covenant, who have circled round Thy Most Great Throne, and who have shown humility at the mention of Thy most perfect Name. Aid me in all conditions to draw nigh unto Thee and to be elevated through Thy bounty. O Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and turning away from all else. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance to ordain for me the reward of meeting Thee. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

Blessed is the soul whom the events of the world did not prevent from hearing the divine call, who turned with his heart in acceptance and was blessed with saying “yea.” This is the most great bounty and the supreme benevolence. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto those who hesitate. We send Our greetings upon thee and upon thy wife and upon the handmaidens who have turned unto God and believed in Him, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for his honor Aqa Faraj, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Faraj! Relief came, they rejected it; mercy came, they accepted it not; blessing came, they showed ingratitude; instead of thanksgiving, they complained; in place of grace, wretchedness appeared. Such is the condition of the heedless people. The recompense of their deeds hath overtaken all and deprived them of the everlasting, eternal mercy. Today, those souls who have drunk from the cup of grace and are gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon should beseech God not to afflict His people with the delusions of the past and to sanctify them from the doubts and allusions of the nations. Praise the Intended Lord Who guided thee to the praiseworthy station and caused thy mention to flow from the tongue of the Wronged One.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for his honor Muhammad Pasha, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>O Muhammad! The Wronged One makes mention of thee from a city wherein the fire of hatred hath been kindled through the actions of the oppressors. They have violated God’s covenant and testament, and turned away from Him Who came unto them with a manifest light. Blessed is the home wherein the remembrance of God is raised, and the tongue that uttereth His beauteous praise. Joy be to the one who hath arisen to serve the Cause, and to the hand that hath taken hold of His wondrous Book. We beseech God to assist His loved ones in that which He loveth and approveth, and to make them dawning-places of grace and bounty amidst the world. Verily, He is the Protector of those who do good. The Call hath been raised, the Path established, and the Balance set up, yet most of the people remain heedless. They have turned away from the Truth, clinging to their desires. Verily, they are in manifest error.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Karbala’i Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! The cawers are spread throughout the lands like locusts, speaking of that which they have not heard and claiming knowledge of that from which they are heedless and veiled. The deniers among the people of the Bayan are observed to be more lost than the Shi’ih sect. Thus have their souls deluded them, and today they do not understand. Glory be to God! In the Day of God they cling to and utter names, while turning away from their Creator. We beseech the Truth to purify the world through the Kawthar of utterance, that the peoples might acknowledge the Lord of the worlds and comprehend that from which they are heedless today. The Glory from Us be upon the people of Baha who have not been deterred by the oppression of the oppressors, the dominion of the aggressors, and the clamor of the heedless. These are God’s party in the world and the signs of His mercy among the nations. Upon them be God’s blessings, His peace, His glory and His splendor. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Generous. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Javad Aqa, upon him be the Glory of God.</p>
<p>O Javad! The All-Bountiful makes mention of thee from this exalted station, and makes mention of thee through His verses, and gives thee glad tidings of God’s grace, the Lord of all worlds. There is no servant but We have mentioned him, and no one who hath turned to Us but We have guided him to My path and counseled him regarding that which shall profit him in every world of his Lord’s worlds. To this testifieth every discerning soul. Blessed is the servant who hath cast away vain imaginings, holding fast to the cord of certitude. We beseech God to assist thee and His loved ones to remain steadfast in His Cause. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer.</p>
<p>O Majid! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. The mentioned names are present before My face. We have caused to shine upon each one of them from the lights of the Sun of My utterance that which shall draw him nigh unto God, the Lord of all worlds. We have turned unto him and given him to drink of the Kawthar of knowledge from the cup of My wisdom which hath preceded the seas. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful. Nothing whatsoever escapeth the knowledge of thy Lord. He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Convey My greetings unto them, illumine them with the lights of My utterance, remind them of the signs of My grandeur, and acquaint them with the horizon of My grace. We beseech God to draw them nigh and assist them to remember Him, praise Him, and serve His wondrous Cause.</p>
<p>The waves of the Divine ocean of utterance are manifest before all faces, and the effulgences of the Orb of bounty are radiant. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, that He may guide the world to the highest horizon of possibility through the temples of remembrance and utterance, that all people may attain, and not remain deprived of the Days of God. Man is bewildered, nay the world is bewildered, for it is observed that mortal life–which in the eyes of the people of insight is less than naught–all are occupied in securing its means and livelihood; yet for that world which has no end, they have neither thought nor contemplation, nor are they engaged in any preparation thereof. We beseech God to remove this heedlessness which prevents all degrees of grace and favor, and to make His servants aware. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you, and upon those whose names you have mentioned in your letter, and upon all who are steadfast and firm, and upon all who hold fast to the strong cord of God.</p>

Blessed is the handmaiden who hath attained unto your love, and blessed is the servant who hath arisen to make mention of you and serve you. We beseech God to preserve you and draw you nigh unto Him, and to grant you the best of what He hath sent down in His Book, and to record for you from the Pen of Grace the reward of attaining His presence, and to rain down upon you from the heaven of bounty the showers of mercy and loving-kindness.

May thou be illumined by the lights of the Sun of Revelation and be accounted among the letters of the Preserved Tablet. At all times, drink from the Kawthar of the Merciful’s love, and be thou enkindled with the fire of His remembrance and speaking in His praise. O fruit of the blessed Tree of Martyrdom! He hath testified that thou art manifest from it and unto it shalt return. Be thou gladdened by these words which have issued from the mouth of the All-Merciful, and arise to render praise unto Him.</p>

Moses attained to hearing the divine call in the Sinai of recognition, and this is that same call with which the Goal of the world now speaketh. Strive thou that this most great bounty may remain and endure. The evil ones have ever lain in wait for God’s loved ones, and through tales of the past they prevent the servants from the supreme horizon. Beseech ye God that ye may attain to such a station wherein ye will regard all save God as non-existent and count it as nothing.

Among the Concourse on High thou art mentioned as a handmaiden of God, and among the people of earth thou art known as a maidservant of the Beloved. Thy service hath not been, nor ever shall be, effaced from the view of the Most Great Scene. O My maidservant! Move among the handmaidens of God in the sanctity of the Ancient Beauty, that perchance all may be sanctified through thy holiness from the defilement of self and passion, and soar in the atmosphere of detachment. Hearken unto the counsel of the Most Exalted Pen and say: Deprived is the soul that turneth from the immortal Wine to that which perisheth, and from the manifestations of the lights of oneness to the promptings of self. O servants! If ye be lovers, behold, the Beloved is present; if ye seek the Wine, lo, the Cup of the Beloved floweth manifest and evident. Cast off the wings of fancy and with the wings of reality soar toward the realm of the All-Merciful. This is the Sun of counsel and utterance that hath shone forth from the Dayspring of the mouth of the All-Glorious. Blessed are they that hear and are illumined thereby. My handmaiden!

However, while some of the loved ones have attained to that which God desired, others have fallen short. You should remind all the loved ones of the divine counsels that have been revealed in the Sacred Books in this Most Great Revelation, that all may be adorned with the ornament of His favor and become the cause of remembrance among the peoples of the world.</p>

When the divine morn’s fragrance was diffused and the banners of the Cause were unfurled, all remained veiled from the Dayspring of divine light and the Dawning-place of divine revelation by the veils of the divines. And a few attained to the hearing of the call - these are the leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree, which have been sent down by the Supreme Pen in the scriptures and tablets. Blessed art thou and blessed is every maid-servant who hath heard and responded and attained to the recognition of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

Hearken unto the call of the Lord of Names, Who summoneth thee from the Prison of ’Akka and inviteth thee to the Supreme Horizon - the Station wherein the Lord of all mankind proclaimeth: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the worlds.

<p>O Haydar-Qabli-’Ali, upon him be the Most Glorious Bounty of God! In My name, the One Who is sorrowful in His Most Great Prison. By My life, My grief, My tribulation and My affliction, if from this moment until the Day that hath no end the Supreme Pen were to address itself as “O Wronged One,” it would be justified. Every manner and kind of oppression hath been inflicted upon the Daysprings of Light and Dawning-places of Revelation, both in the past and present, yet that which hath befallen this Wronged One is without parallel or precedent. O Haydar-Qabli-’Ali, Akhtar hath manifested an oppression that hath no equal in all the world, despite the fact that from the first appearance of Akhtar until now, those around him showed him the utmost kindness and repeatedly accepted his fabrications to assist him. That shameless and unjust one sold his trust, faith, truthfulness and fairness for a few dirhams from those whose wickedness he himself had repeatedly testified to. Yes, he saw two benefits in this action: First, obtaining money, and second, drawing near to the people of error. Assuredly, that station which the rulers and divines of the world have rejected, Akhtar and his like will not accept and will speak of that which pleases them. His very words testify to his falsehood and wickedness. The Greater Branch hath never made mention of worldly matters, nor doth he now, and hath chosen naught but seclusion, worship, submission and contentment. Should anyone meet with him, they would testify that no desire for transient things remaineth in him, for the days are drawing to a close. That calumnious liar’s dealings were with his sons, and from these mentions his purpose was to speak of Akka and to subvert the Cause of God. However, he was heedless that these mentions are the cause of the exaltation of the Word of God.</p>

This is the standard required of you, O assemblage of true believers.

<p>The Dove of the Cause warbled upon the branches of the Lote-Tree of transcendent glory: O people of the Bayan! Fear God and spread not corruption in the earth after it hath been set in order, neither commit that which is unseemly. Purify yourselves from whatsoever hath been forbidden in the Book of God, the Most High, the Most Great. Beware lest ye shed blood. Whoso sheddeth blood is not of Me, and God is quit of him. This was revealed at the beginning of this Revelation from the kingdom of your Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Beware lest ye commit that which your minds and hearts abhor. Fear God, O concourse of believers! Be ye detached from the world and whatsoever is therein, and dispose not of the property of others except with their permission. Thus have We sent down aforetime and now from the presence of One mighty and beauteous. Be ye the trustees of God in His lands, such that were ye to pass by cities of gold, your eyes would not turn toward them. Thus it behooveth you, O concourse of the pure in heart. Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, through your deeds, that the sweet savors of truth may be detected from you by God’s servants between earth and heaven. Adorn yourselves, O people, with the virtues of God, and commit not that which would cause the dignity of His Manifestation to be diminished among His creatures. Thus hath God counseled you in tablets of mighty protection. Oppose no one, and dispute not with any soul. If ye find one who is receptive, remind him of the Most Great Word, and if ye find one who turneth away, turn away from him and turn unto God, your Lord. He shall suffice you against all mankind. Be ye united, O My loved ones, then gather yourselves together under the law of My Cause, and be not of them that differ. Verily the nearest of you to God is the most God-fearing and most humble among you, if ye be of them that know. By the True God! If ye be oppressed it is more beloved by Me than that ye should oppress anyone, and this is of My nature and My most excellent attribute, would ye but be assured. Be patient, O My loved ones, in adversity and tribulation, and if one should oppress you, refer his judgment to God, in Whose hand is the kingdom of all things. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful over what He willeth, and He is the most severe of avengers. We have counseled you in most of Our Tablets not to oppose anyone, yet ye have done that which hath caused harm to return to the Lote-Tree of transcendent glory. O people! Fear God and transgress not beyond what ye have been commanded in the Tablets. This is better for you than that which ye possess, if ye be of them that know. Shun those who have denied God and associated partners with Him and disputed His signs and warred against His exalted and mighty Self. Then be patient even as We have been patient, and contend not with any of the idolaters. Trust in God in all matters, and verily He will aid Me even as He aided Me before when I was in prison beneath chains and fetters, and He aided Me in truth through the hosts of earth and heaven until He brought Me forth therefrom with manifest sovereignty. Within His grasp is the kingdom of all things. He aideth whom He willeth as He willeth, and He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Beware, O people, lest ye cling to names and object to Him Who created them by His command. There is none other God but He, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: He created names even as He created all things, if ye be of them that know. Every possessor of power is powerless before the sovereignty of His might.</p>
<p>And do not object to Him Who created these names by His command – there is no God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: He created the names even as He created all things, if ye be of them that understand. Every possessor of power is powerless before the sovereignty of His might, and every possessor of knowledge is ignorant before His knowledge, and every possessor of wealth is poor before His gate which openeth upon the face of all creation. Beware lest the names withhold you from their Creator. Shun those who cling to them and are among their worshippers. Say: The Prophet is he who heareth My call and believeth in My Self, and the Messenger is he who delivereth My messages, and the Imam is he who standeth before My countenance and gaineth My days, and the Guardian is he who entereth the fortress of My guardianship and detacheth himself from all else save Me, and the Successor is he who counseleth himself and then the servants with My love and My remembrance and My praise. Thus hath the Sun of utterance shone forth from the horizon of the will of your Lord, the All-Merciful, in this sacred, mighty, transcendent and impregnable Paradise. And praise be to God, my Beloved and the Beloved of them that know.</p>

<p>O Dayspring of Revelation! The rapture of the verses hath seized thee in such wise as cannot be described in words, so that when I sit, it raiseth me up with such an uprising as the onslaught of the ungodly cannot quell. When I am silent, the All-Powerful causeth me to speak and biddeth me to cry out betwixt earth and heaven. When I sleep, my heart calleth me and addresseth me saying: “This is not the time for slumber. Arise to fulfill thy Lord’s command, the Lord of all mankind.” Say: O people! The Hour hath struck and the Rock hath cried out: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of all men!” Think ye that the tyrants can prevent the Lord of all creation from that which He desireth? Nay, by His true Self! Should they bring all the armies of the earth, verily thy Lord is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. He doeth what He desireth with a sovereignty that all who are in the realm of possibility are powerless to withstand.</p>
<p>At the time of revelation, it occurred to My servant who was present before the Throne as he wrote God’s verses, that this Tablet was befitting for thy servant, the Friend, since its fire was kindled and its flames spread to all regions. We say: Were his warmth in the love of God to increase less than a whit beyond what it is, he would arise to make mention of God in such wise as would transcend wisdom, which We have enjoined in the Scriptures and Tablets. It behooveth the Friend to be tranquil, that he may hold fast to wisdom lest mischief arise. Thus hath the matter been decreed in the Book.</p>
<p>He saith in secret: “It behooveth the Friend to be set ablaze with the fire of God that the moist and frozen hearts may be set alight thereby, and that all in the regions may be illumined thereby.” There is no disagreement between the servant and his Lord. He desired by the fire the warmth of the love of God for the enkindling of cities and lands, and We desired the light of God’s manifestation that the hearts of all in creation might be illumined thereby. Blessed art thou, O My Name, in that thou hast fulfilled God’s Covenant and drunk the choice wine of steadfastness from the hand of thy Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>We have heard that wherewith thou didst call upon God and found therefrom the fragrance of thy sincerity to God when the Dayspring of Revelation was in the hands of the ungodly. We answered thee with that which hath perfumed the musk of utterance throughout all creation. This is of My bounty unto thee. Verily thy Lord is the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Know thou that in these days there hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, that which is the spirit of life for the body of the world and the cause of everlasting life for those who have turned unto God, the Lord of all men. It hath been named the Most Holy Book, and therein have been revealed the laws and whatsoever God hath sanctified from all directions. Blessed is he who readeth it and pondereth that which hath been revealed therein of the verses of God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Take ye hold of it with the hand of resignation, then observe it that ye may drink what floweth therein from the springs of the mercy of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. By My life! It hath been revealed in such wise as to stupefy minds and thoughts. It is the Most Great Testimony unto all mankind and the proof of the All-Merciful unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. Through it the fragrance of the garment hath been diffused and the breeze of God hath wafted. Blessed are they who are endued with understanding. Thus hath the sun of elucidation dawned from the horizon of utterance as a bounty from Us to those who have believed in God, the One, the Powerful, the Dominant, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.</p>

I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou didst raise up the heaven and establish the mountains and the nightingale sang upon the branches, to ordain for Thy chosen ones that which befitteth the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy generosity. O my Lord! All things have testified to my evanescence and Thy permanence, to my powerlessness and Thy might. Do with me as beseemeth Thee.

<p>Praise befitteth and is meet for the Lord of minds and hearts Who, through His Beloved Name, adorned the non-existent world with the light of being, and guided it from sheer nothingness to the realm of immortality. He bestowed upon non-existence the ornament of existence, and illumined the darkness of aversion with the light of acceptance. Through one exalted Word which shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of will, the ocean of knowledge surged, the sun of wisdom dawned, and the heaven of knowledge and insight was upraised. Glorious is His bounty, mighty His sovereignty, exalted His utterance, and there is no God but Him.</p>
<p>And blessing and peace and glorification and glory and remembrance and praise be upon the Hands of His Cause, who drank from the hands of bounty the choice wine of the most great steadfastness. These are servants whom neither the hosts of the wicked nor the ranks of the evil ones did frighten, and who performed that which they were bidden by God, the Lord of the Day of Return.</p>
<p>Your letter, which was in truth a sign of love shining forth from the horizon of the pen of detachment, arrived. Praise be to God, from each word the fragrance of trust, acceptance and devotion wafted. After observing and reading it, it was taken to the Supreme Heaven, and after attaining the presence before the face of the Lord of all beings and receiving full permission, the letter was presented and was honored to be in His presence and to be heard. At that moment, the ocean of utterance surged in such wise that this servant and all things are incapable and powerless to write and enumerate it. God knows what He revealed, and at the end of the utterance, what the perceptive faculty grasped were these manifest verses. His mighty utterance, exalted be His proof:</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! The Branch, His Holiness Badi’u’llah, presented your letter in its entirety before His face. Blessed art thou for having turned to the Supreme Horizon and attained that which was mentioned in the Books of the Prophets. We beseech God to strengthen thee with such steadfastness as cannot be prevented by the hosts of the world and their ranks, nor by the might of princes and their swords, nor by the doubts of the divines and their rejection. Verily, He is the One Who has power over whatsoever He willeth through His binding and wise command. Well is it with thee for having drunk the wine of revelation from the hand of thy Lord’s bounty when most of the servants were debarred therefrom. This is from God’s grace unto thee. Be grateful and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the servants, and glory be unto Thee, O Glory of the worlds! Let not the doings of the wicked grieve thee, nor the power of the oppressors frighten thee. Take the Book of God with strength from Him and authority from His presence, then read it before those who have denied this manifest Light. Say: O peoples of the earth! Fear ye the Lord of the Throne and be not of the heedless ones. The banner of divine knowledge hath been raised on the right hand of the Throne and the standard of piety on its left. Thus hath the matter been decreed, yet most people are in evident error. This is the Day wherein the Sinai smiled at its Interlocutor and the Herald called out between earth and heaven: O peoples of the earth! The Promise hath come, and the Promised One calleth you unto God, the Lord of the worlds. This is the Day which God hath adorned with His mention of His near servants. Cast away what the people possess and take what ye have been given from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We desire naught from you. We mention you for the sake of God. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by the light of Thy Cause, and the potency of Thy Word, and the power of Thy Pen, to transform the heedlessness of the world into knowledge and wisdom. Then open before the faces of Thy loved ones the gates of inner meanings and utterance. O my Lord! Thou seest me and Thy loved ones in the hands of the oppressors among Thy creatures. I beseech Thee to transform their tyranny into justice and their oppression into equity. Then send down upon them from the heaven of Thy power that which will transform their fear into tranquility, their weakness into strength and might, and their agitation into supreme steadfastness. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all affairs. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! The rain of loving-kindness from the heaven of mercy of the Desired One of the worlds hath descended in such wise that none hath been nor is capable of reckoning it. These days are different days, and their fragrance is sweet and perfumed. The Sun shineth with new splendors and effulgences, and the Tree of Sinai is adorned with the ornament of divine wisdom. Glory be to God! From the water is heard “The All-Bestowing hath come!”, from the trees “The Chosen One hath come!”, and from all things “The Lord of all names hath appeared!” The fragrances of revelation have perfumed the world, and the breezes of inspiration have seized all creation. O people of God! This Prisoner at this moment beseecheth from the Lord of all worlds, for each one of you, that which is everlasting and eternal. He is the One Who, by the scratching of the Pen, attracted the world, and through the power of the Word adorned creation with the ornament of detachment and trust. The Prisoner and all created things bear witness to His power and might, to His glory and dominion.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Withhold not Thy servants from drawing nigh unto the Most Great Ocean which surgeth in Thy name before the faces of all nations. I beseech Thee, O Revealer of verses and Manifestor of clear tokens, by the mysteries hidden in Thy knowledge and the pearls treasured in the vaults of Thine infallibility, to aid me and Thy loved ones to remember Thee, to praise Thee, and to spread Thy signs throughout Thy realm. Then protect them, O Lord of existence, from all things seen and unseen, from the croaking of the croakers, the imaginings of the heedless, and the doubts of the suspicious ones. Verily, Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful and the Fulfiller of the needs of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Mashhadi Mahdi, upon him be the glory of God, and likewise mention was made of certain other loved ones. After these were presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, there was revealed for each one that which is the Dawning-Place of the Light of Truth and the Day-spring of divine loving-kindness. It is hoped that all may drink from the ocean of utterance of the Desired One of the worlds and not remain deprived. This is what was revealed for Mashhadi Mahdi:</p>
<p>He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous</p>
<p>O Mashhadi Mahdi! Praise be to the Desired One of the world Who hath made the world fresh and verdant through His manifest verses, and made manifest the hidden and treasured mysteries like unto the sun. Exalted be His power and great be His signs! Today the loved ones of God must hold fast to unity and harmony and occupy themselves with teaching the Cause. From this blessed day the divine fragrance of the Day of God wafteth. Blessed is he who hath found and attained, and woe unto the heedless! Praise be to the One Who existeth, Who aided thee and illumined thee with the light of recognition. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and for having sent down unto me that which shall endure as long as Thy sovereignty endureth. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds, by Thy Most Great Name through which Thou didst open the door of bounty unto all who are in earth and heaven, and by the lights of Thy Kingdom and the mysteries of Thy Dominion, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love in such wise that neither the world nor aught therein shall prevent me from turning toward the court of Thy glory and drawing nigh unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And specifically for ’Ali-A?ghar-i-Milani a Tablet was previously revealed and that same one is being sent. This Prisoner hath repeatedly heard mention of him from the tongue of Grandeur. Blessed is he and blessed are they that have attained.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for Muhammad-Ja’far-i-Usku’i:</p>
<p>In My Name that is sanctified from all names […]</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabl-Ja’far! The Lord of Power hath turned toward thee from the direction of His Most Great Prison and maketh mention of thee, that My remembrance may draw thee to the Kingdom of Mine utterance and bring thee near unto My glorious and resplendent court. Should anyone ask thee concerning Baha, say: Verily, He is under the claws of hatred by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. By God’s life! The tribulations prevent Him not from making mention of God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Names. He hath stood before the faces of all the world and spoken that which shall guide them to the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. Nothing whatsoever hath deterred Him, neither hath the might of His enemies frightened Him, nor the ranks of them that harbor hatred. His appearance amongst men and His establishment upon the throne without veil or covering bear witness to this. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my Beloved and my heart’s Desire, for having guided me to the horizon of Thy knowledge, honored me with visiting Thy holy places, and mentioned me in Thy prison. O my Lord! Thou seest me clinging to the cord of Thy justice. Ordain for me that which shall profit me among Thy servants. By Thy name! Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>O Haydar-Qabl-’Ali! We have heard the cry of the lovers from ’Ishqabad and have succored them through Our grace, and We have sent forth ’Abdu’l-Karim despite the enemy’s displeasure. We have been with them in all conditions. Verily thy Lord is the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting, the Most High. And We have heard the call of Our loved ones in Usku. We give them the glad-tidings of Our grace and Our mercy, which have preceded existence in both the seen and unseen realms. However, We counsel all to such deeds and character as will cause the servants to draw nigh unto the Dayspring of God’s Cause and the Dawning-Place of His divine light. Should they hold fast to that which hath been revealed in the divine tablets, they shall witness all the world turning toward God. We beseech Him to aid all in that which will exalt His Word.</p>
<p>As for the request for attaining His presence, after it was presented before the Countenance of the Desired One, these sublime words were revealed in response from the Source of verses and the Lord of names and attributes - may my spirit be a sacrifice for His utterance. His exalted Word and mighty proof states: Permission for attaining presence in these days is contrary to wisdom. We beseech God to ordain its reward to be specifically revealed from the Supreme Pen and recorded in the Crimson Book. And regarding His Holiness the Trustee who is now imprisoned for the sake of God, a command hath been revealed from the heaven of God’s firm decree concerning these matters. If they succeed in carrying it out, truly the reward of attaining His presence shall be recorded by the Supreme Pen. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, possessed of great bounty, and He is the All-Commanding, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The mention of the loved ones of ’Ishqabad hath repeatedly been made in the presence of God, exalted be His glory, and His Holiness Afnan hath repeatedly mentioned each one and presented their names. Praise be to God, all have drunk from the ocean of bounty and received their portion and share of the sealed wine through His blessed name, the Self-Subsisting. Well is it with them.</p>
<p>At this hour, two hours after nightfall, the supplication which that honored one mentioned at the end of the book was presented and read in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these verses in response - exalted be His utterance and His proof, and glorified be His majesty and His sovereignty:</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the horizon of Revelation! The Most Great Branch presented thy supplication in most eloquent terms before Our presence. Blessed art thou for having turned unto Him when the people turned away, and for having recognized the Manifestation of Him Who conversed upon Sinai when those in all lands denied Him. Say: O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy power that hath subdued all who are in earth and heaven, and by Thy Name through which Thou hast made the Kingdom of Names to be subservient, and by the Crimson Ark which Thou hast specially ordained for the people of Baha, to make me known through Thy Name and steadfast in the promotion of Thy Cause. O my Lord! This is a day wherein the ocean of Thy bounty hath surged and the fragrance of Thy grace hath wafted. I beseech Thee not to disappoint Thy servants from turning to the Dayspring of Thy gifts and favors. O my Lord! Thou hearest the sighing of those who long for Thee and the cry of those who love Thee in their separation and remoteness from Thee. I beseech Thee to ordain for them, by Thy Most Exalted Pen, the reward of attaining Thy presence and meeting Thee. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Prevailing, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>As to the mention made of Abbas-Ali-i-Iskayi, who wrote and sent glad tidings of the steadfastness and devotion of the people of that land - after this was presented in His presence, that which all the pens of the world are powerless to describe was again revealed concerning him and the friends of Isku. According to His command, that honored one should mention them all and give them glad tidings through the effulgent lights of the utterance of Him Who is the Goal of all beings. Verily our Lord is the Helper, the All-Wise. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>Mention was made of the handmaidens of God. After presentation in His presence, a special mention was revealed for each one. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Remembering, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O Mother of Ali-Akbar! Rejoice in what hath been sent down for thee from the heaven of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, that which hath attracted the hearts of the devoted ones in the loftiest chambers of the Most Exalted Paradise. Thus have We sent down for thee that which testifieth to thy acceptance and thy turning unto God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O Mother of Muhammad-Ja’far! The Wronged One hath remembered thee at this hour with verses whose fragrance shall not cease to perfume the air for as long as God’s kingdom shall endure, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Mother of Mashhadi-Ali! The divine call is raised from the direction of the Prison and maketh mention of thee, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Master of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>O Mulla Baji! Thy mention was made before the Wronged One and there was revealed that which nothing hidden in earth or heaven can equal, to this thy Ancient Lord doth testify.</p>
<p>O Mother of Mir-Muhsin! Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having made me one of Thy handmaidens and for having revealed unto me Thy verses which were the hope of them who are nigh unto Thee.</p>
<p>O sister of Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali! All the servants and handmaidens of the earth were brought from nothingness into being for the recognition of God. Yet on the Day of Resurrection most remained heedless and veiled, while thou didst attain thereunto. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds, and glorified art Thou, O Beloved of them that know, for having sent down unto me from the precincts of Thy prison that which brought solace to the eyes of the steadfast ones in their exalted station. Ye must all, throughout the nights and days, be engaged in praising and thanking God, inasmuch as He hath favored the handmaidens of that land with verses the like of which hath never been seen. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My kingdom be upon My loved ones and My handmaidens who have believed in God, the Lord of the mighty throne. By the life of our Beloved! On this luminous night the ocean of divine utterance surgeth in such wise that none hath been or is capable of measuring or recording it. Thus hath His grace encompassed His servants and handmaidens. It behooveth Me and you to hold fast unto the cord of God in such wise that neither the hosts of the oppressors nor the ranks of the transgressors–they who have denied God’s proof and evidence, disbelieved in His verses, and cast aside His laws on this wondrous and glorious Day–can turn us away therefrom. Light and glory, remembrance and praise be upon you, O company of the sincere and the detached. Authority and dominion belong unto God, our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earths.</p>

<p>Praise be to the Lord of the worlds Who, through His supreme Word, adorned the peoples from nothingness with the ornament of existence, and through His blessed Word of unity provided instruction. Whoso attaineth unto it attaineth unto all that is in the first and last worlds. To this the tongue of proof in the Kingdom of utterance doth testify.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God, my Lord and my Support! This servant desireth to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee, yet findeth himself prevented from that which he desireth, for I know of a certainty that mention of aught else but Thee reacheth not unto Thee nor ascendeth to the heaven of Thy Cause and the atmosphere of Thy Will. I beseech Thee, O God of the seen and unseen, by Thy Name which Thou hast made the Sovereign of all names, and by Thy Command which hath encompassed earth and heaven, to enable me to do that which befitteth the court of Thy glory and the carpet of Thy nearness. O Lord! Thou knowest and seest that I desire to make mention of Thy Afnan whom Thou hast exalted through Thy Tablets and aided through Thy unseen hosts. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance to open before their faces the doors of Thy glory and bounty. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, before Whose power the power of all things hath proven powerless. There is no God but Thee, the Sender down of verses and the Manifestor of clear proofs.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice unto your mention and your utterance! Your noble letter arrived, bringing to mind the days of attaining your presence and meeting. In truth, when one attaineth unto the presence and meeting of holy and sanctified souls, in one respect he hath attained unto Paradise. In any case, after the arrival of the letter and its reading and observation, and the manifestations of joy and gladness and delight and enthusiasm and expansion, we proceeded to the Holy Shrine and presented it before His blessed face, and He said […]</p>
<p>The Seal of the Prophets - may our souls be a sacrifice for Him - hath declared: “A time shall come upon My people when no one’s religion shall remain secure except for those who flee from peak to peak…” In truth, that time is this time. This Wronged One and those who love Him are all clinging to the cord of resignation and the hem of contentment. This people have ever been, and continue to be, possessed of the utmost love towards the government and people of Iran, to such an extent that none of the peoples in diverse regions have been as obedient to the government’s commands as this people. This fact is evident and manifest to all. Nevertheless, you witness the conduct of those associated with the government - how they daily inflict harm upon ones such as yourselves, whom all know harbor no ill intent toward anyone and who deal with God’s servants with trustworthiness, love and kindness. Glory be to God! One is bewildered how they could consent to attribute theft to you who are among the most honored people of Iran, spreading it by word in that city and by telegraph to outlying regions, executing and carrying out whatever the slanderers say. Glory be to God! Where has honor gone, and what has become of care and kindness? It is reported that His Excellency the Ambassador, the Most Noble Mu’inu’l-Mulk - may God strengthen him - has arrived. What did he say and what did he declare? We beseech God to assist him in executing justice. Verily He is powerful over all things. Praise be to God, His Majesty the Shah of Iran in these days deals with this people with the utmost kindness and love, and each day there appears from him that which is a truthful witness and an eloquent testimony to his grace and favor. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to cause through him the standards of His justice to be raised among His creation and the banners of His grace to be unfurled amidst His creatures. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Peace and mercy be upon you and upon those with you who love you and serve you for the sake of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Indeed this servant is bewildered, for in the early stages of affairs in Astaneh, there was hope that through God’s grace - exalted be His glory - and the assistance of His Excellency the Ambassador, the Most Noble Mu’inu’l-Mulk - may God, blessed and exalted be He, strengthen him - matters would be concluded with justice. However, thereafter that which caused despair became manifest. For some time now the Master - may our spirits be a sacrifice for Him - has said nothing. Occasionally some associates have approached the Most Exalted Station and, with the utmost humility and submissiveness, inquired about the reason for this silence and its cause. Nevertheless, not a word has issued from His blessed tongue except that one day He said: “He is the All-Patient; He has commanded you to beautiful patience. He is the Concealer; He has commanded you to mighty concealment.” This servant in all conditions beseeches and hopes that the All-Glorious Truth may make the rulers aware of the sweetness, delight, loftiness and greatness of justice, and not deprive His servants of this supreme bounty and most evident light. He is powerful and mighty over all things.</p>
<p>Mention was made of the spiritual friend His honor Aqa Azizu’llah, upon him Baha’u’llah. Their attention towards those parts where they have gone is fitting. Wherever they may be, I beseech from God, exalted be His glory, bounty and favor for them. Verily God our Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous. Unceasingly do they circle round in remembrance of your honor and beseech from God, exalted be His station, whatsoever is the cause of eternal salvation and glory.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Assist Thy Afnan to that which beseemeth Thy glory, Thy grandeur and Thy power. Verily Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.</p>
<p>Regarding the shop you wrote about - it is very good, for it provides employment for the two brothers, upon them Baha’u’llah. It is both a means of occupation and livelihood - blessed from both aspects, God willing, it has been and is. Praise be to God, both honored loved ones have attained unto the word “Nasr”, meaning they are designated with the victory of God. It is hoped that the third victory will be the advancement of the affairs of the wronged community in the world, and likewise the advancement of your honor’s affairs. With the generous ones, tasks are not difficult. This servant conveys greetings and praise to them and beseeches from God glory, bounty, exaltation and blessing for them. And God is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Concerning mention of the spiritual beloved His honor Aqa Ahmad, upon him Baha’u’llah, you wrote that he has gone to Alexandria and until now no news has come from him. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to unite your company from all directions. Verily He is the Mighty, the Bestower. In this land also, until now no one suitable for work there has appeared, except for the beloved of the heart His honor Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him Baha’u’llah, who has arrived. There is intention today to mention this matter to him - perhaps he will give it attention.</p>
<p>Another matter is that the beloved of the heart His honor Nazir, upon him Baha’u’llah, said that during the days they were at the Threshold they observed a letter with you, either in the handwriting of the beloved of the heart His honor Ismu’l-Jud, upon him Baha’u’llah, or from here which by command was to appear that your honor should write that His honor Ibrahim Effendi, upon him be God’s peace, should not send tobacco to His honor Aqa Nuru’llah and His honor Aqa Ali-Muhammad, upon them Baha’u’llah. God forbid! God forbid! No such command has appeared from the Most Exalted Horizon, and mention of these matters has not occurred in this land. Outwardly it is not known who has committed such a falsehood. Knowledge is with God in His clear Book. In these days they have shown kindness toward His honor Effendi, upon him be God’s peace, and said: We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist him with the hosts of the invisible and visible realm, to open before his face the gates of favor, and to send down upon him from the clouds of His mercy a blessing from His presence and a mercy from His side. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones. O Ibrahim! Trust in all matters in God, the Lord of the Tree and the Mount, and commit thy affairs unto Him. Verily He is the Gracious, the Effusive, the Trustworthy, the All-Wise. And say […]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy mercy, and by the pearls hidden in the depths of Thy bounty, and by Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers and Thy Books and Thy Scriptures, to aid me to remember Thee and praise Thee, and to practice righteousness and godliness through Thy care and Thy bestowal. Ordain for me the good of this world and the world to come. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all names, and within Thy grasp is the dominion of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>From what is evident, the station of the Master’s favors toward His Honor Effendi is clear and manifest, requiring no further mention. This evanescent servant beseeches the Eternal Truth to withhold not from any of the peoples of the earth His infinite mercy and boundless grace, and to adorn all with the ornament of truthfulness and illumine them with the light of justice. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>In these days, the beloved of my heart, His Honor Nazir, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, is present and residing in the vicinity. He mentioned His Honor Effendi, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, and requested a Tablet for his son. After it was presented before Him, He showed His favor. It is hoped that an exalted Tablet will issue forth from the Dawning-Place of generosity and be sent. The two large containers of cheese that His Honor Effendi and other souls, upon them be God’s peace, sent have arrived. It is hoped that God, exalted be His glory, will manifest its recompense and assist them in that which is the cause and means of everlasting remembrance, as well as the cause of eternal blessing. In truth, what they sent was very good and outstanding, and praise be to God, it was honored with acceptance in His presence. Blessed be he and them. And the beloved of my heart, His Honor Nazir, has requested tobacco from His Honor Effendi. God willing, they will send it and be assisted in deeds that are the cause of the Friend’s good-pleasure. Peace and praise and remembrance and glory be upon you all and upon those with you and those who love you and hear your words for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

Wert thou to hear the shrill voice of the Most Exalted Pen and the cooing of the Dove of Eternity upon the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree in remembrance of God, the Creator of Names and Fashioner of earth and heaven, it would bring thee to a station wherein thou wouldst behold in existence naught save the effulgence of the Worshipped Beauty, and wouldst see sovereignty as the most contemptible thing, leaving it to whomsoever might desire it, and would turn toward the Horizon which shineth with the light of His Countenance.” And We revealed to the King of Paris: “Dost thou take pride in the treasures thou dost possess, when thou knowest they shall perish? Or dost thou glory in that thou rulest a span of earth, when all of it, in the estimation of the people of Baha, is worth not even as much as the black in the eye of a dead ant? Leave them to such as desire them and turn unto the Most Great Purpose. The poor man is he who beareth this weighty burden, and the lowly one is he who taketh pride in such fleeting glory.

We make mention of thee with that whereby the hearts of the Concourse on High, the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise, and the Supreme Heaven have been attracted. Blessed is he who has heard and recognized, and woe unto every heedless and veiled one.</p>
<p>O Zayn! By My life and My Cause, every letter that appears from My Most Exalted Pen calls out with the most loud cry in the kingdom of creation: “O concourse of earth and heaven! Open your eyes, for the Chosen One has come with a sovereignty before which the sovereignty of the world cannot stand, and with a Command which the armies of the nations cannot prevent.” To this testifies every fair-minded one and every just one who has spoken the truth concerning this Cause, whereby the limbs of all names have trembled and the heart of every heedless one who has denied God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, has been disturbed.</p>
<p>O Zayn! There has come before the Wronged One a letter sent by one of My servants who heard My call and turned to My direction. He has been named Hassan by the Tongue of Grandeur in this praiseworthy station. Give him My glad-tidings and remind him of My verses. Say: O Hassan! Rejoice that thy mention has flowed at this moment from the Pen of God, the Lord of the worlds. He has sent thee from the palm tree of utterance the fresh dates of knowledge, and from the Tree of Sinai the melody of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Beloved. By My life! If thou wouldst hear with thine ear, it would call out and say: “O people of earth and heaven! By God, the regions have been perfumed by the fragrance of utterance wafted from God, the Lord of existence. Cast the rejectors behind you and turn to the Word which, when it shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the Pen, caused those of Sinai to swoon in the land of extinction, save whom God willed, the Lord of the Frequented House.”</p>
<p>O Hassan! Observe, then mention what the tongues of the rejectors have uttered in this promised Day. The Most Great News has come unto them, whereby the Books of God, both past and future, have been adorned with verses that have filled the horizons and with clear proofs that have erased the traces of discord. Yet most people are unaware. They have cast the ocean behind them, playing with a mere pond, and they do not understand. Say: O people of Baha! Counsel the servants through deeds and character. This is what ye were commanded aforetime by God. Fear God and be not of those who see and deny. Say: Hear the call of God with your ears, then behold the Light shining from the horizon of the Cause with your eyes, nay rather with the eye of God, the Lord of the unseen and the seen. Verily, My Herald - upon him be My glory, My favor, and My mercy - commanded all to look upon My verses with My eyes, but the people turned away from what he said and took for themselves a path to tyranny […]</p>
<p>We desire at this time to make mention of those whom thou hast mentioned, that the rapture of this remembrance may seize them in such wise that neither the vanities of the world nor the wealth of kings and subjects may deter them.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! We have turned unto thee at this hour and make mention of thee in truth, inasmuch as thy name was presented before the Wronged One. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of My utterance from the direction of My prison, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thy call hath attracted me, Thy grace hath guided me, Thy bounty hath given me to drink, and Thy generosity hath encompassed me. I beseech Thee, O God of the world and Creator of the nations, by Thy Most Great Name through which the fire of hatred was kindled in the breasts of the perverse ones and the light of the Cause shone in the hearts of them that have recognized Thee, and by the Word at whose appearance all the books of the world submitted to it, to ordain for me through Thy All-Knowing Pen that which shall abide with me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Thou, verily, art powerful over whatsoever Thou pleasest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all affairs.</p>

We beseech God to ordain for thee the reward of attaining His presence and standing before His face and arising to serve His wondrous Cause, and to aid thee in that whereby thy remembrance and thy name shall endure in His perspicuous Book. By the life of God! The Wronged One loveth to meet His loved ones, but the oppressors have intervened between Me and them and have committed that which hath caused the Spirit of Faithfulness to lament. When thou drinkest the choice wine of My praise from the hand of My bounty, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! The wine of Thy utterance hath intoxicated me and the Kawthar of Thy knowledge hath attracted me. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the One Who conversed on Sinai spoke forth and the decree of resurrection appeared and the dwellers of the graves arose, and by Thy standing and Thy sitting, and by the breezes of Thy revelation and the sending down of Thy verses, to ordain for me the reward of those who have sought Thy presence and circled round Thy throne and hearkened unto Thy call and beheld Thy horizon. O Lord! Thou seest the poor one seeking the Ultimate Goal and the wronged one the manifestations of Thy justice, O Lord of all being and Sovereign of the throne on high and of the dust below. I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which shall make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love and active in carrying out what Thou hast revealed in Thy Books. Verily Thou art the Powerful One Who, when Thy power is manifested, obliterateth all traces of the world’s power, and when the Day-Star of Thy will shineth forth, the wills of all nations are struck dumb. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, and worthy to grant requests.</p>

Today every word that appeareth from the Dayspring of God’s Will concerning His sincere ones and those near unto Him shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. O Muhammad! God willing, thou shalt hold fast unto wisdom and utterance and engage in teaching God’s Cause. Today the ocean of verses surgeth, and the heaven of proof is adorned with the stars of evidence, and such rains of utterance and meanings have been sent down from the heaven of divine mercy that those who circle round have been unable to reckon them. Nevertheless, the deniers have said that which no oppressor hath ever said, to such extent that before Our face they busy themselves with misleading some heedless soul from the path. Thus do We recount unto thee what hath befallen Me at the hands of the heedless ones. Say: O deniers! Like unto the former people, deprive not yourselves of the effulgent lights of the Day-Star of Manifestation. Rend asunder the veils in the name of the True One and shatter the idols of vain imaginings with the arm of certitude. How long will ye worship fancy, and till when will ye pursue vain imaginings? Today the breezes of God are wafting, and the fragrances of divine revelation are diffused, and the tongue of utterance speaketh before the faces of all who are in the realm of being. Let go and take up - let go that which the people possess and take up that which cometh from the horizon of the heaven of God’s bounty. Today the fruits of the Ultimate Tree are visible, the Mount Sinai speaketh in praise of the Lord of Manifestation, and the Lote-Tree circleth round the House. Well is it with him who showeth equity in the Cause of God, and woe unto the hesitators.</p>

<p>O Muhammad! We have made mention and continue to make mention of all the loved ones, and We counsel them to manifest great steadfastness.

Until now they have not understood the station of the Day of God. Say: By the life of God! This is the Day wherein the Primal Point uttereth “I am the first of the worshippers” and the seat of the Throne is the circling-place of the Concourse on High. Say: Have mercy on yourselves and choose not eternal torment through love of vain imaginings and idle fancies. For the sake of God have We spoken and continue to speak, and in the path of God do We summon all to the supreme horizon. Say: O people! Know with clear certainty that until ye pass beyond the river of names, ye shall not attain unto the ocean of inner meanings. This is a word that was hidden in the treasuries of My Most Exalted Pen, and We have revealed it in truth and sent it forth with justice. Blessed is he who hath heard and said: “I believe in God, the Possessor of the seen and unseen.”</p>

Your mention came before the Wronged One and the gaze of favor was directed toward you. The True One, exalted be His glory, has appeared with enduring bounties and heavenly sustenance, and stands before the faces of the world. Yet most of the peoples turned away and rose up against Him. The kings saw no benefit for themselves in acknowledging Him, and likewise the ministers and clergy, even though in the divine Books and Scriptures the Purpose has been clearly and explicitly made manifest, and the True One has proclaimed in the most exalted utterance that this supreme Manifestation has come for the reformation of the world and the advancement of the peoples. The intention is that all might be illumined by the light of unity and associate with one another in love and harmony, so that the whole earth may be regarded as one country and one land. However, those souls who are deprived of sincerity and purity have imagined the True One to be like themselves, and therefore strive and struggle to extinguish the divine light. Would that the servants knew! Would that the people understood! For if they became aware and discovered the Purpose, all would turn toward Him and would utter the blessed words “We belong to God.” Beseech the True One that He withhold not the rebellious from the ocean of His bestowal and bounty, nor deprive the ignorant from the effulgences of the Sun of knowledge, that all may discover and come. Blessed art thou, for thou hast attained to My mention in My prison - a mention that cannot be equaled by the mentions of the world and what the peoples possess.

He hath aided thee through His verses and will aid thee through His clear proofs, and will assist thee through hosts whereby the doors of divine knowledge were opened to all who dwell in the realm of possibility, and the seal of the choice wine was broken through this Name that hath encompassed all creation.

O My Afnan! Discord hath appeared among the servants, and vain imaginings have encompassed the dwellers of the earth. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect His servants and to aid them through His sovereignty, and to confirm them in such steadfastness as neither the hosts of the world nor the power of those who have denied the Day of Judgment can shake. Convey My greetings to the faces of My loved ones and give them the glad-tidings of that which hath caused the ocean of life to surge at this time, and the Sun of the Covenant to shine forth by the command of God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: Beware lest the clamor of the idolaters frighten you. By God’s life! The Tree, though under the swords, remembereth His loved ones and counseleth them with that which exalteth them, and adviseth them to hold fast unto the cord of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. We beseech God to adorn their temples with the ornament of steadfastness and to give them to drink of the Kawthar of His utterance from the hands of His bounty.

This is an edifice that brightens the eyes of those near unto God and the Messengers. Your honor and the fair-minded know that this Wronged One hath neither taken nor desired aught for Himself. His purpose hath been the manifestation of God’s Cause and the exaltation of His Word. In the night seasons We summoned the servants to the horizon of grace, and in the daytime We occupied Ourselves with allaying the fire of hatred in hearts and souls.

Time and again have We uttered this most exalted Word: mighty is the Cause and mighty is the Day. Blessed is the soul that hath freed and detached itself from all else save God and hath held fast unto the Truth - a holding fast which the hosts of the oppressors and the turning away of the deniers cannot sever or separate. Convey to each and every one of the loved ones the greetings and salutations of the Wronged One. By the life of God! They are present before Our face and are visible beneath the glances of Our loving-kindness. It is hoped that all may be assisted to achieve that which shall cause its fame to encompass the East and the West. Verily God is the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the All-Giving, the All-Knowing. The splendor shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you, O My Afnan, and upon My loved ones who have quaffed the choice wine of revelation from the hands of My bounty, who have stood before the faces of My servants saying: “The Kingdom, the Dominion, the Glory and the Power belong to God, the Peerless, the Single, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God! That which is a treasury of utterance for the unlettered, a stronghold of security for the fearful, and a source of riches for the poor, hath been made manifest. Grace and bounty have appeared in such wise that the tongue of the world is powerless to make mention thereof. From every direction hath come sorrow, and from every quarter are evident the signs of grief. Nevertheless, the Tongue of the All-Merciful speaketh from the Kingdom of Utterance such verses as are the very life of the world. This servant beseecheth the True One to transform the doubts and fancies of His servants into the light of certitude, that all may attain unto that which causeth the heavens and the earths and all things to rejoice in its mention and to be gladdened by its remembrance.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Deprive not Thy servants of the wonders of Thy bounty, and grant them their portion from the Kawthar of Thy utterance in such wise that it may seize them from themselves and draw them nigh unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds and Master of nations. There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent over what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>As to what was written concerning Haji Seyyed Mirza from Sedeh and Aqa Seyyed Muhammad, upon them be the Glory of God, after being presented before His presence, these manifest verses were revealed. He speaks, exalted and sanctified be He:</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise[…]</p>
<p>O Siyyid Qabl-i-Mirza! The Wronged One of the world, from the Most Great Prison, that is, the fortress of Akka, hath turned toward thee and made mention of thee with such mention that when it issued forth from the mouth of the Divine Will, the earth revealed its treasures, the seas their pearls, the suns their radiance, the moons their light, the Mother Book its utterance and its word, the mountains their mines, and hearts and minds their wisdom and their secrets. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Effulgent. Can aught be compared with My Word? Nay, by My true Self! Can anyone enumerate what hath been sent down from the heaven of bounty? Nay, by the Lord of the Day of Judgment! Today every fair-minded one hath acknowledged the greatness of the Cause, and every mighty just one hath confessed his powerlessness and shortcoming. This is the Lord of all days and the captivating call to all peoples. Blessed is he who hath heard and found the fragrance of the utterance of God, the Mighty, the Wondrous. O Branch! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. We have made mention of thee through these verses whereby the Cry hath been raised, the ocean of oneness hath surged, and that which was hidden and treasured in God’s knowledge, the Lord of the exalted Throne, hath been manifested. O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! We counsel thee and those who have believed to observe trustworthiness, godliness, forgiveness and generosity, that the lights of virtuous character may shine forth and illumine the earth amidst this darkness that hath encompassed the kingdom of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The glory that shineth from the horizon of the heaven of revelation be upon thee and upon those who have hearkened, hastened, and answered their Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for His Honor Aqa Siyyid Muhammad, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>He is the One Who speaketh the truth amongst mankind.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Reflect upon that which the wicked ones of Hijaz visited upon the Lord of the world, Ahmad. During the nights and days He was occupied with guiding the misguided and reforming their souls. Nevertheless they perpetrated that which caused the atoms to lament and the verses themselves to weep - a weeping that caused the dwellers of the heavens and earth to wail. No harm was evident, no opposition existed. Through the Most Great Mercy and Supreme Compassion, He summoned all to the highest horizon and gave them glad tidings of God’s infinite favors. The counsel of the Lord of existence left no impression upon the evil hearts of that obstinate people. They were like dried up trees, unworthy of fruit. Even now it is observed that whatever is planted in barren soil remaineth fruitless. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to cultivate the soil of His people’s hearts through the hands of wisdom, that from the sowing of the seed eternal and enduring fruits may appear, and that He may cause all to attain true and everlasting life. This is the day of the friends, for the Book itself speaketh and heaven and earth uttereth praise and glory. Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto the hearing of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, and the vision of God, the Lord of this exalted station. Make mention of the friends on behalf of the Wronged One, that perchance this mention may move them all from this earthly realm and raise them above the heavens. Verily God is the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayer. The glory that is manifest, resplendent, and shining from the horizon of the heaven of utterance be upon thee and upon My friends who have turned with illumined hearts unto God, the Almighty, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>As was previously stated, mercy took precedence, but now it is observed that mercy, bounty, grace, and generosity have all taken precedence, as is evident and manifest from the revealed verses. Enemies are visible from every direction. Regarding His Majesty the Sultan, in most of the Tablets there hath flowed from the Pen of the Lord of all beings that which diffuseth the fragrance of favor. Nevertheless, for forty years he hath not restrained his wrath for a moment, and thus have the rulers acted in ways the like of which the eye of creation hath never witnessed. This evanescent servant beseecheth the eternal Truth to enable all to attain unto that which draweth them nigh and leadeth them into His presence. Verily, the Cause is in His hands and authority is in His grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about the investigation and inquiry by the officials of His Imperial Majesty - may God, the Blessed, the Most High, strengthen him - and the reply of Mirza Ali, verily this investigation is praiseworthy, for they will become aware of that which is acceptable in the sight of God, exalted be His glory. After presenting these matters before the countenance of the Goal of all the worlds, these exalted words were sent down from the heaven of will. His word, exalted be His glory, and all-encompassing be His grace and His knowledge: […]</p>
<p>O Afnan! Upon thee be My Glory! That which Mirza Abdul-Karim - upon him be My Glory - hath mentioned is the truth in which there is no doubt. However, these matters did not and do not require any question, for from the horizons of the heavens of Divine Tablets the Light of Commands and Laws hath dawned and shone forth, praise be to God. Therefore there hath not been and is not any veil over matters that would cause upheaval, agitation, clamor and discord. All the Tablets are sanctified from that which would cause the appearance of the fire of hatred in hearts and souls.</p>
<p>O Afnan! Upon thee be My Glory and My loving kindness! The Tablet of the Call was sent, and it beareth the Most Great Glad-Tidings. We previously commanded that a copy thereof be made and presented to the government that they might become aware of a gift that is sanctified and free from likeness and peer. And if copies thereof be spread abroad, it would cause certain matters to arise, therefore it is not permitted save after permission.</p>
<p>O Afnan! The King of Iran hath disappointed Us. Thou knowest that for forty years they killed, burned, and dismembered these people and cast them into pits, and not a single soul arose to defend them, let alone to fight. Nevertheless, His Majesty the King did not arise for justice. In his reign such tyranny appeared that Pharaoh, Nimrod, Shimr and Yazid have sought refuge in God from it. What heart could accept such tyrannies? Consider the lives of Siyyid Hassan and Siyyid Husayn in the Land of Sad, how Zillu’s-Sultan arose with such oppression. Now the cry of those two oppressed luminous lights is heard from the sands of Egypt. That unjust one without equity martyred those men after taking six thousand tumans in cash, and that same day three times did the attendants raid the women and children. In the first plunder they took the boxes and chests and ornaments, and likewise whatever was in the place of commerce - they took it all. They branded a hundred camels in the name of the government, and in the second raid they seized all the household furnishings, from carpets to vessels and other items. They confined the residents of the house in one room and locked the door, with no explanation given. After sunset the chief gardener of the prince went with porters and carried away all the flowers and trees that had been obtained from various places - that is, from Europe and India and China. Hath such cruelty ever had an equal in the world, or is there any likeness to it? Nay, by the Self of God Who standeth over the Letter Sin, and by the Cause of God that dominateth the world! By the life of God, because of the tyranny that occurred in Iran, the Faithful Spirit wept and the Most Great Spirit lamented. The lamentation of the Mother Book was raised up and the cry of the Point of the Bayan was heard. The decrees of His Majesty the Sultan had no effect beyond his own mansion […]</p>
<p>The cry of the Point of the Bayan was heard. The decrees of His Majesty the Sultan had and have no effect outside his palace. Glory be to God! In the days when the Sultan, in his own estimation, was commanding the oppressors of the earth to show forbearance and reject bribes, Zill-i-Sultan was collecting fines all around. Now reflect upon the ruler and the ruled, and take refuge in God. All know that this Wronged One has been a well-wisher of the government and people of Iran, and We have specifically mentioned Nasir in numerous Tablets and sought for him the good of this world and the next. However, the seat was not worthy of this supreme bounty. Ask God to transform the throne of oppression into the seat of justice. That which is the cause of joy to those near unto God after the supreme sorrow hath been revealed in the Most Holy Book. Again, make mention of the loved ones of that land on behalf of the Wronged One. O Abul-Fadl! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Justice. Thou hast ever been and art still remembered. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee. We beseech God to protect thee that thou mayest remember Him and be occupied with His praise. We hope that in this Revelation the loved ones may attain unto the lights of true Divine Unity, not like the Shi’ih sect who each day would carve an idol with their own hands and worship it. Among them was one who claimed to be the Fourth Pillar, who every year would write a refutation of the Primal Point and commit such acts as caused the dwellers of the highest Paradise to weep and lament. We beseech God to aid all to do that which He loveth and pleaseth. Verily He is the Lord of creation, the Lord of the Last and the First.</p>
<p>Blessed is the one who hath attained unto the recognition of the Day of God. The taunts and turning away of the servants did not prevent him from drawing nigh unto the Lord of creation. He testified among mankind to the Lord of Names. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to open the door of His bounty unto the faces of His loved ones and to raise them all from the depths of poverty to the heights of wealth. He is verily the Powerful, the Mighty, in the Last and the First.</p>
<p>In your second letter mention was made of the wishes and desires of the loved ones, upon them be the Glory of God. After being submitted before the Most Holy Presence, it was graciously accepted. Some phrases were somewhat modified and sent. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to adorn His servants with attentive ears and penetrating eyes. Verily He is the Lord of all creation.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the beloved of hearts, His Honor Mirza Abul-Fadl, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, it is now commanded that remaining in that place is most appropriate and preferable.</p>
<p>As for your mention of the receptivity and detachment of the people of Bukhara and Samarkand, it is indeed exactly as you have written. After being submitted before the Seat of Grace, these exalted words issued forth from the Dayspring of the Will of the Revealer of verses. He speaks, exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof: He is the One Who calleth unto truth […]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Thou seest Thy Afnan and Thy loved ones turning unto Thee, clinging to the Tree of Thy grace and holding fast to the hem of Thy bountiful robe. O Lord! Illumine the earth and heaven with their light, and send down upon them what Thou didst send down upon Thy chosen ones and trusted ones. O Lord! Thou seest the Afnan standing in service to Thy Cause and voicing Thy praise amongst Thy creatures. I beseech Thee to open before their faces the portals of Thy knowledge and wisdom, that they may draw the servants nigh unto the court of Thy glory and the carpet of Thy holiness. O Lord! Unite through Thy most exalted Word the hearts of all people, that the world may be illumined with the light of Thy oneness and the radiance of Thy singleness. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>As to those souls who are sanctified, assured and well-pleased - whomsoever they deem fit may journey each year from the City of Love to those regions, that they may guide with spirit and fragrance, with wisdom and utterance, the dwellers of the dusty earth to the highest horizon. Great indeed is the reward for this blessed and accepted deed. Blessed are they that act.</p>
<p>This is a day of thanksgiving and praise, nay rather, a day for the manifestation of all the divine names and attributes. Blessed is the soul that hath arisen for the sake of God and held fast to the service of His Cause.</p>
<p>Regarding the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet of the Call, whatsoever ye have deemed expedient and mentioned hath been adorned with the honor of acceptance, and after being presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, He said: “O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. The Tablet of the Call is among the greatest bounties of God, exalted be His glory. It hath no peer or likeness, for whatsoever was the cause of agitation, discord, conflict, disputation and corruption - all this hath been erased from the Book by the hand of power, and whatsoever was conducive to peace, unity, harmony and reconciliation hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen. Its allusions are the quickeners of the world and its utterances are the water of life for all peoples. By My life! No bounty can equal this most great bounty, and no matter this momentous matter.” Praise be to God, the mighty and glorious Empire is the supporter of this community, and we beseech God at all times that He may aid His Majesty the Emperor to assist this Revelation, that all the horizons of the world may be illumined by the splendors of the light of His justice, and that the oppressed ones among all parties may find rest in the cradle of security and comfort, and may voice their prayers for the perpetuation of his eternal sovereignty. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is.</p>
<p>In these days news of the yellow wind is reaching us from the assembly of the wise ones and physicians, but until now its appearance hath been prevented and its advent barred. And afterward the matter is in the hand of God, our Lord and the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Among the recent news is that the revered Afnan, His honor Aqa Mirza Aqa, upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of all beings, and the beloved of hearts, His honor Nazir, upon him be the Glory of God, have arrived. Among the fresh tidings is that due to the wickedness of the wicked, the door of retribution has been opened. His Majesty the King of Iran did not read the Tablet of God, and now as recompense he must repeatedly read letters from which the fire of hatred blazes forth from the horizon of every word, until an answer befitting the question is given, and likewise with telegrams. Take Iran in ruins, for it has kindled either a new fire in the earth or the fire of divine wrath. From every direction it has encompassed the bewildered king, robbing him of sleep and rest. Tribulations have so encompassed him that his messenger found no opportunity to deliver his master’s messages. However, as commanded, the people of justice must in no way interfere. They must remain with perfect dignity and composure. Nothing contrary to propriety or opposed to righteousness should be manifested by them, for the station of this party today is sanctified above the ways of the world’s parties. To the extent possible, they should strive to quench the blazing fire that burns against the government and nation. It is hoped that praiseworthy and pleasing qualities and conduct will be manifested by this party. In truth, a great sedition has arisen against the government - to this bears witness He with Whom is the clear Book.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar, and obtaining permission and documents for His honor Aqa Ghulam-’Ali from the people of Ya, and renewed special permission for His honor Aqa Mashhadi Rida, upon them both be the Glory of God, and the correspondence of His honor Aqa Ghulam-Husayn and Aqa Rida and Aqa Khayru’llah, upon them be the Glory of God, and the departure of the known leaf from the land of Ta - all these matters were presented before the holy and sanctified Throne of Truth and attained the honor of being heard. His blessed and exalted Word […]</p>
<p>O Afnan! Upon thee be my Baha! Praise be to God that thou hast succeeded in constructing the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar of God, whose remembrance and fragrance shall endure and persist as long as the Kingdom endureth. However, considering that the honored Afnans (upon them be my Baha and loving-kindness) have from the earliest days assisted the Cause of God with hand and tongue, with hearing and sight, all the atoms of creation have testified and do testify to the service, devotion, sincerity and purity of these sanctified souls. Glory be to God! In times of difficulty and distress, those blessed souls have again attained unto this special blessed station. Before this Wronged One, whatsoever was for the acquisition of the House was bestowed in Alexandria - thou thyself knowest this - and whatsoever was in the storehouse in Beirut was given to settle the debt of one of the believers, and the details of both are clear and evident to thee. Had there been means available, it would have been sent specifically for the construction to thee. Although whatsoever both of you possess - that is, thyself and the other one (upon both of you be my Baha and loving-kindness) - is considered the pure property of this Wronged One. By chance, on this blessed night, the supplication of the honored Afnan was specifically read in the presence, and likewise some time ago, and before that. From each word, nay from each letter, nay from each dot thereof, the fire of love was ignited. God willing, may the bestowals of the Most Great Ocean and the gifts of the Sun of Truth encompass them.</p>
<p>As regards the proceeding of the leaves to the Land of Ta, this matter was left to Ali-Qabl-i-Haydar (upon him be my Baha) to execute whenever he deemed it advisable. However, their movement appears very difficult, and thy proceeding to the Land of Ta is not permitted. Although the Sultan is now secretly remorseful for what he hath wrought against this wronged community, God willing, may His grace take hold of him and enable him to compensate for what he hath missed in the days of God.</p>
<p>As for the permission at the time of presentation, it was granted in the presence, and whatsoever the friends of that land have sent hath been accepted according to what was mentioned in the letter. We beseech God to assist all to do that which He loveth and is pleased with. Give them the glad tidings of My acceptance and illumine them with the light of My utterance and remind them of My verses which have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. O Afnan! Verily thy Lord mentioneth at the end of the utterance he who was named Rida in the Book of Burhan, and We give him the glad tidings of My acceptance of him and My turning toward him and My mention of him in days wherein My heart and My pen and My outward and My inward being and My loved ones who have sacrificed their wealth and their souls in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds, have lamented. Both Jinab-i-Rida and his parents have had and continue to have permission to proceed. Praise be to God, the father attained unto that which was recorded and inscribed in the divine Books, and likewise the son. Upon them both be the glory of God and His loving-kindness and the grace of God and His mercy.</p>
<p>O my God, my God! I remember Thee through Thy two servants who did not break Thy Covenant and Testament, who soared in Thy atmosphere and attained to Thy remembrance and praise. O Lord! Ordain for them and for those who love them, both male and female, that which Thou didst ordain for the Companions of Sinai in this Revelation whereby the pavilion of glory was raised up, those in the graves arose, and the law of resurrection was made manifest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Forgiving.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the mention of the passport that was seized in Bukhara: if Bukhara is firmly and definitively under the protection of its august government, there is no harm in obtaining a passport and it would be good. It would be better and more appropriate to inquire also from the spiritual friend, Aqa Ali-Haydar, upon him be the Glory of God, as he is aware of some of the laws of the august government, may God strengthen it. In any case, I have beseeched and continue to beseech God, exalted be His glory, for your honor’s dignity and elevation. On one occasion, these exalted words were heard from the Master of all beings. He said that the Afnan, praise be to God, has been blessed in his attention and steps. Although he has endured hardship, since he has succeeded in rectifying certain matters, the hardship is comfort. We beseech God to exalt him through His grace and favor and to ordain for him and his Afnan the best of this world and the next. Verily, He is the Giver, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>Manifest verses have been revealed especially for the mentioned names, upon them be the Glory of God. It is hoped that all will attain unto them. Verily our Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>This petition was about to be sent when your telegraphic news arrived, and since a response was issued from His presence, the sending was delayed until another herald brought new tidings, and that was your blessed letter which brought spiritual glad-tidings on the morning of the twenty-fifth of Rabi’u’th-Thani. After opening and reading the letter, such joy and delight took hold that at that very moment it was presented to His presence and fully conveyed. Then the divine ocean of utterance surged and the effulgences of the Sun of Knowledge encompassed the world to such an extent that no one was or is capable of enumerating it. Then these sublime words were revealed and made manifest from the Dayspring of Utterance, His words, exalted be His utterance and mighty be His proof: […]</p>
<p>O Afnan! Upon thee be My Glory and My Loving-kindness! Praise be to God that the realm of darkness hath been illumined by the light of guidance, and the parched desert of thirst hath been refreshed by the waters of divine mercy. This is indeed a great bounty and its station exalted. We beseech God to increase, day by day, His confirmations upon you, and to render your purpose so refined that its manifestation through the realm of utterance may captivate the world. Exalted is the penetrating power of My sweetest utterance and My most glorious remembrance! Blessed are those Afnans who have arisen to aid My Cause, who have taken the Kawthar of utterance from the hand of My bounty and have drunk therefrom once in My Name and again in remembrance of Me, through which the horizons of the heavens of wisdom and utterance were illumined. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for them and for My loved ones that which will make them the lights of His Kingdom in His earthly realm and the mysteries of His wisdom in His perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>O Afnan! The letters which thou didst send previously to this servant, each one hath been favored with loving-kindness, mercy, grace, attention and response. Well is it with thee and with My loved ones who have attained with joy unto the cup of martyrdom in My path. The ecstasy of the cup of martyrdom transcendeth all earthly delights. Whosoever partaketh thereof will, with utmost joy, eagerness, longing and gladness, hasten to the station of sacrifice. O God! Grant us, through Thy loving-kindness, Thy grace, Thy mercy, Thy power, Thy might and Thy sovereignty, for verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the Almighty. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst mention about the gathering of the loved ones in a special council for the conduct of affairs, this hath been accepted. In truth it is necessary. At the beginning of the entry of the Wronged One into the military barracks in the city of Akka, the establishment of a council was decided upon. However, due to changes of location and variations in movement and rest, it was postponed. And concerning what thou didst write about the unity, harmony, joy, gladness, delight and happiness of the Afnan and the loved ones - this became the cause of joy and exultation. We beseech God to assist all to remain steadfast in what was mentioned at every moment, for truly the manifestation of discord hath been and is the cause of the dissipation of God’s Cause. The world is not worthy of mention. Erelong its carpet shall be rolled up, save the carpet that is spread in the name of Truth through the endeavors of His loved ones - that shall endure in the world through the perpetuity of the Most Great Name. We beseech God to assist all in that which will cause His Cause to be exalted and His traces to encompass all. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>The signs of victory and triumph are evident from every direction. Blessed are they who have directed their endeavors to the exaltation of the Cause and who are occupied with the greatest steadfastness in uniting hearts and souls. We hope that the three mentioned souls may be illumined and gladdened by the effulgences of the Tree of Sinai, and We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant them success. Were all the peoples of the earth to become aware of the leaves and fruits of the Blessed Tree, they would all expend their endeavors in its service.</p>
<p>They mentioned the consultative council and the blessed, assured souls therein. Praise be to God, each one hath been honored with the mention of the Wronged One and special favors. Divine confirmation and assistance circle round the loved ones. Soon their names, their mention and their deeds shall be spread throughout the East and West of the earth - a promise from Us. Verily thy Lord fulfilleth His promise through His sovereignty and power. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Reflect upon the manifest power in the earth. In a moment He transformed punishment into sweetness and hardship into mercy, to such extent that the oppressor repeatedly acknowledged his error and in utter abasement sought Our good-pleasure. And were he to know what hath been ordained for him, he would cast himself into the fire, or flee to the mountains and lament until death. Thus was the matter decreed in the Mother Book by God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Subduer.</p>
<p>What transpired - the martyrdom of the martyrs who attained the supreme triumph, likewise the exaltation of God’s Word among those within and without, and the manifestation of power and might in that transformation - each is a clear testimony to the power, grandeur and all-encompassing nature of God, exalted be His glory. Blessed are they who know and blessed are they who have attained. However, if mention of the gathering and consultative council is made to the government and permission is obtained, this would be most preferable, seemly and excellent. The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon My Afnan and My loved ones who have acknowledged and confessed that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken before the faces of the servants. The Command is in God’s hands, the Lord of creation and the Commander in the beginning and the return.</p>
<p>The new sublime letter was indeed a book of joy for the friends. There was no delay whatsoever in responding to it - the moment of its presentation and the moment of response occurred in one place and time. Your services to the divine Cause have each been adorned with acceptance and divine good-pleasure. Now, since you have given the glad tidings of presence through the penetrating, swift missive, therefore many are waiting. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant you complete health and perfect well-being, and to cause you to attain the Most Great Scene with boundless joy and delight. And may you receive with supreme profit all that has been delayed during this period. Blessed is God, our Lord, Who bestows a hundred thousand Euphrates of nearness for a single drop from the sea. Who can reckon His grace and mercy? Who can count His favors and gifts? We beseech God to increase the endeavors of His loved ones there and to ordain for them from the Pen of His grace the verses of His mercy, His favor, His generosity and His bounty. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding the trees, fruits and seeds, after presenting it He said: “God willing, may the trees and seeds that the honored Afnan has obtained be planted like the trees planted in the Most Holy Place in the Most Great Name, and may they appear with new and distinguished fruits, and may their mention remain eternal and everlasting until the end that has no end. Blessed be the tree, blessed be the fruit, blessed be the speaker, and blessed be the hearer.”</p>
<p>Whoever has spoken these words has spoken exceedingly well: “The prayer is from Thee and the answer too is from Thee.” I bear witness that He was his helper in receiving, and likewise his confirmer in planting, and similarly He aids in receiving again and grants success in partaking, through His grace, His favor and His beneficence. Blessed and exalted be the glory, the remembrance and the praise upon your honor and upon those who are with you and who hear your words concerning God, our Lord and your Lord.</p>

<p>My God, my God! Hearts have melted in separation from Thee, and the hearts of Thy servants are consumed in remoteness from Thee. My God, my God! The cries of the lovers have risen from all regions, and the lamentations of the chosen ones in their separation have ascended. Thou hast, O my God, manifested the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Dawning-place of Thy revelations, that all who dwell in Thy heaven and earth might be honored by meeting Thee, yet the polytheists and the heedless have interposed themselves between them and the effulgences of the light of Thy countenance. O Lord! Thou seest the faces turned toward the gleaming lights of Thy countenance, the hearts drawn to the horizon of Thy manifestation, the tongues uttering Thy praise and speaking of what hath befallen them from the fire of separation from Thee, and the eyes awaiting the wonders of Thy mercy and the manifestations of Thy nearness and Thy presence. Wilt Thou deny them, O my God, after the ocean of reunion hath surged through Thy name and Thy command, and the horizon of meeting hath shone forth with the luminary of Thy generosity and grace? O Lord! Thou seest the hands of hope clinging to the hem of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the breezes of Thy revelation, the pearls of the oceans of Thy knowledge, and the manifestations of Thy sovereignty amongst Thy creatures, to ordain for Thy loved ones reunion with Thee and attainment unto Thy presence. Then cause them to hear Thy sweet call before Thy throne, or inscribe for them, with Thy Most Exalted Pen, the recompense of attaining unto the gate of Thy grandeur, which Thou hast opened before the faces of all in Thy dominion.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou knowest and seest that there hath come before the Wronged One, in His Most Great Prison, a leaf whereon were inscribed the names of Thy loved ones who have drunk the choice wine of recognition from the cups of Thy gifts and the Salsabil of certitude from the hands of Thy grace. I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, by Thy Name through which Thou hast transformed fire into light and removed the veils from hearts and minds, to aid them to remain firm with supreme steadfastness, that their feet may not slip through the doubts of the transgressors and the hints of those who have turned away - they who have broken Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, who have disputed Thy signs, disbelieved in Thy proof, and turned aside from Thy evidence after it had encompassed Thy earth and Thy heaven. I beseech Thee, O Lord of eternity and Sovereign of nations, to assist them to recognize the Source of Thy laws and the Manifestation of Thy Self. Then remember those whose names have been presented before Thy face, that they may rejoice in Thy remembrance, Thy acceptance, and Thy attention. Verily, Thou art the Most Generous of the generous ones and the Most Merciful of the merciful. Bounty is in Thy grasp and generosity in Thy right hand. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-Rida! The Wronged One remembereth thee from the precincts of the Prison and counseleth thee with that whereby the Cause of God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting, may be exalted. Take hold of the Book with strength from Us in such wise that the doubts of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of existence, may not hinder thee. Arise with supreme steadfastness in the Cause of thy Lord, the Lord of all beings, and say: O peoples of the earth! Fear God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, and be not of those who have denied God’s favor when it was sent down through grace. Turn with illumined hearts to the Most Sublime Horizon. This is what ye have been commanded, both before and after. He beareth witness to this Who hath spoken in every condition that there is none other God but Me, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Say: By God! The horizon of certitude hath been illumined by the Light of proof. Fear ye God and follow not the sources of idle fancies and vain imaginings. He Who was hidden in the universe and mentioned in the hearts of the Prophets and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books of God, the Lord of the seen and unseen, hath been made manifest. Thus have We revealed unto thee the proof and sent down that whereby thine eyes and the eyes of those who have attained to revelation and witnessing may be solaced.</p>
<p>O Heydar-’Ali! The Most Exalted Pen makes mention of thee and counsels thee with that which hath been revealed in the Book. Be thou eloquent in My remembrance, steadfast in My Cause, directed towards Mine horizon, firm in My path, and holding fast to the hem of the robe of thy Lord’s grace, the Lord of creation. A single letter of thy Lord’s verses is worth more than all that is witnessed and seen, as attested by the Mother Book which is with Him. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto My days, the heart that hath turned unto My countenance, the man that hath arisen to serve My Cause, and the eye that hath beheld the lights.</p>
<p>O ’Abdu’l-Karim! The Wronged One makes mention of thee and gives thee glad tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all beings, and counsels thee with that which befitteth the days of God, the Lord of Lords. Turn not unto the world and its conditions and what transpireth therein. All that is therein shall perish, and that which hath been revealed from the Pen of thy Lord’s Revelation, the One Who ruleth over all in earth and heaven, shall endure. We have sent down the verses and dispatched them unto those who believed when God came with power and sovereignty. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the knowledge of his Lord, and woe unto every heedless doubter.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Muhammad and reveal unto him that which will draw him nigh unto the Mighty, the Bestower, Who hath appeared and manifested what He desired. He it is Who hath spoken and caused all things to speak: “There is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.” When thou hast attained unto My verses and found the fragrance of Mine utterance, say: “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having enabled me to recognize Thee and for having acquainted me with Him Who was hidden within the treasuries of Thy power. I beseech Thee to assist me to be steadfast in Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over whatsoever Thou willest. Within Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.”</p>
<p>O Shaykh Muhammad! Hear My call and remember My days and what hath befallen Me at the hands of those among My tyrannical servants who denied My manifestation, My appearance, My dawning, and My verses which have encompassed the horizons. We make mention of thee and counsel thee with that which will manifest man’s station among the religions. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who created thee and caused thee to know this Cause whereby feet have slipped. Let not the doubts of the opposers sadden thee, nor the onslaught of those who have disbelieved in God, the Revealer of verses. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord and speak forth My Name amongst the servants. Thus hath the fragrance of revelation been wafted throughout the world, yet most of the people are wrapped in heedlessness and veils.</p>
<p>O Baqir! Hear the call from the right side of the luminous spot at the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Blessed is the penitent who hath turned unto God, and the humble one who hath submitted to this Cause whereby necks have been laid low. Beware lest the veils of the world withhold thee or the onslaught of those who have denied the Source and the Return cause thee to fear. O Rida! Hear the call that hath been raised between earth and heaven, calling all unto God, the Manifestation of clear evidences. By God! He hath come, before Whom the verses have bowed down and around Whom the Manifestations of the Cause from thy Lord, the Lord of Lords, have circled. Be thou so steadfast in the Cause that the hearts of the wicked ones who have denied God’s proof and evidence and committed that which hath caused the clouds to cry out, shall not disturb thee. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken upon the branch of eternity. Blessed is he who hath heard, and woe unto every froward denier.</p>
<p>O Mulla Ali! The Lord Who hath come with truth, with power and sovereignty, maketh mention of thee. By God! Neither do the Pharaohs hinder Him, nor do the oppressors frighten Him. He hath appeared and revealed whatsoever He desired. He, verily, is the Herald in the realm of destiny. Behold the effects of My Most Exalted Pen and ponder thereon. Verily it will draw thee nigh unto the Most Glorious Horizon and will open before thy face the gate of joy and ecstasy. Beware lest the clamor of the people of the Bayan debar thee from the Dawning-Place of the revelation of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, or the deeds of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of Days, cause thee to grieve. Say: O people! Be fair in the Cause of God and follow not those who have cast the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to idle fancies and vain imaginings. Thus hath the Truth spoken as a token of His grace. He, verily, is the Protector over what is and what shall be.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Husayn! The oppressors of the earth have unsheathed the swords of hatred against the countenance of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. They have committed that which hath caused the dwellers of the all-highest Paradise and this glorious station to lament. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear ye the All-Merciful and follow not those who have denied that which hath been sent down from the Most Exalted Pen in this perspicuous Tablet. The verses have been revealed and the evidences have appeared, yet the people do not understand. Blessed is he who hath turned with his heart to the Most Exalted Horizon, and whose face hath turned toward the face of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Thus did the Pen move when the Ancient King was established upon the Most Great Throne and proclaimed: “There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Loving.”</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Hasan! The rustling of the Sadratu’l-Muntaha hath been raised and the water of life hath flowed in the realm of creation. Blessed is he who hath heard and drunk thereof, and woe unto every heedless one who is veiled. Beware lest the veils of the learned keep thee back. Take thou the chalice of My bounty and drink therefrom My choice sealed wine. How many a learned one hath been debarred from the Known One, and how many an ignorant one hath drawn nigh and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the seen and the unseen, for having manifested Thyself, sent down Thy verses and guided Thy servants unto Thy straight path!”</p>
<p>O Ali! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee at this manifest time and calleth thee unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Beware lest anything prevent thee from God, the Lord of Names, or the intimations of the heedless ones, who have cast the Truth behind their backs, turning unto every remote ignorant one, veil thee. Cast away what the people possess and take that which thou art bidden by God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thus have We sent down the verses and explained them in truth as a command from Us, and We, verily, are the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Hearken unto the scratching of My Most Exalted Pen. Verily, it hath been raised between earth and heaven, and the fragrances of revelation have been diffused in all directions. That which hath befallen the Wronged One in the path of God hath not prevented the trees from yielding their fruits, nor the ocean of inner meanings from its waves. But the One Who conversed on Sinai speaketh and saith: “O people of the earth! Cast away what ye possess and take what hath been given you by God, the Lord of Lords.” We have arisen to promote the Cause in such wise that the clamor hath not deterred Us from the remembrance of God, the Lord of all men. We proclaimed before the faces of the world: “The Promise is come and this is the Promised One Who calleth you unto God. Turn ye unto Him and be not of those who disbelieved in the bounty of God and disputed His signs that have encompassed the horizons.” Thus hath the cock crowed and the Dove of the Cause warbled upon the branches.</p>
<p>O Mulla Hasan! The Supreme Pen hath never paused for an instant; it moveth and speaketh, and through its movement all things were set in motion and all created things appeared. The whole world was created for this Most Great Revelation. This fact hath been mentioned in the Books of old and those that followed, and is manifest today. The Herald, the Primal Point, took the essence of the Bayan and revealed it in these exalted words. His word is this: “I have written the essence concerning His mention, which is that He cannot be known through My allusions, nor through what hath been revealed in the Bayan.” This word is the essence of the Bayan, nay the sovereign of the Bayan. Although this Most Great Revelation, by the testimony of all the sacred Books, hath never needed any proof or evidence other than itself. Its verses have encompassed the world, and the manifestations of its power are clear and evident. Blessed is the eye that hath seen and the ear that hath hearkened.</p>
<p>O Abul-Qasim! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee. From the earliest days until now, both night and day, before the eyes of all men, we have made mention of God, exalted be His glory. The river of mercy hath ever flowed from the Pen of the Dayspring of Revelation, and when some trace of its effects became manifest, certain souls rose up in opposition–more severe than the opposition of the former people who martyred the Lord of all beings–and some spoke words beyond all bounds. The heedless souls have made and continue to make claims. The people of God must be vigilant and aware. The Cause of God hath never been, nor will it ever be, the plaything of the ignorant. If every day someone were to make a claim, God’s Cause would become suspended and delayed among the people. This matter is clear and evident to those possessed of insight. God willing, may all unite and, through their unity, illumine the horizons with the light of this dawning.</p>
<p>O Habib! Hearken unto the voice of Truth that hath been raised from the direction of the Prison. By God’s life! His Word is the sovereign of all words, and His utterance the king of all utterances. Were all the ears on earth to hearken aright, all would turn to the Most Exalted Horizon and would return from that which they possess to that which is with God. The Sun of Truth is shining, the ocean of inner meanings is surging, and the heaven of knowledge is adorned. This Day is unlike all other days, and this Revelation unlike all other revelations. Blessed are they who have turned unto it and attained the recognition of God. Know ye the value of these divine days. By My life! Neither the treasures of earth nor all that it containeth can equal them. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O Ali! God willing, mayest thou remain steadfast in the Cause of God and hold fast unto His praise with such firmness that the world shall have no power to deter thee.</p>
<p>Blessed are the people of Kha who have heard the Call and answered their Lord, the Speaker, the All-Knowing. We have repeatedly made mention of the people of that land. We beseech God to set them all ablaze with such fire that through the heat of the love of God all the peoples of the world may be attracted. One of the people of Kha, named Muhammad, attained Our presence. He hath heard what the near ones have heard. We beseech God to protect him and enable him to make mention of Him and praise Him.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him whose book was present before the Throne and who was named Mirza Baba. Verily We make mention of him and of My loved ones who have believed in God, the Lord of the worlds. O people of God! Take heed lest anything prevent you or the hosts of the world weaken you. Arise with supreme steadfastness in the Cause of God, the Lord of all humanity. He hath aided you, caused you to know Him, drawn you nigh unto Him, and He is the Compassionate, the Generous. O Baba! Each of the names of the loved ones mentioned in thy letter hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen and is being sent, that all may be set ablaze and hold fast unto that which He loveth and is pleased with. We counsel all to act in accordance with that which hath been sent down in God’s Book from the Pen of His command. It guideth you to the straight path and biddeth you to that which will exalt your station amongst the religions. The glory be upon thee and upon them and upon My maidservant and My other maidservants (Hajiyih Bigum and Zahra). Give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness, My grace and My mercy.

Hearken unto the call of the Dayspring of Revelation from the precincts of His sanctified House, which God hath made the circling-point of the Concourse on High and the Dawning-places of His Command from time immemorial, that the call of God may gladden you and sanctify you from the world and its sorrows, and draw you nigh unto the Dayspring of grandeur and power. We have remembered those who have turned towards the Countenance, and have made it a treasure for them in Our worlds which none hath known save His Own Self, the All-Encompassing over all possibility. Blessed are ye, O My loved ones, for having attained unto the Goal when the learned and princes turned away, and for having drunk from the Kawthar of life when every heedless doubter was debarred therefrom. Ye are they whom the veils of men hindered not, nor were ye kept back by the intimations of such as disbelieved in God, the Lord of all men. Ye have turned with radiant faces toward the Most Exalted Horizon and have heard the call of the Lord of Names when it was raised betwixt earth and heaven. Rejoice ye, then give thanks unto your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. How many a king desired to attain Our presence, and how many a scholar lamented for the days of attainment, yet when the appointed time was fulfilled and the Horizon of Revelation shone forth, they kept back from it and held fast unto their own opinions. The world was created for the Most Great Day. Verily He hath come with the truth, but the people are in doubt and dissension. The world hath been illumined through the revelation of Our Most Great Name: among men some have recognized while others have not. Blessed is he who hath heard and perceived and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Dawning-place of the signs!” Turn, O My loved ones, with radiant hearts toward the seat of the throne of your Lord, the Lord of Names. Then aid Him through remembrance and utterance. The doors have been barred and the doorkeeper standeth ready. Should God so will, He will open them through the key of His Most Great Name and drive them away through His sovereignty that hath encompassed all created things. When anyone desireth to enter into the presence of the Throne, they speak concerning him that which causeth the dwellers of Paradise and the Concourse on High to lament. He is, in truth, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We have forbidden the people from coming into Our presence, because of what the hands of such as were heedless of the Command have wrought and who followed every wicked deceiver. It behooveth everyone to act according to what hath been commanded by God, the One, the Chosen. Beware lest remoteness sadden you. Whoso hath today attained unto recognition and acted according to what was commanded, he is reckoned among those who are nigh in the Mother Book. Consider the favor and bounty of God - He remembereth you through grace in this Prison which was built of solid rock, and sendeth unto you that which will solace your eyes. Follow ye the commandments and laws of God, and hold fast unto the hem of the mercy of your Lord, the Cleaver of the Dawn. Hold ye fast unto the cord of unity in the path of God, the Lord of creation. Through your unity the hearts of them that have disbelieved in the Beginning and the End shall be shaken. Teach your children to recite the verses of God at morn and at eventide. God hath prescribed for every father to educate his children, both male and female, in learning and letters, then crafts and professions. Thus have We taught you in Our Most Holy Book which We have sent down from Our hallowed Kingdom. Blessed is he who hath laid hold upon it through Our power. He is of the people of this station. Strive ye that there may appear from you that which beseemeth the days of your Lord, the Lord of all men. The glory be upon you and upon those who have attained unto what ye have attained and have drunk the Kawthar of life from the hands of the bounty of your Lord, the Lord of Religions.</p>

<p>He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing!</p>
<p>The ocean hath surged and the divine fragrance hath wafted, and the Day is come, yet the people are in manifest doubt. The Cry hath been raised and the Hour hath appeared and the Trumpet hath been sounded, when He Who conversed with God took His seat upon the throne of Revelation and the Herald proclaimed: The Kingdom is God’s, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting! Glory be to those who have believed in God, the Mighty, the Loving!</p>

<p>God the Most Glorious! The ocean of divine knowledge has surged when the fragrance of the All-Merciful was diffused. Enter, O people of Baha, into the Crimson Ark, then board it in My Name, the Most Exalted, the Most High. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the Kawthar of My utterance in My days and for having acknowledged that which My Tongue hath acknowledged in the kingdom of My wondrous expression.</p>

<p>In My Name, the Most Holy, the Most Ancient, the Most Great! Say: O my God! Thou seest me standing before the throne of Thy grandeur, hearing Thy call, gazing upon Thy countenance, holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty, and clinging to the hem of Thy grace. I beseech Thee to assist me in serving Thy Cause, then to unite my scattered affairs that I may become capable of teaching Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

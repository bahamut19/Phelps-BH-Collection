He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Glorious

Praise be to God Who is one in might, power and majesty, and single in grandeur, strength and glory. He hath ever been sanctified beyond the mention of all created things and shall forever remain exalted above the description of all beings. He hath made manifest the Way and made clear the Evidence, and hath called out with the most exalted Call between earth and heaven, summoning all to His most glorious horizon and His most resplendent station. Among the people are those who were attracted by His verses and acknowledged His sovereignty; among them are those who were thunderstruck by the Call, then recovered through the sweet savors of the manifestation of the Lord of Names; and among them are those who were thunderstruck and recovered not - these are accounted among the dead in the Book of their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Praise be to God Who hath made manifest from the Point the standing Alif, and verily it is the One standing upon the two Causes, manifest with the two Names, speaking of the mystery of the Manifestation in the two Most Great Remembrances, and appearing between the two Letters. By the first were the heavens folded up, and by the other were new heavens raised up. Exalted be God, the Lord of all mankind, through Whom the signs appeared, the stones glorified Him, and all created things between the earths and the heavens spoke. The Promised One hath appeared and the Worshipped One hath shone forth from His praiseworthy station upon all existence, both the unseen and the seen, through His most beautiful names and His most exalted attributes. Blessed is he who hath turned to this most luminous station and recognized the favor of God, the Lord of the Beginning and the End. Woe unto him who hath turned away and denied - he is of those who have gone astray, fallen into error, turned aside and become wretched.

I pray and glorify those who have cast away vain imaginings, abandoned idols, turned to the Lord of all beings, arose to serve His Cause, spoke His praise, chose His good-pleasure, attained His presence, and drank the choice wine of reunion with Him. These are among the firm ones, the steadfast, the upright. Upon them be the glory of God, the Lord of all worlds.

My spirit be a sacrifice for the burning fire of Thy love! The representation of this evanescent servant is that for some time no trace of your epistolary pen has passed before me. Some time ago this servant submitted a petition and dispatched it from the direction of Ha. A few days ago when his honor Amin, upon him be the glory of God, was departing, this servant found no opportunity, as from the Source of Command came the command for his remaining in this land, and later he himself decided to go to attend to his affairs and return quickly. As he departed suddenly, this servant had no chance to submit a petition. And now, as the Tablets of God were being sent to the land of Sad and that land, therefore this brief missive was ventured. It is hoped to be pardoned.

God willing, through the sweet savors of your utterance, may all the dead in those regions be adorned with the garment of eternal life and the everlasting robe. Although the people are observed to be in such heedlessness that its mention is beyond both pen and tongue, yet the divine Will and Purpose has been and shall ever be triumphant and all-pervading. Furthermore, this evanescent servant conveys greetings to your relatives, both male and female, young and old, and likewise to the loved ones of that land. I beseech and hope from the Truth that He may cause all the loved ones to be enkindled with the fire of His love, that all on earth may be set ablaze by the warmth of their love and turn to the most exalted horizon.

Another submission is that all those circumambulating offer limitless greetings to your honor. The blessed Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of divine Will and dispatched. God willing, may they attain unto them. One Most Holy, Most Glorious Tablet was revealed specifically for your honor and was sent a few days ago in the company of his honor Amin, upon him be the glory of God, and this time it is specifically for those related to your honor.

Verily the glory, the praise, the spirit and the glorification be upon you, O thou who hast turned unto God and remained steadfast in His firm and mighty Cause, and upon those who are with thee and love thee for the sake of God, the King, the Omnipotent, the All-Pervading, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

The Servant of God

19 Jamadiyu'th-Thani 1292

I glorify the honored friend, his honor Aqa Mirza Haydar-'Ali, upon him be the eternal glory of God, with stirring salutations from the Most Holy, Most Glorious Paradise. He has always been the object of the Most Great gaze and God willing, shall ever be.

To Mulla Sadiq of Baku

In His Name, Who is sanctified above the mention of what was and what shall be!

Praise be to God Who is unique in His grandeur and peerless in His Word, through Whose manifestation the Reality hath appeared, the Hour hath come to pass, and the tongues of all things have spoken in the Kingdom of creation. That which was recorded in the Books of God and inscribed in the Scriptures and Tablets hath been made manifest.

O Sadiq! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He maketh mention of thee as a token of His grace, that He may draw thee to a station wherein thou shalt acknowledge that which God Himself acknowledged before the creation of the heavens and the earth, and give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. This is the Day wherein the decree of the Meeting hath been fulfilled and the ocean of attainment hath surged, yet most of the people remain heedless. This is the Day whereof every Prophet and every Messenger from God, the Lord of the worlds, gave glad-tidings.

Say: O people! He hath come Who cannot be indicated by the signs of creation nor walketh in their ways. He hath appeared and made manifest His straight Path. This is the Day that hath adorned the Scrolls of God, the Mighty, the Wise. Behold what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an, that thou mayest lead the people out of darkness into light and give them glad-tidings of the days of God. This is the Day wherein it behooveth every seeker to be in such wise that neither the books of the world nor the veils of the nations can hinder him. He speaketh and calleth out amongst the servants. This is the Day whereof God gave tidings, the Day whereon mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds. By My life! The kingdom on that Day shall be God's, yet the people are wrapped in a thick veil. We bear witness that they are in evident smoke. The clouds of idle fancy have encompassed their hearts inasmuch as they have turned away from God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.

Blessed is he who is adorned this Day with the lights of certitude, turning away from those who doubt this Day, whereof the Tongue of Grandeur spoke before the creation of the heavens and the earth. This is the Day whereon thy Lord hath come and the angels rank on rank. Thus did the Tongue of Revelation speak aforetime, and thus did this Pen foretell - the Pen through whose movement the fragrance of utterance was wafted to all lands and all things proclaimed: "The Truth hath come with manifest sovereignty." This is the Day whereon the Caller calleth out from every direction: "To whom belongeth the Kingdom this Day? To God, the One, the Almighty!" This is the Day whereon the mountains have been moved and every pregnant one hath cast her burden. To this beareth witness the Mother Book in this Most Great, Most Holy, Most Luminous Station.

Say: By God! This is the Day of Distinction. And what shall make thee understand what the Day of Distinction is? Woe on that Day to the deniers who deny the Day of Judgment! None denieth it save every transgressor, every sinful one. This is the Day whereon the Interlocutor of Sinai hath spoken, whereon the Trump hath been blown, those in the graves have been raised, and all who are in the heavens and on earth have swooned away, except whom God hath willed, the Mighty, the All-Praised.

Say: O people! Have ye forgotten what one of My chosen ones spoke aforetime, saying: "Await ye the appearance of the Interlocutor of Moses from the Tree upon the Mount"? These are words which the Messenger of God taught him, from the presence of Him Who sent him with the truth and aided him through the Spirit of Certainty.

O Sadiq! Behold, then remember My days and what hath befallen Me in the path of God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers of old. Tribulations have encompassed Me in all conditions, until the heedless cast Us into this Great Prison. When We entered it, We conveyed unto kings and subjects that which My Will had preceded and which had appeared from the horizon of My all-compelling Will over the worlds. Therein did sorrows overtake Us which none knoweth save God - to this every fair-minded and discerning one beareth witness. When those days were concluded, God transformed it into the Most Exalted Paradise and named it the Heaven of heavens. Thus was the matter decreed in a preserved Tablet. And it hath another episode which, were I to mention it, would cause grief to seize every faithful seeker.

Say: O people! Be fair before God - if ye deny this Cause which hath dawned from the Supreme Horizon, by what proof can ye establish that which ye possess? Be fair, and be not of the wrongdoers. Thus have We expounded the verses and sent down for thee that which hath diffused the fragrance of utterance, that thou mayest find and thank thy Lord, the Speaking, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.

When thou hast received My Book and hearkened unto what My Pen hath spoken, turn thy face toward My direction and say: "I testify that Thou hast come for the life of the world, and through Thy mention the horizon of the Kingdom of God's utterance, the Lord of all worlds, hath been adorned."

As for what you wrote regarding Our name "the All-Bountiful," that you have secluded yourself with Him and recognized that His good pleasure is the good pleasure of your Lord - excellent is what you have recognized, and you are among those who know. Remain there, then remind those who come to you, then convey to them what God has conveyed to you, and be among those who speak concerning the Cause of their Lord. Strive within yourself to remain steadfast in the love of your Master, for soon the winds of difference will blow from every direction - then be not disturbed, but take shelter in the shadow of the protection of your Lord. Thus have We taught you and distinguished you, that you may give thanks to God, your Lord, and be among the thankful ones. And the glory be upon you and upon those who have detached themselves from all else and turned with their hearts to this holy and beloved Scene.

O Temple! Be glad in thyself, for We have built thee from the tablets of the Utterance, reared thee through the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and sanctified thee from doubts and imaginings. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Thou dost speak at all times: "O concourse of creation! Is the temple built of clay better, or that which was fashioned by the hands of the mercy of your Lord, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate? Say: I am the Temple of God amongst you. Beware lest ye forsake Me, turning to your vain imaginings. Fear God and follow not every remote doubter. God hath created Me through His Name and made Me adorned with the ornament of His remembrance amidst the concourse of creation. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who hath made Me the source of His Cause and the dawning-place of His revelation among the worlds. Say: God hath intended by this Name in the Book naught else but My Temple, were ye of those who know. God hath raised Me by His sovereignty and made Me the standard of guidance among His servants. Hasten unto Me and be not of those who tarry. Say: Through My rising the Cause of God hath risen in all things, and through My manifestation hath been perfected what was sent down in the Tablets and what was mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel. Beware lest ye alter the Temple of God. Know ye what We have informed you of before, then aid your Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. This, verily, is the righteousness of God, were ye of those who perceive. Say: This, verily, is the Word of God, were ye of those who know.

O concourse of the Spirit! Beware lest ye deny that whereby the remembrance of God hath been established among you, and beware lest ye follow the veiled ones. Blessed is the dead one who is quickened by the Spirit of God and stirred by the breeze that wafteth from the garment of grace and bounty. Woe unto the deniers! Follow not those who claim faith in Him Whom We sent aforetime, yet when He appeared Who was intended, they denied Him and clung to what they possessed. They are indeed in manifest loss. Say: Verily the Word of God speaketh and walketh, were ye of the discerning ones. When it walketh, the breezes of glorification pass over all who are in creation, and the fragrances of the All-Merciful are diffused throughout contingent being. Blessed is he who hath cast away all else, who hath drawn near, found and said: "Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of creation and the kingdom of invention. I testify that Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Generous. Through Thee were the faces illumined, the Hour appeared, the Dove warbled, and what was mentioned in the Books of God from time immemorial was fulfilled." Thus was the matter decreed, but the people are in a great veil.

Say: Have ye turned to temples made by the hands of Our servants while setting aside the Temple of God? This is naught but manifest wrong. Do ye imagine ye worship God your Lord? Nay, rather your vain imaginings, were ye of the perceiving ones. If ye were worshipping Him, when He appeared in truth, why did ye deny Him? Bring forth your proof if ye be of those who know. Blessed is he who hath forsaken the pool and hastened to the Kawthar which floweth from the finger of the Almighty. He is truly among the triumphant ones. Whoso turneth unto this Countenance in less than the twinkling of an eye, by My life, he is accepted before the Beloved, and whoso turneth away is indeed among the people of the Fire. The Call hath been raised in such wise that every ear hath heard it, yet ye are heedless and are among the remote ones. Cast away what ye possess, then hearken to the rustling of this Pen through which the Kawthar and Salsabil have flowed. When it speaketh, all things proclaim: "There is no God but He, the Almighty, the Powerful."

Say: I am He through Whose name the Tablets were sent down and the pages of God, your Lord, were adorned, were ye of the perceiving ones. Do ye prevent yourselves from meeting your Lord? Open your eyes and follow not every sinful idolater. He is in the luminous spot and the white land, calling all unto God, the Single, the All-Informed. He hath borne afflictions and tribulations in such measure as no Son bore before, nor any of the Prophets and Messengers. The raiment of sanctity hath been altered through the calumnies of those who disbelieved in the clear signs, and when the verses are recited unto them, they say: "This is naught but manifest sorcery." They speak as spoke those before them. Verily they are among the most lost. Blessed is the face illumined by the lights of the Countenance, and the eye that hath turned to this noble prospect.

The beginning of speech is the praise of the Lord. O servants! The springs of divine bounty are flowing - drink from them, that by the help of the peerless Friend ye may be cleansed from the dust of earth and enter the precincts of the one true Friend. Pass beyond the world and set your face toward the city of the Beloved. O servants! The consuming fire is kindled by My hand - quench it not with the waters of ignorance. The heavens are a sign of My greatness - behold them with pure eyes. And the stars bear witness to My truth - testify ye to this truth. O servants! Sight belongeth to the eye and hearing to the ear. Whoso in this blessed day hath not heard the voice of the divine herald hath not possessed, nor doth he possess, ears. The ear is not that piece of flesh at which thou gazest - open the hidden eye that thou mayest behold the fire of God, and hearken with the ear of the spirit that thou mayest hear the sweet voice of the Beloved. O servants! If ye desire healing, lo, the remedy hath appeared. If ye possess seeing eyes, behold the countenance of the Beloved manifest in the marketplace. Kindle the fire of knowledge and flee from the ignorant. This is the word of the Lord of the worlds. O servants! The body without spirit is dead, and the heart without the remembrance of God is withered. Therefore commune ye with the Friend and shun the enemy. Your enemy is those things which ye have acquired of your own desire and have cherished, and wherewith ye have defiled your souls. The soul is for the remembrance of the Beloved - keep it pure. The tongue is for the testimony of God - sully it not with mention of the wayward. O servants! I speak in truth: the truthful one is he who hath beheld the straight path - and that path is one, which the Lord hath chosen and made ready. This path among all paths is like the sun among the stars. Whoso hath not attained unto this path is unaware and astray. This is the word of the peerless Lord, the incomparable One. O servants! The world is the abode of demons - keep yourselves from approaching them. The demons are the wayward ones who lie in the sleep of heedlessness with corrupt deeds. Their sleep is sweeter than wakefulness, and their death more attractive than life. O servants! Not every body possesseth a spirit, nor every frame a soul. Today he possesseth a spirit whose body hath set out for the precincts of the Beloved. The end of every beginning is today - blind not yourselves. The one true Friend is near - make not yourselves remote. O servants! Your bodies are as saplings in a garden, and from lack of water are nearly withered. Therefore freshen them with the heavenly water flowing from the clouds of divine bounty. Words must be followed by deeds. Whoso accepteth the words of the Friend is a man of deeds - otherwise a corpse is better than he. O servants! Sweet is the word of the Friend - where is he who will find it, and where is the ear that will hear it? Blessed is he who today joineth with the Friend and in His path forsaketh and turneth away from all else save Him, that he may behold a new world and attain to the everlasting paradise. The Lord of the worlds declareth: O servants! Abandon your desires and seek that which I have desired for you. Travel not the way without a guide, nor accept every guide's words. Many guides are themselves astray and have not found the right path. A guide is one who is free from the bonds of the world and whom nothing preventeth from speaking the truth. O servants! Practice truthfulness, turn not away from the destitute, make mention of Me before the great ones, and fear not. O servants! Be pure in your deeds and follow the word of your Lord. This is the utterance of the one true God.

He is the Manifest One upon His Most Glorious Throne and this is the Hidden One in His Most Exalted Kingdom

O Beauty of Bounty, at this veil's door stand

That from thyself a hundred suns may grand

The Power of God Most Glorious is thy might

God's Most Exalted Face upon thy sight doth land

The green leaf which bore luminous signs arrived upon the crimson earth, and the detail of inability regarding numerous matters is the content of this famous poem, which appeared in the form of a bird speaking in a language from whose certain allusions it is understood that: O nightingales of fidelity, know ye that the dark ravens who through divine confirmations and teachings of the Hand of Grace and royal training learned the melodies and ways of the spiritual falcons, and through manifestation of the whistles of the divine dove's songs soared in the lofty atmospheres of the Most High, and with the throats of the most glorious birds ascended until they rose up from the stations of nearness to holy eternity and found their dwelling and rest upon the highest branches of the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary and the Furthermost Tree, and became so renowned and well-known in that divine holy retreat that all the holy predetermined birds of the highest paradise and the most impregnable spirits beyond the pavilions of eternity circled round about them. Then at this time the fire of pride and arrogance blazed up in their hearts and their lofty station became the cause of their exaggeration regarding the Beauty of the All-Knowing King, and their sublime rank became the cause of rancor and hatred, completely forgetting their Sovereign and Educator, mounting the throne's seat and attacking the countenance of the Most Glorious King, each wounding that luminous face with their beaks and claws, and not content with this, finding allies with utmost effort and striving, they arose to destroy that Beauty of Majesty. Such were the melodies of this bird which at that time was suspended before Me and had a cage with golden sides and upon its face a mirror of white crystal and it had two small chicks who were singing notes that no birds know their tune, not even the bird that was their mother, and God knows what they were saying as they sang with secret melodies.

Therefore now, O Manifestation of the Name of Bounty of my Lord, if thou wishest to aid thy Lord Who hath been afflicted beneath the swords of rancor and hatred, then cry out with such a cry as to rend asunder all the veils of idle fancies from the hearts of all who are in the heavens and earth, and free the birds of holy hearts from the chains and bonds of limitation and imitation, causing them to soar in the atmosphere of divine unity and detachment, and afterwards speak with holy throat and spiritual melody that there hath appeared that Secret which in Its first manifestation did not utter a single letter of Its pure mysteries such that the three hundred companions who were among the detached essences of the earth all fled and said that "In another cycle will I appear and make manifest the mystery of My Cause" and all the Sinaites would die at that manifestation. Now that cycle hath returned and that Secret hath appeared and all the holy essences of the heaven's kingdom and the people of the highest concourse and the cherubim and bearers of the throne and the near-stationed angels have all been struck unconscious from the manifestation of this wondrous Cause and have perished in the lowest earth, and all the realities of the Prophets and Messengers, one of whom was Moses son of Imran, died on the Mount of the glorious Cause at the appearance of the sublime Mystery, and from another direction the tree of rejection with leaves and branches of infidelity and association and rancor hath grown tall before the throne and desired to uproot the Most Glorious Tree which is firmly established upon the axis of eternity, and to cover it with leaves of hatred and envy. Say: By God the Truth, that Tree is not in a station that ye are able to cover it even if there were to gather with you the hands of the people of the heavens with mighty power and great strength. Say: Ye shall die and become nonexistent or be struck unconscious or return to the lowest hell. Verily it hath been raised up in truth and soon shall a single leaf thereof fill all paradise and all who are in the heavens and earths, and beneath the shade of each leaf shall be sent forth flashes that the sight of all creatures combined hath not beheld.

O Haydar-'Ali, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God!

In My Name, through which light shone forth before the creation of earth and heaven! How excellent are the tribulations that have befallen the Wronged One in the path of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. In truth, tribulation in the path of the Peerless Beloved has been and ever will be beloved. The word of Jacob appeared after tribulation, and the Tongue of Grandeur gave it utterance. Glory be to God! Greed and avarice have reached such a state that pen and tongue are powerless and incapable of describing it. What was mentioned in Akhtar bears witness to the falsehood of its speaker, for he wrote that they had taken from me a document stating that all I possess belongs to the Afnan. This is his confession, yet afterward he says that document is now void and invalid. This second statement, being without proof or evidence, is and has ever been invalid in the eyes of the just. They have sold the Joseph of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, for a few dirhams. They have strayed from the path of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.

Your letters sent in the name of Jud, upon him be My glory, were perused. Tablets were specifically revealed and dispatched for some. Ask of God to transform the Most Great Prison. Glory be to God! The love of the friends and loved ones for Muhammad-'Ali is evident and clear, and most are aware of it. Nevertheless, he has united with one like himself and they have fabricated calumnies for the sake of the possessions of the servants. And now they cry out that the wealth has been stolen and they have set about to subvert the Cause of God.

Say: My God, my God! Through Thy loftiness, Thy transcendence, Thy glory and Thy power, transform the harm that hath befallen Thy loved ones at the hands of Thine enemies. Thou seest and knowest, O my God, what they have done and what they have said. They have cast behind them Thy commandments and Thy laws, and have taken what was forbidden them in Thy Book, out of love for earthly ornaments, both ancient and new. O Lord! Seize them through Thy might and power that they may awaken and return unto Thee. Verily Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.

Convey My greetings to the loved ones in all lands. Say: The Day of deeds hath come, the Day of victory, the Day of steadfastness. Beware lest the utterances of the idolaters or the words of the misguided grieve you. Every year a certain person from Kaf has written a book repudiating the Blessed and Goodly Tree, and likewise other heedless souls from every quarter have produced books of rejection and pages of repudiation, clear and evident. However, in the eyes of those endowed with insight, these matters have been and continue to be the cause of the spread of the Cause of God. Do the calumnies of the people hinder it? Nay, by His very Self! Do the threats of today frighten it? Nay, by His light through which earth and heaven were illumined!

It is hoped that they may be like the surging ocean and the radiant sun. Let them ponder the blessed verse revealed aforetime and hold fast unto it: Say: God; then leave them to their vain disputations. A most mighty and holy Tablet specifically for Mirza Hasan, in the handwriting of the Most Great Branch, which thou didst request, was sent. If, after perusing it, it remains with 'Ali, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, this is most beloved.

Before the faces of princes and divines, We have, with the pen of justice and utterance, struck at the swords of tyranny and rebellion, and We have been and continue to be like a brilliant and manifest light. Should the entire world unite and rise up to harm the Truth, it would be and is absolute nothingness. Verily, We fear no one. We proclaim with the most exalted call: The appointed time hath come, and the Lord of Names and Attributes hath come from the heaven of the Command with the banners of signs.

Today they must drink, with perfect certitude and assurance, from the choice wine of the utterance of the Goal of all the worlds. This hallowed wine has been and ever will be free from intoxication, and bestows eternal joy and everlasting delight. Take it in My name and for love of Me, despite My enemies who denied God's proof and evidence after their confession, and whom earthly ornaments so deluded as to prevent them from turning to the splendors of the Face, from holding fast to the Most Great Announcement, and from turning toward the Straight Path of God.

The glory that shineth resplendent from the horizon of God's Tablet be upon thee and upon those who love thee and hearken to thy words concerning this mighty Cause. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and Power!

Praise be to the Adored One Who, in every age and century, nay rather in every year and month, even in every hour and minute, awakens His servants through signs, tokens and allusions. As is evident, at every moment He appears in a new guise, and in every instant a new matter becomes manifest and an event occurs. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who sent down the Criterion unto them while they were in doubt concerning a new creation. Some are awakened and become aware of divine intentions, their awareness increasing, while others grow more heedless. In these days, were one to find hearing, every created thing would inform man of the mighty events and grievous trials which are the consequences of deeds, and would, in most eloquent language, make him aware. How many a stone hath melted from the fear of God, and how many a servant laugheth and playeth until chastisement seizeth him from every direction. And peace and blessings be upon the Point of Existence and the Manifestation of the Adored One, through Whom the world was glorified, and upon His family and companions who broke not God's Covenant and His testament, and who sacrificed themselves in His path for the exaltation of His Cause and the manifestation of His sovereignty.

Thereafter, it is submitted that the beloved of the heart, his honor Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be the Glory of God, mentioned you, and likewise forwarded the letter you had sent to this evanescent one. Praise be to God, it indicated your honor's love. We beseech God to assist and enable your honor in all conditions. After perusing the letter, it was submitted to His presence, and He commanded that your departure is necessary, and the sooner you hasten, the more advisable it would be, for in these parts the weather is unsettled and there are many people. Therefore, the sooner you proceed to the direction of the physician, upon him be His glory, the more beloved it is and has been. Be not grieved at not attaining His presence, for you have previously attained it many times. God willing, may you ever remain under the glances of God's favor and be enabled to do that which He loveth and approveth. Say: Make resolution thy right hand, and prudence thy left hand, and reliance upon God the crown of thy head, and wisdom before thy face, then journey forth. This is nearer unto righteousness.

We have sent unto the physician, upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness, that from which every seeker hath found the fragrance of his Beloved's garment, and every pursuer the sweet scent of his Goal. Ask God to assist him to serve His Cause and to remain steadfast in that whereby the feet of the servants have slipped, save those whom God hath willed, the Lord of the worlds. We send Our prayers and glorification upon him who hath loved Me and turned unto My face, and upon thee, and upon those who have fulfilled their covenant and acted according to what they were commanded in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

God willing, your honor will proceed, trusting in God and committing all affairs unto Him. Convey my utter servitude and nothingness to the beloved of the soul, the honored physician, upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness, and likewise to his honor the imprisoned one, upon him be the Glory of God, and to Muhammad Surur Effendi and others, upon them be the Glory of God. God willing, may all be engaged in His praise and mention, purely for the sake of God. These are days wherein a thousand sorrows appear at every moment, all being the results of deeds and actions. Matters have reached such a pass that the Islamic nation, which was the most powerful, greatest, most perfect and most rightful of all nations, has manifested such weakness that every person of conscience, every person of fairness, and every person of heart lamenteth over it. Verily, sighs ascend and tears descend, but most of the people are in evident delusion. They have not yet awakened and have not perceived the cause and reason for the afflictions. This evanescent non-existence beseecheth the True One, exalted be His glory, to enable us all. Verily, He is powerful over what He willeth. Peace and glory be upon your honor and upon God's sincere servants.

In His name, exalted be His glory! Wisdom and Utterance!

Praise be to the Lord of Bounty and the Sovereign of existence, Who is worthy and deserving, for in the sending of Messengers and the revelation of Books, His purpose in the primal degree hath been none other than the knowledge of His sacred Being and the unity of hearts and souls. Through one word revealed from the horizon of the Mother Book, the Path was made manifest and the decree of reckoning became evident, the cry was raised and the call of the trumpet encompassed all, and the mountains were set in motion - glorified be His grandeur and His might, His sovereignty and His power, and His all-pervading Word and dominion.

O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! The Name of Bounty hath sent thy letter and mentioned thee. We make mention of thee in this perspicuous Tablet, from which the unitarians perceive the fragrance of the utterance of God, the Lord of the worlds. We bear witness that thou didst turn to Him in the early days and didst attain, and didst acknowledge God and His verses, His Manifestation, His power, His grandeur, and His glory. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid thee in thy latter days as He aided thee in thy early days. Verily, He is the One Whose command is to be obeyed and the One Who is praised in His judgment. Thou hast ever been remembered and hast attained unto boundless grace and favor and the Most Great Mercy. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee. Say:

My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having mentioned me in Thy Most Great Prison, and guided me to Thy Most Straight Path, and illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and mine eyes with the light of meeting Thee. I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, by Thy Command which hath encompassed all things, and by Thy Power which hath prevailed over all who are in earth and heaven, and by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance and the effulgences of the luminary of Thy laws, to make me in all conditions one who speaketh Thy praise, who standeth to serve Thee, and who acknowledgeth that which hath been sent down from the heaven of Thy knowledge. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Compelling over all who are in the heavens and the earths. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

O thou who art present at this moment before the throne of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment! We have sent down for every name among names that which hath caused the solid rock to take flight, let alone bodies and frames. Give glad tidings unto My loved ones of My grace, My care, and My mercy which have preceded My earth and My heaven, and the light of My care which hath shone forth from the horizon of My bounty.

O Nabil-i-Qa'in! The Ship amidst the waves maketh mention of thee, and the Lamp amidst the winds is occupied with the mention of them who love God, glorified be His majesty. The idolaters and oppressors have wrought that which hath caused the Eye of Truth to weep and the Tablet to cry out and the Pen to swoon. When it recovered, it clung to the hem of mercy and said:

Have mercy on Thy servants, O Most Merciful of the merciful! Then conceal the evil of their imaginings, O Thou the Goal of the hearts of them that know Thee! I testify that Thy mercy hath preceded all created things and Thy grace hath encompassed all existing things. All affairs are in the grasp of Thy power, and the ocean of forgiveness is before Thy face, and the luminary of bounty and riches is in the right hand of Thy will. O Concealer! I beseech Thee by Thy chosen Name, and O All-Patient! I entreat Thee by the pearls of Thy love in the hearts of the chosen ones, to adorn the temples of Thy servants with the raiment of righteousness and fear of God. Verily, Thou art the Generous, possessed of great bounty. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

We wish to make mention of thy son, whose mention hath attained the honor of being heard at this moment when the Tongue of Grandeur speaketh in His Most Great Prison. Glory and majesty belong unto God, the Lord of the worlds. O Ismail! From the Friend hath wafted the fragrance of detachment in such wise as to astonish the Concourse on High and those who circle round the Throne of God, the Almighty. Leave the world to its people and take hold of the Book with such strength as cannot be hindered by the ranks of the slanderers. Blessed art thou, for thy name hath been sent down from the Tongue of God, the Speaker, the True, the Faithful. Say:

Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having guided me unto Thy Most Great Name and illumined my heart with the light of Thy manifest Cause.

O Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Ni'mat'u'llah in this exalted station, then send down upon him that which will cause the sweet savors of the loving-kindness of his Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous, to be diffused. We beseech God to exalt thee through His Name and to ordain for thee that which will draw thee nigh unto Him at all times. Glory and splendor, grandeur and praise be upon thee and upon the assured servants of God.

O friends of God! In the name of the King of the horizons! Praise be to the Beloved in His absolute sovereignty, Who through His all-embracing grace and all-encompassing mercy made His loved ones steadfast in His love, to such a degree that the dissension of the contentious ones did not prevent them from following the path of the All-Merciful, and they have borne hardships in the path of God, and have not remained veiled from the Lord of Lords by the might of the possessed or the veils of kings. However, had the seekers of the Ka'bih of the All-Merciful hearkened with their inner ears to the counsel of God, they would not have been afflicted with these tribulations. Although tribulation in His path is beloved to the soul and the desire of the spirit, this station is reserved for the sincere ones, while the weak are seen to be disturbed and shaken in times of tests and trials. Therefore, all are commanded to observe wisdom, that through divine prudence they may cause immature human realities to ascend to the heights of maturity, so that all may be engaged in His remembrance.

Today, no one should be heedless of wisdom. For example, it is observed that some become so assured by a word of acceptance from someone that they mention all matters without any restraint. This is sheer heedlessness. Never be assured by anyone, and speak not beyond their station and capacity. Many souls have been appointed by satanic souls merely to investigate and spy, that they might, in the guise of friendship, become informed of the secrets of the friends. Even as in certain cities some have feigned friendship and, having learned the details of matters, have informed their kind. Hearken unto the call of the Most Exalted Pen and depart not from wisdom. Permission has not been given for anyone to turn to this direction without leave.

The friends of Truth in all lands must act in unity, in such wise that no trace of disagreement may remain between them. They are neither of Sad nor of Kaf nor of aught else. They are the dwellers of the pavilion of faithfulness and the companions of the Most Glorious Paradise. Let them efface these differing letters and soar in the spiritual atmosphere of unity, and drink from the stream of Sad which floweth from the right hand of the Throne of Unity. The favors of God have been and will be with you. Ere long shall the souls who have oppressed the people of Baha be observed in utter remorse. Verily, the All-Merciful is with you and loss shall be unto them. You are the captives of God in the land. This is a great station; account it not small. Ere long shall your mention and that of the other friends of Truth be spread throughout all regions of the earth, even as now your names are mentioned in the divine Kingdom.

O My friends! You are the foundations of the houses of the Cause. If the foundations be not firm, the houses will not endure. And you are the wellsprings of the earth of knowledge. If the source be muddy, it will spread to all the divergent streams, and all will become turbid. My Son aforetime said to His companions: "Ye are the salt of the earth; but if the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men." Your acceptance, detachment and orientation should attract those on earth and draw them to the arena of eternal life. And those souls who have become disturbed and anxious in this greatest turmoil, treat them with the utmost kindliness and love, and guide them to the divine pathway through goodly exhortation, for God hath not wished that any soul should remain deprived, especially those who have become the target of vilification and humiliation in the path of God, even though it be for but an hour. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.

Assured, powerful and steadfast souls have been and will be rarer than the philosopher's stone. Such souls must not leave these weak ones to themselves, but must draw them anew to eternal life through divine utterances. Blessed are they who keep in mind the service and care of the friends of God, even as some have attained to this station and have shown love to the emigrants and friends according to their means. God willing, may all attain to this exalted station. The reward of no deed shall be lost. Verily, He is aware of what His loved ones do. He is the All-Wise, the All-Informed.

Here is O \`Abdu'llah! By the life of God, the delay in mentioning \[you\] is due to the abundance of writing \[to be done\]. Time is lacking and opportunity is not apparent. The Command is in the hand of God, the Mighty, the Loving. That which was mentioned in the letter diffused the fragrance of the love of the Forgiving Lord. We praise God, blessed and exalted be He, for having assisted thee in the early days, and caused thee to recognize His path, His proof, His signs and His clear tokens, and showed thee His traces and made thee hear His call.

O \`Abdu'llah! The divine Books have each been a herald, summoning the people to the Truth, and have been specifically sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will for guidance. His word, blessed and exalted be He, is: "Alif. Lam. Mim. This is the Book; there is no doubt in it, a guidance to the God-fearing." Ask thou of God that He may assist His servants, that all may attain to that for which they were created from nothingness. The world and its vanishing things have prevented \[men\] from drawing nigh \[unto God\]. We beseech God to unveil for His servants that which is now concealed.

O \`Abdu'llah! The pillars in the lands of the people of Divine Unity are shaken. No one is aware of the cause and reason thereof. Until now the earthquake of the Hour hath not subsided. Soon shall its effects be seen. In any case, thou and the other people of Divine Unity should implore preservation from God, exalted be His glory, and petition for victory and triumph, that perchance the calamity of the ancestors may not overtake their posterity, and that which existeth may endure. We beseech the True One, the Knower of things unseen, to assist the kings to act with justice and fairness. Verily, He hath power over all things. Affairs are hidden and concealed in the treasury of Divine knowledge.

When thou receivest My letter and findest the fragrance of My utterance, say: "My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me and taught me the word of Thy unity, and caused me to know Thy Beloved and His station through which Thou hast revealed Thy Cause and made clear Thy path, and given me to drink, from the hands of Thy bounty, the cup of Thy bestowal. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning away from all else but Thee, advancing toward Thee, and hoping for the wonders of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Signs, which Thou hast made the Manifestation of Thy Supreme Paradise and Thy Most Exalted Heaven, and by the pearls of the shells of the sea of Thy wisdom, to make me steadfast in Thy love and firm in Thy Cause, and clinging to Thy cord under all conditions. Thou art verily the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. O my Lord! Ordain for me and for those who love Thee the good of the world to come and of this world. Verily Thou art the All-Merciful, the Bountiful. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."

Praise be to God, thou hast ever been and art still remembered. His honor Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin, upon him be My glory, hath mentioned and continueth to mention thee. Convey My greetings to Jinab-i-\`Abdu'l-Mahdi. Say: "Thy letter was seen. Praise be to God, thou hast repeatedly been the recipient of \[divine\] favor. We beseech God to assist thee and confirm thee and enable thee to do that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily He is the Lord of creation and the Lord of the mighty throne." Remember on behalf of the Wronged One those who are related \[to thee\] and the loved ones, and counsel all to patience and steadfastness, trustworthiness and godliness, and righteousness. It is hoped that all will hold fast to the divine Book and act according to it.

His honor Mir Muhammad Husayn Beg, upon him be the Glory of God

He is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed

Praise, sanctified above the recognition of all created things and the comprehension of all beings, beseemeth the court of that Desired One Who hath adorned the hearts of them that are nigh, of the sincere ones and of the believers in divine unity, with the seal of "Verily I am God's." He is the Lord of verses Who, with the banners of clear proofs from the horizon of the heaven of "He doeth what He willeth," directed His steps toward the realm of creation and suffered Himself to be afflicted and saddened by the vain imaginings of the weak ones of the world. The deniers of the Bayan emerged from behind the veil like wolves and sought to attack the Lord of all men. They said that which caused the dwellers of Paradise to lament and did that which caused the clouds to cry out.

Thy letter which thou didst send to this servant attained the presence and was honored to be heard before the Face. We make mention in this station of My handmaiden and My leaf, the Mother of Muhajir - upon her be My glory and My loving-kindness and My mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth. O My handmaiden! By the life of God, thy mention hath never ceased in the Most Holy Court; thou hast ever been and art remembered. This is from the loving-kindness and bounty of thy Lord which hath encompassed thee. Be grateful and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art wronged throughout all regions, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who art imprisoned in the hands of the heedless. Thou hast chosen exile and imprisonment for Thyself to free the necks of Thy servants. I testify that Thou art the Ancient Bestower and that Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful."

And We make mention of him who was named Abdullah, who hath ascended to the Supreme Companion that he may find the sweet savors of his Lord's loving-kindness and be among the successful ones. O Abdullah! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of creation, and the Glory of the Most Exalted Paradise and the Supreme Heaven, and the Glory of those who hastened to the Supreme Horizon and attained the presence of the Face and heard the Call from the Most Glorious Horizon and circled round the Throne at eventide and at dawn. Therefore, O my God, send down upon him at every moment a mercy from Thee and a blessing from Thy presence, and ordain for him that which beseemeth Thy generosity and Thy bounty and Thy bestowal. Verily, Thou art the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.

O Abbas-Ali! Hear My call time and again. We have named thee "the Helper in the Day of Judgment" as a grace from God, the Lord of the worlds. Thus hath thy name flowed from the Most Exalted Pen in this lofty station. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this most great favor and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Beloved of them that know." The Glory be upon thee and upon thy wife and thy son. Remember them on My behalf and give them the glad-tidings of My remembrance and My loving-kindness, that they may rejoice in the days of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

And We make mention of Muhammad, son of him who attained on the day when all things proclaimed: "The Kingdom and the Realm and the Exaltation and the Might belong unto God, the Lord of Lords." O Muhammad! Hear the call of the Wronged One. He counseleth thee and those who have believed to justice and fairness and to that whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of all men, may be exalted. Say: "Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for that Thy Pen hath moved to make mention of me. I beseech Thee by the power of Thy Will and the manifestations of Thy might to make me steadfast and firm in Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Choosing." We hear the call of My loved ones and We see what they have done in My path, and I am the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We beseech God to assist thee in all conditions to serve His firm and mighty Cause.

O Muhammad Husayn! Upon thee be My Glory. We have made mention of those who have turned to the Face and responded when the Call was raised between earth and heaven. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath attained unto acceptance when every heedless doubter turned away. Put thy trust in God in all matters. Verily, He is with His chosen servants. That which thou didst send hath been received before Us as a token of grace from Us. Verily, thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Take My Book through My power, then act according to what hath been revealed therein. Verily, thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

O Wahhab! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Lords. We have made mention of every name that was in the Book as a bounty from God, the Revealer of verses. Give thanks unto God for that He hath turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison and hath revealed for thee that which shall never be exhausted. Thus have We set forth the verses and sent them that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Sender of winds. We made mention of thy father before and at this time with a mention whereby the hearts of the righteous have been attracted. The Glory be upon My loved ones and My chosen ones who broke not the Covenant and the Testament on the day when the Desired One came with power and sovereignty.

O Ali-Qabli-Haydar, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Destiny! He is God, exalted be His station, the Lord of Wisdom and Utterance!

Praise be to the One desired by the world, Who, in the Most Great Prison, hath spoken and made mention of that which attracteth and draweth the peoples. The acceptance or rejection of the servants, and the opposition and denial of the dwellers of the earth, have not prevented Him from His pervading Will and all-encompassing Purpose. By the command of the Lord of existence, He hath spoken before all faces that which hath been the cause of the exaltation of the world and the sanctification of the peoples.

O Ali-Qabli-Haydar! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Thou hast ever been and art still mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and before the Desired One. Verily, He is with thee under all conditions. Soon there shall appear in the earth that which hath been ordained for thee from My Most Exalted Pen, and the tongues of all beings shall speak of thy remembrance, thy praise, thy service, thy acceptance, and thy rising up in the Cause of thy Lord. By the life of God! Whatsoever hath flowed from the Pen hath been and shall be manifested, letter by letter.

Tablets were previously sent in the name of him who was imprisoned for My sake, and to the loved ones. That which hath not reached him, read ye, that ye may become aware of its contents, and afterward deliver them to His Eminence Jim, the Name of God, that he may be informed of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of his Lord, the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing. And if possible, let them be given to the imprisoned Wronged One Himself - this would be acceptable and beloved in the sight of God.

O thou who hast arisen to serve My Cause! Blessed is Ibn-i-Abhar, for the sweet savors of joy and delight are evident from his condition and manifest from his letter. In the Tablet of the world, this most exalted Word hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen: O friends! Why this fear, and from whom this dread? The clay fragments of the world disintegrate with but a little moisture. The very act of gathering together causeth the dispersal of deluded souls. Conflict and contention are the attributes of the beasts of the field. Through the aid of the Lord, the sharp swords of the Babi community have been returned to their sheaths through goodly words and praiseworthy deeds. The righteous have ever conquered the cities of existence through their utterance.

Say: O friends! Let not wisdom slip from your grasp. Hearken with the ear of understanding to the counsels of the Most Exalted Pen. All the peoples of the world must be free from the harm of your hands and tongues. By clay fragments are meant those souls who, until now, have not understood the purpose of this Wronged One and are seen to be under the control of self and passion. Blessed are My friends and loved ones, for no unseemly act was manifested by them in the days of clamor.

If the Daysprings of the Cause and the Dawning-Places of judgment be not mindful in these days, they shall become mindful thereafter. We beseech God - and do ye beseech Him - that He may adorn His Majesty the King (may God assist him) and likewise the Amir'ul-Umara with the ornament of justice and fairness. The glory of existence lieth in justice, not in oppression. At present, falsehood and vainglory have prevented the world and its peoples from turning to the Truth. Soon shall come a day wherein God will raise up His patient and beneficent servants.

Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having remembered Thy servants in the prison when I was in the hands of the heedless. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the power of Thy Cause to preserve Thy loved ones with the hosts of the seen and the unseen. Then send down upon them from the clouds of Thy mercy and the heaven of Thy generosity the rains of Thy bounty and Thy gifts. O Lord! Disappoint not Thy chosen ones of the wonders of Thy grace and favor, and the manifestations of Thy bestowals and loving-kindness. Thou art He Whom the might of those who have broken Thy Covenant and Testament, who have disputed Thy signs, and who have denied Thy proof and Thy evidence, hath not hindered. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy utterance and its waves, and by the pearls hidden in its shells, to aid Thy servants to achieve the Most Great Steadfastness, whereby the hosts of the earth and their ranks shall not cause them to slip, nor shall their clamor and roaring frighten them. Verily, Thou art He through Whose power all created things have testified, and through Whose grandeur all possible things have borne witness. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.

The blessings and peace and the light shining from the horizon of the Abode of Peace be upon Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones who have taken hold of Thy Book with a power from Thee and a sovereignty from Thy presence. Verily, Thou art the most powerful of the powerful and the most merciful of the merciful. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Praise be to the Peerless Object of all desire, Who deserveth all praise and glory, for through the tokens of His Pen He hath subdued the kingdoms of earth and heaven. The clamor raised in places of darkness held Him not back from His purpose, nor did the calumnies of the people and the opposition of the hypocrites prevent His loved ones from turning unto Him. Through His most exalted Word He summoned the peoples of the nether world to the Dayspring of grace and bounty. Exalted be His might and supreme His sovereignty! He is the One, the Single, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.

O Siyyid Kazim! The servant who is present hath received thy letter which thou didst send unto him and laid it before His face. We have answered thee with that which God hath made a light in the darkness of the earth, and a Kawthar of life for the people of understanding, and the Most Great Medicine for the healing of the nations, and the hosts of power and might for His loved ones who were created to assist His Cause through wisdom and utterance. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken from this station which hath been named the Most Great Prison and by the most beautiful names, as a token of His grace. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. We have sent down the verses and manifested the Cause unto people who understand.

O thou who hast turned towards Me! We have found in thy letter the sweet savors of thy love and the fragrance of thy devotion, thy humility and thy submissiveness. Blessed art thou, and blessed thy tongue and thy pen. Thy Lord, verily, is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word "Be" and it is. We bear witness that thy mention hath attained the honor of acceptance before God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen.

In all conditions the cry of the Wronged One is raised, mentioning His loved ones in that which conduceth to their exaltation. He is the All-Bountiful, the Bestower, the Compassionate. That which beseemeth His loved ones today is steadfastness, for some of the servants are weak: at the mere mention of a name they falter or turn away. Say: O people of the Bayan! By God, I have laid no claim to any matter, nor to any name. Fear ye God and follow not those who cling to the idols of names and are of them that turn aside.

Say: My God, my God! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, clinging fast to Thee and to Thy verses. I beseech Thee by the treasures of Thy earth which come forth through Thy Name to manifest Thy Cause and exalt Thy Word, that Thou assist me and Thy loved ones in that which leadeth to the sanctification of Thy Being and the glorification of Thine Essence. Then assist me, O my God, with such steadfastness as cannot be hindered by hosts or ranks. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Glorious, the Best-Beloved.

O Siyyid Kazim! Thou hast attained unto that whose fragrance shall never cease and shall endure through the eternity of the divine names. His honor Siyyid Javad, upon him be My glory and My loving-kindness, hath also mentioned thee. He is among those who turned towards Me in the early days, who attained Our presence and circumambulated the spot round which circle the Concourse on High. God willing, thou shalt, through wisdom and utterance, make the servants aware and guide them to the divine law. Praise be to God, His grace hath encompassed all: thou hast both attained this Tablet and art engaged in serving the Afnan of the Sacred Tree. We beseech God to assist him and thee to mention and praise Him with the wisdom We have sent down in a mighty Tablet. We make mention of thy mother, thy handmaiden, and give her the glad-tidings of her Lord's loving-kindness, and We ask Him to draw her nigh unto Him in all conditions. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

We make mention at this moment of thy brother whose name beginneth with ?a and Sin, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful. O ?a! Hearken unto the Call from the Supreme Horizon in the Prison of 'Akka. God - there is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have manifested the Cause despite every stubborn tyrant and sinful calumniator. Neither the weapons of the world nor the hosts of the nations hindered Us. We have revealed what We desired before all faces through a power that hath conquered all and a sovereignty that hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth.

O Siyyid ?adiq! Thy name hath been presented before the Wronged One. We have mentioned thee with My Most Great Remembrance. Blessed art thou and blessed are they whom neither the doubts of the divines nor the signs of those who have denied the Day of Judgment have prevented. Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Throne and by the influence of Thy Word, to assist Thy loved ones in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with, and to unite their hearts through Thy Most Great Name, the Most Glorious. Thou art the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust beneath. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

Birjind. O Ahmad, who hath attained! He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. A remembrance from Us unto him who hath sought the Most Exalted Station and traversed land and sea until he arrived at the luminous Dome, the Station wherein was raised the call of the Lord of Names and the Creator of Heaven. By the life of God! He entered and attained unto that which was recorded in the Books and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets. O Ahmad! Give thanks unto God for having aided thee and prospered thee and granted thee His presence, which nothing in the Kingdom or in the Realm of Might can equal. To this testifieth the Tongue of the All-Merciful in the Kingdom of Utterance. We bear witness that thou wast present and didst hear and recognize that which most of the servants were prevented from recognizing. We have revealed for each one whom thou didst mention in the presence of the Countenance a Tablet that hath testified to God's grace and loving-kindness. Blessed art thou and blessed is every servant whom the oppression of those who denied the Beginning and the Return hath not deterred. We showed thee Our horizon and caused thee to hear Our call and aided thee to accomplish a deed before which all deeds bow down. Grieve not for what hath befallen thee. There hath befallen Us in the path of God that which caused the rocks to cry out and the trees to lament. We were with him at the time of his ascension. By My life! The Concourse on High welcomed him and found from him the fragrance of his Lord, the All-Glorious. Thus was the matter decreed by God, the Lord of Lords. He fulfilled God's Covenant and His Testament and testified to that whereunto God had testified before all things: that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Chosen One.

The Light shining from the horizon of the heaven of grace and the fragrance wafting from the garment of the Dayspring of justice be upon thee, O thou who hast believed in God and His signs and who didst migrate in His path until thou didst attain unto that which was hidden in God's knowledge and inscribed in His books. To this testifieth He with Whom is the Mother Book. We bear witness that thou didst hear the Call and didst answer thy Lord and didst turn unto Him, despite those who cast the verses behind their backs and denied God when He came with power and sovereignty. Upon thee be My glory and the glory of those in My Kingdom and the glory of those in the pavilion of My grandeur and the glory of every steadfast one whom the power of princes hath not weakened, who arose and proclaimed: "God is our Lord and the Lord of the earth and the heavens!"

O Ahmad! Praise thou the Beloved of the worlds Who hath aided thee in that which was mentioned in His Book and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen. At the beginning of Our imprisonment We sacrificed a Branch from the Branches for a matter none knoweth save God, thy Lord. The world hath no worth, neither had it any. That Branch, in the prime of youth, laid down his life and sought another station. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of inner meanings that were there to be revealed less than a needle's eye of thy son's station who ascended unto God, all would fall unconscious with joy. The world must be left to heedless nations. A station whereof all things have testified to its transience is not, and hath never been, worthy of attachment. Pure, detached, and tranquil souls especially yearn to take flight at all times, yet they remain patient for a few days in accordance with the requirements of consummate wisdom. The Command is in His hand and authority is in His grasp. Be not grieved. The Truth hath been and is with thee. With utmost joy and delight, occupy thyself with the service of the Truth in these fleeting days. Verily He speaketh the truth and guideth to the Path, and He is the Mighty, the Beauteous.

Convey My greetings to the friends and gladden them with God's loving-kindness. The promised Tablets were sent with Jinab-i-Amin, that is, Abu'l-Hasan, upon him be the glory of God. God willing, those worthy of them shall attain unto them and drink from the living waters of the All-Merciful's utterance. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee. Today is not a day of grief. Let not time slip away. Thou hast been and art remembered in the Most Holy Court. I counsel My loved ones to deal with the heedless people with wisdom. God's mercy hath preceded His wrath. Speak according to the requirements thereof. People are like earth - some barren, some blessed. If good soil is found, the planting of the tree of inner meanings and utterance is permitted; otherwise silence is preferable. The glory which is manifest, evident, and shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon My loved ones who have held fast to My firm cord.

In the name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Invincible, the Most Glorious! The mercy of God from the Primal Point hath verily descended in the form of words in the Tablets by virtue of truth. Well is it with the soul whom God hath not deprived thereof, and who hath tasted the sweetness of the remembrance of God, the Most Great, in these words which have issued from the mouth of God in truth. Verily it is the Most Great Sign in the Concourse on High, and the burning fire in the Tree of Eternity, and the glorious fruits upon the Tree of the Cloud, and the Ark of Eternity upon the Sea of Grandeur, and the Dawning-Place of the Command in the depths of the Names, and the Rising-Place of Light amidst the company of creation. Yet the people have remained heedless thereof and have deprived themselves of the melodies of God.

O servant! Bear thou witness that these are words which the Ancient Beauty hath sent down from the heaven of grace, and through them He maketh mention of thee that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and tread the paths of glory. Cast aside what thou possessest, then take the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him and the might that emanateth from His presence, and follow not every rejected satan. Follow thou the way of God and His command, then turn thy face toward the All-Merciful, that the lights of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, may take hold of thee and transform thee unto a station of sanctified love.

When the Tablet of God reacheth thee, place it upon thy head, then read what hath been revealed therein with such melodies as shall attract every praised and receptive soul. Beware lest thou be still in the Cause of thy Lord or remain silent in His remembrance. Aid thy Lord, the Bestower, in these days wherein the manifestations of Satan have dispersed from around Him. Thus doth the Pen of God instruct thee, through whose melodies were created the hearts of the Concourse on High and the realities of those who dwell in the Kingdom of Names - thus hath the Command been, if thou be of them that know.

Read thou the words of God in thy days and follow not those who have followed their desires in the days wherein the Ancient Beauty was established upon the throne of His Most Glorious Name by the command of Him Who was witnessed from the holy horizon. Then arise in the Cause of God and remind the people to turn unto the court of His grace and His presence. Say: O people! This is the Ancient Mystery that hath appeared in the temple of Him Who speaketh among you with verses that cause all in the kingdom to be thunderstruck. And if thou art capable within thyself, address the dwellers of the Cloud, then remind them of how this Beauty hath shone forth from a manifest horizon of glory.

By My Beauty, the Truth! Should anyone arise in this Cause and desire to subjugate all created things through a word from His presence, he would be empowered to do so. Thus hath the power of thy Lord encompassed all who are in the worlds. Say: In the name of God, the Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious! Then subjugate what is in thy right hand and what is in thy left hand, then turn thy face toward this Dawning-Place wherefrom the Ancient Beauty was witnessed. Leave the idolaters and what they possess. Verily, We have found some of them upon the hill of turning away, and some upon the hill of questioning, and some upon the hill of hatred, and some upon the hill of ignorance. Thus hath God reckoned their affair in this Tablet which hath been, from time immemorial, sanctified from the touch of the idolaters.

Hold thou fast unto the cord of God, then remain steadfast in His Cause. Take thou no rest in thyself, nor tarry in thy place. Wouldst thou rest while the Temple of God was raised upon the cross of hatred by these idolaters? Oh, what sorrow for the servants who have found rest within themselves while the Ancient Beauty hath been afflicted amidst the company of the hateful ones, and there descendeth upon Him at every moment that which no ear can bear to hear. By this have the hearts of the Concourse on High been consumed, then the hearts of those who dwell within the pavilions of eternity, then what was and what will be, if thou be of them that know.

Guard not thyself in the Cause of God in such wise that the fire of His love should be quenched within thee. Come forth from behind the veils of silence with manifest and glorious utterance. The glory of God be upon thee and upon whosoever hath heard the melodies of God and followed what hath been commanded in truth. Thus hath the sun of wisdom shone forth from the horizon of the mouth of thy Lord, the Most High, if thou be of them that perceive. And praise be to God, the Lord of the heavens and of the earth, and the Lord of all the worlds.

He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious

Pure praise and the essence of glorification befit my Beloved, Who hath ever been sanctified beyond the understanding of the mystics and the descriptions of the learned, and will ever remain exalted above the comprehension of whatsoever beareth a name among all names. All tongues speak His praise and all existence is turned towards His direction; nevertheless, He hath been and will ever be beyond mention and beyond sight, for whatsoever proceedeth from the tongue of creation and is encompassed by the understanding of His servants is contingent, while the Ancient Being hath been and will ever be sanctified beyond renewal and contingency, and exalted beyond allusion and limitation. Through pure bounty and grace He hath been made manifest through the Most Great Name, that all may be illumined by the effulgences of the lights of His Revelation and attain unto the cup of His presence, which hath been interpreted as the meeting with God. We should praise the Truth, exalted be His glory, with a hundred thousand tongues, for He hath accepted the confession, acknowledgment, mention and praise of His servants; otherwise, in truth, every speaker is observed to be speechless and every learned one ignorant. Thoughts cannot know Him, eyes cannot perceive Him, and mention cannot reach Him. He is, verily, the Sanctified, the Exalted, the Inaccessible, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Thereafter, this evanescent servant, by virtue of the deputyship bestowed, hath acted at the beginning of each month--that is to say, in each month he hath attained, in thy stead, the presence of the Beloved of the worlds. We beseech God, exalted and mighty be He, to strengthen thee at all times. He is, verily, the Powerful, the Almighty.

The letter thou didst address to this servant arrived, and its perusal brought the utmost joy. As to what thou hadst written, that "this insignificant atom who was known for patience hath now fallen into such a state that I constantly beseech patience from the Source of grandeur and majesty"--this matter was mentioned in the presence of the Beloved, Who smiled and said: "Praise be to God that thou hast been blessed with divine favors and hast drunk from the Kawthar of meeting. This is a bounty that hath had and shall have no like or equal, for how many were the servants who hoped and yearned to be honored and blessed with this supreme bounty in the Days of God. Yet when the horizon of darkness was illumined by the morning star and the herald of the promised Day appeared, all remained occupied with their own desires and were veiled from the lights of the Sun of Revelation, save those whom thy Lord did choose." Know thou the worth of this station and preserve it in the treasury of thy heart.

God willing, may ye ever be enkindled with the fire of divine love and sustained by the fruits of the tree of patience and resignation. In any case, do not abandon your former ways. If your intimacy with Him hath diminished, He, in view of the former fellowship, will not withdraw His hand from you. Ye should, God willing, be occupied with the utmost joy and fragrance in the remembrance and praise of God, and likewise hold fast to one of the outward professions. It hath been heard that thou hast chosen seclusion. Today is the day of healing and medicine. God willing, treat the chronic diseases of heedless souls with the medicine of divine knowledge, and outward healing is not incompatible with inward healing. Praise be to God, thou art confirmed through divine confirmations. Convey greetings to the friends in that land. We beseech God to preserve the friends of that land from discord, for the harm of discord is beyond reckoning. Although in most divine Tablets the command of love and unity hath been revealed and sent down from the Supreme Pen, nevertheless in some lands they have clung to vain imaginings and have become the cause of discord. However, it is hoped that the friends of that land will be engaged in the remembrance of the Lord of creation with the utmost love and unity, all gazing unto the supreme horizon and acting in accordance with that which hath been revealed in the Tablets, not regarding every speaker as truthful, and clinging to such deeds and actions and character as will cause the upliftment of God's Cause and manifest true humanity. Blessed is he who walketh this straight path. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is the All-Remembering, the All-Explaining, the All-Wise.

God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and He Who speaketh among His servants is indeed the Lord of all creation. Through Him hath streamed from the Most Exalted Pen the Kawthar of immortality, and through Him hath surged the ocean of bounty in the kingdom of creation, and the Sun of grace hath shone forth from the horizon of God's will, the Lord of all men. Through Him were the mysteries revealed, the rivers made to flow, and the trees raised their voices in that which the Tree of Utterance spoke unto Moses, son of 'Imran. Blessed is the soul that hath turned unto Him, the ear that hath heard, and the eye that hath beheld what hath appeared through the Will of God, the Lord of might and power.

O people of God! In this year there hath befallen the Wronged One that which hath caused the dwellers of the Kingdom and the Realm of Glory to lament. We beseech God to adorn His servants with the ornament of justice and fairness, and to enable them to that which beseemeth these days. They who have exchanged trustworthiness for treachery, and godliness for tyranny and corruption - these are among the people of error in the sight of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. And in it the Bird of Inner Meanings hath taken flight unto the Most Exalted Companion and the Most Glorious Horizon, whereby the Most Great Joy was transformed into the Most Great Sorrow, and the tears of the righteous were shed in manifestation of their love and expression of their affection. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to adorn the temples of His loved ones in this supreme calamity with the robe of patience. Verily, He is the Lord of Lords, and in His grasp is the reins of all choice.

O Tongue of Grandeur! Make mention of him who hath turned toward the Horizon of Revelation when the call of Him Who conversed on Sinai was raised - He through Whom the fragrance of utterance was diffused throughout all possibility and the sweet savors of the All-Merciful were wafted among all religions. Then make mention of his orientation and his turning, his humility and his lowliness, and his trust in the Dayspring of Lights. Blessed art thou, O 'Abdu'l-Husayn, and blessed is thy name. I bear witness that thou didst attain unto the hearing of the Call when it was raised between earth and heaven, and thou didst turn and believe in God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Names, and didst acknowledge that which He revealed in His Most Holy Book and His Sacred Tablet, and that which His Tongue did speak. Thou art he whom the veils of the world and the clouds of the nations did not hinder. Thou didst rend them all asunder through the power of recognition and didst seek the ultimate goal, the supreme end, and the most exalted horizon, and thou didst advance and hasten until thou didst arrive at the station whereon He Who conversed on Sinai was established upon the Throne of Revelation, and the Herald called out from every direction: "O concourse of earth and heaven! This is the Day wherein God hath fulfilled His promise and revealed that which was hidden in His knowledge, and hath called all unto the carpet of His holiness and the courtyard of His companionship. Blessed is he who hath turned and attained, and woe unto every heedless doubter."

The Tongue of My Grandeur in the Most Great Prison doth once again in this moment testify that thou didst bear hardships in the path of thy Lord, and there befell you from the oppressors that which caused the hearts of those near unto God to tremble and the livers of the sincere to melt. Thou art he who attained unto the presence time and again, and drank the choice wine of reunion from the hands of grace and bounty, and recognized Him Who was veiled from all eyes, and heard the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen, and beheld that which was mentioned in the hearts of the chosen ones and inscribed in the Holy Books and Tablets.

Glorified art Thou, O God, O God of Names and Creator of heaven! I beseech Thee by Thy most great signs, and by the revelations of the Sun of Thy grace amidst all beings, and by the waves of the ocean of Thy mercy in the kingdom of creation, that Thou send down upon him from the heaven of Thy bounty that which beseemeth Thy generosity and bestowal. Then grant him, at all times, Thy enduring blessing and Thine eternal sustenance. O Lord! Adorn the temples of Thy loved ones with the vestures of patience and prosperity, and ordain for them that which will acquaint them with what Thou hast destined for them in the Supreme Paradise near unto Thy Most Great Mercy and Thy Most Mighty Favor. O Lord! Ordain for him and his kindred that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and console them and comfort them in that which hath befallen them through the decree of Thy judgment. Then send down, O my God, upon them from the clouds of Thy generosity a blessing from Thee and a bounty from Thy presence. Then protect them from the hosts of the oppressors who have broken Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, who have denied Thy proof and Thy evidence, who have disputed Thy signs and have warred against Thy Self. Thou art He by Whose command the standard of power was hoisted upon the highest flagpoles and the banner of authority among all people. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Hearing, the All-Answering.

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!

Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou dost witness and behold what hath befallen me at the hands of them that have denied Thy most great signs and turned away from Thy Beauty, having followed their own selves and idle fancies. By Thy glory, O my Beloved! The wolves have encompassed me from every side, and I remain alone in Thy dominion, solitary amidst Thy creatures. Whenever I impart unto them that which Thou hast taught me through Thy bounty and inspired me through Thy favors and loving-kindness, their wretchedness and their veils increase, until matters have reached such a pass that my heart is pierced by the arrows of their association of partners with Thee and the spears of their hatred. Yet when all this hath befallen me in Thy path and for Thy good-pleasure, O my God, I remain thankful for it and content with whatsoever Thou hast ordained in the kingdom of Thy decree.

Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having caused me to taste the sweetness of Thy remembrance and given me to drink from the chalices of Thy grace and mercy. I beseech Thee, therefore, O my God, by Thy Name through which Thou didst join together the Kaf and the Nun, and didst manifest Thy hidden Name, that Thou send down upon Thy servants from the direction of the paradise of Thy favors that which will sever them from all else save Thee, turn them away from all besides Thee, and draw them nigh unto the direction of Thy nearness and Thy tender mercy. Thou, verily, art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

By Thy glory, O my God, my Lord, and my Hope! Whenever I desire to arise to praise Thy Self amongst Thy creation and open my lips to mention Thee, I find myself bewildered therein, for I am certain that no remembrance of aught else beside Thee can ascend to the heaven of Thy mighty oneness, nor can any description of what is other than Thee soar to the atmosphere of Thy near singleness. Every possessor of utterance is powerless to rightfully mention Thee or render thanks unto Thee, and every possessor of sight is blind to beholding the lights of Thy beauty. Thou hast ever been sanctified beyond the remembrance of all else save Thee and the description of aught besides Thee. Thou, verily, art the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Generous.

O servant! Hearken unto the call of this Prisoner Who hath been imprisoned in the path of God, thy Lord, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Conquering, the Powerful. Then know thou that they who prided themselves on serving me have risen up against me with hypocrisy, have cast at me the darts of dissension, and have objected to me for having imparted unto them the mention of their Lord, the Most Exalted, the Great.

Say: O people! If this be my crime, then I am not the first criminal. Fear ye God, and pervert not the words of God from their places, and be not of the wrongdoers. By God! Whosoever possesseth the least sense of smell would assuredly detect the fragrance of truthfulness from this Shirt, sent forth and wondrous, which hath appeared upon the form of this Tablet and which We have sent unto thee that thou mayest remember thy Lord at morn and eventide. Say: O people! Can the fragrance of musk be confused with aught else? Nay, by my life! Save by him who causeth the matter to become confused unto himself and followeth in the footsteps of Satan. Say: O company of the heedless! The Sun can never be concealed by the veils of rancor and hatred; verily, it hath shone forth in truth from a sanctified horizon resplendent. Say: O people! Fear ye God, then adorn your tongues with truthfulness, your hearts with equity, and your faces with humility before your Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Beware lest ye conceal the beauty of the Cause through the falsehood of your tongues. Fear ye God Who created you by a command from His presence, and be not of the negligent ones.

O believing servant! When this Tablet reacheth thee, remember God, thy Lord, and be not heedless of Him. He, verily, is the Protector of the doers of good. Say: O my God! I am he who hath detached himself from all else save Thee and hath fled to the shore of the might of Thy mercy, which hath preceded all created things. O my God! Drive not this poor one from the door of Thy riches, nor this thirsty one from the Kawthar of Thy grace and the Tasnim. O my God! Leave me not to myself and my desires, then rend asunder the veils that have prevented me from arriving at the shore of the might of Thy mercy. Thou, verily, art He Who doeth what He pleaseth and ordaineth what He willeth. O my God! Send down upon me from the clouds of Thy bounty the rains of Thy generosity and grace, then cleanse thereby my heart from the remembrance of all else save Thee. Thou, verily, art the Supreme, the Most Exalted, the All-Encompassing. O my God! Deprive me not of the wonders of Thy favor, then cause me to soar in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and ascend to the heaven of Thy mercy, that I may speak forth the praise of Thy Self between the heavens and the earth. Thus doth this Prisoner teach thee that thou mayest remember thy Lord and be of them that are certain. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

How can a tongue that calls upon other than Thee be worthy to make mention of Thee, and how can a heart that hath turned to any save Thee be fitting to become a mirror of Thy beauty and be warmed by Thy love? How can an eye that hath beheld aught except Thee and turned toward any direction but Thine be capable of witnessing the wondrous handiwork of Thy creative Oneness or be honored by beholding the glory of Thine eternal majesty? How can an ear that hath perceived the finite words of Thy servants possibly hear the comprehensive verses of Thy divine unity or the sweet melodies of the Dove of Thy reality? How can feet that have walked in paths other than Thy good-pleasure move in the arenas of Thy holiness and reunion? And how can a body occupied with aught save Thee be worthy to drink from the pure wine of Thy love, or find intimacy with the pristine countenance of Thy divine sovereignty, or with the beauty of Thy hidden divinity, or be submissive to Thy Lordship, or prostrate before the face of Thy loving-kindness?

O my God! After all this, I am ashamed of my deeds before Thee and abashed at making mention of Thee. Yet since I know that all this cometh from none other than Thee and from Thy presence, my soul findeth rest and my being is calmed, for Thou art the Doer of all things and the Omnipotent over all things. Glorified, glorified art Thou! How great is my bewilderment at the wonders of Thy deeds and the marvels of Thy handiwork! How wondrous is my perturbation at the manifestations of Thy power and the expressions of Thy might! At times Thou clothest the temple of lowliness and poverty with the mantle of grandeur and raisest it to the heavens of Thy favor; at times Thou strippest the garment of glory from the form of might and majesty and returnest it to the source of Thy humiliation and the mine of Thy poverty. At times by Thy will Thou causest the essence of the most high to descend to the lowest dust, and at times by Thy desire Thou raisest the pure essence of the lowly to the most exalted throne. At one moment I witness that Thou clothest the point of tyranny with the robe of the glory of Thy justice and majesty, and at another I see that Thou strippest the essence of justice of the garments of Thy mercy and beauty and hidest it in the veils of tyranny, such that it is known and described by naught else.

In all this Thou art powerful through the power of Thy sovereignty and dominant through the all-encompassing nature of Thy might and divinity. Thou art not to be questioned about that which Thou art pleased to manifest, nor art Thou to be prevented from whatsoever Thou desirest to do, such that if Thou shouldst make glory the very essence of abasement, who could prevent Thee, or if Thou shouldst make the essence of remoteness the very substance of nearness, who could forbid Thee? Nay, by Thy glory! The sovereignty of Thy power hath ever flowed through the kingdom of Thy creation, and the dominion of Thy might shall forever hold sway in the empire of Thy realm and creatures.

Glorified art Thou, O my God! How can I make mention of Thee with words with which children play and which the people of contingent being utter? Nay, by Thy countenance! I love not to be thus, nor do I wish to be such, even though Thou shouldst manifest but a single letter thereof in the garment of Thy wondrous glory and the vesture of Thy new and sublime exaltation. By Thy glory! None would be able to utter a letter thereof or make it an enduring proof from Thee, a complete word from Thy presence, and an everlasting treasure greater than the creation of the heavens and earth.

Yet withal, I beseech Thee by the fire of Thy Being which hath ever been concealed in the mystery of Thine Essence, and by the ocean of Thy greatness which hath ever flowed in the reality of Thy Being, to teach me from Thy holy tongue which Thou hast sanctified from the hearing of Thy creation and hallowed from the understanding of Thy servants, and to honor me with the melodies of Thy rapture which none can hear, perceive, or know, for were but a single note thereof to appear, all who are in the heavens and on earth would be thunderstruck by the strange nature of its tune and the wondrous character of its pattern.

Glorified, glorified art Thou! I ask Thy forgiveness for what hath flowed from my pen concerning its cause and decree. I have not occupied myself with aught save Thee, for the essence of Thy Being and the pure reality of Thy Spirit have been engaged with the sweet-scented breezes of Thy holiness and the raptures of Thy glory, yet I have left all this and occupied myself with ink, as though I had turned away from love and inclined toward that which profiteth me not before Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of glory and grace. For to turn to aught besides Thee is a sin unequaled by any other sin and unpreceded by any error. Therefore forgive me and pardon me, for Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful and the Most Generous of the generous.

He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. It hath been prescribed that in every city a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather together people to the number of Baha, and should it exceed this number it mattereth not. They should consider themselves as entering the Presence of God, the Most High, and as beholding Him Who is invisible. It behooveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and the deputies of God for such as dwell on earth. They should consult together in such wise as to win the good pleasure of God and should choose that which is approved, even as the Lord, your God, the Ruler, the All-Wise hath commanded. The Ancient Beauty, addressing the peoples, ordaineth that in every city of the earth a house should be established in the name of justice, wherein shall gather pure and tranquil souls to the number of the Greatest Name. At the time of their gathering they must conduct themselves as though in the presence of God, for such is the binding command that hath flowed from the Pen of the Ancient of Days, and God's gaze is fixed upon that assembly. Upon entering, they must, as deputies of all souls, consult concerning matters and interests affecting all - first regarding the teaching of God's Cause, as this is the most important of all affairs, so that all may enter the pavilion of oneness as a single soul and all upon earth may be seen as one body. Likewise must they consider the refinement of souls, the preservation of human dignity, the development of cities, and the politics that God hath made the foundation of cities and the fortress of His servants. The teaching of God's Cause must be conducted with due regard to times and seasons, considering what is fitting, as with all other matters, and implemented accordingly - but ever mindful not to contravene what hath been revealed in the divine verses in this most mighty Manifestation, for whatsoever the Lord hath decreed is indeed what is best for His servants. He is more merciful to you than ye are to yourselves. He is in truth the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. If the aforementioned souls act according to the prescribed conditions, they will surely be assisted by the invisible confirmations. This is a matter whose benefits return to all. There are many affairs which, if neglected, will be wasted and lost. How many children are seen in the land without father or mother - if no attention is paid to their education and training they will remain fruitless, and a fruitless soul's death is preferable to its life. Likewise with the wealthy and noble who through weakness and old age or other cause have fallen into poverty and abasement. These souls must, for God's sake, consider and reflect upon all such matters and others pertaining to the earth, and implement what they deem proper. If people would look with the eye of justice they would with certainty know that whatsoever hath been revealed from the Source of Command is purely for the good of all who dwell on earth. All must be as wings for one another. Man's honor lieth in wisdom, understanding and praiseworthy character, not in the accumulation of riches and pride and vainglory. All were created from dust and unto it shall return. O people of Baha! Man's adornment consisteth not in the things of this world, but rather in the knowledge of God - exalted be His glory - and in sciences, crafts and proper conduct. Ye are the pearls of the sea of oneness - consider the pearl, whose luster and dignity are inherent to itself. Were it to be wrapped in the finest of silks, that silk would prevent the manifestation of its freshness and beauty. Its adornment is within itself. Seek ye this adornment and be not saddened by lack of outward means. O trees of the Ridvan! Withhold not yourselves from the spring breezes of divine bounty, and deprive not yourselves of the sweet fragrances of the wisdom-laden words of your Lord. Such is the extent of His grace that, despite the heedlessness of all, He hath caused to flow from the Most Exalted Pen in the prison of Akka that which is for the good of His servants. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.

He is the One dawning from the horizon of the heaven of bounty. This is a Book sent down by the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens, that He may draw those who dwell in the realm of creation near unto the Most Exalted Horizon--the station wherein the Most Glorious Pen proclaimeth: "The Kingdom, the Realm, the Sovereignty and the Dominion belong unto God, the Revealer of verses." This is a day wherein the fragrance of bounties and favors hath been wafted from God, the Lord of creation. Blessed is he who hath inhaled the fragrance of the All-Merciful, and he who hath heard the Call when it was raised betwixt earth and heaven, and he whose tongue hath spoken before all religions: "The door of reunion hath been opened with the key of the name of God, the Most Glorious." And blessed is he who hath heard and hastened, and woe unto every hesitant doubter.

God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath come with the truth is, verily, the Lord of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and the unseen. When He appeared, He uttered a Word whereby the ocean of utterance surged, and the fragrances of the All-Merciful were diffused, and through it the trees spoke, the fruits appeared, the rivers flowed, the rocks trembled, and the righteous cried out: "Blessed is the land honored by His footsteps, and the spot adorned by His presence, and the air that received the fragrance of His revelation, and the house wherein His remembrance was raised, and the city that became renowned through His name, and the tongue that uttered His praise at morn and eventide."

Say: This is a day wherein the heaven of knowledge hath been adorned with the stars of wisdom and utterance, and wherein the sun of proof hath shone forth from its horizon, as a bounty from God, the Lord of Lords. This is a day when the light of joy hath shone forth after the darkness of sorrows, and the carpet of manifestation hath been outspread, and the decree of gladness hath appeared, as the Hands of the bounty of the Lord of Destiny circulated His most pure wine at His most luminous station and His greatest scene. And God raised His station until He established Himself upon the throne of utterance and spoke that whereby the realities of all contingent beings were attracted.

Thereupon the rustling of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha was heard in the Abha Paradise, calling to the denizens of earth and heaven, saying: "Rejoice with exceeding gladness and impart the tidings that the Hand of Bestowal hath stretched out and opened the arena of delight in the name of God, the Blissful, amidst the dwellers of the Tabernacle of Glory in these days of unfading splendour."

Blessed be God, the Originator of all things and the Lord of the Kingdom of Names, Who hath adorned the world through His Most Great Name, and from Whose Pen hath flowed that which attracted the hearts of the nations who, when they heard, turned unto Him and acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur had spoken in the earliest of days. Then the Sadratu'l-Bayan called out from the highest Paradise, saying: "O dwellers of the cities of names and companions of the Crimson Ark! This is a day the like of which the eye of creation hath not seen, nor hath the vision of invention beheld its equal, inasmuch as the Lord of all beings hath willed to adorn the couch of one of His loved ones--who hath been named 'Abdu'l-Baha by the Tongue of Grandeur--with a leaf from among the leaves of the Tree of Fidelity, whom God hath adorned with the ornament of martyrdom in His path and the sacrifice of spirit in His love. And since her dowry in the Book of God was the sacrifice of bodies and souls, the King of Martyrs came forward himself and accepted that which was ordained by the Pen of Destiny--he who arose from the horizon of the world with the banner of detachment and sacrificed his spirit in this Straight Path and the Great News, whereby the realities of what was and what will be were made joyful. Command and judgment belong to God, the Mighty, the Help in Peril.

O God of the world and Creator of the nations! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name to bless this union through Thy name, the All-Merciful. Then unite their hearts through Thy Name by which Thou didst unite hearts at the dawning-places of Thy Cause, the repositories of Thy laws, the descending-points of Thy knowledge, and the sources of Thy names. Then send down, O my God, upon them and upon those with them, the rain of Thy generosity from the clouds of Thy grace.

O Yahya! Hear the Call from the Most Exalted Summit and take the Book with a strength that the might of the world cannot weaken and with a power that the Pharaohs of the nations cannot prevent. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of them that are near and the Beloved of them that are detached, for having adorned my head with the crown of Thy utterance, and my temple with the ornament of Thy bounty, and my heart with the light of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee by Thy Will, through which Thou hast subdued all created things and manifested all possibilities, to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy service, speaking Thy praise, and assisting Thy Cause through wisdom and utterance. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.

In the Name of God, the Most Holy! This Book hath been sent down in truth, and by it We have rent asunder the veils. Verily, We are the Mighty, the Bountiful. Through it hath shone forth the Sun of Divine Revelation, and the Face hath been illumined by the Light that hath dawned from the horizon of mysteries. Say: Is there any doubt concerning God? He hath come with the Kingdom of verses. Verily, the Word proclaimeth: The Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the All-Choosing. Say: Cast away your idle fancies, and take hold of that which ye are bidden by Him Who is the Dawning-Place of inspiration. The veils have been rent asunder by the finger of the Will of your Lord, the Lord of all men. He verily seeth him that turneth towards Him, and heareth that which he calleth upon Him with, whether in secret or openly.

Heedlessness hath overtaken the dwellers of the earth, save those whose eyes have been opened by the light of God, the Mighty, the All-Luminous. Verily, sight was created for this most great vision; therefore look, O ye who are endowed with insight! He who said "Show me" heard "Look, thou shalt see Me." Exalted be this bounty the like of which eyes have never beheld! All things testify to My Self, while the people are in wondrous drunkenness.

Among the idolaters are those who say He hath come nigh. Say: Yea, by my Lord! He is verily the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. Every sect hath endeavored to extinguish the light of God. God hath refused save by His authority, until He filled the horizons. Can anyone stand against His Command? Say: What aileth thee, O thou fly? The gate of heaven hath been opened, and the All-Bountiful hath come, riding upon the clouds. Thereupon were blinded the eyes of those who disbelieved, and every deceitful idolater was confounded.

Blessed art thou, O thou who hast turned to God, the Cleaver of the daybreak! Thy letter and that which was presented before the Face hath been mentioned. Thy Lord is verily the Mighty, the All-Knowing. There hath dawned from the horizon of the Pen that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of all nations. He is verily the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Stand firm, by His power, in His Cause, then remind the people with wisdom and utterance. Soon shalt thou behold the Cause dominant over all who are on earth, and its effulgence from every direction. Can prison and tribulation prevent Him from that which He desireth? Nay, by the Lord of Lords!

Blessed is the heart that is quickened by the breath of God, and the tongue that is adorned with His remembrance amidst all worlds. If thou art enkindled by this Fire that hath been kindled in the world, those in the lands shall be enkindled by thee. Think not it is fire; it is light whose effects shall soon encompass those in all regions. Be thou assured through God's grace and mercy. He verily exalteth whom He willeth by a command from Him, and confirmeth his mention in the Mother Book.

Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou beholdest me amidst the idolaters among Thy creation and those who have turned away from among Thy creatures, and Thou knowest that I have desired naught but what Thou hast desired, and desire naught but what Thou desirest. I have conveyed Thy Cause to the east and west of the earth, and thereby there hath befallen me that which hath caused the dwellers of Thy dominion and kingdom to lament, until they cast me and seventy souls into this Most Great Prison. When We arrived, We desired to convey unto all once again, that they might know that tribulations have not prevented the Manifestation of Thyself from manifesting Thy sovereignty and exalting Thy Word. We have conveyed unto the manifestations of Thy power in Thy earth that which Thou didst command me, by Thy command and Thy sovereignty. I have not compromised with anyone in Thy path, and have accepted all tribulations in Thy love and in manifesting Thy Cause.

I beseech Thee, O Lord of creation and King of invention, to transmute the brass of existence by the elixir of Thy utterance and wisdom. Then reveal unto them from Thy All-Comprehensive Book that which will render them independent through Thy riches. I testify, O my God, that with Thee is the knowledge of what was and what will be, and the knowledge of all things in Thy Hidden Book. I beseech Thee by Thy Self to make known unto the servants the Manifestation of Thy Cause and the Dawning-Place of Thy verses, that they might find in His every condition the sweet savors of Thy knowledge and the fragrant breezes of the garment of Thy mercy. Then aid them in that which is chosen by Thee, that they might choose what Thou hast chosen for them through Thy bounty, for that which appeareth from Thee is best for Thy servants.

O Lord! Aid this servant who hath turned toward the direction of Thy gifts, then ordain for him the good of this world and the next. Then assist him in helping Thy Cause and conveying that which Thou hast willed by Thy sovereignty, for this is the most excellent of deeds with Thee, and the most exalted in Thy Book. O Lord! Aid him in all conditions to stand firm in Thy love. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Generous. Praise be unto Thee, O God of all who are in the heavens and the earth.

O Mirza Abdullah! In the name of the one incomparable Beloved! This servant's purpose concerning the loved ones of God has ever been truthfulness, justice and drawing nigh unto God. Throughout all days and nights I have summoned all, purely for the sake of God, to the holy court. Even in times when there was not a moment's hope of safety outwardly, as you have all seen and understood, when enemies from all sects lay in ambush for this celestial bird, nevertheless, to the extent possible and even beyond that, there was no negligence in teaching the Cause of God. I swear by His sacred Being that I never had, nor have, any purpose of my own. Rather, the purpose was that a gathering of spiritual birds might assemble in His most glorious and impregnable Paradise, engaging in the remembrance of the Friend, that perchance the fragrances of detachment might waft over the world and its people, causing all to turn toward the Friend and become freed from the abasement of self and passion, and that the edifice of oppression built by the hands of the polytheists and transgressors on earth might be demolished by the hands of justice of holy, detached souls, so that all people might receive their share and portion from the ocean of His bounty and not remain deprived of His all-encompassing mercy.

Tablets have arrived from the land of Sad, and all are certain that that wicked associator has written falsehoods and calumnies. I swear by the Beauty of the Beloved that the mind is bewildered by the craftiness of these souls. Some of you have seen it. Now that associator has become the "leader of women." Observe the power of that Almighty One Who has made manifest the falsehood of these wicked souls through their own actions, such that every person of insight and understanding has recognized and will recognize that "leader of women" as the "leader of men." Therefore take refuge in God, O people, from their deceit and their lies. May God protect us and you from their evil.

Hear the call of this servant and with complete steadfastness protect the Cause of God from the oppression of the polytheists of the Bayan. Say: O people of the Bayan! Judge fairly yourselves. The deeds, actions and words of those souls have become evident and manifest. Is it now permissible for anyone to turn to such souls or speak in praise of such persons? No, by the Lord of the worlds! Whatever is mentioned is for the protection of God's Cause, not for the protection of this prisoner, for it is quite evident that if any days of life remain for this servant, rest will never be attained, just as it was not attained before. Rather, by God, I have never sought nor do I seek rest, for at all times I proclaim: "Would that my blood might be shed at this moment in the path of God, my Beloved and the Beloved of the mystics." In this case, whatever occurs on earth will bring no benefit to this servant. Whatever loving counsels have been and are mentioned in the Tablets are solely for the sake of the loved ones' turning to the holy court of the All-Glorious and All-Bountiful.

O Abdullah! God's favor has ever been and continues to be with you, and you have been in His presence and have become aware of the two parties. The record of the polytheists of this land are those souls who are in that land, and whatever you have observed of deeds, actions and words in those souls is the reflection of these souls that has appeared in those souls. Now ponder on the deeds and actions of Truth and His words, and on what you have observed from others besides Him, that the truth may become clear to you. Previously two Tablets were sent specifically to you; God willing, they have arrived. Today you must strive and endeavor to the extent possible to teach God's Cause, for this is the greatest bounty and supreme good. Although most people have ever turned to falsehood, as the affinity between them is evident, just as most people on earth today are idol worshippers - what else until the will of the Doer of whatsoever He willeth decrees, and verily He is powerful over what He willeth. However, you must stand firm in the Cause with perfect steadfastness and teach God's Cause with tongue and pen to the extent possible. This is the fruit of existence, and verily He is the Mighty, the Adored One.

In the Name of the Most High, the Most Exalted

This is an epistle from this servant to him who hath believed in God and journeyed unto Him until he entered the sacred shore in the vicinity of the mercy of his Lord, the Mighty, the Gracious, and heard the melodies of God and drank from the seas of nearness, then was guided by the guidance of the Spirit and attained unto the lights of a luminous countenance. O servant! We have heard thy call and have answered thee with a reply that transcendeth the minds of the mystics, that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and soar with longing and be of them that have attained unto the lights of Beauty, and be detached from the world and its ornaments to such extent that nothing in the kingdom shall cause thee grief, and be as a fire in thy love that may consume the veils of those who were veiled in the days of God and were among the losers, that perchance they may arise from the couches of their heedlessness and seek forgiveness of God within themselves and return unto the paradise of nearness.

Say: O people! Fear God and believe in Him and differ not concerning His Cause, and be not of the mischief-makers. Follow the command of God and migrate unto Him with your hearts, and when ye hear the verses of the Spirit, fall down in prostration before them, and follow not those who have cast the Book of God behind their backs as though they had never heard it, and who walk in the valley of polytheism.

Say: O people! The Cause of God hath come upon clouds of spirit with angels round about it, and the Sun of Beauty hath shone forth and the Face hath appeared from behind the veil with manifest sovereignty, and the believers at that time rejoice in the joy of God and are attracted by the melodies of the Spirit, while ye lie sleeping upon the couch of heedlessness.

Say: O people! Know ye the value of these days and deprive not yourselves of the fruits of Paradise, and be not of the heedless ones. This is what this servant counseleth you in his epistle and strengtheneth you through the Spirit and conveyeth unto you the messages of his Lord and remindeth you of the remembrance of God, the Mighty, the Luminous.

And thou, fear no one and grieve not for anything, but put thy trust in God. Verily He will protect thee from the hosts of Satan and will aid thee by His command and will provide thee with everlasting bounties and will give thee glad tidings of lights of ancient glory, that thou mayest abide in the Concourse on High and soar with two wings of longing unto the precincts of a mighty nearness.

O servant! The polytheists say there is no spirit in these words. Say: Woe unto you! The spirit of life from this Paradise wafteth upon the worlds. And thereby they turned away and waxed proud before God and the Manifestations of His Cause, and were dead within the veils of their own selves. Thus hath Satan made their deeds seem fair unto them and their hearts have hardened as though they were behind a thick veil, after God had commanded them in all the Tablets not to follow their desires and when they hear the verses of the Spirit to rejoice within themselves and hasten unto a holy and noble seat.

Say: If ye be in doubt concerning what hath been revealed in this Tablet, then bring forth a proof from God or an evidence from His presence, then call your witnesses if ye be steadfast in your words. And if ye be unable, then fear God and join not partners with Him in His Cause, then follow what hath been revealed unto you and follow not every ignorant multitude, and be not of them that turn aside.

Thus do We recount unto thee the story of those who disbelieved and turned away, though I desired naught save servitude unto God, the True One, and thou art witness unto this, and God behind thee is All-Knowing and All-Witnessing.

Say: Doth not My tribulation among the servants suffice you, wherein We were manifest among them like the sun in the midst of heaven, and there befell Us what hath befallen no one before? Yet withal We desired no help from you and We put Our trust in God, the Mighty, the Exalted. This is the extent of their understanding in this vain life, and in the hereafter they shall have no helper nor supporter.

Convey the Spirit from Our presence unto him whose writing We found in thy letter, and give him glad tidings of the light of a wondrous morn. Then remind him not to make any reference to Us, that God may sanctify him from the veils of heedlessness and make him one of the angels of the highest heaven. And peace be upon thee and upon the women in thy household and upon those who remember God in thy land and who are upon a straight path of certain truth.

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious! This is a Tablet which hath been sent down in truth from the presence of One mighty and wise, wherein is mentioned that which attracteth the minds of them that have recognized the unity of God. Is this the day of silence? Nay, by the Lord of the worlds! Is this the day of rest? Nay, by My true Self, were ye of them that know! All things have been stirred by the breezes of Revelation. Do ye remain seated in your places, even though ye be of the sincere ones? Leave the people behind thee, then stand firm in the Cause of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. When the breezes of the verses take hold of thee and awaken thee from slumber, arise and say: "O people! By God, He is indeed the Beloved of the heavens and earth! He hath been imprisoned after having sacrificed Himself for our sakes. Where is your sense of honor, and where is your fidelity, O ye who have turned towards Him?" He is in such tribulation as the eye of creation hath never beheld its like, after having summoned the people unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

Grieve not for what hath befallen Us, and be patient. He, verily, hath power over all things. Then know that thy mention hath been made before Us, and We have sent down verses unto thee and dispatched them to thee that thine eyes may be solaced thereby. This, verily, is a manifest bounty. Then remind the people of the Bayan there. Say: "Have ye denied your Lord, the All-Merciful, after He came upon the clouds of explanation with a mighty proof?" Say: "Fear ye God and cast not the Truth behind your backs. Take what ye have been given from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Wise."

Do ye find any other than Me in the Bayan? Nay, by Him Who caused Me to speak His praise amongst the worlds! Hath there flowed from the Most Exalted Pen any mention save My mention? Nay, by My true Self, were ye of them that know! Were it not for My mention, the Bayan would not have been revealed, and by My Name was adorned the heaven of the Cause. Here is its Sun, which hath dawned from its horizon. Blessed be God Who hath manifested Himself in truth with evident sovereignty!

Say: "O people! Arise from the slumber of passion and turn unto the Dayspring of the Cause, the Source of the signs of your Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted." Thus doth He counsel you from the Most Glorious Horizon. Hearken unto that whereunto ye are called from the direction of the Throne, and be not of them that hesitate. Say: "Beware lest ye follow him who hath turned away from the Truth and clung to them who have denied God from time immemorial. They are indeed of an evil people, among the most lost."

Quicken the servants through My Name, then give them to drink in My days that which floweth from the right hand of the Throne, that they may unite in the Cause and not be of the doubtful ones. Say: "O people! Be fair! Do ye find anyone who speaketh between the heavens and the earth, whom neither the oppression of the wrongdoers nor the might of sovereigns can prevent?" Those who preserve themselves behind veils call upon the people to deny the Lord of Lords. They are indeed in manifest error.

Say: "Have mercy upon yourselves and upon Him through Whom the eyes of the Primal Point were consoled in the Most Exalted Companion. This is He Who took the covenant of His own Self before the creation of the heavens and earth." Say: "Have ye not heard the Cry which was raised in the atmosphere of the will of your Lord, the All-Merciful? And have ye not heard that which came from the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful?"

Say: "We have desired naught for Ourselves, but rather for your sakes, were ye to be fair-minded. We have accepted the swords of the enemies for your life, and every fair-minded, well-informed person beareth witness to this. We have turned away from all who are on earth for the sake of your turning unto the direction of the mercy of your Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate."

Say: "Would ye slay with the sword of hatred him who hath sacrificed his life for your sake? Woe unto you, O heedless ones! If ye deny the All-Merciful, by what discourse will your souls find assurance? Fear God and follow not every idolatrous doubter."

Place thy trust in God and convey that which thou art commanded. Let not the might of the oppressors frighten thee. He is with those who make mention of Him, and He aideth him who speaketh His praise. He, verily, rewardeth the rememberers. Be thou assured of thy Lord's grace.

Say: "O my Lord! I have turned with my whole being to the Dawning-Place of the signs of Thy oneness, and have turned away from those who have opposed the Dayspring of Thy Cause. Preserve me, O my God, beneath the shadow of Thy great mercy. Then make me to be of those who have stood firm in Thy Cause, who have been faithful to Thy Covenant, and who have cast behind their backs all who are in the realm. Ordain for me, O my God, the victory of Thy Cause and Thy remembrance amongst Thy servants, and disappoint me not of that which Thou hast ordained for the choicest among Thy creatures. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."

He is the All-Possessing!

This is a Tablet which bestoweth remembrance upon all the worlds and guideth the heedless unto the paradise of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Therein is healing for the breasts of those who have turned with their hearts toward the direction of God, and for the idolaters there is a grievous chastisement.

O servant! Be thou steadfast in the Cause which none can withstand save those who have detached themselves from all who are in the heavens and the earth. Then take hold of this handle whereby the hearts of those near unto God have taken hold.

Say: O people! Know ye that God hath made Us independent of you and of what ye possess and of all the worlds. We have no need of you nor of what ye possess. Rather, all things are in need of the grace that is with Me, and I am the Munificent, the Generous. Say: He is indeed self-sufficient in His own sufficiency, and all else is made sufficient through His sufficiency, were ye but to perceive it. And if We accept anything from anyone, that is of Our favor unto him, if ye be of those who know.

Say: By God! All who are in the heavens and earth cannot equal a single letter that proceedeth from My Pen, and I am the Bestower, the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. Say: What ye possess befitteth you and is worthy of your station, O concourse of the heedless! By God! If ye were to expend all that is in the heavens and earth, and what ye possess of gold and silver, and beyond these your spirits and your bodies, for one who would bring you glad tidings of this Cause in this Name, it would still be more insignificant than anything else, were ye but to know.

Say: O concourse of the Bayan! By the True God, heedlessness and intoxication have seized you more severely than the peoples of old, and this is testified to by this truthful and trustworthy Pen. Say: We have been imprisoned in this Prison behind towering mountains, and We seek from you neither helper nor assistant save God Who created Us and you, and help cometh from none but Him, and He is the Helper, the Almighty, the Powerful.

Say: Today nothing shall profit you, even if ye were to expend all that hath been created between earth and heaven, except that ye believe in this wise Remembrance. Nothing shall be accepted from anyone, even if he were to fast and pray for the duration of God's existence, except that he draw nigh through this exalted and sublime Prayer.

Say: By the True God! Today none is permitted even to breathe except by My leave, much less anything else, were ye but of the God-fearing. And by this there ariseth the fire of hatred in the breasts of those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, and tranquility in the hearts of the monotheists.

Say: If ye deny these verses, then by what proof have ye believed in all the Prophets and Messengers? Bring it forth if ye be truthful! Say: Remain ye in your homes and seats, then occupy yourselves with what your desires command you, and do not oppose these captives in this distant land. Fear ye God and dispute not with Him Who hath appeared with manifest sovereignty, the like of which hath never appeared before and shall never appear unto the end that hath no end, and Who remained behind the veil of concealment when He found you wrapped in veils of heedlessness and thick coverings.

And thou, read thou this Tablet and share it with the letter Mim that he may become aware of God's sufficiency and be of the assured ones. And send its transcript to his land that its people might be transformed from the left hand of fancy to the right hand of certitude. Then convey Our remembrance to the letter Za' and others among the steadfast loved ones of God whose feet slip not from this Path wherefrom slip the feet of the mystics.

Say unto them: Emerge from the darkness of heedlessness and convey yourselves, then convey the servants, and be not of the fearful ones. God will protect you from those who have disbelieved and oppressed, and from the hosts of the idolaters.

What they say regarding the letter Qaf in the presence of Mahdi is incorrect. Love for him has ever been and shall ever be manifest. The intent of that statement was to investigate the circumstances of the writer who wrote from the land of Ta, not you and them. In any case, pay no heed to the words of those who intend and raise up, for most are devoid of truth. What was mentioned in the Tablets was intended to manifest the unity of you Mahdis in Qam?in, naught else. We remember the people of the sanctuary, and likewise Majid and Rida and others among the assured ones.

He is the Mighty, the Exalted, the Self-Subsisting!

This is a Tablet that speaketh with truth, and in it is that which guideth the people unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, Who hath ordained for Us that which He hath ordained for none else of His creation. We are, therefore, in great thanksgiving.

Say: O people! Successive years and consecutive months have passed, and the Face was among you like unto the resplendent, shining sun, yet ye turned not towards it for a moment, nor did ye recognize it for an instant, though it moved amongst you morning and evening. Thus did days and nights pass while the people were in great heedlessness and intoxication. And whenever We increased for them the proof, they increased in their wretchedness and were in manifest loss.

Say: O concourse of the Furqan and all who are in the heavens and on earth! Do ye follow what your desires command you and forsake Him Who created you and sustaineth you? Woe unto you, O company of Muslims! Fear God and cast not the Book of God behind your backs, and deprive not yourselves of this wondrous bounty. If ye have a proof greater than this, or an evidence mightier than it, then bring it forth and be not of the patient ones. And if ye have not God's proof and His evidence, then by what proof did ye turn away from the Truth and were among the rejectors?

Do ye imagine within yourselves that God's Cause will be altered by My imprisonment? Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! Rather, His Cause will be exalted and His decree elevated, even should all creation oppose it. He is triumphant over His Cause and firm in His support. He will aid His Cause through the hosts of His invisible realm on high.

Thus have We set forth the verses in truth that they might guide those who are guided by God their Creator. When the verses of God are recited unto them, they offer up their souls and are among those who draw nigh unto the homeland of nearness before God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

And thou, O Nabil, know that those who have left their homes and dwelling places, emigrating unto God - their reward falleth upon God. This is glad tidings for thee and for those who were among those who sought the right hand of holiness. Then know that those who claim faith in these days - their faith will not be complete except through their turning unto God and turning away from all who are in the heavens and earth. Be not as those who were before, and follow not that which they have no authority to follow, and be not of the heedless ones.

Say: O people! Follow not those unto whom God hath given no authority or power. Follow him who reciteth unto you the verses of God - this is one of His signs, if ye be of those who hear. Say: The bounty was among you, yet ye turned away from it after God had enjoined it upon you in all the Tablets, nay in every line, if ye be of those who see. When they turned away from God's decree and denied God's bounty, God removed it from their midst and left them in manifest darkness, and caused it to dwell in a place whose hem neither those who accept nor those who reject can touch.

We praise God for having confined Us in this remote prison. And thou, be thou at peace through thy Lord's favor and grieve not for anything. God will assist thee through His Command and will ordain for thee abundant good, and will exalt thy name in truth among the company of those who are brought nigh.

Then know that We have written no letter to anyone, nor do We write except as God willeth. He verily ordereth all things as He pleaseth, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful. And if thou desirest, convey the fragrances wafting from this Tablet to those who have believed in God and His signs and were among the assured ones, that perchance the people may arise from the couches of heedlessness and turn with their hearts toward the direction of God, the Supreme, the Most High, the Great.

And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who have relied upon their Lord.

He is the Hearing, the Answering One!

O My Name! Upon thee be My glory! The petition of Asad - upon him be My glory - was noted and achieved the honor of being heard. Praise be to God that they have inhaled the fragrance of divine knowledge and are turning their gaze toward the horizon of the favor of the Goal of all the worlds. This is the fruit of existence, to which the Supreme Pen hath testified and doth testify. They have not been and are not deprived, for they have turned unto Him in days when the divines, the jurists, and the princes of the earth became opposers. We beseech God to aid all to preserve that which hath been bestowed.

O Asad! The breathings of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, have taken thee, and the Kawthar of divine knowledge hath attracted thee. Say: My God, my God! Unto Thee be praise and unto Thee be thanksgiving, unto Thee be bounty and generosity, for having honored me with Thy days and caused me to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy Cause, the Manifestation of Thy Self, and the Dayspring of Thy signs, and for having aided me to turn toward Thy most exalted horizon, to hearken unto Thy sweetest call, and to turn toward the lights of Thy countenance, O Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens! O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and turning away from all else, acknowledging that which the tongue of Thy grandeur hath spoken when Thou didst establish Thyself upon the throne by Thy command and will, that verily Thou art God, Who hath ever been One, Single, Alone, and Self-Subsisting, and wilt ever remain as Thou hast been. There is none other God but Thee, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted, the Ruler in the beginning and in the end.

O my Lord! Thou seest the poor one seeking the ultimate goal and the most exalted summit, the needy one seeking the kingdom of wealth, the distant one seeking Thy nearness, O Lord of all beings and Lord of the throne on high and of the dust, the weak one seeking the horizon of Thy power, the ignorant one seeking the ocean of Thy knowledge, the weary one seeking the kingdom of Thy utterance, and the dead one seeking the Kawthar of Thy eternity. I beseech Thee by the breezes of the dawn of Thy Manifestation and by Thy Most Exalted Word, whereby the rivers of Thy knowledge have flowed from the hearts of Thy loved ones, and by the Name through which Thou hast subdued Thy servants and Thy lands, to cause me in all conditions to hold fast unto that which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy will in Thy Scriptures and Tablets, and to cling to that which Thou hast commanded me through that which hath been revealed when the creaking of Thy Most Exalted Pen was raised in the kingdom of creation through Thy bounty and favors.

I know not, O my God, my Goal, and my Hope, which of my deeds hath made me worthy of recognizing the ocean of Thy light and the fire of Thy Lote-Tree, and which of my remembrances hath guided me to the court of Thy favor and the Dawning-Place of Thy hidden Names and Thy treasured Secret. I beseech Thee, O Thou through Whose forgiveness all things bear witness and through Whose grace all things exist, to forgive me and those who love Thee, O Lord of Lords, Master of the Day of Reckoning, and the Speaker in the Return.

I know not, O my God and my Lord, whether Thou hast ordained for Thy servant to turn toward the lights of Thy countenance, to stand before Thy throne, to stand at Thy gate, and to enter the place which Thou hast made the circling-point of Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers, or whether Thy irrevocable decree hath prevented me from this most great bounty, O Master of nations. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy giving and the sun of Thy grace to ordain for me from the Pen of Destiny the hearing of Thy sweetest call and the gazing toward Thy most exalted horizon, and ordain for me the reward of meeting Thee, O Beloved of the Concourse on High and Master of the Most Glorious Paradise. Then write down for me that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. O Lord, I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance to make my turning toward Thy presence a treasure for me with Thee. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

And concerning what was written about 'Ali-Haydar, it was mentioned before the Wronged One and adorned with the ornament of the favor of the Goal of all worlds. We beseech God to aid him in that which He loveth and is pleased with. In these days, mention of him hath flowed from the Supreme Pen. We beseech God to make him successful in that which beseemeth His days. We, from this station, send Our greetings upon the faces of the brethren and upon him and upon those whom the might of the ranks and multitudes prevented not from turning toward God, the Sovereign of the Kingdom and the Realm.

And should Asad - upon him be My glory - recite this brief prayer, it would be beloved:

My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the penetrating power of Thy Most Exalted Word and the might of Thy Most Exalted Pen, and by the Name which Thou hast made the Sovereign of Names, to ordain for me that which shall profit me in every world of Thy worlds. Thou knowest what is with me and I know not what is with Thee. Verily, Thou art the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

He is God, exalted be His glory in wisdom and utterance!

O handmaiden of God! Upon thee be the Glory of God and His favors. The letter thou didst send to him who beareth the name of God, upon him be My Glory, attained unto Our presence, was seen and heard. There hath come upon you that which hath caused grief to the loved ones and joy to the denizens of the highest Paradise - grief to the loved ones due to separation, and joy to the denizens of the highest Paradise due to union. His honor Badi', upon him be My Glory, hastened from this dust-heap earth to the highest Paradise. All the peoples round about are saddened by thy sorrow, yet it behooveth all to hold fast to gracious patience. Verily thy Lord is the All-Patient. He commandeth thee, His handmaidens and His loved ones to gracious patience.

However, O My handmaiden and My leaf, I swear by the Sun of inner meanings which hath shone forth from the highest horizon of the world, through God's grace and favor - exalted be His glory - there have been ordained for thee offspring and children who shall forever be nourished in the paradise of inner meanings with eternal, everlasting bounties and delicate foods. By the life of God! This bounty shall never cease nor undergo change. This is hidden within the innermost of the innermost. As to the outward realm, that which will bring you certainty and assurance is mentioned for the sake of God, that thou mayest rend asunder with the fingers of certitude the somber garment that is unpleasing, and adorn thyself with the luminous robe that is most beloved of all that hath appeared from thee.

O My handmaiden! Upon thee be My Glory and My mercy. Every word of the divine words specifically revealed for thee from the heaven of the merciful Will is as a righteous child and a manifest remembrance. Blessed be thine ear, for it hath neither hearkened to nor heard any word of unseemly deed, and through the Most Exalted Pen thou hast been blessed with children and offspring who are immortalized, eternal and everlasting in God's Book, each bearing witness concerning thee. Rejoice thou in this great bounty.

\[Letter continues with specific mentions of various individuals and conditions in the prison city, concluding with guidance and blessings\]

The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon every maidservant who hath believed in God, the One, the All-Informed.

O My Name! Upon thee be My Glory. Although the condition of this land and the events occurring therein are outwardly unknown, repeatedly hath this exalted Word been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen: the prison land is outwardly calm but inwardly turbulent. The knowledge thereof is with God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Yet, purely through grace and favor, permission for the Leaf to approach and remain hath been granted, as a bounty from God, the Ordainer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

He is God, exalted be His glory in majesty and power!

O questioner! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He summoneth thee unto God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. As to what thou hast written concerning the manifestation of the Cause and the completion of the proof, know thou that the proof hath been completed, the heavenly table hath descended, the earth hath been cleft asunder, the heaven hath been split, the mountains have been scattered, the trees have been uprooted, the seas have been frozen, the path hath been laid, the balance hath been set up, the trumpet hath been blown, the door hath been knocked, the hosts have been arrayed, the inevitable hour hath come to pass, the tribes have been shaken, the bugle hath sounded, and the voice of the trumpet hath been raised, when this most exalted Word was sent down from the Most Exalted Pen: My glory and grandeur bear witness that this is not the day for questions. It behooveth every soul, when the call is raised between earth and heaven, to leave behind whatsoever he possesseth, to arise and say:

"Here am I, here am I, O Lord of Names! Here am I, here am I, O Creator of Heaven! I bear witness that Thou hast appeared and manifested what Thou didst desire through Thy command 'Be,' and it was."

O thou who strivest with thy words! Look with the eye of fairness. For years, the arrows of tribulation have rained down from the clouds of divine decree, by reason of what the hands of the wicked have wrought, upon the Truth and His loved ones, while thou didst repose upon the couch of heedlessness in utmost comfort. Now, in these latter days, when God's testimony hath encompassed the world and His proof hath risen like the sun from the horizon of His Cause, thou hast clung to the ropes of the world's soothsayers and their like, seeking to measure the Truth by a standard that is unworthy of mention. Return unto God Who created and nurtured thee, and say:

"O my Lord! I testify that I was heedless of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the heaven of Thy wisdom, and turned away from the Dayspring of Thy Revelation and the Source of Thy signs. I beseech Thee by Thy mercy that hath preceded all created things, and by Thy grace that hath encompassed all contingent beings, to forgive me and remit my sins. Thou, verily, art the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Thou art, in truth, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous."

O questioner! Sanctify thine ear that thou mayest hear the divine call, and cleanse thine eye from the dust and rheum of idle fancies that thou mayest behold the Supreme Horizon. Today the whispers of Satan are evident and the breezes of the All-Merciful are wafting. Cast off the former and take hold of the latter. In the name of the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the horizons have been filled with the signs of thy Lord, and such clear tokens have appeared that none but every heedless, turning away, denying one that is far astray would deny them. Observe the signs of God and ponder them, that perchance thou mayest inhale the fragrance of His garment and attain unto the Dayspring of Revelation. All that hath appeared in the world was previously announced in the divine Tablets with the most clear exposition. The Command is in His grasp, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful. This is the Day whereof the All-Merciful hath spoken in the Qur'an, saying: "The whole earth shall be but His handful on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens shall be rolled up in His right hand."

If thou wouldst reflect a little, by the life of God, thou wouldst melt away in shame, for the Truth hath appeared in such wise as hath never been witnessed in all creation, and from His movement and stillness, His call and utterance, and all His ways, proofs, evidences and testimonies have become manifest and evident. Yet despite this, thou still seekest to know the Truth through conjecture and idle fancy. Cast aside what thou hast and take what is with God, the Lord of all worlds. Strive that thou mayest drink from the cup of everlasting life and not be numbered among those who swoon away. By the life of God! The trumpet hath been blown, and all who are in the heavens and on earth have swooned away, save those who have held fast unto His cord and clung to the hem of His luminous robe.

When thou hast received My Tablet and found from it the fragrance of My verses, go forth from thy house towards the wilderness and lament with the lamentation of the bereaved, and say, as many times as the number of the Greatest Name: "I repent before Thee, O God of the worlds!" Then turn thy face towards the Prison and say:

"I have come unto Thee, O Thou Wronged One of the worlds, with sincerity for Thy sake, in submission to Thy command, in humility before Thy decree, hoping for the wonders of Thy favor, and beseeching Thy ancient generosity, O Thou in Whose hand is the dominion of all worlds! I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great."

LVII

When thou art departed out of the court of My presence, O Muhammad, direct thy steps towards My House (Ba{gh}dad House), and visit it on behalf of thy Lord.

When thou reachest its door, stand thou before it and say: Whither is the Ancient Beauty gone, O most great House of God, He through Whom God hath made thee the cynosure of an adoring world, and proclaimed thee to be the sign of His remembrance unto all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth? Oh! for the former days when thou, O House of God, wert made His footstool, the days when in ceaseless strains the melody of the All-Merciful poured forth from thee! What hath become of thy jewel whose glory hath irradiated all creation? Whither are gone the days in which He, the Ancient King, had made thee the throne of His glory, the days in which He had chosen thee alone to be the lamp of salvation between earth and heaven, and caused thee to diffuse, at dawn and at eventide, the sweet fragrance of the All-Glorious?

Where, O House of God, is the Sun of majesty and power Who had enveloped thee with the brightness of His presence? Where is He, the Day Spring of the tender mercies of thy Lord, the Unconstrained, Who had established His seat within thy walls? What is it, O throne of God, that hath altered thy countenance, and made thy pillars to tremble? What could have closed thy door to the face of them that eagerly seek thee? What hath made thee so desolate? Couldst thou have been told that the Beloved of the world is pursued by the swords of His enemies? The Lord bless thee, and bless thy fidelity unto Him, inasmuch as thou hast remained His companion through all His sorrows and His sufferings. I testify that thou art the scene of His transcendent glory, His most holy habitation. Out of thee hath gone forth the Breath of the All-Glorious, a Breath that hath breathed over all created things, and filled with joy the breasts of the devout that dwell in the mansions of Paradise. The Concourse on high, and they that inhabit the Cities of the Names of God, weep over thee, and bewail the things that have befallen thee.

Thou art still the symbol of the names and attributes of the Almighty, the Point towards which the eyes of the Lord of earth and heaven are directed. There hath befallen thee what hath befallen the Ark in which God's pledge of security had been made to dwell. Well is it with him that apprehendeth the intent of these words, and recognizeth the purpose of Him Who is the Lord of all creation.

Happy are those that inhale from thee the sweet savors of the Merciful, that acknowledge thine exaltation, that safeguard thy sanctity, that reverence, at all times, thy station. We implore the Almighty to grant that the eyes of those who have turned away from thee, and failed to appreciate thy worth, may be opened, that they may truly recognize thee, and Him Who, through the power of truth, hath raised thee up on high. Blind, indeed, are they about thee, and utterly unaware of thee in this day. Thy Lord is, verily, the Gracious, the Forgiving.

I bear witness that through thee God hath proved the hearts of His servants. Blessed be the man that directeth his steps towards thee, and visiteth thee. Woe to him that denieth thy right, that turneth away from thee, that dishonoreth thy name, and profaneth thy holiness.

Grieve not, O House of God, if the veil of thy sanctity be rent asunder by the infidels. God hath, in the world of creation, adorned thee with the jewel of His remembrance. Such an ornament no man can, at any time, profane. Towards thee the eyes of thy Lord shall, under all conditions, remain directed. He, verily, will incline His ear to the prayer of every one that visiteth thee, who will circle around thee, and calleth upon Him in thy name. He, in truth, is the Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

I beseech Thee, O my God, by this House that hath suffered such change in its separation from Thee, that bewaileth its remoteness from Thy presence, and lamenteth Thy tribulation, to forgive me, and my parents, and my kindred, and such of my brethren as have believed in Thee. Grant that all my needs be satisfied, through Thy bounty, O Thou Who art the King of Names. Thou art the most Bountiful of the bountiful, the Lord of all worlds.

He is God, exalted be His glory in wisdom and utterance!

Praise be to God Who has manifested the Light and through it illumined the world of inner meanings and expression, and Who has revealed the Fire and through it shone forth upon Moses on the Mount of mystic knowledge. Glory and praise, blessings and splendor be upon His Prophets and His chosen ones, whom He has made the Dawning-Places of His names and the Daysprings of His attributes and the Manifestations of His Self and the Recipients of His knowledge and the Treasuries of His verses - through whom were opened the gates of divine knowledge to all in the realm of possibility, and the Dove of certitude warbled upon the highest branches. There is none other God but Him. He has ever been in the heights of power and majesty, and in the summit of might and grandeur. His favor has been complete and His proof perfected and His evidence fulfilled and His sovereignty made mighty. He it is Who has sent down His verses and revealed His clear tokens. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O Mahdi! Upon thee be My glory! The Wronged One bears witness to thy turning, thy devotion, thy arising, thy presence, thy attentiveness, thy service and thy deeds in the Most Great Prison and the Most Mighty, Most Impregnable Fortress. We beseech God to assist thee and grant thee success, and to ordain for thee from the Supreme Pen the best of the hereafter and of this world. Verily He is the Lord of all mankind and the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below. There is none other God but Him, Who is established upon His mighty throne.

We make mention of thy father, whom We have remembered in such wise that his remembrance shall endure in the cities of knowledge and wisdom. We testify that he attained unto acceptance and witnessed that which God Himself has witnessed - that there is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. And We make mention of him who was named Nasrullah, whose mention thou desired. We beseech God to forgive him through His grace, to purify him through His loving-kindness, and to draw him nigh unto Him. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.

Thou hast hearkened unto the voice of the Wronged One in eloquent Arabic; now hear it in sweetest Persian. Praise be to God, the children of Abraham and the heirs of Moses have drunk from the ocean of divine knowledge and have heard the call of the Blessed Tree. This Wronged One has made mention of each one, and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to ordain for them that which shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Make mention of each one from the Wronged One, that perchance through the breezes of remembrance they may attain unto everlasting joy and be freed from the troubles of this world.

O Mahdi! Give thanks to the Goal of all the worlds Who has assisted thee to recognize Him and to turn toward Him, and in the nights and days seek thou the preservation of this most exalted station. Verily He is the Powerful, the Preserver, the Mighty, the Great. We counsel the loved ones of God with that which conduceth to the elevation of souls and the reformation of the world. No host hath been or is mightier than goodly deeds and pure character. With these hosts must they conquer the citadels of hearts. This is the true good that hath been mentioned and recorded in the Books and Scriptures and Tablets of God, exalted be His glory. Blessed is the soul that hath held fast unto the cord of grace and clung to the hem of trust in God. Such is among those men of whom He saith: "On them shall be no fear, neither shall they grieve."

Say: O friends! Hearken unto the voice of the Wronged One and sanctify yourselves from the doubts and allusions of the manifestations of idle fancies and the dawning-places of vain imaginings, that ye may be refreshed by the breezes of God's loving-kindness that waft at dawn, and attain unto everlasting life. God is aware and mankind doth witness that this Wronged One hath, from the earliest days until now, striven mightily to reform souls and unite hearts, that the horizons of the world might be illumined with the light of concord among nations, and that all might turn with spirit and joy toward the Supreme Horizon and occupy themselves with that which profiteth their souls. To this testifieth every informed sage and every discerning knower.

O Mahdi! We beseech God to assist thee in serving His Cause and to enable thee to do that which is pleasing unto Him. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing.

The honored beloved, his eminence Nabil ibn Nabil, may the 966 \[Baha'u'llah\] and His favors be upon him, may take note.

He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power

Praise be to God Who sent down the blessing, and verily it is a table spread that hath descended from the heaven of His grace, and it expresseth itself in every tongue through all things, and it is that blessing whereby whoso attaineth unto it shall neither hunger nor be troubled. And in the understanding of the divine ones it expresseth the Primal Reality and the Point of Unity and the Mystery of Oneness - the Beloved of the Lord of Names and the Best-Beloved of those who are in earth and heaven, Who was named Muhammad, may God's blessings and peace be upon him and his family among all peoples. And He is the Book whereby were sealed the mysteries of origin and return from God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower. And blessings and peace be upon him and his family and his companions through whom were raised the banners of divine knowledge and the seal of the choice wine was broken and the ocean of divine confirmation did surge, and upon those who acted according to what they were commanded by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

And then, this evanescent servant hath attained unto your exalted letter and found therein the fragrance of your love and sincerity and submission and humility before God alone. The servant beareth witness that you have attained the lights of divine unity and the station of detachment and have swum in the ocean of mystic knowledge until you discovered the pearl of utterance and the coral of inner meanings. The servant beseecheth his Lord to strengthen you and draw you nigh and aid you to accomplish what He loveth and approveth.

Although in truth that beloved one hath already attained this station, yet since prayer is beloved and good-pleasure is above all stations, from time to time this servant dareth to express such words. In truth this is a great and mighty station which none knoweth save Him. And after being informed and made aware it was submitted before His presence and He said: "The truth is with him, he hath spoken truthfully. We beseech God to aid His servants to perform pure deeds and speak truthfully and to righteousness and the fear of God. Verily He hath power over all things." End quote.

And regarding his eminence Haji Ali Askar, may the 966 \[Baha'u'llah\] and His favors be upon him, they wrote that the beloved one his eminence Amin, may the 966 \[Baha'u'llah\] be upon him, hath repeatedly mentioned him, and especially in these days the sun of permission hath dawned from the horizon of will. However, since the weather is unsettled and likewise the sea is turbulent, patience is preferable. If they remain in that city and its environs, after things settle they may proceed. Although God, exalted be His glory, hath been the Protector and the waves of the sea move not, nor have they moved, appear not, nor have they appeared, except by God's will, yet the intention is that in this winter season the sea hath not been, nor is, free from toil and hardship. Therefore their hardship is not beloved in the sight of this servant. And likewise They said if any work arose requiring return to their land, the reward of attaining the presence would be bestowed upon him. Verily he is among those who have succeeded in serving the Cause and have been adorned with the love of God, the Mighty, the Wise. End quote.

This transient one also conveyeth greetings and salutations to them. Another submission: whatever that beloved one doeth hath been and is according to the command, for at first They said complete association with known persons is not permitted, as people's properties are with them and the great ones of the earth await pretexts. Therefore one must act with utmost wisdom. This hath been and is explained in detail to travelers as well. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is indeed the Kind, the Affectionate. Any matter that occurreth for God's sake is beloved and predominant over other matters. This is what I heard from the tongue of Him Who speaketh today in the heart of the prison that which causeth to tremble the minds of the weak and the hearts of the foolish.

The final glad tidings is that on Saturday morning the 15th of Safar, acting as your spiritual representative, I attained unto visitation and circumambulation and was adorned with acceptance. Praise be to God that the letter was concluded with a mighty matter. The peace shining forth from the horizon of the Abode of Peace be upon you and upon those who have held fast to the Sure Handle and have acted according to what they were commanded by God, the Lord of all beings.

He is the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Powerful, the Most High, the Most Glorious

Praise be to God Who hath manifested Himself unto all created things through His Name that is sanctified above all names and attributes, and Who hath called all, through His loving-kindness and favors, unto the Dayspring of His Cause which is exalted above all directions, that all may turn unto the Dawning-Place of His grace and the Dayspring of His Revelation, and drink what He hath desired for them of the Kawthar of divine knowledge through His all-pervading favor over all contingent beings. Verily, the spirit, glory and splendor rest upon those who have heard, responded and turned unto Him, detached from idle fancies and allusions.

Praise be to God Who hath made for the Tree of His Cause branches and twigs that move at His mention and incline toward His direction, and from which is heard the praise of God, the All-Possessing, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. My spirit be a sacrifice unto you! Two blessed letters which were written to honor this evanescent one have been received. Praise be to the Beloved of the worlds Who hath made this unworthy one the recipient of the attention and favors of His blessed Afnan. Boundless joy and delight were occasioned by the sweet fragrances of your words, and the supplication that was submitted to the Most Holy Court reached the blessed vision, and as commanded, this evanescent servant presented all of it.

His grandeur be exalted! He saith: "O My Afnan! Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One in this mighty prison, and that which thou didst compose in praise of God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds, was chanted before His face. We have turned unto thee from this spot and make mention of thee with that which shall cause thy remembrance to endure throughout My glorious and mighty Kingdom. Despite the tribulations that surround Me, My Most Exalted Pen hath not ceased, and moveth at all times in celebration of God, the Lord of all names. Verily thy Lord is the Powerful, the Mighty. We beseech God to confirm thee in all conditions in that which thou art in the Cause of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed."

And likewise was revealed, addressing Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'l-?amid: "O ?amid! Hearken unto the call of this Exile from this near yet distant horizon. We have mentioned thee before and mention thee from this noble station. By God! There hath been ordained for whosoever hath turned unto God in this Revelation that which none hath comprehended save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing. Rejoice in My mention of thee. That which thou seest today shall perish, but that which hath been sent down from the presence of the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, shall endure for thee."

As to other news of this land, despite the encompassing presence of the heedless and the clamor of the polytheists, the divine fragrances of the Cause are spreading. Some time ago, the situation in this land became very severe, that is, the governor here rose up in opposition. Praise be to God, very soon the fire of his rancor was extinguished and the spark of his envy perished and disappeared. One day, a group was present in the Most Holy Court, namely some from Kha and ?a and others who had arrived in the Holy Land in these days. Mention was made of the envy of the divines and the wickedness of those heedless souls. He said that glory had been taken from those souls; even if they should cling to all means, they shall never attain unto it. The example of those souls is like embers of fire, and all of them have been and shall be extinguished by a single wave from the ocean of God's will.

In any case, that governor is gone and another has come who has been and continues to be in utmost humility. The items that were previously sent have arrived, and this servant reported their receipt. The later chest that was newly sent has reached Alexandria. They wrote that it would be sent on the return steamer, but this servant was greatly embarrassed as it caused trouble for you. My trust in you caused such boldness. The Branches and Afnans of the Blessed Tree especially convey their most glorious greetings to you, and furthermore this evanescent one's greetings to Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'l-?amid, upon him be the glory of God, depend upon your grace and favors. Those who circle round offer their pure devotion to your presence. The most wondrous, most exalted greetings and the most holy, most great, most glorious praise be upon you and upon those who have attained the honor of serving you.

The Honored Friend, Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Mahdi, one of the sons of Khalil, may the Glory of God rest upon him, may take note:

He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power! Praise be to God Who hath guided us to His path, caused us to speak His praise, sent down for us the proof and made manifest the way. He it is Who made us hear His verses and taught us what will profit us in this world and the next. Verily He is the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below. Prayers, praise, glorification and glory be upon His chosen ones and His friends who have not broken His covenant and His testament. These are servants whom God hath described in His scrolls, His psalms and His Book. Through them God hath aided His Cause and seized the oppressors through His justice. Through them His verses were spread abroad and His proof was made manifest, and through them He conquered the lands and manifested among the servants what He desired. Upon them be the grace of God and His care in the beginning and the return.

And then, the letter of that honored friend arrived and brought joy. Praise be to God that you are confirmed in mention and praise, in love and faithfulness. As the fragrance of steadfastness and affection wafted from the letter, it became the cause of boundless joy. After its observation and reading, it was taken to the Holy Presence and presented before the Face. This is what the Tongue of Utterance spoke:

"O Mahdi! Thy letter arrived and the servant present before the Face presented it. We beseech God that He may confirm thee and grant thee success, that thou mayest be occupied at all times with the mention of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Time and again this Wronged One hath mentioned thee with a mention that appeareth for the sake of God. It is the guide of souls and the attractor of hearts. He is the Herald and He is the Messenger of the Garden of inner meanings. Through Him the soil of hearts is transformed and temples are adorned with His ornament. God willing, at all times you will hold fast to the remembrance of God and that whereby His Cause is uplifted. Verily He is the Helper of those who turn to Him and the Guide of the seekers."

Convey greetings and glorification to the friends wherever you meet them on behalf of the Wronged One. We beseech God to confirm all in steadfastness in His Cause. Verily He is the Answerer of prayers. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

And We make mention of him who is named Sadiq. Verily he was present and heard and saw and witnessed and knew. We beseech God to preserve him through the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Verily He is the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Praise be to the Goal of the world that you have been confirmed in that which is the cause of eternal salvation. You have ever been remembered. The days of your presence have not been forgotten. I beseech God to ordain that which contains the good of this world and the next.

The beloved of the heart, one of the two Most Exalted Names, Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid 'Ali, may the glory of God and His care and favors be upon him, delivered your letter, and likewise the letter that was sent in his service was also seen. They have perfect love for you. In truth they are well-wishers of the world and its peoples. They themselves will surely send a reply.

Regarding what you wrote about entering Qarabagh, God willing it was and is blessed. After being presented in the Presence, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke this blessed word: "To remain in that land, so long as it passeth in spirit and fragrance, is beloved."

God willing, it is hoped that the days will pass for you in spirit and fragrance, and that you will be the cause of building up hearts and minds, that the heedless may become aware and the sleeping may lift their heads from the couch of negligence. The Command is in God's hand - He doeth what He willeth and decreeth what He pleaseth.

To the honored brother Jinab-i-Aqa Mulla Muhammad-Sadiq, may the glory and care of God be upon him, I convey glorification and seek confirmation for him. God willing, may he in all conditions be mindful of wisdom, hold fast to wisdom, and speak with wisdom. And whatever he requested from the two beloved Most Exalted Names, may the glory and favors of God be upon them both, will be expressed and God willing will be sent.

Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon the loved ones of God who have acted according to what they were commanded in His Clear Book. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

O my God and my Lord! Thou seest what Thou seest and dost witness what Thou dost witness, and Thou beholdest, O my Beloved, how I have been afflicted at the hands of Thy creatures, such that I have fallen into this well that hath neither beginning nor end. Before Me riseth up the Serpent of wrath with jaws stretched to engulf Me, and behind Me stalketh the lion of anger intent on tearing Me in pieces, and above Me, O My Well-Beloved, are the clouds of Thy decree, raining upon Me the showers of tribulations, whilst beneath Me are fixed the spears of misfortune, ready to wound My limbs and My body. Yet O my God, despite these tribulations which no other among Thy servants hath endured, I give thanks to Thee with my inner and outer tongue, my visible and invisible being, and I say: Where is Thy hidden grace, and where are Thy lofty favors, O Thou Who art my Creator and Ordainer? Glorified art Thou, O my Best-Beloved! If Thou dost not ward off from Me these tribulations that have descended, withhold not from My heart the sweet delights of Thy wondrous revelation, and if Thou dost not lift from Me these calamities that have befallen Me, close not off from My face the sweet-scented breezes of Thy sanctity. Glorified art Thou, O my God! By Thy might, the melodies of Thy unity shall not cease from my mouth despite the sorrows that encompass Me from the manifestations of Thy negation and the dawning-places of Thy wrath, nor shall my lips cease moving despite the cares that have seized me from the direction of Thy decree. O my God, I have reached such a state of grief that the lamp weepeth at what hath befallen Me at the hands of the oppressors among Thy creatures and the rebellious among Thy creation. Glorified art Thou, O my Beloved! Hear Thou the cry of this oppressed one in this Most Great Prison, O Thou in Whose hand is the Kingdom of might and eternity, and in Whose right hand is the sovereignty of command and destiny. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy power and ordainest through Thy will what Thou desirest. By Thy beauty, O my First and my Last, many days and known nights have passed, and I have not emerged from the house of sorrow to meet Thy loved ones, though I long to meet them that I might behold in their faces the lights of Thy unity and find comfort in their presence through the sweet breezes of the love and affection for Thee that waft from their hearts. Therefore, O my God, take me not to task for this grievous error, and leave me not in this state, O Thou in Whose hand is the dominion of might in the most exalted heaven. Thou knowest, O my God, that this is not due to any pride towards them or independence from them, but rather, O my Beloved, I fear they would be saddened by My sadness and troubled by My trouble. Therefore have I kept myself from meeting them and veiled my face from their sight. I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Name through which appeared the sun of Thy beauty and the moon of Thy majesty, and through which were raised the heavens of the sanctity of Thy oneness in this Word whereby were manifested the melodies of the Sovereign of the might of Thy bounty, and through which all existence entered the pavilion of Thy oneness, and through which the servants acknowledged and confessed that which Thou didst call them to from the throne of Thy grandeur - that Thou mayest make those who have clung to Thee and to the hem of the robe of Thy loving-kindness to be among those who are honored at all times by meeting with Thee, who hear Thy melodies, who serve in Thy service, who stand firm in Thy Cause, who gaze upon Thy countenance - for Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Then I beseech Thee, O my God, by this treasured Name and this hidden Word, that Thou accept from Thy servant who hath migrated unto Thee and repeatedly circumambulated the sanctuary of Thy holiness, that Thou fulfill what he hath guaranteed to Thy loved ones - for Thou art the Fulfiller, the Giver, the Wise. Then raise them to a station wherein they shall perform Thy prayer from time immemorial and which shall never cease throughout eternity - for the elevation of this prayer which none among Thy creatures hath comprehended. Then accept, O my God, from these ones the compensation for the yearning of the lovers in their remoteness and separation from Thee, and the compensation for those who have attained unto nearness to Thee and reunion with Thee. Then send down, O my God, upon the hearts of Thy loved ones that whereby Thy servant who hath been named Salman may be loved, that they may honor him with Thine honor and turn toward him through Thy grace, such that they withhold not from him what Thou hast given them through Thy bounty according to their capacity - for Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest, and Thou art the Mighty, the Exalted, the Generous. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful!

My God, my God! Thou seest my tears and hearest my sighs. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Throne, by the Manifestations of Thy Cause, by the Daysprings of Thy verses, the Sources of Thy clear proofs, the Fountainheads of Thy commandments, and the Points of descent of Thy revelation, to aid Thy servant who hath turned toward Thy most exalted horizon and held fast to the cord of Thy bounty, O Lord of all beings and Master of the throne on high and of the dust below, to act according to what Thou hast commanded him in Thy Book which Thou didst send down upon the Dawning-Place of Thy most excellent names and Thy most exalted attributes, whereby Thou didst separate truth from falsehood, the knowing from the ignorant, the guide from the misguider, the one who accepteth from the one who turneth away.

I testify, O my God, in this my position, to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee. Thou hast ever been powerful through Thy might and dominant through Thy Will. Thou art He Whom neither the might of kings nor the clamor of subjects could hinder. Through Thy power Thou hast manifested that before which the necks of nations have bowed down and the voices of all in the world have been hushed.

Thou seest me, O my God, far removed after Thou didst shelter me in the protection of Thy supreme mercy, and poor after Thou didst cause me to dwell upon the shore of the sea of wealth. O Lord! Withhold me not from gazing toward Thy most exalted horizon, nor my tongue from Thy remembrance, O Lord of all names and Creator of heaven, nor my ears from hearkening unto Thy verses, O Lord of all beings. By Thy glory, O my God! I know with certain knowledge that the eye was not created save for the Greatest Vision, nor the tongue except for Thy remembrance, O Possessor of all power.

I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of the Kingdom, by the mysteries of Thy dominion and what lay hidden in the ocean of Thy knowledge, and by that whereby the pavilion of Thy glory was raised upon the highest standards and the banners of Thy grandeur were hoisted in the most exalted station, and by Him through Whom the valley flowed and the clouds rained, and by His family and His companions, to ordain for me the good of the Hereafter and of this world. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Alas, alas! How can I mention Thee, O God of the world and Goal of the nations, after my knowledge that remembrance of aught else but Thee befitteth not Thy grandeur and power, nor is worthy of Thy most holy court and Thy sacred station? Therefore, alas, alas! O my Lord and my Support, my grievous sins have prevented me from drawing nigh unto the ocean of Thy mercy, and my great transgressions have come between me and the sun of Thy grace. By Thy glory, O Goal of all creation and Object of all things possible, the heart loveth naught save for its turning toward Thy most exalted horizon, and I desire not the eye save for beholding Thy traces, O Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust below.

The spirit is beloved if it be sacrificed in Thy path, and the body acceptable if it be cast upon the dust in Thy name. I know not, O my God, my Lord and my Goal, what Thou hast ordained for this Thy servant. Hast Thou ordained for him to enter into the depths of the sea of Thy oneness and the ocean of Thy grace and mercy, or hath Thy irrevocable decree withheld him from what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones? O Lord! I am the thirsty one, and with Thee is the Kawthar of life; I am the transgressor, and with Thee is the ocean of forgiveness. Deprive me not, O my God, from the ocean of Thy bounty, and make me not deprived of Thy grace, O Thou in Whose grasp is the kingdom of all possibilities. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Bestower.

O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Prophets and Thy chosen ones who were so attracted by Thy remembrance that neither the ranks of the world nor the opposition of the nations could withhold them. They arose and proclaimed: "God is our Lord and the Lord of the mighty Throne and the elevated Seat!" They spent what they possessed in Thy path and hastened to the place of sacrifice with such joy as to astonish the Concourse on high and the dwellers of Thy Paradise, O Lord of all things--those whom Thou hast mentioned in Thy Book and described through Thy Will and Purpose. These are servants, honored ones who speak not until He hath spoken, and who do as commanded.

Make me in all conditions one who acteth according to what Thou hast commanded me, who forsaketh what Thou hast forbidden me, who remaineth steadfast in Thy Cause, who speaketh in Thy remembrance and praise. Then I beseech Thee by Him through Whom the breezes of Thy verses were wafted and by Whose advent the heavens of Thy sky were honored, to aid me to act according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Then forgive me and my parents through Thy grace and bounty. Verily, Thou art the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

O Siyyid Mahdi and Mirza Mahdi! In the Name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious! This is a Day in which every soul and spirit must arise to promote the Cause of God - that is, to teach His Cause with wisdom and utterance, not through disputation. Such a Cause has appeared that even the pure ones and those near to God have been confounded, let alone the idolatrous and hateful embodiments who have ever been and shall ever be non-existent and unmentioned. O Mahdi! This is the Day of the Most Great Steadfastness. Stand firm in the Cause and, to the extent possible, do not neglect to promote God's Cause. We are aware of the sorrows that have befallen you, but be patient as We were patient, and be not of the perturbed ones. Salman is departing, as are several others, and after their arrival you will be informed of the details of this land. The idolatrous embodiments are constantly occupied with new calumnies, and they have surely sent letters to various regions. By My life! If people had insight, they would recognize from these very fabricated calumnies the station, power, measure and falsehood of those who oppose and war against God. Just as these false embodiments are occupied with spreading fabricated words, you too must occupy yourself with spreading words of truth and sincerity, that perchance the people may not be prevented by the narrators of lies and calumnies, and may be confirmed in the path of God, to Whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and earth. Write to Mirza Baqir: "Stand firm in the Cause and grieve not for what was taken from you. God will soon give you double what you lost. He is the Powerful over what He willeth, and He is Powerful over all things. Beware lest you grieve over such matters, for all are God's servants - He takes and gives, causes to die and brings to life. Whatever He does to anyone is better for him than the treasures of the heavens and earth. Be patient in what has befallen you, then stand firm in the Cause. Grieve not in the least, for soon He will bestow upon you that which will gladden you in truth. He is the Protector of the doers of good." And convey to Jinab-i-Rasul that his exposition has reached the Seat of Exposition. Praise God that the favors of the All-Glorious and the Beauty of the All-Merciful have been and will be with you. Sing and warble as you please, and grieve not for anything, for He loves His servants who do good, and will never neglect them for less than a moment. He is near to those who love Him. Furthermore, the lamentations of Aqa Muhammad-'Ali were heard. It behooves him to be thus, for he heard God's melody with his own ears and was with Him in prison and witnessed what befell Us of tribulations. Convey to him Our greetings and give him the glad tidings of Our remembrance of him, that he may be of those who rejoice. Then convey Our greetings to the people of the sanctuary and to all the friends, both Arab and Persian. Then remind them of this wondrous Remembrance. And the Glory be upon you and upon them and upon God's servants, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Sovereign, the Wise. They commanded to write that God's favors have ever encompassed you and will continue to do so. That you have not yet been summoned has been due to the wisdom of God's Cause, for this Servant has ever sacrificed His life for the good of God's Cause, and I love that God's loved ones should all act likewise. Had you been summoned, given the conflicts in that land, it would not have been advisable; otherwise you would surely have been summoned by now. Now remain in perfect peace and tranquility. God willing, you will be summoned in the hot season. Grieve not at your separation, but be patient and be not of the sorrowful ones. God willing, we hope you will be blessed with attaining Our presence. Rest assured and fear not, then speak forth in praise of God among the worlds.

In the Name of God, the Ever-Abiding, the Imperishable!

Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the Realm of Divine Identity at the Sacred Spot of Oneness by the Tongue of Divinity: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Leave behind all creation and turn with thy heart unto God. By God! The heaven hath been cleft asunder and the Lord of the Day of Mutual Calling hath come. Say: O people of hypocrisy! Whither do ye flee? Can ye penetrate the extremities of My grandeur and dominion? Nay, by the Lord of the Day of Separation!

Know thou that We have rent asunder the veils and shattered the idols of vain desire when We raised up one among the servants and adorned his heart with the ornament of strength and certitude, and sent him with a Tablet from thy Lord unto him by whom the dwellers of Paradise lament at eventide and at dawn, that he might know that He is indeed the One Who doeth what He willeth. The tribulations of the world deter Him not from that which He desireth. He is, in truth, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Compelling.

When the Tablet was opened, the Great Cry was raised anew, and all who dwell on earth were thunderstruck save whom thy Lord, Who causeth night to succeed day, willed to spare. Can anyone create the like thereof? Nay, by thy Lord! Thus hath the matter been decreed by God, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

When thou art honored with God's Tablet, take it with power from Us, then hasten unto her who claimeth faith in God, the Lord of lords. Say: I have come unto thee from the Dawning-Place of verses with thy Lord's clear proofs. Then bring forth the Tablet and recite unto her what hath been sent down from the Supreme Pen. Thus hath the matter been decreed and truth hath come with clear evidence and proof. Say: If thou be fair in God's sight, can any word equal what thou hast witnessed? By God! Wert thou to be fair, thou wouldst find from every word of God's words the sweet fragrances of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Can any matter of his Lord be obscure to one who is endowed with insight? Nay, by My Self! Be fair, O ye who are possessed of vision.

He hath appeared in such wise that none can speak in His presence. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say: The Word of God shineth forth among words even as the sun at high noon. Fear God, O people, and follow not every doubting idolater. Hath vain desire withheld thee from thy Most Glorious Lord, or have names prevented thee from turning toward God, the Creator of earth and heaven? Leave behind all who are on earth, for by My life, all that dwelleth thereon shall perish, and the Tongue of Grandeur and Power proclaimeth: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.

Sever not the tie that bindeth thee to Him; hold fast unto it. Thus doth the Lord of eternity command thee at this moment when He is established upon the throne of His Most Great Name, while hosts of evil have surrounded Him. Say: Hearken unto the word of thy Lord and reflect upon him by whom thou wert made to pause in a Cause but for which the Bayan would not have been revealed nor would the Dove have warbled upon the branches. Hast thou forgotten what thou didst witness from Him after We removed the veils for thee? Can aught be hidden from God Who hath caused all things to proclaim His praise? This is better for thee than all that is hidden or manifest.

Arise through My might and power, then take the cup of detachment in the name of thy Lord, the Creator of all things. Then drink therefrom in remembrance of thy Lord, the Revealer of verses. Wouldst thou dwell in the spider's house after the coming of the Lord of all kingdoms? Leave it to its people, then turn thee toward this House round which circle the Concourse on High at morn and eventide. By Him Who gave Me utterance, I desire naught but good for thee thereby, and remind thee purely for the sake of thy Lord, that thou mayest abandon thy desire and hold fast to the hem of thy Master. To this testify all atoms, O thou who hast turned unto God \[...\]

Thereto beareth witness every atom, that thou, O thou who hast turned towards God and gazed upon His countenance, must cast upon them the words of thy Lord. If thou beholdest in their countenance the radiance of the All-Merciful, then draw thou nigh unto them, but if they be veiled by the dust of the fire, then turn away from them. Thus hast thou been commanded by the Lord of all men. Fear not thine own self; be as thy Lord was. Dost thou not see that from the horizon of tribulation, beneath the swords of destiny, He calleth the peoples of creation unto God, the Lord of all names, and the might of the wicked deterreth Him not? We have sent down unto thee a Tablet whereof were but one letter to descend upon every mountain, thou wouldst surely behold it soaring, out of longing, toward the Dawning-Place of Names and Attributes. Gather thou My loved ones together, then make mention of them on My behalf, that they may be drawn unto the station from whose horizon hath shone the Sun of the remembrance of the name of thy Lord, illumining thereby all who dwell in the realms of being.

He is God, exalted is He. O Rahim! Hearken unto what this sorrowful Bird warbleth unto thee from the hidden words, that thou mayest ascend unto the station which God hath created and ordained for thee, wherein the censure of the critic, the denial of the denier, and the heedlessness of the proud shall not hold thee back. Hear thou My words and inscribe them upon the tablet of thy heart, lest thou forget the decree of love from this Servant Who hath been afflicted among the servants and desireth to depart from this land by reason of what hath befallen Him through the whisperings of the sinful and the intimations of the heedless. It is as though I were imprisoned in a house of iron, finding for Myself neither helper nor friend. Say: O people! Have mercy upon this One Who hath drunk from the cup of destiny, upon Whom hath descended the decree of divine will, and upon Whom have flowed the oceans of tribulation. By God! I weep with the eyes of My heart, cry out with the tongue of My inner being, and lament with the essence of My being. O My brother! If thou wouldst remove the veil of limitation from thine hearing and cleanse it with the water of thy love, thou wouldst find the traces of My sorrow in the realm of possibilities, hear the weeping of the holy ones in the concourse on high, witness blood flowing from the eyes of the dwellers of the realm of eternity in the heaven of mystery. Thou wouldst not rest in thy place due to My oppression, nor find repose on thy seat due to My deprivation, nor drink water due to the burning of My liver, nor find solace with anyone due to My loneliness and the multitude of Mine enemies. By God! Were I to loose the reins of the Pen, the pillars of eternity would be shaken, and the pavilions of existence would not be raised from behind the veil of nothingness. But I have concealed it in My heart and drink rivers of blood from My heart, lest anyone take notice of what hath descended upon Me and befallen Me. Know thou that We loved thee before and love thee now, and I desire that thou shouldst be detached unto God and reliant upon Him, that the fire of love may burn so intensely in thy breast that thou canst find no rest in thy love for God nor patience in His good-pleasure, that thou mayest walk upon the earth with tranquility and dignity as though walking before the Almighty, forgetting all remembrances that would prevent thee from entering the paths of the righteous, that thou mayest be an aid to the light in these dark and gloomy times which have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth, such that I fear they may encompass all servants and drown all who exist. Therefore, convey My greetings and glorification to My loved ones and those who claim to love Me, and remind them in these days the like of which eyes have never witnessed nor minds conceived, and say to them: O servants! Why have ye turned away from God, your Creator? Whereby have ye associated partners with Him? By what authority do ye spread corruption in the land without His leave and slay people without clear proof or Book? Say: Are ye not ashamed before Him Who created you, from Whom is your beginning and unto Whom is your end? By what reason do ye harm this Youth Who hath believed in God, His Lord, turned away from all else but Him, advanced toward the sanctuary of His beauty and the Kaaba of His Self, and Who hath become hidden from the eyes of men such that ye see Him but know Him not? He hath become like a moving thread in the heart due to the thinness of His bones and the delicacy of His skin through what hath touched Him of sorrows and the fire of deprivation. If thou wouldst hear from Me and accept My counsel, thou wouldst find the fragrance of eternity from the Most Exalted Garment and attain to the most excellent station and furthermost place. Travel in the land and migrate from this city to a land which thou lovest, and remind the servants not to seek corruption. And if thou desirest to return to Us afterward, thou shalt have permission from this Servant. But grieve not over anything, nor be troubled in any matter. God will remove grief from thee and clothe thee with the garment of joy. There is no God but Him. He spendeth as He pleaseth, and He is the Mighty, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting. Soon will the banners of tribulation be raised in this land and the sun of trials appear in this heaven, and the people will then be tested, and We say: We are God's and unto Him do we return. That which hath descended from the H after the B.

This is the Tablet of Truth which hath been sent down from the heaven of Command. Whoso readeth it and pondereth thereon, God shall raise him up in the midmost heart of the Ridvan adorned with such glory that the lights of the All-Merciful shall shine forth from him and illuminate thereby the peoples of the highest paradise. He is the Truth Who hath ever been witnessed at the horizon of truth, through truth, upon the truth. O people of truth! The Truth hath appeared from the horizon of truth in this Truth Who hath dawned from the Dayspring of truth, Who speaketh the truth and remindeth you of the truth. Beware lest ye forget the truth at the time when He took from you the covenant of His own truth, and be not of them who turned away from the truth and were among the heedless. Say: By God! The Truth now calleth out before Him and informeth all created things that this indeed is the Truth Who hath appeared through truth, and verily He is the Truth through Whom truth was established aforetime and shall be established hereafter. O people of truth! Behold ye the Truth in what shineth forth from the sun of His beauty, then hearken unto the melodies of truth that proceed from His lips, then drink from the Salsabil of truth that He offereth you from the cup of His bounty, and eat of the favors of truth that have been sent down from the heaven of His mighty sovereignty and the clouds of His holy grace. Then take shelter in the shade of the Tree of Truth, this Youth, Who when He moveth within Himself causeth to move thereby all manifestations of truth and suns of oneness, and when He remaineth still within Himself, the beauty of truth and His temple are established upon an exalted and impregnable throne. O people of truth! If ye would but cleanse your eyes from the dust of contingent things and whatsoever proceedeth therefrom that befitteth not the sovereignty of names and attributes, ye would witness that the Manifestations of truth, its Daysprings, its Dawning-places and its Repositories all circle round this Truth Who hath appeared through truth and been established through truth upon the throne, before Whose shadow all who are in the heavens and on earth prostrate themselves, though they recognize it not and are unaware within themselves, being among those who are heedless of this Truth Who, were He to rend asunder the veil of glory from the face of beauty, would cause all things to proclaim, confirmed by the Holy Spirit even as the Beauty Himself was confirmed in the realm of eternity: "Verily I am the Truth, there is no God but Him, and verily we all, at the appearance of this Truth, are among those who prostrate themselves." And verily this is He before Whom walk the Manifestations of truth, behind Whom proceed the Daysprings of divinity, at Whose right hand move the Essences of glory and at Whose left advance the Temples of the All-Merciful, all of them speaking, crying out and proclaiming: "O people of the Bayan! By God, the tongues of the All-Merciful have given the lie to your claims that ye believe in God, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. For ye claimed within yourselves that ye had believed in God and in His Manifestation Who was named 'Ali before Nabil, yet when His Messenger came with authority from the divine Command upon clouds of holiness in the most exalted Paradise, ye denied Him and rejected Him, even to the point where ye pronounced sentence of death upon Him just as the divines of the Qur'an pronounced sentence upon 'Ali aforetime, the Manifestation of His exalted, transcendent, powerful, supreme and omnipotent Self. Therefore nothing do ye pass by that doth not give you the lie and dissociate itself from you and seek refuge in God from meeting with you. By God! Were ye to judge fairly within yourselves, ye would witness that the very breath that proceedeth from you giveth you the lie, that the heaven raised above your heads dissociateth itself from you, and that all that raineth down from the clouds denieth what issueth from your tongues, were ye but of them who hear. Through you have the clouds of mercy and grace been withheld, and the life of the people of the highest paradise transformed, and the countenance of grandeur turned pale, for ye have done what none before you have done. We have concealed it through Our grace, for verily We are the All-Bountiful, the Almighty, the All-Wise. What We have manifested among men is but a drop from the ocean of your deeds; otherwise, were I to speak the truth concerning what ye have done, the command of what shall be would return to what was, existence would revert to absolute and utter nothingness, and all that is witnessed in the kingdom would be transformed to dust. Thus hath the Command been sent down from the presence of the Mighty, the All-Bestowing, if ye be of them who are mindful.

We have revealed to the renowned Kadkhuda Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali, that he may be watchful of the Most Great Horizon \[the Seat of God\], the Mighty, the All-Knowing. In the Name of God, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy! These are the verses of holiness which have been sent down from the presence of One mighty and wise. He guides the people to the heaven of grace and bestows upon them that which quickens their hearts and draws them nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Blessed is he who finds the sweetness of his Lord's remembrance, who detaches himself from the world, and ascends to the station wherein he hears the melodies of God with his ear and beholds the signs of God with his eye, and is possessed of clear vision. When he attains to that station and arrives at this holy, pure and exalted Seat, he becomes so steadfast in the Cause of his Lord that he regards all else as under His shadow, and his gaze never wavers from this Most Great, Most Pure and Wondrous Horizon. O servant! Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the holy precincts of this Blessed Spot: "I am, verily, God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forebears of old. Cast away from thyself whatsoever keepeth thee back from God, thy Lord, then enter beneath the shadow of His Name, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful." When thou hast sanctified thyself from allusions and purified thyself from intimations, the breezes of the All-Merciful will draw thee to the right hand of Paradise. Then loose thy tongue in remembrance amidst the heavens and earth and convey thy Lord's Cause, for God hath prescribed unto every soul the duty to deliver His Cause. Thus hath the matter been decreed from the presence of One mighty and powerful. Whoso opens his lips today in remembrance of his Lord will be reinforced by the hosts of God's revelation through wondrous inspiration, and God will cause the Kawthar of divine knowledge to flow from his mouth and will make him speak with wisdom and utterance in such wise that none among all created things shall be able to speak in his presence. By God, O servant who art mentioned before the Throne! Were it not for the opposition of the people of the Bayan against thy Lord, the All-Merciful, I would have manifested, through the power which God granted Me before the creation of all things, that which would have caused all necks to bow before the command of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. By My life! If what hath befallen Me at their hands were to befall thee, thou wouldst weep for My loneliness, then My solitude, then My tribulation between the claws of those who were created by My command. But We have concealed it lest the cry of the sincere ones be raised. Thou knowest that the people of the Bayan used to hide their faces behind veils to protect themselves, and were among the heedless. We were manifest between the heavens and earth, speaking in praise of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. I did not protect Myself for less than a moment, and was ever shining above the heads of the enemies with the lights of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful, until the Beauty of the Word dawned from the horizon of grandeur and power and the Cause encompassed all the worlds. Then they felt secure in themselves and emerged from behind the veil with swords of hatred and manifest deceit, striking Me at every moment with their blades. By God! There remained no place on My body that was not struck by iron, and they reached such heights of vainglory that they denied the proof whereby their own faith had been established and their mention had been exalted among the servants, both great and small. Such was the condition of these people - they say what they understand not and imagine themselves to be among the doers of good. Say: Today, whosoever turneth away from this Cause hath turned away from God and His Messengers; his name shall not be mentioned before the Throne and he shall be in manifest loss. As for thee, avoid such as these, then put thy trust in thy Lord. He will protect thee in all conditions and guard thee from the hosts of Satan. Be thou steadfast in thy love for thy Lord and fear not those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God and were among the idolaters. Put them behind thee, then turn thy face toward thy Lord at all times. Thus have We detailed the remembrance for thee and informed thee of what hath befallen Us, that thou mayest become aware of the harm that hath touched Us from these heedless ones. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who have remained steadfast in the Cause and were among the firm ones.

His Holiness the Afnan, Aqa Siyyid 'Ali, upon him be the Most Glorious Splendor of God. 15 Rabi'u'l-Avval 1304.

He is God, exalted be His station, to Whom belong greatness and power.

Praise, sanctified from utterance and exposition, befitteth and beseemeth the Goal of the world, Who through the light of Hijaz illumined the world of metaphor with the light of truth, and through the fragrance of Ba??a perfumed the horizons. Exalted be His greatness, perfect His proof, and complete His testimony. And blessings and peace be upon the noblest of His creation and Dawning-Place of His names, and upon His family and companions through whom was manifested God's power amongst His servants and His might throughout His lands. Glory be unto Thee, O my God, Lord of the seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne and the manifestations of Thy sovereignty to assist the people of unity to act according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book, whereby Thou didst separate between the monotheists and the polytheists, and guided those who turned unto Thee to Thy straight path, and taught them what would preserve them from that which harmeth them outwardly and inwardly. Then I beseech Thee, O Goal of the world and Object of worship of the nations, to enable them to do what Thou lovest and approvest, that perchance sorrows may be changed to joy, abasement to supreme glory, and weakness to the power which Thou hast mentioned in Thy mighty Book. Verily Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Praise be to Thee, O God of the worlds!

May my spirit be a sacrifice for you! The illustrious letter which was issued from the exalted pen bestowed the bounty of joy and granted the food of gladness. This food is in truth, in its primary station, the most delicious of the world's bounties. The servant beseecheth the Lord of the throne and earth to strengthen your honor and to ordain your nearness and return, and to manifest through you that which will diffuse its fragrance throughout the world through the eternity of His most beautiful names and His supreme attributes. Verily He hath power over all things.

You sent the letter of his honor Aqa Mu'a??am (Ismu'llah al-A?daq), upon him be from all things the Most Glorious Splendor. It caused boundless joy. In truth it was a musk-pod of delight which was opened in this land, for it was adorned with mention and praise of the Goal of the worlds, and likewise with news of the health and well-being of the Afnan in that land. The servant beseecheth for his honor and those with him glory, exaltation, wealth, bounty and power. After its reading and perusal it was presented before the Countenance and He said:

"O My Afnan, upon thee be My glory! Act according to what We have spoken and commanded." It was a comprehensive word that issued from the tongue of the Wronged One, namely that whatever reacheth you, take it and be honored with its acceptance, but it should remain with your honor as a trust, that perchance the purpose of the Afnan, upon him be the glory of the All-Merciful, may be realized. Verily We send greetings upon thee and upon those who have loved Me and do love Me. End.

Praise be to God, they arrived and the news of their arrival, well-being and tranquility was each a herald speaking. In all conditions we offer thanks and praise to God, glorified be His majesty, for He hath bestowed that which hath had and hath no likeness, peer or similitude. And regarding the House, we hope that the intention of his honor Aqa Mu'a??am (Ismu'llah al-A?daq), upon him be the Most Glorious Splendor of God, may be realized and may come from the world of ideals into the world of being. To the true beloved one Aqa Mirza Mu?sin, upon him be the Splendor of God, there is somewhat of a name present, rather a whole world of regret, for I was not successful in presenting a response to his blessed letter, but there is hope that now efforts will be made to make amends. Mention was made of the spiritual beloved Janab-i-Aqa Mirza Husayn, upon him be God's peace. Praise be to God, this too increased the bounty of joy and delight. God willing may they be confirmed and assisted in what they have intended and do intend in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. Peace and praise and glory be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.

Regarding the 40-yard pieces and the white fabrics that were sent, all arrived exactly as specified in your esteemed letter and were accepted with honor. However, as commanded, if at some point four rolls of high quality thick 40-yard fabric could be sent, that would be appreciated. Praise be to God that your honor is engaged in service to the Cause.

Regarding the Huquq funds that you had written about, you sent the exact copy of this servant's note to Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Ahmad, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty, and likewise regarding the hundred tumans which your honor, even though the Huquq funds had not arrived, wrote to Jinab-i-Afnan, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty, asking them to deliver - all these matters were presented to the Most Holy Court. His word, exalted be His mention and His utterance: "Blessed are those Afnans who have attained to My recognition and heard My call and have arisen to serve My holy, mighty, magnificent Cause. They are under the gaze of their Lord's mercy and He has ordained for them that which shall profit them in the next world and in this one. He is verily the Deliverer, the Preserver, the Bestower, the Generous."

If one observes with an illumined eye what has transpired, he will testify that the oceans of divine mercy, favor and kindness have encompassed the Two Luminous Lights. He has preserved them and honored them and exalted them, and in these latter days they have attained to what their Merciful Lord desired of His favor. What you have written to Jinab-i-Afnan A. and H., upon him be the glory of God, and what you have recommended, is acceptable before the Throne. Today all the friends of God should look to the matter of the Two Luminous Lights and carry out what is beloved, especially the Afnans of the Divine Lote-Tree and particularly those Afnans who have arisen to serve the Cause - what they have done has been and is beloved.

And regarding the hundred tumans that you wrote about, if permission is granted and it is accepted, the hundred tumans will not be deducted from the Huquq funds and the full amount will be sent, so that the Truth may have accepted these hundred tumans from this non-existent one. This matter was also presented and accepted. He said the Afnan wished to achieve this service which is truly one of the great services to the Cause of God, and We accepted it, for whatever pertains to the Two Luminous Lights is counted among the services to the Truth. By the life of God, theirs is an excellent beginning and end. We have restrained the Pen from mentioning what is concealed today. Were We to loose its reins, there would appear from it that which would cause every living thing to hasten to the place they both turned to. Thus has the Tongue of Grandeur spoken at this hour.

The remainder of the Huquq funds, if they arrive, have been allocated for the captives and travelers of this land. After receipt they should be sent, as was detailed previously according to instructions. The mention you made of the attention of the honored Afnans, upon them be from all glory its most glorious, was presented to the Most Holy Court. He said We have previously given permission and that permission is now adorned with a new ornament, but in all conditions they should be mindful of wisdom which is one of the divine commandments. He is verily the Helper, the Preserver, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Hold fast to the cord of wisdom and trust in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He is your Preserver and your Helper and your Bestower. He is with you in all conditions. Rejoice, O My Afnans, in the mercy that has preceded you from One who is All-Knowing, All-Seeing.

The various funds that you had written should be sent to the Most Holy Court were presented. Praise be to God, they were adorned with the ornament of acceptance. He said the small debts should be paid and with the remainder a property should be acquired, as the matter of housing in this land has become very difficult due to the large population and small size of the city, or lands should be purchased so their yields may be an enduring fruit for the one who sent them.

This servant submits that this matter is among the great divine favors, for it has occurred by God's command in the days of the Truth. We praise Him through the duration of the kingdom and the realm. And truly this is cause for rejoicing.

He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power

Befitting and proper is good mention and pleasing praise for the gathering of the friends of God, who have become detached from self and attached to God. Trust in God is a firm cord and resignation to His will is the most upright and secure handle. How blessed is the soul that has attained to this most exalted station. "Whoso trusteth in God, sufficient unto him is He." I beseech God to give His friends to drink from the cup of trust and to bestow upon them from the chalice of reliance. The prosperity of the world and its development is a book that tells of its ruin. Blessed is the soul whose heart is free and detached from the world and all that is therein. Such a one is worthy to make mention of the blessed Word of Unity. Praise be to God that the favored community has attained to this station and acknowledges and confesses the oneness of God. For the exaltation of the Word of Unity they have borne a hundred thousand afflictions and faced the arrows of martyrdom in His path. The soul has no station in this regard, nor does the spirit have any rank. Would that we were like the leaves of the trees, which have no motion of their own - their movements come from the wind, and the wind appears through the Will. Would that we servants too had our motion and stillness proceed from the Will of God, exalted be His glory. Though this station has not yet appeared, there is hope that through divine confirmations and the endeavors of His friends it will become manifest. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, and take as intercessors the Lord of "Were it not for thee" and His family and companions, that perchance the door of joy may be opened and His relief may come, and He may purify His servants from defilements and grant them ease. Verily He has power over all things.

Thereafter, the beloved of the heart, that is, the honored Haji Seyyed Javad, upon him be the Glory of God, has repeatedly made mention of you and has presented before the face of the Lord that which is the cause of joy and the source of gladness. It is hoped that from the ocean of divine bounty and the infinite mercy of the All-Merciful He will manifest through him that which will cause his mention and name to endure as long as His names and attributes endure, and in every moment grant him a portion from the cup of His favor. He is the Powerful One Whom the power of the world cannot withhold and Whom the hosts of nations cannot prevent from His purpose. His is the power and the strength and the might, and His is the sovereignty and the greatness and the authority.

This servant, in the nights and days, beseeches God, exalted be His glory, not to deprive His friends of the manifestations of His Most Bountiful Name and to grant them from the ocean of His gifts that which is befitting. This evanescent servant has ever been occupied with the mention of the friends and has sought and continues to seek for each one that which is conducive to the exaltation and advancement of God's friends. The purpose of this letter has been to mention the friends so that it may be known before all faces that this servant has not forgotten and will never forget them, and has sought and continues to seek blessing and bounty and mercy for them.

Another matter to mention is that the spiritual friend, the honored Aqa Muhammad Hasan, son of the martyr, upon both of them be the Glory of God, who was present at the beginning of the exile and has never fallen short in service and attendance - the utmost favor and consideration exists and is evident regarding him. He has recently acquired a shop and intends to engage in business. Therefore I request of that honored master that care be taken in his transactions and that whatever he requires be carefully obtained and well-packed so that it may be preserved from damage and loss during transport and reach him safe and sound. It is certain that your honor will exert the utmost effort in what has been mentioned, and surely blessing and favor from God has encompassed and will encompass this. Peace be upon you and upon God's righteous servants.

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious

A mention from Us to him who turned towards the Dawning-Place of Revelation and attained the presence of his Lord while He was in the Most Great Prison through that which the hands of the wicked had wrought, that he might once again inhale the fragrance of his Beloved from His garment which We have sent in the form of a Tablet. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Blessed be thy face for having turned towards the countenance of the Beloved, and thy tongue for having voiced the praise of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Be thou aflame with the fire of God in such wise that the sincere ones may find from thee the warmth of thy Lord's love, the Cleaver of the Dawn. Convey My greetings unto My loved ones and remind them of that which thine ears have heard from the tongue of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Then bid them to wisdom and utterance. This is better for the exaltation of thy Lord's Cause amongst His servants. Say: Beware lest the affairs of the kingdom sadden you or the veils of those who follow vain imaginings prevent you. That which they possess shall perish, while might and power shall endure for you, O concourse of the righteous. Rejoice, O assemblage of ardent lovers! By God, the Beloved hath appeared and the horizons have been illumined by His countenance. Be ye jubilant and magnify this Name through which the atoms are entranced when it is mentioned. Blessed are they who have borne tribulations in My path and have been imprisoned for My Name. These, verily, abide beneath the canopy of My majesty. Soon shall We adorn the pages of the Book of Creation with their names amidst all existence.

Then make mention on My behalf of him who hath been named Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali. Say: Grieve not for thy imprisonment. Verily thy Lord is in the Most Great Prison through that which the hands of the infidels who have denied God, the Lord of all names, have wrought. Thou wert mentioned before the Throne and praised before the Face, and the Tongue of Eternity spoke in remembrance of thee, and this Pen, which God hath made the sovereign of all pens, hath flowed over thy name. Blessed art thou for having turned towards Him, recognized Him, quaffed, and been attracted by this Light, one ray of which, when it appeared, caused the tongues of the Concourse on High to proclaim: "This, verily, is the Most Great Name and the Ancient Beauty"; and the tongues of those within the pavilions of grandeur and majesty to exclaim: "This is the Ancient Mystery and the Essence of His Great Name"; then the tongues of the denizens of Paradise cried out: "This, verily, is He Who was promised unto us in the Tablets of God, the Almighty, the Loving"; and the tongues of the inhabitants of the Kingdom proclaimed: "This, verily, is the Beloved through Whom eyes were solaced and faces were illumined." Then the call was raised above the head of the Youth from the horizon of glory and power: "By His life! That which ye have mentioned is limited by your own selves. This is the Beloved of God, the Almighty, the Beautiful. This is He Who, were He to rend asunder the veils and appear in the full splendor of His Beauty, would cause the very essence of beauty to sever its own hand and exclaim: 'May my soul be a sacrifice unto Thee, O Thou Who art the sacrifice of all worlds!'"

O Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali! Verily thy Lord maketh mention of thee even as thou makest mention of Him, and His mention hath preceded all worlds. Were it not for His mention, who would know what mention is, that he might speak of it in creation? Thus doth the Lord of invention inform thee--He through Whose name the ocean of inner meanings surgeth in the heart of utterance, and the proof of the All-Merciful hath been perfected unto all worlds. Be thou as a bird soaring in the atmosphere of thy Lord's love. When thou inclinest to the right, say: "In Thy Name, O Lord of all worlds!" When thou turnest to the left, say: "Through Thy remembrance, O Thou Who art the Most High, the Self-Sufficient!" And when thou seeketh the south, say: "Through Thy praise, O Thou Who art the Beloved of all in the heavens and the earth!" Grieve not, for verily thy Lord is with thee. He is with His sincere servants.

Upon thee, O Mustafa, be the remembrance of God, His praise and the praise of them who have detached themselves from all save God, the Mighty, the Most Praised. Guard thou the Cause from all directions, even as thou hast been bidden by the One Who revealeth the verses. He, verily, is the Omnipotent, the Almighty. If thou shouldst meet Amin, attract him through the remembrance of thy Lord. He is indeed among those who are remembered and will be remembered before the Throne. This is from the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. Blessed is he for having borne abasement for the glory of the Cause. By My life! He shall find himself in manifest glory. Say: O My loved ones! Let not exile grieve you. Whosoever seeketh Me, in whatsoever land he may be, verily dwelleth in the homeland of the All-Merciful. Thus hath the matter been decreed from the presence of the Lord of all possibility in a Tablet sealed with the finger of thy Lord, the Strong, the Trustworthy. Then make mention on My behalf of Abdullah, who hath borne tribulation for the victory of the Lord of creation. Upon him be the glory of God, His remembrance and the remembrance of them that remember. And upon thee, and upon him, and upon them all be glory.

May the Beloved One, His Holiness Al-Khalil, upon him be the Glory of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Sublime, be regarded with the blessed glance and eye of providence.

He is God, exalted be His station in grandeur and majesty!

My spirit be a sacrifice unto thee! This evanescent servant testifieth that he hath been honored with a letter, each letter of which was a blazing lamp whereby my heart was illumined and whereby the heart of every seeker will be illumined, for it was kindled from the fire of the love of God, the Lord of creation, and was ignited by the oil of wisdom and knowledge. Verily it was sent from the presence of him who was named by our glorious Lord as "The Friend" and made him special among His servants for His remembrance and praise and the manifestation of His Cause among His creatures. Therefore He named him "The Teacher" in His Books which He sent down from the heaven of grandeur and power. How wonderful is this station which is sanctified above my mention or the mention of any other! We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist him at all times and under all conditions, and to establish through him what He hath willed in the kingdom of creation. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He pleaseth and ordaineth for whomsoever He willeth with authority from His presence. He shall not be questioned about what He doeth. Verily He is the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Thereafter, it is submitted that whatsoever you wrote regarding the sending of the sacred and exalted Tablets - blessed be you! It is known that your honor has been and will be engaged in services to the Cause according to your capacity. And regarding what you wrote asking that mention of your honor be made in the Most Holy Court, your entire letter was presented in the Most Pure and Most Luminous Presence, until it reached these words of yours: "I called upon my Lord when circumstances prevented full expression of my condition." This is what was revealed in reply from the heaven of our Lord's will, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing:

"God heard thy call before thy existence in creation, in a realm which none save the All-Informed hath knowledge of, and We answered thee in that realm as a bounty from Us. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. And We heard thy call after thy existence and answered thee outwardly through that which thou didst attain in the Tablets, and inwardly through what is inscribed in a Preserved Tablet. The Tablet in this station referreth to His knowledge which overshadoweth the worlds. Blessed art thou, O teacher of My Cause, who gazeth upon My countenance and who art mentioned before My mighty throne! Give thanks for Our having enabled thee, confirmed thee, taught thee and caused thee to speak on a Day when the world is seen to be blind save for whom thy Lord, the Inspirer, the Mover, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, willeth. Be grateful that thy teaching was accepted by God - this is indeed a manifest bounty whose effects shall soon appear in the earth. Verily He is the Manifester, the Giver, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy."

Again from the heaven of divine providence, especially for his honor Aqa, the Name of God, upon him be all His most glorious Glory, a Tablet hath been revealed, and likewise a Tablet specially for his honor the Afnan, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, who is in China, hath been revealed from the heaven of providence and sent. Similarly this servant hath submitted some petitions to serve certain gentlemen which are in the envelope of Aqa, the Name of God. God willing, your honor will send them. If the petition is brief, I hope to be pardoned, as in these days this servant is occupied day and night - numerous petitions arrive at the Most Holy Court from every direction and at all times this servant is occupied, therefore I hope to be pardoned for the brevity.

The Most Great and Most Mighty Twin Branches - may my spirit and the spirit of all the worlds be a sacrifice for the sacred dust of their most mighty feet - with most wondrous mention and most exalted greeting remember and salute your honor, and likewise all who circle round present their pure devotion and most wondrous, most mighty, most holy and most glorious greetings to your honor. This servant's request is that whenever you meet any of the friends of God in that land, you convey sublime greetings on behalf of this evanescent one. The Glory which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Throne be upon your honor and upon those who have been honored to serve you.

May I be your sacrifice - regarding the letters sent, if your honor wishes to open them yourself, after observing the envelope please send them. In all conditions your honor has been and is free to choose.

He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power

This evanescent one submits to Samandar, the divine fire, that praise be to God, in every mail the sweet fragrances from your honor perfume the soul and cause the spirit to quiver and become illumined. In this case, whatever is mentioned is surely insufficient and whatever is written is certainly inadequate. Therefore I appoint that beloved one as representative before that beloved one, that whatever pertains to the conditions of unity and harmony and the exaltation of the station of love and affection and oneness, you should tell yourself on behalf of this servant from your own words. From the utterances of the Manifestation of Names and Attributes that were sent to your honor and the names mentioned in your honor's book, it becomes evident that this servant is occupied in writing day and night, therefore if there is sometimes delay in sending replies, God willing you will forgive. And another submission: whatever has reached your honor regarding the Huququ'llah from any soul and any place has reached this evanescent servant through the King of Martyrs, His Holiness the Name of God "?", upon him be all the most glorious Baha. We beseech God to assist those who have acted according to what they were commanded in the Book and to send down upon them from the heaven of His grace a blessing and mercy and benediction from His presence. Verily He is the Mighty, the Bestower. In truth the matter of divine rights is a great matter, incumbent upon all to fulfill, for it is the cause of bounty and blessing and goodness and whatsoever accompanies every soul in every world of the worlds of their Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Generous. Another submission: some time ago, that is several months ago, his honor the Name of God, his holiness Jamal, upon him be all the most glorious Baha, had written a letter to this servant. A reply was written but due to the upheavals in the surrounding areas was not sent. And likewise some time ago again a reply was written and not sent, until this time when their third letter arrived. Before the Throne were revealed sublime and exalted verses specifically for them and the souls mentioned in their book, but this time too, due to the weight of the mail, it was not sent. God willing it will be sent later and that beloved one will attain to its perusal, and God willing the reply to the petitions of Lavi will also be sent. In any case that beloved one must keep the horizon of wisdom in view. Most of the souls in the world appear with deceit and guile, therefore wisdom must be observed and kept in view in every matter of matters. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist your honor as He has assisted you and preserve you for the service of His Cause among His creatures. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty. If there were opportunity, surely from the city of sincerity would be sent the sweet basils of love and flowers of unity and melodies of the nightingale of affection and cooings of the dove of fellowship and songs of the birds of knowledge and leaves of the trees of remembrance and wisdom and sweet sounds of the lofty Lote-Trees and spiritual sweet waters, but due to the multitude of occupations and successive writings this evanescent servant found no further opportunity. God willing if life is granted he will make up for what was missed. I beseech the Truth to ever gladden this servant with the effect of that beloved soul's spiritual pen. What more can I submit? From the flame of the fire of love, at the time when mention of his honor the brother, upon him be the Glory of God, flows from pen or tongue, God knows the fire of longing appeared and the light of sincerity dawned. In this case the pen sees itself powerless, but since the expression of sincerity before true friends is beloved in the sight of the Beloved, therefore this evanescent servant with a hundred thousand yearnings and longings conveys to them a sacred greeting sanctified from incidental conditions. We beseech Him, exalted be He, that eyes may be consoled by meeting him. Verily He is the Answerer. The Glory be upon your honor and upon him and upon every believer who has attained to the recognition of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

O Muhammad-Shafi' and Ahmad-'Ali, upon them be the Glory of God! He is the Answerer in the Kingdom of Hearing! We have transformed the fire into ink and through it made manifest that which was hidden in knowledge and inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Books and Tablets. Blessed is the servant by whose name My Pen and My Tongue have moved, and blessed is the soul that hath attained unto My days and heard My most sweet call from the most exalted station. O Shafi'! Verily, sorrows have prevented Me from remembrances, as testified by Him Who possesseth the Mother Book. Those souls who were present before the Face and attained unto hearing were so seized by the fragrances of revelation that the reins of choice were taken from their hands, and they testified with their outward and inward tongues that there is none other God but Him. Thereafter, one of My names strayed from the straight path of God. For one thousand two hundred years they were occupied with names of successor, guardian, chief, noble one and fourth pillar, and the fruit thereof was witnessed on the Day of Recompense. Nevertheless, Dawlat-Abadi is now busy forming a new party like unto the Shi'ih party. O Shafi'! The station by whose word the sincere ones, the near ones, the chosen ones and the friends have been and are being created - they have passed beyond it in the name of "mirror." They have lost indeed who turned away from the Truth and followed every heedless doubter. The people of Baha are souls who in their first step have passed beyond the heaven of names and intended the kingdom of certitude. The entire world hath not been and is not able to change these assured souls. He saith: If thou recite one verse of His verses it would be more glorious in the sight of God than if thou should record all the Bayan, for on that day that one verse will save thee while all the Bayan will not. O Shafi'! I swear by the Sun of Truth which now shineth from the horizon of the heaven of the Kingdom that one who hath been seized by other than the Truth is incapable of comprehending a single verse. We created him for the service of My friends, but Satan led him astray until he turned away from the Truth and committed that which caused the near ones to lament. The people of Baha must be educated until they attain unto the Most Great Steadfastness, lest the tempests of doubts and the storms of allusions move them. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the Wise Expositor. O Shafi'! Convey greetings from the Wronged One to all, that perchance through the fragrances of the utterance of the Goal of all worlds they may attain to such a station that the hand of doubt and uncertainty will fall short thereof and be cut off. O Ahmad-i-'Ali! Upon thee be the eternal Glory of God! Repeatedly hast thou drunk from the cup of bounty and attained unto the hearing of the call. Well is it with thee! Thy letter was sent to the Most Holy Court by My name Mahdi, upon him be My Glory, and these manifest, decisive verses were revealed from the heaven of Will and sent forth, that thou mayest find from them the fragrance of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. My name Mahdi sends his letters to the Most Holy Court. If an answer is revealed he gives the glad-tidings and informs the friends, otherwise he waiteth until God cometh with His clear and decisive utterance. Thou hast ever been and art remembered in the Most Holy Court. Make mention of the people of that land on behalf of the Wronged One and remind them of the revealed verses, lest the names prevent them from their Owner and Creator. We make mention at this time of thy father who attained unto the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. O Fadlu'llah! Upon thee be the Glory of God, His bounty and His mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth. Rejoice thou in My mention of thee. By My life! The treasures of the earth, its bounties and its fruits cannot equal it, as testified by Him Who hath spoken and speaketh in every condition that verily I am God, the Single, the All-Informed. We have mentioned and do mention at this time the handmaidens of God, and give them the glad-tidings of the favors of God, exalted be His glory. We beseech God to assist them and grant them the meeting with His Tablet, the Mighty, the Wondrous. The Glory be upon you from Us, O friends of God, His chosen ones, His servants and His handmaidens, and upon those whom doubts have not prevented from His Great Announcement and His Straight Path.

In the Name of Him Who encompasses existence, both seen and unseen. This is a sealed Book, to which the near ones bear witness that it has been sent down from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Shed no blood and harbor no doubts concerning this Cause, through which all religions have been fulfilled in the realm of possibility - thus has the All-Merciful decreed, if you but knew. Do not consume the property of others, nor follow those who have risen in hypocrisy when the Luminary of the horizons has come with His promised Name. O people! Turn not away from Him Who has turned to you, nor oppose Him Who calls you to God, the Mighty, the Loving. How long will you follow your desires and pursue your vain imaginings? Rend asunder all veils in the name of your Lord, Who has power over what was and what shall be. Days and nights have passed while you slumbered. The dawn has broken from the horizon of the Cause while you slept. The light has appeared yet you flee to darkness. The living waters have flowed from the mouth of your Lord's will, the All-Merciful, yet you turn away. The nightingales of utterance sing upon the branches with various melodies, yet you remain distant. You run to the crier but perceive not. Is there anyone who beholds his Lord with his own eye, detached from all else in people's hands? Verily such a one is among the people of Baha in the preserved tablet. Ears were created to hearken to this utterance and hearts to recognize this Beloved. You drink stagnant water thinking it the pure stream, and worship idols yet understand not. Blessed are those who have cast aside their desires and turned with their hearts to this horizon from which has risen the sun of the remembrance of their Lord's name, the Mighty, the Forgiving. O rememberer! Hearken to the call of the Remembered One, through Whose name those in the graves have arisen. When you see one who is immersed in his desires, listen not to what he says. Rather hear this sweetest call raised from the mouth of your Lord, the Possessor of Names: "Verily there is no God but Me. O My creation, behold Me!" When you detect from anyone the fragrance of aversion, draw not near to him - thus does the Lord of the seen and unseen command you. Despair not of God's spirit and mercy, and forget not this praiseworthy portion. Arise to your Lord's Cause through His might and power, and be a herald of His name among the worlds. Say: O people! The Lord of Days has come, and the King of mankind calls out: "To Me, to Me, O lovers!" The Beloved calls you at all times and summons you to His luminous beauty. Follow not vain imaginings - open your eyes. By God, this is the light of certitude which has shone from the horizon of detachment, illuminating the heavens and earth. Deprive not yourselves of the outpourings sent down from the heaven of your Lord's bounty, the Mighty, the Generous. This is God's Day which you were promised in His mighty Book. This is God's Balance which has been set up by the hands of your Lord, the Strong, the Trustworthy. This is the appointed time for all servants and the return of mankind, did you but know. This is He through Whose name mosques and temples were built, and through Whose remembrance hearts took flight and turned to God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Say: O people! Fear God and pervert not the Word from its place - this is it, were you but fair-minded. Whoever acknowledges otherwise has perverted the Word and is among the wrongdoers. Say: If you seek its dawning-place, it is this, and if its setting-place, He speaks now with God's verses, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Do you know by what you have been barred from the heaven of bounty? No, by the Self of Baha! And do you realize by what cause you turned away from the Intended One? No, by His radiant, wondrous Command! Vain imaginings from the idols who claim knowledge without proof or clear Book have overcome you. Say: O people! Have mercy on yourselves and break not God's covenant and testament. This is sincere counsel, were you but hearing. Break down the barriers in My Name, the Loving, then rend asunder the veils in My Name, the Powerful, the Bestower, that you may know your Lord, the Mighty, the Great. Thus have the fragrances of verses wafted when the Lord of Names and Attributes spoke. When you find, say: Praise be to Thee, O Wronged One, and glory be to Thee, O Glory of the worlds, and praise be to God, the Beloved of the mystics.

In the Name of the One Friend! Your letter reached the Divine Throne and the glance of loving-kindness was directed toward it. All that was mentioned therein was understood. We have heard that which thou didst call out to God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds, and the yearning of thy heart at what befell thee in His days. He is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Forget not what We counseled thee during thy presence. Hold fast unto it - it shall suffice thee if thou be of them that comprehend. Thy Lord speaketh naught but the pure truth. Soon shalt thou witness what We have informed thee of, if thou hearkenest to what We caused thee to hear and act according to that which thou hast been commanded by One All-Knowing, All-Wise. This is not a day of grief, for the Ancient Beauty is outwardly speaking and established upon the throne. Ye must manifest such joy and gladness as to cause the world and all therein to rejoice. What God desireth from you is that which befitteth these days and manifesteth that which attracteth the hearts of all creation. Thou wert in the presence of the Throne and heard what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, and knew what He loveth and is pleased with. Act according to what He desired. He is the Friend of whosoever befriendeth Him, and He is verily the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Be assured of God's loving-kindness. He is verily the Forgiving, the Pardoning, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Know thou with certitude that whatsoever hath been revealed from the Mouth of the Divine Will shall assuredly come to pass. Thou didst mention tribulation. Grieve not at this, for the tribulation of this wronged Prisoner is greater than the tribulations of the first and the last. Observe and reflect how in the Most Great Prison He is afflicted between two parties, to such an extent that no end can be seen to its mention. Nevertheless, with utmost joy and delight He summoneth the people to the most exalted station, which is the recognition of God. No harm hath prevented Him and no tribulation hath hindered Him from the remembrance of God. All the loved ones of God must appear among the people of the world adorned with the ornament of steadfastness and assurance, and at all times remind the people, that perchance their worn and tattered garments may be exchanged for new and sanctified raiment. All that is seen and exists in the world shall pass away, and what endureth is the deed performed in the path of God. Follow what thou hast been commanded by the Intended One. Soon shalt thou witness what thou wert promised in His presence. Nothing escapeth His knowledge. He is cognizant of all things. Previously, wondrous verses were revealed and sent especially for the honored Karim and thyself. Likewise, before that, a mighty Tablet was sent with the letter Sin. Never have ye been absent from sight, nor shall ye ever be. These are the days for the manifestation of the most great steadfastness. Blessed is the soul that hath drunk from this most pure wine and partaken of this most luminous nectar. Convey from this Prisoner in the realm of possibility the most wondrous and most glorious greetings to them that soar in the atmosphere of the love of the All-Merciful, especially to those souls who have drawn nigh and turned to God's imperative Command. Blessed are they, and again blessed are they! By God, the Pen moved to inscribe their names and the tongue to make mention of them. This sufficeth them, would they but know it. A special Tablet hath been revealed for each one. God willing, they shall be sent through a trusted messenger. We beseech God to gather all upon the shore of this Ocean and give them to drink that which shall make them the helpers of His Cause, the rememberers of His Name, the utterers of His praise, and them that are detached from all else besides Him. He is verily the Powerful, the Mighty. His favor hath reached such a degree that He maketh mention of His loved ones in the Most Great Prison. Have ye witnessed any bounty greater than this? Nay, by His Self! Have ye found any lord more merciful than He? Nay, by His Beauty! Have ye known any beloved more compassionate than He? Nay, by His Command which hath subdued the worlds! Appear ye among the people of the world in the utmost spirit and fragrance, bearing His Name, and strive to teach His Cause. This is the pure good which the Pen of Command hath recorded. Blessed are they that act accordingly. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have remained steadfast in this Cause whereby the mountains have been crushed, the heaven cleft asunder, and the earth rent in twain.

In the Name of the One God, Who hath no partner! We hear the Call from all things, as though they were stirred within themselves through their longing for that which hath appeared and shone forth from the horizon of eternity with manifest sovereignty. Our dwelling-places, wherein the fragrance of Our raiment hath wafted, draw near to Us through Our most beautiful names, which We have made the dawning-places of Our revelation throughout all worlds. Therefore hath the City and all that surroundeth it been illumined by the advent of its Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Verily, the Sadrih crieth out, saying: "I perceive the fragrance of Thy raiment, O God of all worlds!" And the Mount shineth forth through this Manifestation and proclaimeth: "The Beloved of the heavens and earth hath come!" And the Ka'bih of mankind, having sensed the breezes of its Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, hath called aloud and cried out: "The Desired One hath come with great glory!" And the House of the Son hath been illumined by the lights of Beauty, declaring: "The Father hath come with His kingdom and His sovereignty!" Blessed be they who turn unto Him! Even the pebbles of creation remember their Lord with this wise remembrance. The Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth above all things: "The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Exalted, the Great!" At all times We hear from everything the mention of their Lord - this indeed is a wondrous thing. In the evening We hear the glorification of all things in remembrance of their Lord, and at daybreak We hear from them other words. By My life! The Spirit of the Cause speaketh within them at all times such words that were the possessors of ears to hear them, they would fall prostrate upon their faces before their Lord, the All-Merciful. Thus have We set forth Our verses in detail, from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. Blessed is he who hath risen from among the dead and turned unto God, the Revealer of verses, Who hath appeared in truth from the horizon of the Cause in such wise as to attract the hearts of those who have recognized Him. This is the Day of hearkening - hearken ye unto the Call of your Lord from the direction of the Prison. Verily, there is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and within His grasp lieth the Kingdom of the dominion of the heavens and earth. Whoso hath heard His call and answered it, verily he is of the people of Paradise in this noble court. Blessed is he who hath arisen to serve My Cause and hath cast aside all else but Me. He is indeed of the people of the realms of My footstool. My angels shall enter upon them with the lights of My grandeur. They are verily the lamps of guidance from whom the denizens of the Supreme Paradise derive their light. Thus hath the matter been decreed by the Pen of Baha, and God is witness unto what I say. Leave the dead, and hold fast unto God, the Creator of names. Verily, He hath come in this resplendent raiment.

Say: O people! Commit not acts of mischief and indecency, and follow not every doubting polytheist. Beware lest ye backbite one another. This hath been forbidden in the Tablets. Fear ye the All-Merciful, and be not of those who spread corruption. Enter not a house except with permission, betray not the trust of others in their possessions, and lean not towards them that have acted unjustly, for this indeed is a grievous error. Aid Me through My loved ones. They who love them for My sake shall find themselves in pavilions of My bounty, and shall ere long behold themselves in an exalted station. Beware lest ye dispute one with another. Unite in the religion of God and His Cause, lest there occur among you that which your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised, desireth not. Say: This is My path. Walk ye therein with My leave, and be not of them that doubt. This is My straight path; verily it is the right way. We have set forth in the Book the details of all things, that perchance men may follow that which is best for them. He is but a faithful counsellor. They who follow their own desires are not of the people of guidance, as doth testify your Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious, if ye be of them that are assured. Say: O people! Do ye frequent the mosques for My remembrance, yet oppose Mine own Self? What aileth you, O concourse of the heedless! Remind the people in the days of thy Lord, then lead them out of darkness and guide them to the horizon whence hath shone the Sun of the beauty of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Most Beautiful. Beware lest the things of this world withhold thee from thy Lord, the Lord of all names. Drink thou the waters of immortality from the utterance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Wise. They who remained heedless in those days are as mere asses - they have no way to the Truth. They rejoice while the wrath of God pursueth them. Verily, they are the companions of the fire. They who have turned to the Countenance shall ere long find themselves beneath the canopy of their Lord's mercy. Verily, they are of them that are nigh unto God. Thus have We instructed thee and taught thee that thou mayest rejoice in the days of thy Lord and be of the thankful ones.

O Nabil-i-Qabli-'Ali! In the Name of God, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most High! This is a Book from Us to him who hath turned his face unto God, the Lord of all worlds, and who hath traversed the path until he arrived at the Living Waters which flowed from the finger of the will of his Lord, the Most Merciful, and was numbered among the successful ones. He arrived at the Holy Shore and found companionship with the Beloved of the worlds. After his arrival, We commanded him to enter the abode of those who wronged themselves and God, the King, the Mighty, the Wise, until he came upon them suddenly like a thunderbolt of chastisement upon a sinful people. He sat and prevailed through what the Most Merciful cast into his heart, until he arose and returned to the Most Great Ocean, detached from the idolaters. Blessed art thou, O servant, in that God hath made thee as fire unto the idolaters and a spirit and sweet fragrance unto His believing servants. Cast away all that is possible and take what thou art commanded by thy Lord, the Most Merciful. Turn unto His hesitant servants that perchance through thee the withered trees may become verdant and those who are remote may draw nigh unto God in manifest humility. Arise and say: O people! By God, the Primal Word hath been fulfilled, the Hidden Alif hath appeared, and the sun of thy Lord's authority hath dawned from the horizon of possibility with brilliant, resplendent light. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of its fragrances. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen counsel you, and God is, verily, the Witness and the Informed of this. Say: O people, be fair and then observe: Can darkness persist when the sun shineth forth? Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! When the Most Great Ocean surgeth, the flame of fire cannot endure beside it, and when the winds of might blow, the gnat cannot remain stable, were ye but of those who know. Say: O people, abandon names and the idols of the idolaters. Turn unto God, the Lord of Names and Attributes, sanctified from all allusions. Thus hath Truth spoken - hearken and be not of the heedless ones. Say: O people! By God, he whom ye have taken as lord besides God is like the ashes of dogs' bones, nay more despicable, were ye but of the assured ones. Whoso looketh into his words knoweth his worth and findeth from them the exhalations of hell. Those who mention fabricated words when that which hath been sent down from God's dominion hath been revealed are cursed by the denizens of the highest paradise and God's near servants. Say: Today one letter thereof cannot be equaled by all that hath been created in the heavens and earths. Say: O concourse of idolaters! Die in your wrath! The Luminary of inner meanings hath shone forth and its radiance hath dazzled your eyes. Return to your abode in the depths of hell. He who compareth the verses of God with his words is like unto Pharaoh when he said "I am your lord, the most high." Say: This is greater, were ye but possessed of insight. O Nabil-i-Qabli-'Ali! Hear the word of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious, from the Shore of Eternity. Then wash thyself in the waters of sanctity and speak forth His praise amongst His servants, that the words of God may influence the hearts of all peoples. Grieve not over anything, and regard not those who are heedless except as insects driven by the winds of self and passion, carried wheresoever they list. Thus hath it been sent down from God's dominion - thy Lord and the Lord of the first and the last. Say: O people! If ye have guaranteed immortality and are secure from the grave, then follow your desires. Otherwise, fear God Who created you by His command. Death is truth and shall come upon you. Then shall ye find yourselves in manifest loss. Then inform the people of what thou hast seen and known, that they may detach themselves from what they possess and turn with their hearts toward the Holy Court, and not follow Satan. When thou openest the door of utterance, thy Lord, the Lord of lords, shall assist thee with the angels of revelation. Thus hath the Pen of the Most Merciful given thee glad tidings in this Tablet, one letter of which cannot be equaled by all that hath been created in all existence, as every possessor of keen vision doth testify. Remove the veil from the people and burn their veils with the fire of thy Lord's love, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. And when thou seest those who have believed, glorify their faces on My behalf and give them the glad tidings of the Youth's remembrance of them out of His love for God. This, verily, is a great bounty. The Spirit and Glory be upon thee and upon those whom the cooing of the Dove of Eternity hath attracted to the direction of God, the Mighty, the Generous. And praise be to the Beloved of the worlds.

He is the All-Glorious, the Most Manifest, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!

This is a Book from the Wronged One to him who hath turned unto the Self-Subsisting and hath quaffed the choice wine, sealed, from the hand of His bounty on a day whereon the people turned away from God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. The verses have been sent down in such wise that the Kingdom of Utterance circleth round them, as attesteth He Who speaketh in every state, that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Loving. Verily, the Glory, in the ocean of tribulation, calleth unto them that love Him and soar in His atmosphere and have taken His Book with such strength as the hosts could not withhold. Can anyone reckon what He hath sent down from the heaven of His grace, and can anyone enumerate what hath befallen Him in the path of God? Nay, by the Lord of all existence!

O thou who gazeth upon My countenance! We have enjoined upon men righteousness and piety, and forbidden them tyranny and wickedness, yet they cast aside the former and chose the latter. I testify that they have cast the decree of God behind their backs and have taken what they were bidden by the sources of fancy and idle imaginings. Say: O concourse of men! This is a Day whereon the Lord of Destiny calleth from His most great scene of contemplation and summoneth him who was named 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar, who turned to the Supreme Horizon in the earliest days, and was so transported by the rapture of the Call that he forsook what the people possessed and took what was ordained for him in his preserved tablet.

O thou who drinketh the choice wine of My utterance, the Kawthar of My bounty, and the Salsabil of My praise! His Holiness Rida - upon him be My glory and loving-kindness - acting as deputy at a time when the Luminary of permission was shining forth, set out for that Station and attained unto the privilege of pilgrimage. He hath accomplished in the path of God that which God hath adorned with the ornament of acceptance and good-pleasure. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.

Despite the upheaval of the world and the perfidy of most nations and the kindling of the fire of hatred, the True One, exalted be His glory, hath granted success and guided His loved ones to the stream of His love. Glory be to God! The treacherous ones and the highway robbers are present in every direction and stationed at every outpost; nevertheless the Most Exalted Pen moveth, its scratching is raised, and its call is loud. We testify that He is the One with power over whatsoever He pleaseth. Neither the onrush of the oppressors nor the tyranny of the aggressors can hinder Him.

The letters which you sent to this servant and likewise to other loved ones were all presented at the Most Holy Court and were honored to be heard. God willing, answers will be sent down from the heaven of will and dispatched, that the reality of existence may acknowledge His generosity and the essence of bounty His bestowal. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

?abibu'llah - upon him be My glory and loving-kindness - after his return to the horizon of manifestation attained unto the presence and was sustained by the cup of reunion. He dispatched to the Most Holy Court a leaf adorned with the names of the loved ones, seeking the expression of bounty for each one, and each was blessed with that for which he was brought from nothingness into being, and there was sent down for each that which the treasures of earth cannot equal. Verily thou wert with Me and didst witness the waves of the ocean of My utterance and the effulgences of the sun of My loving-kindness. Blessed are the souls who seized each wave and were blessed thereby. Say: This wave was not hindered by hosts, and this power was not weakened by the transgressions of nations. The breaths of revelation have encompassed the world, and divine counsels and admonitions have been inscribed upon the tablets of existence. Soon shall the fair-minded arise and testify to a power that hath had no like in the world, and whose equal is non-existent.

O thou who standeth before the Throne! If there be delay in answering some, the reason and cause thereof is known. Ye should know with perfect certitude that the mention of each one hath been and is in the Most Holy Court. Say: My God, my God! Aid Thy loved ones to hold fast unto the cord of Thy good-pleasure in all conditions, then ordain for them that which will draw them nigh unto Thee at all times. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

The friends of God in all lands! He is the One Who speaks in the Kingdom of Names! This is the Day wherein the Call of God has been raised from the direction of the Most Great Prison, calling out to the nations that there is no God but Me, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Every ear has been blessed by the call of its Lord, and every eye by the Most Exalted Horizon, and every heart by the love of God, the King, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved, except those who cast behind them their God and followed their desires in that they followed those who disbelieved in God throughout all ages and turned away from Him when the Most Great Book appeared and what was inscribed in the preserved tablet. O friends of God! By God, darkness has drawn its veil, and that which has sullied the hem of the Cause has appeared. Thereupon the Concourse on High laments, and then those who soared in the atmosphere of the love of their Lord, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the All-Loving. The Trustworthy One was before the Throne for a year and after it; then We commanded him to return and engage in what he desired. Verily his Lord is the Commander, the Mighty, the All-Wise. We have commanded all to engage in crafts and trades, and this is from God's grace unto His creation, but most of the people are heedless. He was before the Throne and heard the call of his Lord morning and evening and between them. Thus was it ordained for him from the Supreme Pen. Verily his Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Bestower, the Generous. Blessed is he and blessed is he who hears the call of his Lord and follows what he has been commanded in the Book which God has made a light unto those on earth and a proof from Him to all the worlds. The Supreme Pen in this blessed Tablet conveys greetings to all the friends and commands all to that which God has willed in the Book, for verily that which descends from the heaven of the Divine Will is in truth the water of life for receptive souls and healing for the world's ills. By the life of God! Every soul that acts upon it will assuredly be preserved from afflictions and will be encompassed by God's infinite favors. All must be focused on the Dawning-Place of grace and the Dayspring of revelation, awaiting to hear God's call from the direction of the Prison. This is the most great bounty, this is the divine gift among creation, and this is the heavenly feast. For if the loved ones act upon what has been revealed from the Supreme Pen of kindly counsels, goodly conduct, and pure deeds, the fragrances of divine mercy will embrace all the earth, and all will become detached from all else, turning with heart and soul to the horizon of the loving-kindness of the All-Merciful. Beseech God that He may assist all through His favors and lift the concealing veils, that all may soar in the heaven of the All-Merciful's love on the wings of certitude. He is verily the Bestower, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Various matters have appeared in this land which, although they have caused apparent distress since the dust of these occurring matters has affected the hem of the Cause, yet God manifests what He willeth and bestoweth upon whom He willeth what He willeth. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Generous. The Most Great Prison in these numbered years has been, through God's grace, a place of security and safety and the source of bounties and blessings. But it changed when they changed. He is verily the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Perceiving. God will soon transform it as He transformed it the first time, as was decreed by His Pen in a mighty tablet. Then We make mention at the end of the Book of him who turned towards the direction of the Throne, who was named Abu'l-Hasan in the Book of God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. He left his land, turning towards God and gazing toward the horizon of His grace, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. He entered the land of Rum when the fires of war were blazing therein and tribulations surrounded him from all sides. Then God delivered him by a sovereignty from His presence and preserved him in truth. He is verily the Preserver, the Generous. This continued until he entered the Prison Land and attained the presence of the Countenance and heard what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in his mighty, lofty station. He is among those who fulfilled the Covenant, and the breezes of revelation took hold of him in such wise that he cast away desire and turned unto guidance. Verily his Lord is the Helper, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Most High.

He is the Remembering One, the Speaking One, the Trustworthy, the All-Wise

O Name of Bounty! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. The letters from the Land of Ta and the petitions of some to the Most Holy Court have been received and heard. Praise be to God, the loved ones of God are occupied with remembrance and praise and are, God willing, holding fast to the cord of unity. We beseech God to assist them and confirm them in what they have intended in His straight and manifest path. Responses to most have been sent down from the Kingdom of utterance and dispatched. We beseech God once again to enable them to hearken unto what hath been revealed and to achieve what He hath willed on His mighty and wondrous Day.

His honor Samandar, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of destiny, hath mentioned Mulla Husayn, upon him be the glory and loving-kindness of God. Permission hath been granted for him to proceed to the regions of the Land of Ta. We make mention at this time of His honor 'Ali-Shir, upon him be the glory of God, and We bid him to patience and steadfastness in the face of divine trials. That which befell him also befell the Wronged One upon first entering the prison. How excellent was that which one of the loved ones of the All-Merciful spoke in the Dispensation of the Criterion - he who was named Sa'd in the Book of Names. He was among those who believed in the Presence of the Seal, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake, in the earliest days. In his final days his sight was taken from him. Some of the loved ones said to him: "Thou shouldst beseech God thy Lord to restore thy sight." He, upon him be My glory, said: "The decree of God is dearer to Me than mine eye." We beseech God at this time to assist 'Ali-Shir and enable him to be steadfast, to admit his son into the most exalted Paradise, and to send down upon him at all times a spirit and mercy from His presence. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.

That which Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, hath mentioned regarding the mother who hath ascended to the Supreme Companion, and that which he hath desired, hath been adorned with the honor of acceptance and the ornament of divine good-pleasure. We made mention of her before her ascension and after her ascension in terms that no other mention can equal. Verily her Lord is the Compassionate, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Likewise, the deed of the Leaf, the wife of Rida'r-Ruh, and another Leaf, her daughter, hath been mentioned before the Wronged One, and permission to perform it hath at this time been sent down from the heaven of God's command. Blessed are they both. The glances of loving-kindness have ever been and continue to be directed towards His honor Marfu' and his relatives, both female and male.

O Name of Bounty! In view of what hath occurred from the Kingdom of divine decree, We have delayed in answering the letters of Samandar which were brought by the servant present before the Countenance and which thou didst forward. We beseech God to send down hereafter that which will transform sorrows. No word hath been heard from His honor Javad, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist him in the victory of His Cause as He assisted him before, and to adorn all those of his household who dwell in that home with His special favors, and to set each one of them ablaze with such a fire as will cause the heedless souls to become enkindled.

We make mention at this time once again of him who was named 'Ali-Shir, that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones. O 'Ali-Shir! Grieve not for what hath befallen thee. In all things place thy trust in God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for thee the good of the hereafter and of this world, and to decree for thee the reward of one who hath drunk the choice wine of mystic knowledge from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the All-Merciful, and who hath presented himself at the door and heard the Call from this luminous horizon.

The glory from Us be upon My loved ones there who have heard and responded, who have aimed at and attained, and upon those who have not broken God's covenant and His testament and who have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur spoke before the creation of the heavens and the earths. This year, in view of the sorrow that hath occurred, if His honor 'Ali-Shir should delay and make his pilgrimage to the Ultimate Goal and Most Exalted Summit in another year, it would be more fitting and appropriate. He verily assisteth His loved ones in all things. He is verily the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Kind.

To Mirza Mahdi, upon him be the Glory of God. He is the Hearer, the Answerer, the All-Seeing, the All-Informed.

O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of the Throne. This is the Day of God, and His call is raised from every direction, and the light of His Cause is shining forth from every horizon. Blessed is he who hath seen with his own eyes and been guided, and who hath heard with his own ears and been led aright. Glory be unto God! The world is seized with wonderment, for its people are seen to have passed by the lights of the Luminary of certitude and to have clung to the cords of idle fancies.

O Mahdi! Upon thee be My glory! Thy letter was forwarded by Javad - upon him be the Glory of God and His mercy - to the Most Holy Court, and was honored to be heard in the Divine Presence. We indeed perceived from it the fragrance of My love and thy steadfastness in My Cause. We beseech God, exalted be He, to open before thy face, through the key of His Most Great Name, the door of bounty. He is, verily, the Lord of all nations. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

It is hoped that thou wilt speak in the name of God, glorified be His majesty, and be occupied with His remembrance. Certain petitions arrived from that region, and some months ago answers were sent down from the heaven of divine Will, though they have not yet been dispatched, for most people see no difference between weapons and reform. The power of distinction is lost and the people wander bewildered in the wilderness of perplexity. That opposing soul who dwells on the island hath taught alchemy to certain ones that their insight might increase, but it hath only added to their blindness. Should thou ever meet Abdullah or his like, say: O thoughtless one! Take this very science as the criterion, that the truth may become evident to thee. In Aliyyih four persons were engaged in this pursuit for some time, and they have seen and will see naught but loss.

O Mahdi! Upon thee be My glory! By the life of God! When this Wronged One returned from His two-year journey, it was observed that that heedless one had given certain people the operation of division. We said: Woe unto thee, O heedless one! Division hath never been and is not acceptable unto God. Deception and guile are evident from its very name. O Yahya! Abandon it and be not of the losers. In any case, he still gives and continues to give it to some people, and the poor helpless souls, trusting in alchemy, spend their lives practicing it, joining the first cycle to the last. Glory be unto God! The essence of vain imaginings hath ever caused and continueth to cause matters to appear confused, until such time as souls return to their abode and to that which was ordained for them.

What hath been said was and is for the sake of God, for the helpless people are unaware of the root of the matter and have fallen prey to alchemy and the like. When thou perceivest the fragrance of My utterance, arise from thy place, turning toward the Kaaba of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, and say:

My God, my God! I testify to Thy manifestation and Thy appearance, and to Thy establishment upon the throne of utterance in the midmost heart of contingent being. I beseech Thee by the breezes of Thy Revelation and by that which hath been wafted from Thy verses in Thy days, and by the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty and the effulgences of the Sun of Thy grace, to aid Thy servants to return unto Thee and to repent before the gate of Thy pardon and Thy generosity. Thou art, verily, the Ever-Forgiving, the Almighty, the Pardoner, the Merciful.

O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and holding fast to the cord of Thy grace. I beseech Thee to exalt me among Thy servants through Thy Name. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of Thy creation. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Bestower.

We make mention of Our loved ones there and beseech God to ordain for them, by His Most Exalted Pen, the best of all that exists in His worlds, and to give them to drink of the Kawthar of steadfastness, by virtue of which whoso drinketh thereof shall not be hindered by the hosts of the world from drawing nigh unto the Most Great Name, nor shall he be frightened by the might of the aggressors or the power of those who have denied God, the Lord of existence and the Educator of the seen and the unseen.

The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon them and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds and the Master of the Day of Judgment. We conclude Our words by making mention of thy brother and sister, and We beseech God, exalted be He, to protect them through His grace and His hosts, and to guard them from the cawing of the cawers and from the evil of the oppressors. Verily, He is the Almighty over whatsoever He willeth through His word, the Mighty, the Wise.

He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!

Praise be to God Who hath sent down His bounty and manifested what He desired. He, verily, is the One Who is desired in the former and latter days. There is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. I bear witness that there is none other God but Him, in acknowledgment of His grandeur, in recognition of His sovereignty, and in submission to all that appeareth from His presence. He, verily, is the Single One, the One, the Mighty, the Powerful. Praise be to God Who hath assisted the sincere ones to turn towards the Supreme Horizon and to achieve the most great steadfastness, and hath enabled them to remember and praise Him and to serve His Cause in days wherein clamor hath been raised between earth and heaven and the hearts of the people of wisdom have been perturbed. Exalted be the Lord of the Throne and the dust, and the Master of the former and latter days. There is none other God but Him, the One Who overshadoweth all who are in the heavens and the earths.

Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose Name the rivers have flowed from the impenetrable rock and the Dove of the Cause hath warbled upon the branch of eternity! I beseech Thee by the sovereignty of the Names whereby the idol and its hosts have lamented, to assist Thy loved ones to remember and praise Thee and to do that which beseemeth Thy days. O my Lord! Thou seest them turning towards Thee and awaiting the wondrous tokens of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee to send down upon them from the heaven of Thy grace a blessing from Thee and a mercy from Thy presence. Then ordain for them through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which Thou didst ordain for Thy chosen ones who hastened to Thy horizon and quaffed the wine of Thy love. Thou art, verily, the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

Thereafter, the letter of your honor brought joy to the heart. God willing, you will at all times be occupied with the remembrance of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. All that is in the world hath been and will be evanescent, and all upon earth acknowledge and confess this fact. That which endureth and lasteth is the service that is rendered for the sake of God, and greatest of all is a word that is recorded by God for any soul. Praise be to God that your honor hath been favored with His grace - this is the essence, and all else is counted as derivative. As for your expression of embarrassment at the delay - never be saddened or troubled by such matters and their like. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Self-Sufficient, the Mighty, the Powerful. It is most clear that your honor and all that pertaineth unto you belong to God, glorified be His majesty. In this case, whatever occureth causeth no harm. He knoweth and seeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Due to certain necessary matters, mention was made to Haji Mirza Abu'l-Hasan, upon him be the glory of God. Whatever was mentioned, he hath surely related the details. There is no need to mention it again. This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth God to enable your honor to attain unto that which hath been and is the purpose. Regarding the dispatch of the packet about which you wrote - excellent is what thou hast done for God, the Lord of the worlds. And since that packet was bearing Tablets, the recompense of the bearers is and shall be with God. And concerning your supplication to God, glorified be His majesty, for the facilitation of affairs - God willing, it hath been and shall be manifested. Previously a word was heard from the blessed tongue which indicated what hath been mentioned, and this servant beseecheth God to assist you in that which is the cause of the perpetuity of existence in the divine worlds. Verily, He guideth whom He willeth and giveth to whom He willeth and withholdeth from whom He willeth. In His grasp is the key to all things. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Powerful.

As for your mention of Aqa Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be the glory of God - surely by now he hath arrived safely and in good health. Convey greetings to him, and likewise to the friends if you meet them. Glory be upon your honor and upon those who have attained unto steadfastness in this wondrous Cause. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.

He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and Power

Praise be to God Who guided us to His path, made known His evidence, and made clear to us the wonders of His grace and the manifestations of His care. And the prayer shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of knowledge and the peace radiant and resplendent from the dawning-place of grace be upon the Secret of existence and the Manifestation of the intended Lord, through Whose appearance God's most beautiful names were manifested and through Whose character His supreme attributes emerged, and from Whom the near ones found the fragrance of God's hidden Name and the sincere ones that which the tongues of what was and what will be were powerless to mention. And upon His family and companions who aided the religion of God and His Cause and acted according to what they were commanded in His Book - those servants whom the manifestations of might and power did not prevent from enjoining good and forbidding evil. They truly strove in God's path and by their swords necks were humbled and the temple of the Cause was established upon the throne of independence among mankind. Blessed is he who attained unto them and heard from them what their Beloved and Intended One related to them. And woe unto him who turned away from acceptance and was among the deniers.

And then, the esteemed letter arrived. Praise be to God, it was a messenger bearing the fragrance of love and spoke of stations of sincerity and affection. May God, exalted be His glory, assist that spiritual friend and spread through that beloved one that which the worlds are powerless to conceal and find themselves impotent before. The Command is in God's hand - He doeth what He willeth and decreeth what He desireth. However He hath not and will never neglect the welfare of His loved ones. This is the truth of certainty.

The first matter is to express sincere devotion and evanescence and nothingness to the presence of the gentlemen, upon them be all His Most Glorious Beauty. His honor the Great Master, upon him be God's grandeur and might, cannot bear the hardship of turning toward the House of God from that direction, as it is very difficult, especially this year. I beseech God to grant the reward of pilgrimage. Verily our Lord is the Forgiving, the Generous. The beloved of the heart Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, and the other friends have been and are in this evanescent one's thoughts. God is witness and testifier that they are ever remembered in the heart. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to strengthen them and all His loved ones and to confound their enemies. Verily He is powerful over all things.

As for the matter of the beloved friend, what they have arranged is exactly right. God willing he will be assisted to render a service whose station he does not now know and of whose significance he is unaware. And regarding what they wrote about whether it would be advisable for that honored one to also accompany them to become informed of the source and reality of matters, and likewise to turn toward the intended land - this is most beloved. It is very clear that if that beloved one were to turn, it would be and is most excellent and most loved and most beauteous. All services return to that honored one through God's grace. The servant asks Him Who is not mentioned by what is with the people to send down for you from the heaven of His bestowal at all times that which the pen is powerless to mention and to which the fingers cannot point. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

Another matter: His honor Aqa Shukru'llah, upon him be the Glory of God, who had come from Shiraz, was delayed in Port Said due to lack of papers. They intended to proceed to Beirut. Until now no news of them has arrived. Now that honored one should designate someone to go inquire of the quarantine authorities and obtain news of him. This matter is very necessary as they are strangers and do not know the languages. If they are there and require expenses, give them whatever amount they need. Peace and mercy and glory be upon your honor and upon God's loved ones there.

In the name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord

Praise be unto Him Who cannot be known through utterance nor described through proof, Who hath been sanctified above every evidence and argument and hallowed beyond all mention and praise. He hath ever been holy beyond the comprehension of created things and the conditions of contingent beings. Every knower hath testified to his powerlessness, every mystic to his limitation, every accomplished one to his shortcoming, and every sage to his ignorance. Exalted be His greatness, glorified His dominion, magnificent His power, and sublime His station! He it is Who gave Us the glad tidings of His appearance and His arising to establish His Cause, and through these glad tidings did the Prophets and Messengers give tidings to all who dwell in the kingdom of command and creation. Yet when He Who was mentioned appeared and the Promised One came, the people arose in opposition, in such wise that the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise and the inmates of the highest Heaven lamented.

Glory be unto Thee, O Thou the Desire of hearts! I beseech Thee by Thy greatness and Thy sovereignty and Thy might and Thy power to assist Thy servants to rend asunder the veils and to recognize Thy manifestation in the return. O Lord! They are the poor and the powerless, and Thou art the All-Possessing, the All-Compelling, the Almighty. Thou art He Who created the servants through the Word that proceeded from the mouth of Thy Will and preserved them throughout ages and centuries by the arms of Thy power. I beseech Thee to assist Thy servants and Thy creation to turn unto Thee and draw nigh unto the horizon of Thy Cause. Then preserve them, O my God, from the promptings of self and passion, by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue all creation. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.

Thereafter, your letters have been continuously received, and detailed responses to each have been submitted and dispatched. In your previous letter you had written that you would send His Eminence Ibn (upon him be the Glory of God) to Iraq, and a response was sent according to your letter. And in this letter which has now arrived, dated the 28th of Rabi'u'l-Avval, you sought permission to send His Eminence Ibn either to those regions or to these parts. Therefore this was submitted in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, and this is what the Tongue of Utterance spoke forth in the Kingdom of Proof - exalted be His Word: "God willing, may they be occupied at all times with service to the Self-Sufficient, Transcendent Cause and be focused on the horizon of wisdom. We have counseled him and do counsel him with wisdom. Any matter that today causes conflict and commotion, it is best to abandon it in the sight of the Lord of all beings. Glory be upon him and upon those with him and upon every wise mystic."

Praise be to God, they are illumined by the dawning lights of the Sun of Grace. This is a bounty that tongue and utterance and pen and ink are powerless and incapable to mention and record and convey. Praise be to God that you have reached a station where you recognize the bounty and know its worth - and this station is very rare indeed. It must be preserved through the Name of the Powerful, the Mighty. Although this is the Day of vision, it is observed that the people are deprived of it. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His Glory, that you may ever drink from the ocean of grace and soar on the wings of detachment in the atmosphere of the love of the All-Merciful. Observance of wisdom is among those matters that you have repeatedly heard from the Tongue of Truth, exalted be His Glory. In all conditions you must be focused on it.

Convey greetings and salutations on my behalf to the friends in that land. Sacred and exalted Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of Will specifically for certain souls - God willing they will receive them and attain unto them. May your relatives, God willing, dwell and rest beneath the Sadratu'l-Muntaha. One Sadrah is manifest and visible at the ultimate station, and one Sadrah is without end - glorified be He Who created them both and planted them and made them manifest and preserved them. And glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who have testified to that which God hath testified: that there is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted! Hearken unto the Call of thy Lord from the direction of the Throne, that verily there is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O people, abandon your desires and set your faces toward the Most Remote Sanctuary - this would be better for you, did ye but know. Say: Verily He standeth at the pivot of tribulation and calleth you to the Ultimate Tree. Fear God and follow not those who have taken their desires and cast aside their God. Thus doth the Pen of Command remind you, would ye but understand. He hath come for the life of the world and hath sacrificed Himself through that which was ordained by God, the Mighty, the Loving. Say: By the barking of dogs the Most Exalted Pen shall not be silenced. It speaketh between earth and heaven and summoneth you unto God, the Lord of Names, but the people perceive not. Tribulation deterreth Him not from that which He hath been commanded, even though His very life be in grievous peril. Can the rays of the Sun be prevented by that which the servants have interposed? Nay, by the Lord of creation! But the people are wrapped in thick veils. Those who have turned away from the Countenance are they who are drowned in the sea of allusions which We have left to previous generations, and with these do they seek to heal the wounds in their hearts. By My life! They have no refuge this Day. Soon shall ye behold them prostrate upon the ground of fancy. By God! They have not understood the melody of utterance in this wondrous Revelation. Thou hearest My words and shunnest these people. Enter, in the name of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, a station which their minds have not attained. Thus doth the Tongue of Ancient Days command thee from thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Say: This is a Cause with which no other cause can be compared. God hath made it sanctified from the allusions of the worlds. Through it hath shone forth the Sun of wisdom and utterance from the horizon of the will of your Lord, the All-Merciful. How blessed are they who have advanced toward it! Through it hath been established the decree of origination, and by it have been illumined the hearts of the monotheists. Were it not for it, the degrees of origination would not have been completed. Reflect that ye may know what hath been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen. Thus hath the Truth come and the matter been decreed from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Know then that thy brother hath turned away from the Truth, having followed his desires. He is but in grievous delusion. A letter from him was presented before the Countenance. We found him wandering in the wilderness of error and We left him as a warning to the worlds. He spoke that which even children would not speak. Alas for him! Soon shall he find himself in evident loss. Say: O people! If ye recognize not the Truth by its own self, then look unto that which hath been revealed from His presence, that perchance the fragrance of the verses may sanctify you from allusions and draw you nigh unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. That which the Tongue of Revelation hath spoken shineth like the sun among the words of the worlds. When the Word issueth forth from the Dayspring of utterance, its fragrances waft between the heavens and earth, yet none perceive it save those who have detached themselves from all that is with the people and have turned toward the countenance of their Lord, the Mighty, the Praised. Say thou: In the Name of God, and take the cup of certitude in the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. By God! Through it thou shalt ascend to an atmosphere wherein thou shalt hear from the rustling of its winds "The Beloved of the worlds hath come!" Leave these people and their fancies, and stand firm in the Cause of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Then summon the people with wisdom and utterance. This is better for thee than all that hath been created in existence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Rend asunder the veils in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. He shall assist thee in the Cause, and He is the Powerful, the Almighty. Soon shall the world pass away. Strive thou to enter the Kingdom of immortality. By God! Wert thou to discover it, thou wouldst cry out between the heavens and the earth and stand firm in the Cause in such wise that neither the opposition of the divines nor the objections of the learned nor the power of rulers would deter thee. Choose for thyself what We have chosen for thee and regard not those who have wronged save as an ant that flieth for an hour or less. God shall soon purify the earth of these people and shall raise up His Cause as He pleaseth. Verily He is the Triumphant over all who are in the kingdom of command and creation. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Generous. We beseech God to give thee to drink of that which floweth from the right hand of the Throne and to make thee among those whom the denial of the polytheists hath not deterred in the Cause of their Lord. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the Name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious

O Hasan, of the people of the sovereign in Qaf! Thy letter hath come before Us, and We have read that whereby thou didst call upon God, thy Lord, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Praised. We have learned of the love thou bearest for the Beauty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. O Hasan! Be thou beneficent in all circumstances and deeds, that thou mayest exemplify the name wherewith thou wast named in the Kingdom of Names. Thus doth the Pen of Command enjoin thee from the presence of God, the Mighty, the Bestower. Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the direction of sorrows, the Spot whereon is established the throne of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, that He is God and there is none other God but Him. He hath created all things by His command. No God is there but Him, the Supreme, the Transcendent, the Mighty, the Help in Peril. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord, then be thou assured in thyself. Verily, He exalteth whom He willeth and abaseth whom He willeth. In His grasp are the keys of all things. He ordaineth for whomsoever He pleaseth whatsoever He pleaseth by His command, and nothing in all the worlds can prevent that which He hath created. Say: O people! Do ye imagine that aught can frustrate the Cause of your Lord, the Most High, or that the heavens and earth can withstand Him? Nay, by My Beauty that shineth upon all things, were ye of them that know! Say: Fear ye God, O people, and follow not your desires. Follow ye the religion of God and spread not corruption in the earth after its reformation. Then take ye for yourselves a path unto God in the midmost heart of paradise. Thus have We imparted unto thee the word of truth, that thou mayest hear what the Tongue of Unity hath warbled in the highest paradise. Moreover, convey Our remembrance unto him who was named Muhammad in times past, whose mention was in thy letter, that he may rejoice within himself at having been remembered before God, thy Lord and the Lord of all things and the Lord of the Concourse on High, He before Whose praise stand the realities of all created things. Say: O servant! We sent down unto thee aforetime a Tablet wherein We counseled thee to hold fast unto the Tree in such wise that the tempests of winds would not shake thee, lest thou fall upon the earth of abasement and deprivation. Beware, beware, O Zaman, lest thou forget that which thou wast commanded in the Tablet. Hearken unto the word of thy Lord, then cut thyself off from the manifestations of Satan from whom thou dost perceive the stench of hatred for this Youth, through Whom the veils of creation were rent asunder and by Whose Pen's decree were created the realities of the people of paradise. Beware lest thou sit with Mine enemies. Flee from them and shun them. Then take for thyself a station beneath the shadow of thy Lord's protection, which God hath purified from the doubts of time. Taste thou the cup of eternity and cast behind thee the cups of those who doubt that which hath appeared with truth. Leave them to themselves and place thy trust in God, thy Lord. Verily, He will protect thee through His power and dominion. Say: God knoweth what is in your breasts, and with Him is the knowledge of all things in a Book which none hath discovered, neither the Concourse of the Bayan nor the people of vision, save they who have severed themselves from all ties and have taken fast hold of the Most Glorious Cord between earth and heaven. By God! By the light of their countenances are illumined the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise and the inhabitants of the canopies of names. Thus have We expounded the verses unto thee and set them forth in truth, that thou mayest be of them that are assured. Say: O people! Do ye read words wherewith children ought to play, while ye stop your ears from hearing the words of God? Woe unto you, O concourse of loss! And thou, O Zaman, hear the counsel of thy Lord. Shun those from whom thou perceivest the odor of hypocrisy, and fear not thy solitude, for God is with thee at all times if thou standest firm in His Cause and detachest thyself from all who are in the heavens and the earth. Thus have We cast upon thee the truth as a bounty from Our presence, and I am He through Whose command hath appeared the kingdom of grace and beneficence. And the glory be upon thee and upon him whose letter came before God, and upon his family. Thus doth God single out for mercy whomsoever He pleaseth, and He, verily, is the Mighty, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Sovereign, the Bestower.

He is God! O servant who gazes upon the Face! Hearken in the most sweet Persian tongue to the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen. I swear by the Ordainer Who caused to flow from the tongue the fountains of wisdom and utterance, that if all who are on earth were to purify their hearts from the hints of imitation and the veils of fancy, they would all be drawn by a single melody from the divine melodies and would turn toward the holy divine dwelling place. But the cotton of imitation has blocked their ears and the veil of limitation has concealed their hearts. O Ali, the Cause has reached such a state that the people of the Bayan are considered before God more veiled than previous peoples, even though the King of mighty establishment, after rending the veil of the people, gave glad tidings in the year sixty of this manifest, evident, shining Beauty in all Tablets. Nevertheless, all have arisen with swords of malice to cut down the divine Lote Tree with utmost vigor. Those who were never aware of this Cause have now united to prevent the weak servants from reaching the shore of the divine presence. They understand not what they say and are unaware of what they do. They cling to the Book while turning away from the Lord of Lords. They pride themselves in words from before while turning entirely away from words that surpass whatever has been created in the heavens and earth. Like a gnat in barren land they make claims to divinity. How quickly they erased God's signs from hearts and focused on distorting His words rather than the creation of the Bayan and what was revealed therein, for all were created before by His word. Despite the explicit nature of this statement in the words of the All-Merciful, all have turned from the divine direction and turned to that from which Satan seeks refuge. This is why the Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all in the kingdoms of existence be sacrificed for Him - states that soon it will be witnessed that the people of the Bayan will inflict upon the All-Merciful what no one inflicted upon previous Manifestations. In the days when the Sun of the horizons was rising from the horizon of Iraq, Tablets were revealed in that land and all events that would occur in this land were inscribed by the Pen of Power in those Tablets - blessed are they who perceive. It has been known that the more manifest and perfect the Revelation, the more evil and base appear the manifestations of negation and dawning-places of hell. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of the Beloved that the Primal Point was grieved by my grief in His days and wept over my tribulations. In any case, the deed of Truth is entirely distinct from all else, but veils of fancy have prevented the sight of creatures. In these days the Beauty of Divine Unity is afflicted in the hands of the basest of His creatures. But they are pure nothingness and sheer nonexistence, for power and might and glory and exaltation, and likewise all names and attributes, are all praiseworthy and beloved in their relation to God. After severing this connection they all are and will be pure nothingness and sheer nonexistence, even if they should appear with all the means of the heavens and earth. That servant who gazes toward God must be grateful at all times that by God's might and power they have broken the idols of fancy and turned toward the holy direction of Divine Unity. How lofty is the station of a servant who arises today to aid the Cause of God and protect the weak ones of creation from satanic suggestions. Blessed art thou for having attained this and God has ordained as recompense for thy deed a station in His presence - and it is the best of stations and most excellent of abodes. Strictly forbid all the divine loved ones today from corruption and conflict, for whatever occurs, its harm returns to the divine Lote Tree itself, as has occurred and returned in these days. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who hearken to thy word regarding the Cause of God thy Lord and who drink the purest wine at the mention of this Greatest Scene. By God, they are among the most exalted of creation before God, my Lord and thy Lord and the Lord of our forefathers.

He is the One Who gazeth from the All-Glorious Horizon! Hearken unto the Divine Call and with penetrating vision and illumined heart, consider and ponder His wondrous words. All names have been and shall forever remain within the grasp of His power, and all people of diverse nations are clinging to and holding fast unto the divine names, for no soul hath the power to transgress the Kingdom of Names or to step outside His command. All make mention of His Name and turn toward His direction, and yet concerning some, there hath been revealed and sent down from the Divine Pen that they are worshippers of idols. Now ponder what hath been and shall be the cause of this. If We were to say they clung to names and remained veiled from the recognition of the Essence, all people share this station, for all besides Him have been and shall ever be veiled from recognizing His exalted Essence. The way is barred and the path is impassable. He was, and there was nothing besides Him that could know Him. Therefore, all recognition from the peoples of the worlds returneth to the ocean of Names, and it is most evident that every nation of the earth calleth upon Him by a name, and none can transgress this station. Yet upon some hath the decree of polytheism been issued from the Ancient Pen, and upon others hath the decree of Divine Unity been sent down, and this is for no other reason save that they are heedless of that which they have been commanded in this Day. Therefore are they reckoned among the people of the fire and are not mentioned in the presence of God.

The ultimate goal and the furthermost Lote-Tree and the most exalted horizon of human existence is that one should not remain veiled from the Truth in the days of God, and should will that which He hath willed, and should not perceive in himself any will, purpose, existence or life. He should see all these as perishing in His will and purpose. These are the essences of existence and the daysprings of the manifest. This is a Day wherein all the denizens of the highest Paradise are gazing upon the sincere ones and are crying out "O Lord, have mercy upon Thy servants," for rarely can be seen one who truly gazeth toward the horizon of God's Cause and is detached from all else. From every direction ariseth the cry of haste, and the manifestations of Satan are occupied with deception, each day calling the people by a different name.

O people of the earth! Alif and Shin! Hearken unto the Call of the Lord of the Worlds and with perfect certitude and assurance, gaze toward the direction of the All-Merciful in such wise that ye behold all the peoples of the earth as non-existent and turn unto the intended Goal. Interpret not the divine Word, and remain not veiled from its outer meaning, for none knoweth its interpretation save God and those who are heedless of the outer meaning of the words and claim to understand their inner meanings - I swear by the Most Great Name that such souls have been and shall ever be liars. Blessed are they who act upon the outer meaning and hope for the inner meaning. The Truth hath ever been one, sanctified from peer or likeness. We have borne all tribulations that perchance the people might enter the realm of sanctity. Strive ye that in these days ye may be adorned with the ornament of the mercy of the spring of the All-Merciful.

Recite ye this prayer morn and eve: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name, through which the sun of Thy Cause hath shone forth from the horizon of Thy Revelation, not to deprive us of the breezes that waft from the direction of Thy grace. Then make us, O my God, purely devoted to Thy Face and detached from all else but Thee. Then gather us, moreover, with those servants of Thine whom the intimations of human nature have not prevented from turning unto the Divine Presence. O Lord, cause us to enter beneath the shadow of Thy most great mercy, then preserve us from those servants who have disbelieved in Thy Most Glorious Name, and give us to drink of the pure wine of Thy providence and the choice wine of Thy bounty and favors. Verily Thou art powerful to do what Thou willest, and verily Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful. O Lord! Make us steadfast in Thy love amongst Thy creatures, for this is Thy greatest gift to Thy creation, and verily Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful ones.

In His Most Holy, Most Ancient, Most Luminous, Most Great Name, I am the Rewarder of all the worlds. These are the verses of Glory sent down from the heaven of destiny. Blessed are they that hear them. It behooveth no one to cleave unto what is with the people, but rather unto that which is with their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. That which is with the people profiteth them not. Verily God is the Self-Sufficient, the Powerful. He enricheth whomsoever He willeth through His command, and guideth whomsoever He desireth through His Name, the One Who ruleth over the worlds. Every great one hath become great through His greatness, and every powerful one through His Name, the Powerful. Every matter hath appeared through His sovereignty and everything hath become great through His Name, the Great. His names have encompassed all who are in creation. Verily He is independent of them, were ye of the assured ones. The names are with you, while with Him there is naught save His Self, the Mighty, the All-Informed. All things have bowed down before His Name, and every sovereign hath been humbled before His sovereignty, and in His grasp is every wise command. Take what ye are bidden by God and abandon what ye are bidden by every remote ignorant one. Every learned one who hath not known his Lord is counted among the ignorant, and every ignorant one who hath known his Lord is reckoned among the learned. We abase him who hath exalted himself and We exalt him who hath abased himself, for I am powerful over what I desire. Say: The Command is in My hand. I do what I will. There is no God but I, the Mighty, the Generous. Say: Were We to decree for light the decree of darkness, none hath the right to object. Thus hath it been sent down in the Tablets, were ye of those who know. Were We to decree good as evil, no soul hath the right to say "why?" Whoso sayeth this is among the transgressors. Verily He decreeth for the seeing one the decree of the blind, and for the blind one the name of the seeing. He is the All-Seeing, the All-Perceiving. All affairs are in the grasp of His power and are created by His Word, but most of the people are heedless. We hear from the servants what they object to God. Lo! they are among the losers. Say: O My servants, first ponder upon the origin of the Cause. When ye have recognized it, ye shall find yourselves in a vast expanse and shall not object to God even if He were to decree for all upon earth. Blessed are they that perceive. Were it not for My mercy, they would see the decree other than what they have, but My mercy hath preceded and My grace hath encompassed the worlds. Arise, O My servants, to assist My Cause, and be not of those who hesitate. Most of the servants who followed vain imaginings have objected to Us. Lo! they are among the wrongdoers. Those who have denied God's verses and His proof have lost. Lo! they are among the bewildered ones. They see the ocean yet hasten to the pond. This is naught but manifest wrong. They wrong their own souls and are not among those who are aware. They call upon God with their tongues, yet when He commandeth them with what their souls desire not, they return to their place in the depths of hell. They visit the House yet object to Him Who built it in His Name. Thus do their desires move them. Lo! they are among the godless ones. Blessed is he who hath shattered the idols of vain imaginings through the sovereignty of his Lord, the Lord of all men, and hath arisen among the servants with this wondrous Remembrance. He aideth whomsoever desireth to assist His Cause and inspireth whoso openeth his tongue in His mighty Name. O My loved ones! Be as beacons of unity among mankind and as lamps of detachment unto those who dwell in the heavens and on earth. Beware lest the dust of the world darken your hearts or the veils of the wayward conceal your faces. Be as stars of guidance among creation and as lights of utterance unto all in the realm of possibility. This beseemeth those who have attained the lights of the countenance in this brilliant dawn. O thou who hast turned to God! Recite the verses of thy Lord unto those who are there, that perchance they may arise unto that which beseemeth a Day like this, wherein the Spirit lamenteth and the Beloved crieth out in grief for the Beloved of the worlds. The Pen moveth and the tongue of the Lord of Eternity speaketh in this hour wherein the hosts of those who believed not in God have encompassed Him and were engaged in manifest oppression. Be patient, O Pen, and mention not that which saddeneth the loved ones of thy Lord, and be of the patient ones. God hath made tribulation the Kawthar of Glory. Thus hath the matter been decreed from the presence of One mighty and great. Verily glory from the Glory be upon those who have heard the call of Grandeur when it was raised in truth. Lo! they are among the sincere ones.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful

Essential praise and glorification befitteth that Intended One Who illumined the world through the effulgences of the Sun of Truth and adorned the realm of possibility with the ornament of knowledge from the ocean of awareness. Exalted be His greatness, glorified His power, magnificent His beneficence, and supreme His grandeur! He is the Powerful One Who through a single exalted Word brought forth the kingdom of earth and heaven, created man and guided him to the supreme horizon, and adorned sheer nothingness with the ornament of being and pure non-existence with the crown of existence. He is the Omnipotent One Whom neither the thunder of cannons can prevent from what He hath willed, nor the clash of swords deter from His pervading and mighty Will. He doeth what He pleaseth and ordaineth what He willeth. He is the Strong, the Dominant, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

Thereafter, your letter addressed to this evanescent servant opened the gate of reunion and bestowed the fragrance of attainment. After its perusal it was presented before His presence, whereupon He said: O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of love and gazest toward the horizon of grace! In this day it is incumbent upon all to seek protection from God, exalted be His glory, for His loved ones and chosen ones, inasmuch as commotions and upheavals have encompassed all. Each day a fresh calamity descendeth upon the world and a new sedition ariseth, yet none hath discovered the cause and reason thereof. The religion of God is seen to be weak while His enemies are strong. The deeds of men have become embodied in diverse manifestations - at times affliction, at times tribulation, and likewise in different forms of weapons, guns, swords and spears. Beseech ye God to awaken the heedless and rouse the slumbering, that perchance they may discover the cause and reason, for when any illness is diagnosed its cure becometh easy. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast subdued the world through one of Thy names! I beseech Thee by the blood of Thy loved ones which was shed in Thy path to protect Thy loved ones from the oppression of Thine enemies who have risen in an enmity the like of which the eye of creation hath not beheld. I beseech Thee, O Lord of eternity and Sovereign of nations, by the Most Great Name, to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will aid them in Thy remembrance and praise and in that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Thou art He, O my God, to Whose power all created things have testified and before the manifestations of Whose might all possible things have bowed down in submission. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

As to the mention made of certain souls, God willing, through His grace they shall act in accordance with what He loveth and is pleased with, and be engaged in His remembrance and praise. Convey greetings from this evanescent one to all and say: The world at all times proclaimeth its own evanescence and extinction, but only the hearing ears hearken. Blessed is the soul whose outward adornment preventeth him not from the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness nor depriveth him of the outpourings of the True Bestower. The atoms of dust cry out at all times saying: O children of Adam! Time passeth like lightning. Ye were not created for the world, rather it was created for you. Know ye your worth and act as beseemeth a human being. God willing, may all be assisted to do that which will profit them in all the worlds of their Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous.

As to the mention made of Darvish Husayn who desired to come and sought permission - in these days these regions are somewhat disturbed, therefore we beseech God to grant him the reward of pilgrimage. Verily, He hath power over all things. Under all conditions this evanescent one is occupied in prayer for God's friends. Prayer is from the servant and its acceptance from God, the One, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. In all matters be ye mindful of wisdom, for the people are ignorant and veiled from the Cause. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings.

May the honored and esteemed friend, Aqa Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God, take note.

He is God, the All-Powerful, the Most Glorious

Praise, sanctified above comprehension and reason, befitteth the Lord of all creation Who, through His all-compelling Will, honored the world by the advent of the Most Great Name - that sacred Being Who is mentioned by all names yet is sanctified from them all, Who is described by all human attributes yet is independent of them all. Glory be to God! In this station neither can the tongue describe nor is it capable of mentioning Him, neither can the heart comprehend nor draw nigh unto Him. This is a station where sight fails to behold and reason becomes powerless to understand. In consideration of His supreme mercy and greatest favor, He hath commanded all to engage in praise and glorification and hath ordained recognition of the Dawning-Place of Revelation and the Manifestation of His Cause, Who is His own Self. In this station, through His grace and favor, He hath reckoned confession of powerlessness and ignorance as knowledge, and acknowledgment of inadequacy as true recognition. Exalted be His bounty! Exalted be His generosity! Exalted be His grace! I bear witness that there is none other God but Him. He it is Who hath established Himself upon the throne and spoken amongst men without veil or concealment.

And now I inform my honored friend that some time ago a letter was received from Mulla Abu'l-Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God, wherein he had mentioned you. His great satisfaction with your letter was evident and manifest. He requested that I submit the details thereof to the Most Holy Court. At a time when this evanescent servant attained the presence of the Divine Throne and presented the details, the Sun of Grace shone forth from the Dayspring of Divine favor, and He said:

"It behooveth every soul to remember his Lord in these days wherein the Temple of Justice hath lamented between the heavens and the earth by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. O Muhammad-Baqir! The servant present before the Throne made mention of thee by virtue of what was recorded in the letter of Abu'l-Hasan, who hath believed in God, the Single, the All-Informed. Rejoice thou in that thou hast been mentioned before the Countenance and My Most Exalted Pen hath remembered thee. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Bountiful. The Glory be upon thee and upon My loved ones in that land. Convey My greetings unto their faces and say: Hold fast unto wisdom and put your trust in God, the Lord of all worlds. He is with you, witnessing and seeing, and He is verily the Protector, the Mighty, the All-Knowing."

Furthermore, the aforementioned person requested that I write to you acknowledging receipt of the sum you had given him, as well as what Aqa Muhammad-Husayn had given. In any case, he had mentioned all the details and a reply was sent to him. Surely he himself will write the details to you as well. We beseech God to aid you in that which will exalt His Cause and to number you among those whom neither human affairs have prevented from recognizing the Lord of Destiny, nor the might of the oppressors from God, the True King, the Manifest. And we beseech God to ordain for you the good of this world and the next. Verily, He is the Protector of those who do good. He hath indeed seized him who oppressed, and soon will He seize those who have denied Him and His verses which have filled the East and West of the earth. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

God willing, may you be enkindled at all times with the fire of divine love and be engaged in His remembrance. May the friends in that land who are gazing toward the horizon of the All-Merciful and have attained the wine of immortality convey this servant's greetings to them. We beseech God to gladden and quicken them all through the fragrances of the garment of the Beloved of the seen and the unseen, that they may remember Him in the assemblage of the world and be joyful in His remembrance. Praise be to God Who hath adorned that land with the wondrous and glorious ornament of the presence of His loved ones. Glory be upon you and upon those who have attained to the remembrance of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen.

He is the Speaker, the Manifest, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise

Praise be sanctified above all expression and understanding, befitting the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence of the Intended One, Who has made manifest the hidden mysteries within hearts and minds, and has confirmed the decree revealed by the All-Merciful in the Qur'an: "Though there be the weight of a mustard-seed and it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth. Verily God is subtle, informed of all things." The secrets of breasts and treacherous glances have been made so evident that none has any way to deny.

O Afnan, upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness! In days which, through the tyranny of the oppressors and the rejection of the followers of religions, were like the darkest night, this Wronged One arose before the faces of all to render assistance, such that the effulgences of the light of the Luminary of Revelation became manifest from every direction. None can deny this save he who is deprived of justice and fairness. Then emerged from behind the wine-jars the embodiments of tyranny with swords of hatred, and there appeared from them that which testified to their lies and to the calumnies of their own selves, whereat the Tablet lamented and My glorious, wondrous Pen cried out. One whom We had, from the beginning of days, granted a place beneath the pavilions of grandeur and appointed watchful eyes to protect, at last united with others like himself and issued decrees to oppress and seize people's property. Each day some falsehood appears and some harm arrives. To whoever turns toward this spot they attribute something. They seized money through theft and brought it to Akka, and oppression reached such a point that they even attributed to Aqa Siyyid Ahmad that which befitted their own selves. God is witness, and the atoms of creation bear testimony, that the Greater Afnan came to this land solely for seclusion, not trade. They have written concerning him that which proclaimed their own heedless, idolatrous selves. But glory be to Him - nothing among all things has prevented Him from what He desired, nor any grief from among griefs. He has spoken and continues to speak before all faces with a power that the hosts of the world cannot weaken and with a sovereignty that the ranks of nations cannot prevent. We beseech God to give all to drink from the Kawthar of His justice and bounty, to cause them to return unto Him, and to aid them to turn repentant to His gate. Verily He has power over all things.

To everyone the corruption of those souls has become evident and clear. Glorified be He Who has manifested what was in their breasts and hearts, and glorified be He Who has ascended the throne of utterance and given glad tidings to all of the appearance of their Lord, the All-Merciful. Verily He is the Almighty, the Glorious, the Bestower.

Your supplication arrived. Blessed be your tongue for having uttered that which has diffused the fragrance of God throughout all things, and blessed be your heart for having turned to Him on a day wherein appeared what had been hidden from eyes. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to raise you up through His sovereignty and draw you nigh through His verses, and through you to raise up the standards of His victory and the banners of His might, and to ordain for you what He has sent down in His Book for His chosen ones who were not prevented by the world and its ornaments and colors, who arose and said: "O concourse of earth and heaven! By God, He Who created them both has come with a Cause before which all in the kingdom of names cannot stand firm." To this testifies the Most Great Book which speaks among the nations, and He chose imprisonment for Himself for the salvation of the world. Blessed is he who has turned, found, recognized and said: "Praise be to Thee, O Beloved of the world, and glory be to Thee, O Desired One of all in the heavens and earths."

Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the loved ones of that land. Say: Hold fast to wisdom and occupy yourselves with teaching. Say: This is the Day of God - recognize its station and what has been ordained therein from the presence of a Mighty, Powerful One. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you and upon your family and upon those who love you and hear your word concerning this Most Great Announcement and this mighty Cause. Praise be to Him, for He is the Goal of those who know.

He is God, exalted be His station, the Glory and the Power!

Praise be befitting and worthy of the One Who is the Purpose of the world, Who illumined His loved ones with the lights of the Sun of Divine Unity and crowned them with the blessed word "There is none other God but Him." The might of their ranks was not prevented from remembrance, and the tumult of multitudes did not hinder them from turning to Him. And prayers and peace be upon the Sovereign of existence and the Purpose of the unseen and the seen, through Whom the Sun of Power shone forth from the horizon of the world and the Standard of the Cause was raised amidst all peoples, and upon His family and companions who aided the Cause of God with their souls and all they possessed until the Call was raised among the parties - enduring peace forever and ever.

Thereafter, it is submitted that the letter of that beloved one arrived and after its reading, it was taken to the Most Exalted Court where it attained the honor of being heard in His presence. In response, these sublime words dawned forth from the Dayspring of Knowledge. He spoke, and His sweetest utterance is this:

In the Name of God, the Lord of the worlds! O thou who art remembering and O thou who art beholding! Thy letter in fine handwriting arrived and was accepted. Verily We heard thy call and answered thee with that which testifieth to thy turning, thy steadfastness, thy remembrance and thy praise. Praise be to God that thou art illumined by the lights of the Sun of Proof which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of knowledge. From the Hand of Bounty thou hast drunk the cup of immortality and received thy portion of the sealed wine through the Name of the Self-Subsisting.

The purpose of what hath been mentioned is the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory, which thou hast attained. Divine love hath been expressed through His Most Beautiful Names. Blessed is he who hath taken the cup of love, detached from all else, and hath drunk therefrom in His Name, the One Who rules over all who are in the heavens and on earth.

We have made mention of each of the souls referred to, that the remembrance might attract them to a station wherein naught is mentioned save God and that which hath appeared from Him. Verily the Wronged One remembereth them through His remembrance and remindeth them of the signs of God, the Lord of the worlds, and giveth them glad tidings of His grace, His loving-kindness and His mercy which have preceded existence both seen and unseen.

We counsel each one to that which is the cause of the manifestation of love and the reformation of the world. The station of man is wisdom, nobility, kindliness, trustworthiness and religiosity. Goodly character is accounted as the mightiest of hosts in the world. We beseech God to assist His loved ones that they may unlock the doors of hearts with the keys of character and illumine the horizons with the light of unity. We ask God to assist them, grant them success, draw them near unto Him in all conditions, and send down upon them from the heaven of bounty His mercy and blessing. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and worthy to answer prayer.

We send greetings to the friends in every land and region, and counsel them to that which is befitting and proper.

Praise be to God! The river of utterance floweth and the Sun of knowledge shineth. This evanescent servant beseecheth God to assist that beloved one in that which leaveth lasting and enduring traces. Thou hast ever been and continueth to be remembered. The gaze of the favor of the Purpose of creation is directed towards that beloved one. In all conditions, this evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, that He may assist that beloved one in that which is the cause and means of awareness, that perchance the hearts of the servants may be illumined with the light of recognition of the Lord of creation. He is the Powerful and the Mighty.

I convey to each of the friends greetings, praise, glory and splendor, and with a hundred thousand tongues I beseech for them that which will cause the fields of knowledge to become verdant and flourishing and the gardens of justice and fairness to become fresh. Verily He hath power over all things.

Peace, remembrance, glory and splendor be upon your honor and upon those who have attained unto the light of unity, through God's grace, the Lord of the worlds. And praise be to God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful

Praise be to the Intended One Who offered the living waters of knowledge to all on earth without distinction or regard for station. Among the people are those who, having turned to Him, found; who, having been commanded, took; and who drank in His Name, the Mighty, the Generous. And among them are those who turned away and denied, until they arose to extinguish the light of God, the Lord of the worlds.

May the manifest and evident prayers from the horizon of God's loving-kindness, and the radiant, brilliant peace from the direction of His mercy which preceded all things, be upon the Sovereign of the chosen ones through whom earth and heaven were illumined, and upon His family and companions who strove in God's path until His word was exalted among all beings and the necks of the servants bowed before it.

And then - may my spirit be a sacrifice for your love - the letter of the beloved of the heart, his honor the Shaykh, upon him be 9 66 \[Baha'u'llah\], was noted. Praise be to God, they are adorned with the ornament of health, acceptance and love. This evanescent servant at all times and seasons beseeches and implores the True One, exalted be His glory, for the elevation of their station. After reviewing it, it was presented to the Master Who said:

"We beseech God, the Lord of earth and heaven, to strengthen him, make him successful, and grant him the good of this world and the next. Verily He is the Master of creation, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful. Peace be upon him and his brother and their families in Qaf. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to protect them from the darkness of smoke. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth through His word 'Be' and it is."

And regarding the mention they made of the honored lady, the sister of Aqa Mirza 'Isa, it was presented and He said: "The True One, exalted be His glory, created all servants, both male and female, specifically for His knowledge. Blessed is the one who became aware of the cause and purpose of their creation, such that the oppression of oppressors and the opposition of polytheists did not prevent them from the divine religion. Disbelief has encompassed the world, and the Truthful Informer has given this news. We must, in the night seasons and at dawn, at sunset and sunrise, with utmost humility and supplication beseech and implore the True One, exalted be His glory, to protect His loved ones with the hand of His providence and preserve them from the hosts of polytheism, disbelief, doubt, uncertainty, conjecture and idle fancies. Verily He has power over all things. Blessed is the leaf that heard the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and held fast to it, and woe to the heedless ones, both men and women."

We convey greetings to his honor 'Isa and counsel him to that which is befitting. The first thing incumbent upon the friends of God is to purify their hearts from rancor and hatred, to sanctify and cleanse themselves from bestial qualities, and to act upon the divine ordinances with the utmost joy and fragrance. By the life of God! If they hear the call of the Wronged One, ere long the world will be seen as one homeland, tongues as one tongue, and hearts as one heart. Blessed is he who holds fast to that which benefits him and turns away from every ignorant remote one.

And regarding the mention of permission on behalf of the handmaiden of God - this matter is not permissible in these days even outwardly, as quarantine exists in the surrounding areas and means of prevention are evident. We beseech and implore the True One, exalted be His glory, to enable all His servants to attain pilgrimage or record in their book the reward of pilgrims. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Generous. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Merciful.

Furthermore, let that beloved one act in whatever way they deem advisable. If expedient, they may send this very letter, or a copy of it, or a copy of parts of it. Verily the servant fears to contravene the wisdom he has been commanded to observe. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings. The end belongs to the God-fearing, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord

Praise be to Him Who is sanctified above my praise and the praise of all created things. How can the praise of those beneath Him reach the court of His glory, after my certitude that all else was created by His command? The oceans of praise and the heaven of remembrance and utterance are reserved for His loved ones, whom the afflictions and hardships of the world did not prevent from the Lord of Names. They arose and spoke that which the Tongue of Grandeur had spoken before the creation of all things: Verily there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Informed.

Thereafter, your beloved second letter, which you had written after returning from your journey, arrived - an arrival that refreshed the very spirit itself. It was as if it were cool living waters reaching one afflicted with thirst in intensely hot weather. Well is it with me and with you! After it was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and after the prayer was presented, these verses were revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Goal of all the worlds. His blessed and exalted Word:

O 'Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar! Praise the Goal of the world Who hath mentioned thee in such wise that were it to be compiled, a manifest book would be witnessed wherein oceans of meanings lie concealed and hidden in its words, and wherein the mysteries of the Books are treasured in its letters. Glory be to God! Despite a greatness the like of which hath not been witnessed in the world, the transgressors have turned away and deprived themselves of the Most Great Bounty and the Mightiest Ocean. Soon shall their dominion be rolled up, and they shall find themselves in the fire. Convey to all the friends in that land the greetings of the Wronged One, especially to those souls who have drunk from the Kawthar of inner meanings and who are gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon. Wondrous and exalted Tablets have been sent down from the heaven of divine Will; from their horizons the light of grace is manifest. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the Tablet of his Lord. By the life of God! It is more precious in My sight than whatsoever hath been created on earth or treasured therein. Verily thy Lord is the Strong, the True, the Trustworthy. The splendor shining forth from the horizon of My Most Exalted Pen be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who love thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.

What else can this evanescent one mention after the dawning of the lights of the Sun of divine favor? Who and what am I? I am lower than dust and more traceless than nothingness. The flow of ink is from His boundless mercy, and the power of the pen is from the spirit of His favor. Who gave power to the hand and Who taught the ink? His grace and mercy have encompassed all and are evident as the sun. He is the Describer of Himself and the Praiser of Himself. He hath no need for mention by anyone. His is the creation and the command, and He is the Mighty, the All-Choosing.

In brief, each of the aforementioned souls have been honored to be mentioned in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and for each one hath been revealed that whose fruit shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven, if they be enabled, God willing, to preserve it. The thieves and betrayers lie in wait. For twelve hundred years what did they bring upon the people? They reared all in vain imaginings and idle fancies until, on the Day of Manifestation, its fruit became evident to all the worlds. God curse them! They have done what neither Nimrod, nor Shaddad, nor the Christians, nor the Jews have done. They have pronounced judgment against Him through Whom the rivers of meanings and utterance have flowed in the contingent world and through Whom God's Law was established among His servants. Fie upon them and upon what their hands have wrought on the Day whereon the Herald proclaimed: "The Kingdom belongeth to the Creator of all existence!"

This evanescent servant beseecheth God - exalted be His glory - to aid and grant success to those souls who have unanimously determined to serve the Cause, that is, to educate and refine souls. Verily our Goal and your Goal, our Beloved and your Beloved, is the Hearer, the Answerer, and He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon your honor, upon them, and upon whosoever hath clung to the cord of God, the Lord of all worlds.

O My Most Holy and Most Exalted Messenger! Grieve not for what hath befallen thee. By My life! Thou art beneath the wing of thy Lord's grace, the Mighty, the All-Praised. I testify that thou hast attained the presence of God and achieved that which thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful, hath desired for thee. He was with thee when the oppressors drove thee from the City of God, whereat the eyes of the Concourse on High wept and the dwellers of the pavilions of Glory and Grandeur lamented. Thus doth thy Lord, the Most Glorious, bear witness, and He is, verily, the All-Knowing.

Rejoice thou in this Most Great Remembrance from the Ancient King. By God! It behooveth thee to soar with rapture at that which God hath testified for thee in this Tablet, from whose horizon hath shone forth the Sun of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Thou hast indeed fulfilled God's Covenant and His Testament, and turned unto Him with a luminous heart. Thy mention hath been revealed in the Tablets in such wise as to gladden the eyes of the sincere ones who shall come after thee. The very act of thy departure and exile from the City is identical with drawing nigh unto God. Thus doth He Who causeth the dawn to break testify in the Tablets, and He is verily the Ruler over what He willeth.

We have seen thy departure as arrival, thy going forth as entering in, and thy absence as presence before thy Lord. Such is the bounty ordained for thee by the One Who is the Almighty, the Ancient of Days. The heavens may vanish at thy Lord's behest, but that which hath been revealed for thee by the Pen of the Ancient of Days shall never pass away. Say: Praise be to Thee, O God of all the worlds! Joy and sorrow have embraced each other through what hath befallen you in the path of God. Blessed are they who understand. The sun of joy hath dawned through the manifestation of the Lord of Revelation unto you with the lights of grace and bounty, while sorrow hath consumed the hearts of the pure ones through what hath befallen you at the hands of the oppressors. The world and all that the wrongdoers behold for themselves shall perish, but that which hath been ordained for you in a clear Tablet shall endure.

Soar thou in the atmosphere of longing and yearning, since the Day-Star of the horizons hath shone upon thee through this wondrous Tablet. O Messenger! Read thou the Tablet wherefrom emanates that which hath perfumed all creation with the fragrance of the All-Merciful, by which the Holy Spirit hath been rendered fragrant. Say: All glory is in God's hands; He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth of His creation. He is, verily, the One Who hath power over His purpose. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Wise.

Remember My loved ones on My behalf, then choose for thyself the service of thy Lord. He will, verily, assist thee with the truth. He is with His sincere servants. Say: Glorified art Thou, O my God! Praise be to Thee for having caused my name to flow from Thy Most Exalted Pen, and for having mentioned my remembrance before Thy Most Great Throne. I beseech Thee, O Beloved of the worlds and God of all who are in the heavens and on earth, to make me steadfast in Thy love, firm in Thy Cause, gazing toward Thy direction, serving Thy Self, rising with Thy remembrance, and shining forth with Thy Name amongst all beings.

I testify, O my God, that with Thee the reward of one who hath borne hardships in Thy good-pleasure shall not be lost. Blessed is the soul that hath trusted in Thee and turned toward Thee. Woe betide him who hath denied and disbelieved and was among the transgressors. O Lord! Aid me in all conditions to serve Thee amidst Thy creatures. I testify that service unto Thee is naught but the exaltation of Thy remembrance and such deeds as manifest the sanctity of Thy Cause among the peoples of the world.

O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued all who are in the heavens and earth, through which Thy remembrance was exalted, Thy proof was established, Thy evidences appeared, and Thy verses were sent down, to assist Thy loved ones in that which Thou hast purposed for them through Thy bounty and favor. Then deliver them from the fire of self and passion, and cause them to enter beneath the shadow of Thy Most Great Mercy. Ordain for each one of them that which shall render him independent through Thy riches, powerful through Thy might, and triumphant over the enemies through Thy sovereignty and power, in such wise that the hosts of earth and the authority of those dwelling thereon shall not frighten him. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest. Thou doest what Thou pleasest through Thy pervading Will, and Thou decreest what Thou desirest through Thy all-encompassing Purpose. The clamor of the heedless shall not prevent Thee from that which Thou hast willed, nor shall the power of the oppressors render Thee impotent in that which Thou hast ordained.

Have mercy upon us, O our God! We call upon Thee and remember Thee by Thy Name, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of them that seek Thee and the Ka'bah of them that yearn for Thee!

O thou who art named 66, He is God, exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and the Power!

May my spirit be a sacrifice unto thy presence! What can this evanescent servant say or mention that would be befitting? It is most beloved that the beginning of every letter be adorned with the mention of the Lord of all beings and the King of origin and return. However, at times, when the certainty of non-arrival and attainment appears evident, the pen becomes still, the tongue silent, and the heart bewildered. In any case, since permission has been granted, we must praise Him with such descriptions and glorification as are acceptable among the servants. There is no other recourse, and this is the ultimate bounty. To Him be praise, thanksgiving, glory and splendor.

The blessed and exalted letter which was the cause of joy and gladness arrived. Like the spring rain to saplings and the special favors of God upon men, it hath showered upon this servant. Praise be unto Him and praise be unto His loved ones. Multiple letters have arrived; some have been presented and some have not yet found opportunity. God willing, they shall be presented.

Regarding the Afnan, His Honor Haji Mirza Siyyid Muhammad, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, what you wrote - that is, his exact words - was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. He said: "O My Name Mehdi, upon thee be My Glory! The call of the Afnan was heard. We are aware and cognizant of his grief and sorrow from separation and remoteness. Sorrow and anguish have seized him from every direction. God willing, may he not erase the days of presence from his sight. The remembrance and manifestation of that is the cause and reason for the defeat of sorrows. When the greatest joy comes, sorrow flees like lightning. O My Name! The Afnan is afflicted with both hardship and separation and exile, and other matters that are the cause and reason for heart-weariness. However, we beseech God to adorn him with such an ornament that the smoke and dust of the world may not change him, and likewise we ask for him that which is befitting and worthy. O My Afnan! Do not grieve, for the world is not worthy of grief. That which will gladden thy heart and the hearts of the lovers hath been ordained for thee. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds."

This evanescent servant beseeches God, exalted be His Glory, that means may be provided for them to return again, and that this evanescent servant may drink with them from the cup of reunion and meeting, time after time, repeatedly, cup after cup, chalice after chalice, in spite of those who have denied God's signs and rejected His manifest and evident proof.

Regarding the mention made of the beloved one, His Honor Haji Aqa Muhammad, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, after presentation They said: "O My Name Mehdi! The mention of the mentioned one is mentioned before the Mentioned One. God willing, may they be blessed in all times and circumstances with the favors of the Desired One of the worlds. O My Name! In truth, they are striving and endeavoring to serve the Cause, unite hearts, and promote the divine laws. Praise be to God Who assisted him in establishing harmony and steadfastness. Some of the loved ones of that land have sent letters to the servant in attendance. If God willeth, favors shall be shown hereafter and replies shall be sent. Praise be to God, all are seen as links of one chain. The lights of their love are evident and radiant. Glory be upon them, peace be upon them."

The fact that they had mentioned this lowly one brought two delights: one, their mention, and two, your honor's renewal and repetition of that mention - blessing upon blessing. Praise be to God, the land has been adorned with the flowers, roses and fruits of love. I convey greetings, praise and glory to them, and likewise to the loved ones of God in that land. Peace and praise be upon your honor, upon the beloved ones, and upon those who are with you.

May this reach the illumined and most holy presence of our honored and beloved master, the teacher, upon whom be all the most glorious and resplendent glory of God.

In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Ancient, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.

The essence of praise and its quintessence befitteth that eternal King Who hath, from time immemorial and unto everlasting, sanctified the hem of His chosen ones from the praise and glorification of this servant and his like. What relation can there be between the lowly earth and the exalted, elevated heaven? Glorified be He Who hath manifested and revealed the Word, and raised it up in truth, and made victory to reside in utterance, and hath spoken that whereby His mercy hath encompassed all in the realm of possibility, save those who arose and fled from the shadow of His grace. Exalted is the All-Merciful above being known through what hath been mentioned from the beginning that hath no beginning, or being remembered unto the end that hath no end. All descriptions and mentions have returned and shall return unto those who have cast away their desires and turned toward the Supreme Horizon, and heard and answered our Most Glorious Lord, and bore for God's sake the derision of enemies and trials and tribulations. These are servants whom God hath mentioned in His Scriptures, Books and Tablets, and made them the Hands of His Cause amongst His servants. Through them the clouds have rained, and vegetation hath sprouted in valleys and upon hills, and the decree of the Book was raised up. These are servants upon whom the Concourse on High and those who circle round the Throne pray at eventide and at dawn.

Glory be unto Thee, O Thou by Whose Name the gates of heaven were opened! I beseech Thee by the sovereignty of Names to assist Thy chosen ones to make mention of Thee and glorify Thee and that which beseemeth Thy days. Then protect them from the evil of Thine enemies who cast Thy Book behind their backs and turned away from Thy Beauty and disputed Thy proof and Thy testimony. Then ordain for them, O my God and God of all things visible and invisible, that which Thou hast ordained for those who offered up their spirits and their bodies in Thy path. Then manifest what Thou hast destined for them through Thy bounty and favors. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

My spirit be a sacrifice for your mention and my soul be a ransom for your steadfastness. This evanescent servant perceiveth his own shortcoming to such degree that he is ashamed even to express his deficiency and counteth even this among the gravest of sins, for some time ago I was honored to receive Thy blessed handwriting, yet I was negligent in offering a response. Once when I intended to present a petition, it was observed that a most exalted and holy Tablet had descended from the heaven of divine Will and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke this word: "O servant, stay thy pen, for the Supreme Pen maketh mention of him as a token of His grace." Until this time I have been and continue to be gladdened by the sweetness of the Merciful's utterance. I praise Him and thank Him throughout the duration of the kingdom and the heavenly realm, for the effulgences of the Sun of favor are directed toward your eminence. In such circumstance, mention of this evanescent one, who is like unto nothingness itself, was in no wise worthy or befitting. In these days, one night while engaged in recording verses in the presence of the Throne, amid the revelation your mention appeared from the Tongue of Grandeur and one most holy and exalted Tablet specifically for your eminence was revealed and dispatched. God willing, you will attain unto its perusal. This is the day of mention and praise, the day of enthusiasm and fervor, but this evanescent one's tongue is tired and body weak, and moreover commanded to wisdom. He beseecheth God, exalted be His might and glory, to raise up servants who may guide the people to the ocean of knowledge through wisdom and utterance, and speak that which is meet to be spoken. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. Through His Name every door was opened and every wise command was made manifest. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. The glory shining forth from the horizon of eternity be upon your eminence and upon those with you and upon those who love you and hearken to your word concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds.

All those circling round and standing before the Throne present their utter evanescence, nothingness and pure sincerity in service to your eminence.

The Most Great Branches, may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps, remember your eminence with holy mention and most exalted and glorious praise.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful!

Glorified be God, our Lord, the Lord of the mighty Throne and our Master and the Master of the exalted Seat. He hath sent forth the Messengers out of love for His servants and creation, and as a bounty and favor unto them, that He might draw them nigh unto Him and guide them to the court of His glory and acquaint them with that which profiteth them in every world of His worlds. He hath sent down the Books that His proof might endure in His kingdom. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful One Who loveth His servants and creation, and remindeth them at all times of His signs, and sendeth down mercy upon them from the heaven of His bounty. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid those who have believed in His signs to remain steadfast in His word of unity. He is, verily, the Helper, the All-Knowing, and the Almighty over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Most Great.

O beloved of my heart! Thy letter was received, but there was no opportunity to reply. On this night I was enabled to make mention of a response, and I beseech God, glorified be His majesty, to protect that beloved of the heart and aid him to set aright the affairs of His loved ones. He is our Protector and the Protector of the sincere ones among His servants and those who are nigh unto His creation.

On this night thy letter was again presented before His presence. He said: The friends of God have ever striven with utmost effort for the well-being of their fellow believers. Praise be to God that thou hast been assisted to accomplish that which is the greatest means for the manifestation of the light of unity and concord. This Wronged One beseecheth God, glorified be His majesty, to protect His friends and to make each one a gate of mercy, blessing, kindness, compassion, prosperity and reformation. He is, verily, the Almighty, the All-Choosing.

Although thy presence with the Wronged One was beloved, yet since thou art occupied with the affairs of the friends of God, glorified be His majesty, it maketh up for what was lost, nay rather, it is greater. We beseech God to aid all to manifest His attributes among them. He is, verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

Both heart and tongue are occupied with the love and remembrance of the days of thy presence. The pen writeth, the tongue speaketh, the heart is aflame with the fire of love. All this is from the grace of God, our Lord and your Lord, upon you and upon His servant. He is, verily, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful.

How can one enumerate His mercy and generosity? Every fair-minded soul hath confessed its inability, and every truthful one hath acknowledged it. The Prophets have confessed their powerlessness, how much more so the diverse parties! In all conditions we hold fast to His cord and hope for His grace. He is the One Bestower and the Mighty, the Powerful.

The true Beloved, His Holiness Ali, upon him be God's everlasting peace, whose very being is the gate of love and the book of mercy, hath ever been and still is remembered in the heart and is present before the face of the Lord. In all conditions I seek His confirmations and beseech God, glorified be His majesty, to aid him to guide mankind and enable him to rend asunder the veils of the people of allusions. He is, verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

The friends are each remembered and blessed with the favors of their Lord, may our spirits be sacrificed for Him. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to manifest a wondrous favor and adorn all with that which gladdeneth their hearts. He is, verily, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

At the end of thy letter mention was made of the Face. It was intended to be acquired in the way of religion, but it proved impossible as commerce hath ceased in this land. According to what thou didst submit to my master, His Holiness Gh. S., may my spirit be a sacrifice for the dust of his footsteps, the funds were sent to Egypt for the purchase of the stone, and likewise for other purposes. However, word hath come from the Threshold that a sum of one hundred Ottoman liras was sent to the house. As commanded, mention was made of this to the one named Jud, upon him be 96 \[Baha'u'llah\], that they should send that purse exactly as it is. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon God's righteous servants.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful

Glorified be He Who sendeth down the rain as He willeth and causeth it to descend as He pleaseth. Glorified be He Who bestoweth His favors as He chooseth and showereth them as a token of His grace upon His triumphant servants. Praise be to God Who bestoweth wealth and causeth it to descend by His command, for He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Glorified be He Who hath adorned poverty with the ornament of pride through His words: "Poverty is My glory." Thus did the Tongue of Revelation speak aforetime, as every discerning soul doth testify.

The letter of that spiritual friend was received, and from its fragrance wafted the sweet savors of love for God and sincerity. The life of existence hath ever been and shall remain through the mention of the Desired One. Whosoever attaineth unto this hath attained unto all good. After reading and observing the letter, it was brought before the Most Holy Court, and all of it was presented before His Presence. He said: "O Ahmad, upon thee be My loving-kindness." The servant present read thy letter before the Face of the Wronged One.

The purpose of creation hath been and shall ever be the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory. This is the most exalted summit, the supreme horizon, the primal valley, and the ultimate goal. The eyes of them that are nigh unto Him are fixed upon it, and the hearts of the sincere are turned towards it. This is the station whose mention is as the water of life to every seeker, and is the straight path for every wayfarer. By the life of God! If the heart be connected to the mentioned ocean of utterance, it shall find itself free and unfettered. Praise be to God that thou hast drunk from the cup of recognition and attained unto the supreme bounty.

That which is incumbent today, after recognition, is service to the Cause through wisdom and utterance, and through deeds and character, for goodly deeds and praiseworthy character are the hosts of God, and are mightier than the hosts and armies of earth. Blessed is he who acteth according to that which hath been commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. Other stations have no worth or standing. Whatsoever is witnessed in the world of wealth, riches, treasures and the like belong to God. There is no shame in their absence, nor pride in their presence. By the Sun of the horizon of Truth! Today pride lieth in pure deeds and spiritual qualities.

Make thy provision the Word that hath issued from My mouth at the time of thy turning toward the land of Baha, thy shield the fear of God, and thy weapon humility and lowliness before the face of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We beseech God to grant thee the good of the hereafter and of this world, and to send down upon thee that which beseemeth His grace and bounty. Verily, He hath power over all things.

This evanescent servant hath ever beseeched God, exalted be His glory, that He may strengthen thy father, thyself, and all the other brothers and relatives - upon them be the Glory of God - to mention Him, to praise Him, and to serve His Cause, and that He may ordain for them that which shall shine as a light in every world of His divine worlds. God willing, may they be as lamps of character in the world. In truth, thy father - upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness - is adorned with qualities which the Prophets and chosen ones have mentioned from God, exalted be His glory. Blessed be he and those who walk in his footsteps, holding fast to his path.

Concerning what was mentioned about the matter of trade, it was presented, and He said: "Act according to what the honored Afnan, Siyyid M. - upon him be My glory and loving-kindness - deemeth advisable. His wealth is God's wealth. This is a firm, verified, and established command, to which honored servants bear witness." God, exalted be His glory, hath commanded engagement in craft, earning, and trade. Yours is the action, and His is the blessing and loving-kindness.

This evanescent servant beseecheth that He may adorn the trades with great profit. He is the Powerful, the Able. His is the greatness, the power, the might, and the majesty. There is no God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Peace be upon you and upon God's sincere servants, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the name of our Lord, the Exalted, the Most High!

Glorified be God, Who created the heavens and the earth in less than an instant. This is what He hath ordained by His command, if ye be of them that understand, and what hath been mentioned in the Book concerning the boundaries of the six \[directions\], which is nothing but a wisdom from God, the Help-in-Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

Say: O concourse of the earth! Fear God, and have mercy upon yourselves. Cling to the Cord that is moving in all directions with the tokens of the splendor of the Beloved. Be ye not heedless of it and hold fast to it, if ye desire to ascend the summits of holiness. I swear by God, O concourse of the earth! The Hour is now manifest in the Temple of evident might, the Resurrection hath come to pass and appeared through the celestial light of the Beloved, and the Path hath been raised up through the Self of God, the Protector, the All-Praised. Paradise is now visible and adorned with the ornament of Him Who is the supreme object of desire. The souls of men are suspended in the heaven of transcendent glory, and the Nightingale is warbling its melody upon the branches of the Tree of Command, if ye be of them that hearken. Verily, the Beauty of God hath appeared from behind the veil, and yet ye are veiled in veils of your own.

Hearken to My words, and attend to that of which ye have been careless. Consume all the veils in the name of God, the Help-in-Peril, the Most Exalted, the Self-Subsisting. Perchance ye may enter into the gardens of Paradise, inhale the sweet fragrances wafting from the holy flowers of the Beloved, and not withhold yourselves from attaining that which hath been ordained for you through the grace of God, the Protector, the Almighty, the Most Holy.

By the righteousness of God! Soon whatever ye regard as precious in this vain life will be folded up, ye will return to God, and will be called to account for your deeds, and ye will no longer be able to make amends for that which hath escaped you. In the holy Presence, before the angels of the Realms above, ye will be shame faced, and nothing ye have done in your lives will avail you, neither will the worldly vanities ye have accumulated profit you. This is the clear truth, which the fingers of the Self-Subsisting have inscribed and made manifest through the power of truth, if ye be of them that understand.

Say: By the righteousness of God! The days of the Spirit have passed you by while ye were heedless of them. Wherefore, be advised by this counsel of Mine, and turn towards the Face of your Creator, if ye be of them that understand. Take no rest except in remembrance of God. This is what the Dove of the Spirit counseleth you that haply ye may be guided by the guidance of God, and may conduct yourselves upon the earth in accordance with His will. This is better for you than all that hath been and will be. And take no breath except in remembrance of the Beloved, if ye would be guided by this counsel.

Say: By the righteousness of God! At this moment the Dove of the Command is singing the most exalted call in the centre of the heavens, if ye be of them that hearken. Sanctify your ears and purify your vision that haply ye may see with the eyes of God that which He hath ordained for you in His kingdom of glory and what He hath inscribed with the fingers of the Spirit upon the guarded Tablet of holiness.

O 'Ali, give thanks to God, thy Lord, inasmuch as He hath enabled thee to recognize Himself and imbued thy heart with His love. This, indeed, is the intended goal. Moreover, He hath manifested to thee that which thou didst see in the world of the dream. This, indeed, is an evident bounty. Wherefore, sanctify thy soul and soar with the wings of power in the glorious atmosphere of the Beloved. Have no fear of anyone, and forget not the grace of thy Lord unto thee. Be thou in thy love for thy Creator like a mountain of ruby, and withhold not thyself from the remembrance of thy Lord. Make mention of Him, then, at all times. This is the grace of God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. Trust in God in all affairs, and avoid those who have disbelieved in God and were shut out from meeting Him. We bear witness at this moment that thou hast been faithful to thy promise and responded to thy Creator at a time when the hateful have not responded to Him. Thus, hath His mercy preceded thee and those who have trusted in God, their Lord. Announce the glad tidings to thyself, and rejoice in thy spirit, inasmuch as thou hast arrived in a land around whose precincts the angels of holiness circle. Thus have We bestowed our bounty upon thee and upon those who have believed in God, their Lord, who have turned towards the Countenance of the All-Glorious. Salutation upon thee and upon those who are steadfast in their love. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou art He Who hath brought forth all created things from the treasury of Thine eternity, and raised up all creatures from the ocean of Thy generosity and bounty. Thou hast rolled up the cycles from eternity unto eternity, and turned the ages from pre-existence unto everlastingness, whereupon the seas of Thy mighty Will did surge, and upon them sailed the ships of Thy desire, and upon them settled the ark of Thy decree from the heaven of Thy providence.

Thereafter, Thou didst move the thread of pre-existence through the garments of nothingness, and breathed the spirit of life into the essence of sublime glory, that thereby the countenance of Thy names might be revealed in the kingdom of Thy attributes, and the beauty of Thy face might be made manifest in the realm of Thy grandeur. Among these, Thou didst single out one of Thy servants, clothing him in the garment of Thy grace and the robe of Thy guidance, giving him to drink from the water of Thy love and the Kawthar of the manifestation of Thy good-pleasure. Thou didst nurture him with the hands of Thy mercy and suckle him from the breasts of Thy generosity until he grew mighty in the sovereignty of Thy power and the dominion of Thy lordship.

Thou didst make him firm in his faith in Thee and in Thy signs, a servant to Thy presence and a slave at Thy threshold. He walked upon the earth according to what Thou hadst ordained for him, and what Thou hadst decreed through Thy divine sovereignty and godhood. That which Thou didst ordain for him from the wonders of Thy power came to pass, and that which Thou didst determine from the essence of Thy might and the quintessence of Thy wisdom was fulfilled, until the time which Thou hadst fixed in Thy Book, wherein falsehood cannot enter, nor can what is written therein be delayed by a single hour or hastened forward.

Thereafter, when his appointed time was fulfilled and his days were ended, Thou didst return him unto Thee as Thou hadst brought him forth from Thee, concealing him in the treasuries of Thy hidden knowledge and the repositories of Thy mystery. All this proceeded solely from Thy consummate wisdom and Thy perfect handiwork, from the hidden stores of Thy knowledge and the jewels of Thy concealed mystery. Yet when the understanding of this became veiled behind the curtains of Thy jealousy and the pavilions of Thy grandeur, Thy servants were troubled and Thy bondsmen were grieved - though by Thy glory, they would not grieve over any aspect of Thy descending decrees or occurring affairs.

Glorified, glorified art Thou! I beseech Thee at this moment, by Him Whom Thou hast made the heaven of Thy Will and the earth of Thy Purpose, the sun of Thy decree and the moon of Thy determination, to send down patience into the hearts of His loved ones and Thy loved ones, for none shall be found among His loved ones save through the revelation of the sun of Thy love and the manifestation of the moon of Thy affection. Then strip from the frame of his father and mother the garments of sorrow and the robes of grief, for this Thou lovest in the kingdom of Thy most exalted might, the pavilion of Thy most glorious majesty, and the paradise of Thy most holy sanctity. Then clothe them in the purest vestures of Thy bounty and the most protective veils of Thy joy. Verily, Thou art the Giver of whatsoever Thou willest in whatsoever way Thou pleasest, and Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.

Glorified art Thou, O my God! I adjure Thee at this moment by Thy Word through which the mystery of Thy Self was established upon the throne of Thy sovereignty, and the Essence of Thy Being upon the seat of Thy grandeur, that Thou extinguish not the lamp which Thou hast kindled with the light of Thine eternity, nor still the dove which Thou hast caused to soar by the essence of Thy rapture and the quintessence of Thy yearning. Then grant tranquility, O my God, to Thy servant who burneth with love for Thy beauty, who crieth out in secret with longing to meet Thee, who waileth in his heart seeking reunion with Thee, who weepeth from the intensity of his passionate desire for Thee and the overwhelming force of his yearning for Thee. Though in the very midst of attainment, he seeketh reunion with Thee; though at the very height of nearness, he is consumed by the fire of Thy love. There have descended upon him drops of a grief that cannot be quenched and waves of anguish that shall never cease, such that the mystery of Thine eternity, the garments of Thy lordship, and the essence of Thy divinity have been saddened thereby. His drink in these days is from the tears of his eyes, and his food in the nights is from the sighs of his heart and the blood of his soul.

Therefore, O my God, send down into his heart a tranquility from Thy presence and a patience from Thy court, that he might find rest upon the throne of Thy strengthening and the seat of Thy composure, lest he be disturbed by what befalleth him from the hidden aspects of Thy Cause and the manifest tokens of Thy wisdom. For in Thy hands is the kingdom of the heavens, in Thy right hand is the empire of radiance, and in Thy grasp is the realm of destiny. Verily, Thou art the Bestower, the Omnipotent, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Powerful.

In the Name of God, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing!

Your letter hath come before Us, and We have understood its contents. We beseech God to aid thee to recognize Him, to detach thee from all else save Him, and to draw thee nigh unto His Self. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Help in Peril. Blessed art thou for having turned unto this Prisoner, Who hath been imprisoned in the path of God by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. It behooveth one such as thee to know God and to ascend, by the ladder of certitude, unto the station of true knowledge.

Verily, when We found in thee the love of God, We responded to thee with this Tablet, that thou mayest be among those who, when the verses of their Lord are sent down unto them, fall prostrate upon their faces before God, the One, the Peerless, the Self-Subsisting, the Just. Turn unto God with proof and evidence, and with that which He hath made a testimony from His presence. Thus hast thou been commanded by thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Test not thy Lord, for it is His to try His servants as He pleaseth. Turn unto Him, then be content with what He hath ordained for thee in the Tablet, and be thou in a state of joy and tranquility.

Verily, He hath not sent down upon anyone save that which is better for him than all that hath been created in existence. And if thou art unable to immerse thyself in the depths of the oceans of thy Lord's good-pleasure, the Lord of Names and Attributes, then ask of Him what thou desirest, for He fulfilleth the needs of those who ask of Him, and He is indeed of great bounty and supreme benevolence. Beware lest thou condition thy turning unto Him upon any matter, for He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He shall not be asked of His doings. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Bountiful.

Abandon what the people possess and take what is with God. He will suffice thee above all that hath been created in existence and ordained in contingent being. Know thou that I am but the servant of God among you, moved by the winds of the will of your Lord, the All-Merciful, as He pleaseth and willeth. I possess for myself neither life, nor death, nor stillness, nor motion. I speak not except by His leave, as evidenced by that which hath appeared from Me by His command, which none can perceive save those endowed with insight.

Hearken unto the rustling of the Most Exalted Pen, the rushing of the winds of grace, and the cooing of this Dove that singeth by thy Lord's command upon the branches of the Lote-Tree of inner meanings and utterance with diverse melodies. Gird up thy loins to assist the Cause of God, then arise from the horizon of the Cause with remembrance and utterance. Say: O people! The clouds of idle fancies have been rent asunder and the verses have been sent down from God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Knowing. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of Him Who hath come to you with power and sovereignty.

If thou wouldst hear My word concerning thy Lord's Cause, God would raise thee to a station wherein thou wouldst behold most of mankind beneath thy shadow, and He would send down unto thee that which would gladden thy heart. Verily, there is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command. All things are with Him in due measure. By what proof can one who denieth this Cause establish his faith in God? Say: By which of your Lord's signs do ye cry lies, O ye who are in loss!

Detach thyself from all things, then turn thy face toward thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and say: O my God and my Master! I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou didst unlock the tongues of them that know Thee in Thy praise and glory, and through which the hearts of the sincere ones were severed from all that was created on earth in their quest for Thy nearness and good-pleasure, that Thou deprive me not of the breezes that waft from the right hand of the gardens of Thy paradise, nor of the fragrances that are wafted from the direction of Thy Name, the All-Forgiving, upon the sinners among Thy creatures. Then cause me, O my God, to be wholly turned unto Thee and detached from all else save Thee. Then remove, by the fingers of Thy power, the veils that have come between me and the lights of the countenance of the Manifestation of Thy most exalted Self in this Revelation, which hath appeared in Thy Most Great Name between earth and heaven. Then send down upon me, from the clouds of Thy mercy and the heaven of Thy grace, the good of this world and the world to come, and ordain for me a seat of truth with Thee in the highest paradise. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Exalted, the Most High, the All-Choosing.

Jinab-i-Siyyid Zaynu'l-'Abidin, upon him be the Glory of God

In My Name, the One dawning from the horizon of the Kingdom of Utterance! The breezes of utterance have wafted, the fragrance of divine knowledge has been diffused, the sun of unity has shone forth, the moon of oneness has appeared, the rustling of the Divine Lote Tree has been raised, and the scratching of My Most Exalted Pen has been heard. Then We saw the conditions of the earth transformed and altered. When We turned Our gaze, We beheld the Faithful Spirit come to hearken unto My call, and the Spirit stood before My face, and the Primal Point circled round Me. Thereupon the tongue of My grandeur spoke that which I am unable to recount to you. Blessed are they who were present, who heard, who attained, and who returned to their stations by My command, and I am the Ancient Commander.

When that carpet was rolled up, We spread another carpet. We concealed the mysteries and revealed what was befitting for the people of the land, and I am the Mighty, the All-Choosing. O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who has turned to the Countenance, whose letter appeared before the Throne, sent by one who was speaking My praise, who stood firm in service to My Cause, who turned to My horizon, and who would transcribe My verses in the nights and days. Verily, he was named Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin in the Mother Book.

O Zaynu'l-'Abidin! The Wronged One makes mention of thee with a mention whereat the world was stirred with longing for the meeting with the Ancient King, and the Maids of Paradise came forth from their chambers to hearken unto the call of their Lord, the Possessor of the Day of Return. Thy letter was presented and the Most Great Branch, who was present before the Throne, read it. We have answered thee with verses which God hath made as an ocean of light for His loved ones, as a globe of fire for His enemies, as the All-Highest Paradise for His chosen ones, and as the exalted Paradise for those who circle round the Throne. Thus have We sent down verses for thee and expounded them by Our command, that thou mayest give thanks to thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.

Take thou the chalice of My utterance in My Name, then drink from it with My remembrance and say: "My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having remembered me while in the grasp of enemies, and thanks be to Thee for having turned towards me when I was in a fortress built of polished stone. By Thy might, O my Desired One, my Beloved, the Ultimate End of my hope and my expectation! The thirst of my heart is not quenched save by the Kawthar of Thy utterance, nor the agitation of my heart save by the rain of Thy mercy, nor is my inner being gladdened save by the manifestations of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy mercy and the effulgences of the lights of the sun of Thy bounty to ordain for me from Thy grace that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and be a lamp whereby I may walk in Thy worlds and be illumined amongst Thy servants. Then ordain for me that whereby my soul may find tranquility. Verily, I know not what profits me. Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed."

We make mention in this station of thy mother, whom thou didst mention in thy letter. We beseech God to assist her, to strengthen her, and to grant her that which will solace her eyes and gladden her heart. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Verily, he who hath attained unto My mention and the traces of My Pen is of the people of Baha in the sight of God, the Lord of all men. Blessed is the maidservant who hath attained, and the servant who hath attained, and woe unto every heedless doubter.

We have sent down for him who was named Muhammad that whereby the fragrance of the loving-kindness of the All-Merciful hath been diffused throughout all possibility. Blessed is he who hath taken it with power from Us and found from it the fragrance of the mercy of his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

O Hashim! We have heard thy mention and have mentioned thee from the Pen, which, when it moved upon the Tablet, all created things were stirred with longing to hearken to the call of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Gracious. We have mentioned thee before and at this time. Rejoice and say: "Praise be to Thee, O Lord of all beings, for having mentioned me and sent down for me that whose fragrance shall never be cut off. I testify that Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Protector of what is and what has been."

At the end of the Tablet We make mention of My loved ones who have soared in My atmosphere and taken My Book, whom neither the doubts of the transgressors nor the signs of the deniers prevented. They drank the choice wine of revelation from the chalice of My bounty. They arose and proclaimed: "O peoples of the earth! Set aside what ye possess. By God! The Lord of Heaven hath come with sovereignty that neither the hosts of rulers can withstand, nor the clamor of divines can prevent, nor can the might of those who denied what was sent down from God, the Powerful, the Manifest, the All-Knowing, cause Him to fear."

In His Name, Who is manifest above all things! Say: O Pen! When the appointed time came, the eye was bewildered and the breezes of tribulation seized the polytheists. Among them was he who cast away the Book of God and opened his mother's book. Thus did the ignoble one. O people of the realm of possibility! I adjure you by your Lord, the All-Merciful: Have you seen a countenance more beautiful than what hath appeared, found an utterance more wondrous than what hath come forth, heard a call more exalted than what hath been raised, or witnessed a youth more comely than this wondrous Youth? By God! At that moment I heard the cry and lamentation of all things. Nay, by Thy beauty, O Glory of the worlds! Through Thy name the Most Great Ocean was stirred, and through Thy remembrance the mouth of them that are nigh unto God was perfumed. None hateth Thee save he who knoweth not his father. Then must the question be referred to his mother, were he to be of the fair-minded.

Time hath brought Me low, to such extent that the dumb now speaketh, since the gates of utterance have been opened through this human being who proclaimeth at the midmost heart of creation: "Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Speaking One, the True, the Articulate, the Trustworthy." Abasement hath reached such a pass that the mute claimeth to have heard the melodies that were raised between earth and heaven. Even so did the Impostor make his claim when he beheld those who were secluded now clothed as men, who prostrate themselves before every remote idol. He who is unable to speak as common folk speak hath risen in whispering delusion, claiming for himself what none among the polytheists have claimed.

The feeble one desired to speak amidst the cooing of the Dove. Fie upon those who turned unto him and were among the abased! The desires of those who know not their left from their right have raised him up. Say: O people! Fear God, and follow not those who have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. If thou marvel, then marvel at him who turned toward the croaking of the raven, turning away from the melodies of the Spirit whereby existence itself was quickened. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in this manifest Prison.

Those who cannot distinguish between the valuable and the worthless, the fat and the lean, have taken him as their protector instead of God. They are assuredly among the losers. Say: Ye are the deaf who hear not My sweetest call, and ye are the blind who behold not this luminous Scene. By My life! Mine eye beholdeth My beauty, Mine ear heareth My most wondrous and matchless verses, My pen moveth by My name and remembrance, and My tongue speaketh forth My praise in this vast expanse wherewith Paradise and all within it converseth, saying: "Blessed art thou, O most exalted Station, wherein the Beloved of the world hath appeared and speaketh by His Most Great Name, and wherein the might of the nations that rose up in opposition and were among the oppressors hath not hindered Him."

O Bird of the Divine Throne! It seemeth Thou hast found a place of security; We behold Thee soaring in all directions and singing with all melodies. Hast Thou forgotten the talons of the malevolent ones and the arrows of the polytheists? The people have been prevented by the croaking of the croaker. Pay them no heed, but speak forth in this Paradise the praise of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Thus doth the Ancient Commander command thee. The Kingdom hath been stirred by the melodies of the Bird of the Realm of Might, and the mortal world hath been seized by the breezes of the verses of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. All things have been attracted by the call of God, yet We see that the people are as though dead.

Arise over the graves in the name of thy Lord, the All-Forgiving! Say: O ye who lie in the tomb! The Promised One hath come, and the Sovereign of existence hath appeared in His mighty glory. How long will ye slumber in the cradle of vain imaginings? Arise at My leave and My call, then drink of the choice wine which floweth from the direction of the Throne through His name, the Mighty, the Generous.

Blessed art thou, O thou who hast turned to God, for this luminous Tablet hath been sent down in thy name, and for thy remembrance hath the mouth of God, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Powerful, been opened. Were creation to endure forever, such a bounty could not be equaled, if thou be of them that know. Convey My greetings to My loved ones who have recognized Me, turned away from Mine enemies, circled round My Cause, been gladdened by the expansion of My commandments, and rejoiced at My mention and praise in My days. They are assuredly among the sincere ones.

Thus have We informed thee, apprised thee, and caused thee to hear the call of this lonely Stranger. The glory from the Beloved be upon thee and upon them. He is, verily, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

Then know that thy letter hath come before Us, and We have heard that wherewith thou didst call upon God thy Lord in that which proceeded from My tongue, and it was read before Us by him who was present before the Throne, and We have answered thee with truth. Soon it shall reach thee, if God should will and desire. Verily there is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all things with Him are according to measure. Give thanks unto God for having delivered thee from thy people and brought thee forth from among them with tranquility and power, and aided thee to recognize the Manifestation of His Self after they all turned away from God. Even thus doth light proceed from fire. Then unite with the loved ones of God and speak among the people with wisdom, for We have lifted the law of disputation and have left the earth to its people. Thy Lord desireth naught but the hearts of the righteous. And the glory be upon thee, and the splendor be upon thee and upon thy sister and upon whoso hath rent asunder the veils.

His honor Zaynu'l-'Abidin, who attained the presence of God and achieved victory, is he who hath dawned from the horizon of the heaven of proof. This is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down to him who hath turned his face towards His countenance, until he attained that which was revealed in the Book of God, the Lord of all men. O Zaynu'l-'Abidin! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One from the right hand of the luminous Spot in the Most Exalted Paradise. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. At times He maketh mention of His station as the Most Great Prison, and at others as the Most Exalted Paradise. By the life of the Desired One! Paradise doth not cause Him to forget His remembrance, nor do tribulations in His path harm Him. He hath borne such afflictions as none knoweth save the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The Tongue of My grandeur hath testified for thee, while seated upon the Throne, of thy turning towards Him, thy presence before Him, and thy hearkening unto the call of God, the Lord of the worlds. When thou returnest to thy place, make mention of My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad-tidings of My bounty. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid them and draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful.

O Zaynu'l-'Abidin! Hearken unto the divine call in the Persian tongue. Today the friends must, one and all, occupy themselves with such conduct and deeds as will cause the exaltation of the Word of God and the preservation of souls. The standard of praiseworthy character hath preceded all other standards, and the banner of goodly deeds hath ever been, and will continue to be, exalted above all others in station. Say: O friends! By the life of God, contention hath been forbidden, and conflict, corruption, bloodshed and evil deeds have all been strictly prohibited in My Most Great Book. Indeed, certain utterances were previously revealed from the Pen of the Dayspring of Divine Unity regarding the rebellion of the Shi'ih party, such as when He said in one instance: "The necks have been extended in hypocrisy. Where are the swords of Thy retribution, O Subduer of the worlds?" The purpose of such expressions was to demonstrate the extent of the wickedness of the deniers and opponents. The tyranny of the aggressors hath reached such a pitch that all have seen and heard of it. In any case, I swear by the Sun of Truth which shineth from the horizon of the heaven of the Most Great Prison that the intention of the Ancient Beauty hath never been, and is not, contention and conflict, nor that which causeth hearts to be troubled. Refer ye to the Tablets wherein He saith: "Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship." The purpose of this Revelation is that the fire of hatred which blazeth in the hearts and souls of the followers of divers faiths should be quenched through the Kawthar of divine utterance and heavenly counsel, and be stilled and extinguished. In this year, which is one thousand three hundred and six, a Tablet was revealed in the handwriting of the Wronged One wherein this exalted word shone forth from the horizon of the Most Exalted Pen: "O people! Make mention of the servants with good, and speak not of them with evil, nor with that which would grieve their souls." Even the mention of evil hath been forbidden in this year, for the tongue was created to make mention of God. It would be a pity to defile it with backbiting or to utter words that cause grief and distress to the servants. We have permitted association with all peoples, except such souls from whom ye perceive the odor of enmity in the Cause of God, the Lord of all mankind. From such souls ye must needs keep aloof, as a command from God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. O people of God! Let your drink be the Kawthar of love, your occupation that which manifesteth unity, and your deeds that which guideth mankind to the path of God, the Mighty, the Powerful.

O Zaynu'l-'Abidin! Upon thee be My glory! Time and again hath thy mention flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, and repeatedly hast thou attained His presence. Know thou the value of this station. Praise be to God that thou art occupied with His mention and praise, and dwellest in His vicinity. The remembrance of these days hath been and will ever be beloved. God willing, it shall never pass from sight. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having given me to drink the Kawthar of Thy utterance from the hand of Thy bounty, and for having caused me to hear the scratching of Thy Pen and to behold the horizon of Thy Revelation. I beseech Thee by Thy power which hath encompassed all created things to make me in all conditions one who remembereth Thy name and uttereth Thy praise. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful. O my Lord! Forgive me and those who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the All-Generous.

O Mahdi! I pray that ye may ever be occupied with the remembrance of God and His service. Few are my questions, and I beseech from the King of His power - even as one of His servants who is connected with the people of the Son beseeched Him - that He may make us steadfast in the face of oppressive onslaughts, for verily He is the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful, and that He may protect us in the fortress of His favors, bounties and generosity, and so forth. Thy Lord hath answered all of this before thy supplication, inasmuch as He hath aided thee to serve His Cause, to promulgate His Faith, to mention His Name amongst His servants, and hath preserved thee from the insinuations of the sinful and the doubts of the deniers, and made thee steadfast in times of trials and tests. For such a Lord praise, glorification and thanksgiving are befitting. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Peerless.

That which ye wrote concerning the sending of copies of Tablets hath been most acceptable. In truth, the Words of the All-Merciful are like the breezes of the springtime of divine favors for all creation - the more they blow and pass by, the sweeter and more excellent they become. This is of God's grace unto them. Previously certain Tablets were revealed unto you wherein were recorded from the Pen of the Most High explanations of the revelation of certain Quranic verses and some stories of earlier times. Those Tablets, nay rather all that hath been sent unto you, should be dispatched to all lands, for they shall prove most beneficial. Some of the servants are unaware of what hath come to pass and are heedless of what shall come to pass, therefore such Tablets shall be profitable. Those to whom copies are sent should make copies themselves and send them abroad. Although this wondrous Cause is one that hath had and shall have no likeness before or after it, blessed is he who beholdeth it with his own eyes, detached from all that he hath heard aforetime.

In any case, the service to the Cause rendered by your honor is befitting and meet. All that ye have undertaken hath been and is acceptable. Concerning the letter to the Land of Kh, they had written: "By My life! We love to hear their call at all times. We have not forgotten them, rather We remember them as is meet and befitting. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful." God willing, after the way is assuredly opened, We shall send unto them that which will cause their spirits to soar and their eyes to be gladdened.

As for what ye wrote concerning Fars, his book was presented at the Most Great Scene, and an answer was revealed and sent. However, they must proceed with the utmost wisdom. They must never speak openly of the Sender or that which is sent. Most people are immature and as infants. When a child is born of its mother, it must be given milk, not meat and heavy foods, so that step by step it may be educated and reach a station wherein it can partake of diverse fruits and manifold bounties. Ye must greatly emphasize concealment of the Cause, wisdom, and forbearance with people. Although the command to teach hath been revealed in the Tablet, yet this is not intended for these days. They must act according to the capacity of the people. The more matters remain concealed in these days, the better it is. Previously a Tablet was specifically revealed for them, but it was not sent.

We beseech God that they may remain firm and steadfast. The ultimate bounty concerning him is that his mention hath been recorded by the Eternal Pen in the Divine Tablet. Blessed is he, and again blessed is he. If at any time he should desire to turn towards this land, ye must surely forbid it. The explicit command is that no one should turn towards this direction except by permission of his Lord.

Convey greetings from the True One to N.S. Say: God hath seized him who cast thee into the well. Verily He is the Deliverer of the loved ones and the Destroyer of the idolaters. Likewise, convey the honor of greetings to Khalil of the land of S, to Darvish, and to other loved ones of God, and especially to Aqa Muhammad-Rida who is consumed in the fire of separation, and to his family convey countless greetings. The Glory be upon thee and upon those with thee and thy family.

The Divine Call was raised from the Blessed Tree of Oneness in the Holy Vale, calling all and giving them the glad tidings of the manifestation of transcendent glory, even as the son of Zacharias gave the glad tidings of the appearance of the Spirit to all. Blessed is the state of those souls who hearkened to the Word of God and attained His recognition, while those who failed to hear the Primal Word are accounted among the dead and shall abide forever in the fire. This is that Manifestation which in the Book of God was not made contingent upon any matter, nor dependent on anyone's acceptance. The deeds of the doers, the acceptance of those who accept, and the sincerity of the sincere - all are contingent upon His permission and dependent on the will of that True Goal. Nevertheless, some among the people of the Bayan, following Satan, have been debarred from the path of the All-Merciful, although the previous Manifestation gave tidings, saying that the purpose of the Bayan and all that was revealed therein returns in its primal reality to the subsequent Manifestation, and whatever good mention was made in the Bayan He made it return to and reserved it for that Dawning-Place of Divine revelation and Treasury of heavenly knowledge. O people of the Bayan! On that Day which is the King of Days, God forbid that you should cling to your divines and leaders and thus remain deprived of the Goal. And further He says: Despite all these firm and established counsels and revealed verses, it is seen that at the time of the Manifestation you will commit that which no people before have committed. God, the Most High, the Most Great, speaks truth. For it was witnessed that some clung to one like themselves and thus remained deprived of the Truth. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of inner meanings that if today all who are on earth were to claim leadership or more, and were to perform all good deeds, yet hesitate in this Cause, they would never be accepted. For all deeds and stations are verified through recognition of the subsequent Manifestation - whoever remains veiled from Him, no deed will ever profit him. In all times take refuge in the All-Merciful, that you may remain protected from the evil of Satan. Soon will His signs be spread in that land. Leave them behind you with manifest steadfastness. God willing, all the loved ones should gather together in perfect love and unity at the fountain of the Divine Cause, and conduct themselves among the servants in such wise that all may discover from them the fragrances of the love of the All-Merciful. Today is the day of assistance, and assistance has never been and is not by the sword, for in this most great Manifestation all have been forbidden from corruption, contention and warfare. In truth, the purpose of holy war in every age has been to guide people to the direction of Divine Unity, even if by force. But in this case it cannot be known who has become intoxicated with the Kawthar of merciful grace and turned toward the divine direction, and who has entered beneath the Tree of grace in chains of force. Moreover, the sword of deeds has been and will be sharper than the outward sword. For if the loved ones of God in this merciful Manifestation had conducted themselves among creation according to His characteristics, assuredly by now all would have turned toward the straight path of glory. What was destined has come to pass. God willing, henceforth all must act according to goodly deeds, excellent actions and praiseworthy character, so that people may discover the Source through the manners and conduct of these souls. The cause of most people's perplexity and hesitation has been the deeds of some. Furthermore, whatever the divine loved ones do today is attributed to the Source of the Cause. People's vision is not pure, so they cannot perceive the reality of the Cause or discover the Greatest Scene. We beseech God to assist you in His love and good-pleasure, to detach you from those who have disbelieved in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and to send down upon you that which is best for you. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Forgiving.

He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the Ever-Abiding, the Gracious

This is the Book of God, the Most Exalted, the Powerful, the Gracious, unto God, the Mighty, the Sovereign, the Inaccessible, the All-Protecting. Herein is mentioned what hath come upon Us from the people of the Bayan, that it may serve as a remembrance unto those who exist today and as guidance and mercy unto another people, and that My tribulations may be recalled before God on the Day whereon the creatures of the first and the last shall be gathered together.

O people of the Bayan! Did not God announce unto you in the Book this Revelation in a language of manifest truth, in that which was revealed unto the Great One when he inquired about God's Hidden Name, and He answered him in truth saying: "Verily, he is the son of 'Ali, an Imam of indubitable truth." And this was the last that was revealed concerning this irrevocable, mighty, transcendent and powerful Cause. The Tablets of God were filled with mention of this Youth, if ye be of them that bear witness. Moreover, this is the proof whereby the Revealer of the Bayan and all that appeared from Him were established, as ye yourselves and all who dwell in the heavens and on earth do testify.

Despite this, how is it that ye have turned away from these verses that have filled the East and West of the earth, if ye be of them that comprehend? Say: O people, if ye believe not in these verses, then by what proof did ye believe in God aforetime? Bring it forth and be not of the patient ones. Say: O people, am I not the son of 'Ali in truth? Was I not named Husayn in God's almighty, mighty and gracious dominion? Have I not recited unto you each day verses that have left hearts unable to reckon their number, nay, even the minds of them that are nigh unto God?

Yet ye, O people of the Bayan, have denied Me, calumniated Me, and rejected Me without any clear proof or illuminating Book. And whenever We increased the evidence, ye increased in your rejection, to such extent that ye kindled the fire of hatred in your breasts, O people of malice! Do ye wish to obstruct this Breeze from blowing, or to prevent the Spirit from ascending unto God, the Sovereign King, the Mighty, the Ancient? Nay, by my Lord, ye shall never be able to do so, even as the peoples before you were unable, O heedless ones!

Say: By God, besides Whom there is none other God, no one's faith shall be complete this Day except by acknowledging this Cause. This is God's punishment upon the idolaters and God's mercy upon them that believe in His unity. O people of the Bayan! Do ye believe in part of the Book while denying God's Book, the Revealed, the Gracious, the Trustworthy?

O people! Fear God and follow not your desires. Follow the fear of God and flee not from this Great Announcement. Will flight profit you? Nay, by the Lord of the worlds! Will turning away avail you? Nay, by the glory of God, the Great King! And if ye have forgotten what the peoples of old did, the people of the Furqan are not far from you. Remember when the Most High came unto them with manifest authority, bearing a conclusive proof from His Lord, the Bestower, the Honored, the Gracious. He sent unto the leaders of the people the angels of the Cause with an illuminating Book. They entered their presence with a mighty and glorious Tablet. Among them were those who turned away and took not the Tablet, and those who took it and looked upon it as one in a swoon, saying "These are but tales of the ancients." And among them were those who took the Tablet with one hand and gave it less attention than can be reckoned, then cast it upon the ground, being among those who showed arrogance toward God Who created and fashioned them. Thus do We recount unto you the tale of the perplexed ones.

O people of the Bayan! Strive within yourselves not to act as these idolaters acted. When the Youth of the Spirit entereth upon you with God's Book, arise instantly from your seats, then take the holy Book in your hands, then kiss it, then honor the Youth with gracious respect. By God, this shall profit your souls more than all that ye are engaged in. And if ye transgress, verily God is independent of what is past and what is to come and what appeareth in these few days.

The Spirit, the glorification, and the splendor be upon you, O people of the Bayan, if ye follow that which the Dove hath warbled in this eventide.

He is the One speaking from His most exalted horizon! O Abu'l-Fadl! He speaks through this Most Exalted Blessed Word which has dawned from the heaven of the Supreme Pen - fix your gaze upon it: "Whoso is for God, God is for him." In these days this utterance has repeatedly flowed from the Tongue of the One Mentioned. The tree of this word was planted aforetime, and in these days it has sprouted and borne fruit. O Abu'l-Fadl! In one of the Tablets this passage was revealed: "If the entire spiritual realm were to be transformed into the power of hearing, one could say it would be worthy of hearkening to this utterance which has flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful. Otherwise, the visible ears were not and will not be capable of hearing this call, save a limited few." Praise be to God, you have hearkened and attained to that which was the cause and purpose of creation. Blessed are you and joy be unto you! The All-Knowing God accompanies you in travel and at home. The tribulations that have descended, the difficulties that have arisen, the straits and trials and grief and afflictions - all are witnessed and recorded by the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Book. This passage transforms the world's tribulations into mercy, and diseases into health. Whatever has befallen you has been for God and in the path of God - the Supreme Pen bears witness. Fire in His path is light, and poison is sweet honey. I swear by the Sun of Revelation which has shone forth from the highest horizon of the world - if the people of earth were to attain to a drop from the chalice of inner meanings, or a drop from the ocean of utterance, all would turn from what they possess to what is with God, and would occupy themselves with circumambulating around the chosen ones of God. The veils of the wicked have prevented eyes from beholding the Most Exalted Horizon, and likewise ears from hearing the Most Exalted Word. His Honor the Name of Bounty, upon him be My glory, forwarded your letter to the Most Holy Court, and this response has descended from the heaven of the Will of the Beloved of the worlds. It gives life to the spirit and bestows true wings, that you may teach the servants to soar and guide them to the true Ka'bah of God. O Fadl! The wings have become soiled with the clay of vain imaginings - ask God to cleanse them with the water of return. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing. Teach the servants to read what has been revealed from My Most Exalted Pen. My God, My God! I beseech Thee by the penetrating power of Thy Most Exalted Word and the might of Thy Most High Pen to assist Thy servants to turn to Thee and gaze toward Thy horizon. O my Lord! Deprive them not of the outpourings of the heaven of Thy Will and the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty. Thou art verily the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Conquering, the All-Powerful. As to the matter mentioned, whatsoever conduces to the benefit of the world is acceptable and beloved before God, and whatsoever is otherwise is rejected. For this Most Great Revelation has been dedicated to the salvation and reformation and unity and harmony and tranquility of the peoples of the world. To this bear witness the dwellers of Paradise and the companions of the holy precincts, and beyond them I am the All-Knowing Witness. According to the command, the servant present has written to His Honor Varqa, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, that which wisdom requires. We beseech God to show a way and guide to it, that the purpose may be achieved without harm. Praise be to God, His Honor Sin has from the beginning stood ready to assist. Now too We beseech God to confirm him in that which befits His Day. He has shown friendship and love from before. In all matters one must consult while considering the outcome. Take what is good and what benefits the world - this is My bidding before and after. To this testifies every truthful and trustworthy one, and every knowing and informed one. Whosoever proves to be a well-wisher of this party, We have wished and wish for his good, and this will certainly be manifested and answered. Blessed are they that understand, and blessed are they that act. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those who have turned and believed in God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed

O thou who gazest upon His countenance! In thy letter mention was made of the Chief Secretary. After perusal, We desired to make mention of him, inasmuch as in the Most Holy Book this blessed verse hath been revealed: "Consort with the followers of all religions with joy and fragrance." Therefore, whosoever maketh mention of this Wronged One, whether in truth or otherwise, the Supreme Pen hath revealed the utmost favor concerning him. This Wronged One hath ever sought justice and fairness from the servants of God, but vain imaginings have become a veil, and have prevented most from witnessing and hearkening. All know that from the earliest days until now, this servant hath been in the hands of his enemies, and despite the afflictions that befell him, and imprisonment in the land of ?a and the land of Mim, and captivity and exile, the Pen hath not ceased for a moment, until in every place the Word was raised and the light of the Cause shone forth. Those souls who have arisen in opposition today were each in hiding and occupied with preserving their own lives. In any case, praise be to God, the Cause hath been exalted. Now whoever wishes may come forth to the field and say what he desires. Glory be to God! These mentioned souls were not with Us and were unaware of the root of the Cause, and now some have clung to calumnies that have no likeness or reality. But beautiful is patience, and God is the Helper against what they describe. I do not complain of My grief and sorrow for all that hath come to pass and will come to pass in the path of God, for it is beloved. I do not fear the afflictions in His path, nor the calamities in His Cause. To this testifieth every fair-minded one who is informed, and every knower who is endowed with vision.

If deemed advisable, convey the greetings and praise of this Wronged One to the Secretary. We ask of him, purely for the sake of God, to make an effort and turn his attention to these regions for some days. There have been and are many benefits in travel. The purpose is that he might honor Cyprus with his presence for some days near my brother, but he must see with his own eyes and hear with his own ears. It will become clear and evident to him with whom the Cause was in the beginning, and from whom the revealed verses came. If governmental affairs prevent him, let him send a representative, but not like Shaykh Muhammad. Let him appoint a person of insight and fairness, possessed of justice and hearing, to turn towards that direction, that perchance after observation he might speak with justice and fairness. In these days the honored Mirza Abu'l-Qasim Nasir arrived in the great city from 'Ishqabad and met with Shaykh Muhammad several times. God is Most Great! All his statements were lies and calumnies. Afterwards, the honored Nasir wrote a response to his calumnies and sent it. We asked for a copy to be brought to send to thee, that thou might observe to what degree the calumnies have ascended.

O ?a! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. Say: My God, my God! Adorn the heads of Thy servants with the crown of truthfulness and detachment, and their temples with the ornament of godliness. Then aid them to return unto Thee and to enter beneath the gate of Thy grace. Verily, Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Generous, verily Thou art the Forgiver, the Merciful. I beseech Thee, O my God, my Lord and my King, by the rain of Thy mercy wherewith Thou hast adorned Thine earth, and by the waves of the ocean of Thy knowledge whereby Thou hast manifested Thy favor and bounty, to confirm them in trustworthiness and godliness, lest they exchange their religion for gold and their destiny for wealth. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. O Lord! Send forth, through Thy power and sovereignty, servants who will aid Thee through wisdom and utterance, and who will spread Thy signs among the religions. Thou seest, O my God, what hath befallen Thy loved ones at the hands of Thine enemies who have been consumed by the fire of greed and passion, and who have wrongfully devoured the wealth of Thy servants. O Lord of all being, Master of the throne on high and of earth below! O Lord, stay the hands of evil from those who have turned to Thee and entered beneath the shadow of Thy mercy. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.

If deemed advisable, let him read it to the Secretary, and let the letter remain with thee.

O Samandar, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the One Who speaks in the Kingdom of Utterance. O Samandar, the grace, mercy and loving-kindness of God have encompassed and continue to encompass your circumstances. That which had no likeness has been revealed, and that which could not possibly have any semblance has become manifest. Yet the people of vain imaginings cling to their imaginings, and those of idle fancies to their fancies. We are God's and unto Him do we return. Those souls who are heedless and unaware of the Cause have uttered that which has grieved the denizens of the most great paradise and caused the Supreme Paradise to lament. Ask of God for justice and fairness, that perchance His servants may find and attain their goal.

The letter of His Honor Khalil, upon him be the Glory of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful, attained the presence. The fragrance of divine love wafted from it and the light of love shone forth. Verily he attained the presence of Him Who conversed with the Sinai and heard and saw what was recorded by the Supreme Pen in God's Books, the Lord of all beings. That letter mentioned those who have turned to God, therefore what speaks with the most eloquent utterance in creation and calls all to the horizon of the All-Merciful was sent specifically to each one. Blessed is he and those with him. The Glory be from Us upon you and upon him and upon his family and upon those whom God has related to him. We make mention of them and give them glad tidings of God's loving-kindness, mercy, grace and favors. He is truly the All-Bountiful, the Generous.

At the end of this epistle We make mention of him who is named Yahya and remember him with My verses and give him glad tidings of My mercy which has preceded existence. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist him, make him successful, and aid him with the hosts of the unseen and the visible. He is powerful over all things. The Glory be upon him and upon every steadfast, upright one.

In these days Abdul-Husayn, upon him be My Glory, is present before the Face in the Most Great Prison. We beseech God that he and all souls who have appeared from that household may attain the most great honor and supreme loving-kindness. That household is truly related to the Truth - they must hold fast to that which causes the exaltation of God's Word and is the cause of manifestation and the stations of existence. Samandar and Shaykh, upon them both be My Glory and loving-kindness, should, in view of their station as fathers, pray for all. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer.

The letters of His Honor Amin, upon him be My Glory, have arrived continuously and continue to arrive, and he has repeatedly mentioned the friends of that land, both men and women, upon them be the Glory of God and the Glory of those who are in the heavens and earths. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

O Samandar, upon you be My Glory and loving-kindness. Convey My greetings to all the members of your household, young and old, and give them glad tidings from the Wronged One. We beseech God to adorn each one with the ornament of supreme loving-kindness and to embellish them with the crown of steadfastness.

O My leaves and My handmaidens! Tonight, which is the twenty-first night of the blessed month of Ramadan, this Wronged One is occupied with your mention in the Most Great Prison. This most great bounty has appeared from the Mighty Announcement at this hour, and the lights of the Sun of loving-kindness are shining from the horizon of the heaven of bounty. Know the value of this station and be engaged in the mention of the Goal of the worlds with the utmost joy and delight.

May His Honor Khalil, upon him be My Glory, the Beautiful, the Sublime, and likewise His Honor Karim, upon him be My Glory, illumine their families with the lights of the utterance of the All-Merciful, that they may attain supreme joy and greatest delight in the divine days. We have likewise mentioned the other handmaidens of that land in the Book of Amin. Blessed are they who have attained.

We make mention in this station of him who is named Andalib, who warbled in the gardens of wisdom and utterance, and We give him glad tidings of My loving-kindness and mercy. We have mentioned him in various Tablets. We beseech God to assist him and aid him to serve His firm and mighty Cause. He has always been and continues to be remembered. His poetry and prose in mention of God, exalted be His glory, are blessed traces in the book of the world. Verily his Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Forgiving, the Merciful, and He is the Generous, the Bountiful. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

He is God, the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. Praise be to God Who hath sent down His grace and revealed unto creation that which lay hidden in His revealed Books, wherein He gave glad tidings to His servants of the Most Great Name, through which the world was illumined and the foundations of the nations were shaken. Blessed is he who hath heard the Call and responded to his Lord. He is among those who have soared in the atmosphere of nearness and reunion, and have drunk the choice wine of meeting from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. By God's life! He is verily the whale in the sea of utterance, the singing Tree in the midst of Paradise, the Sun shining from the horizon of exposition, the brilliant Star in the heaven of mystical knowledge, and the Moon rising from the dawning-place of certitude. God knoweth that he is the light in the lamp of the world, and that he is the one who hath turned toward the Supreme Horizon after most of the nations turned away from it. If this evanescent servant desired to describe even one of the lovers who have detached themselves and been attracted by the Call of God - by God, the pens would be consumed, then the pages, before completing the descriptions recorded in the preserved and guarded scrolls. To this beareth witness what the Nightingale of Utterance spoke before in His words that the believer cannot be described.

O beloved of My heart! Give thanks unto God for having aided thee to turn unto Him and honored thee with attaining His presence when the Intended One was shining from the horizon of glory. I bear witness that thou didst turn, didst hear, didst advance, and didst respond to thy Lord. Blessed art thou for having remained firm when the lands were shaken, and for having turned toward Him when most of the servants turned away. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid thee in all conditions and assist thee in what is best for thee in the beginning and the end.

And furthermore, this evanescent one hath attained unto the letter which your honor sent in the name of his honor Jud. In truth it was a testimony speaking of your love for the Beloved of the worlds, and a manifest witness to your turning toward and steadfastness in the Cause of God, exalted be His glory. Praise be to God that your honor hath been among those who have attained unto the choice wine of meeting, the Kawthar of steadfastness, and the Salsabil of contentment. This servant giveth thee the glad tidings that he heard a hundredfold special mention of your honor from the tongue of Grandeur, mention that shall endure as long as the divine names and attributes endure. How excellent for your honor and how pleasing for your presence! Regarding what you wrote about lack of success, this servant testifieth by God's testimony that your honor is successful, and if outward circumstances have again prevented your presence, you should not be saddened by this, for praise be to God, you have drunk from the ocean of meeting, entered the Most Great Scene, and heard the divine utterances with your own ear. And now you are commanded to wisdom, for after the martyrdom of his honor Badi, all the servants have been commanded to wisdom, and you must indeed hold fast to wisdom in all matters and keep your gaze upon it. This is a decree that hath been sent down from the heaven of the divine will in most of the divine Tablets. In this case, if the requirements of wisdom do not accord with your turning again, you should not be saddened, for this too is obedience to God's command. To this the Pen of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, beareth witness. Those who circle round the divine throne offer most wondrous salutations to your honor, and likewise this evanescent servant conveyeth greetings to his honor Aqa Muhammad. I praise the Beloved of the worlds for having aided him to love Him and blessed him with recognition of His Beauty in His days. This is the enduring wine that hath been and shall be more precious than the rarest ruby and sweeter than all honey and sugar. How pleasing for him! And glory be upon your honor and upon him and upon those who have attained unto the Most Great News. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is the Ever-Abiding, the Eternal, the All-Wise Teacher

To his honor Shaykh 'Ali-Mirza, upon him be the Glory of God

Praise be to God Who hath manifested Himself through His Name, the Letter B, upon the sea of H, whereupon light appeared and spread across the face of the water. Verily He is the Point that cannot be described by the descriptions of the people of creation. Then that holy, primal, eternal Point manifested itself upon the Tablet. Then another point appeared, and verily it was the Primal Will, through which God created all that was and will be, and all that appeared before and will appear unto the end that hath no end. And verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. His mysteries cannot be known, His signs cannot be comprehended, and His evidences cannot be described. He hath created the Supreme Pen and caused it to speak between earth and heaven. Blessed is he who is attracted by His most sweet call and hath turned toward the Lord of Names. Verily He is the Most Great Remembrance and the Ancient Sign, speaking from this most exalted and resplendent station, and this most luminous and most glorious spot, that there is no God but Him, the Powerful, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Great.

O 'Ali! We were in the bath when the servant arrived with thy letter and read it at the door. We found from it the fragrance of thy love, thy sincerity, thy submissiveness and thy humility before God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed art thou in having attained the presence of God when He was in the land of K. By the life of God, this is indeed a manifest bounty. Thou wert present, heard, saw and drank the sealed wine from the hands of thy Lord's bounty, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Ask God to grant thee success and aid thee to serve this Wronged One, even as He aided thee before. Verily He is the Powerful, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Beloved.

When the Wronged One was in the bath, the servant arrived at the door with thy letter and presented all before His presence. O 'Ali! The gaze of favor hath been directed toward thee. Were it not for Him, that which appeared from thee would not have appeared. And regarding what thou didst write about the weakness of the servants and the heedlessness of the negligent souls toward the exalted Truth - the truth is with thee. Yea, the face of the world is turned toward irreligion. In all years, nay in all months, nay in all days, it is far from faith, knowledge and certitude, clinging to doubts and vain imaginings. And for a time it shall continue thus, even as its duration hath been revealed and recorded in God's Book. But be not grieved, for the effulgences of the Sun of Truth shall absorb the excessive moisture of nature and shall gather together the scattered letters. This matter is not particular to this age, but hath been thus from before, as a drop from the drops concealed in the ocean of divine knowledge hath been revealed in the holy Tablet of Wisdom. Blessed is he who hath beheld and read and said: "Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art the Explainer to the worlds!" After the passing of the duration mentioned in the Book, suddenly shall the Cause of God be raised up and all souls shall turn toward it. Verily thy Lord is the True Informer, the Speaking One, the Truthful, the Trustworthy. Thou must at all times be occupied with serving the Cause and summon the loved ones to the most great steadfastness, for barking and howling have been and are being raised from every quarter, as We informed thee when We were dawning from the horizon of Iraq and established upon the throne in the Land of Mystery and in this noble spot. In these days the Ancient Beauty hath gone forth from the Most Great Prison, and the place of His manifestation was first in the garden and then in the palace known in this land. And while walking, again the servant presented himself before His presence with pen and ink and made mention of thee. Therefore the Kingdom of Utterance spoke forth with these wondrous and sublime words: The Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee among them who have believed and turned their shining faces toward the Most Exalted Horizon, this station that is mighty, holy, powerful and wondrous.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great!

Praise be to God Who hath guided all to His path, taught all His knowledge, and honored all through His grace and favors. He it is Who hath revealed from the drop the ocean of creation, and through Him the world was illumined and the nations were set ablaze, until even the pebble testified and the seed spoke forth, and the story of the Mount was renewed in the Sinai of Manifestation. Exalted, exalted is He above the inability of every eloquent one to praise Him and every articulate one to describe Him. He is the Single, the One, the Sanctified, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Glory be to Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the reins of existence! I beseech Thee by the light of Thy countenance and the splendor of Thy face to assist Thy servants to remain steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that the oppression of those who have denied Thy signs may not grieve them. O my Lord! Purify the earth from the defilement of these ones and sanctify it from those who have turned away from Thee and have risen to destroy Thy House which was built by the hands of Thy power. O my Lord! Ordain for me and my brothers that which will benefit us in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

And then, your letter was received in His presence - truly sorrows have fled from the field. I beseech the Exalted One to grant you the best of what He possesses and to assist you in serving Him in every world of His worlds.

To the honored Mr. Afnan, upon him be the peace of God and His favors, I convey my greetings. God willing, may they be assisted in all conditions and drink from the cup of joy at all times in such wise that the troubles of these days may not affect them nor deprive them of spirit and fragrance. O my brother, O my beloved! The ancient glory hath been ordained for them. Happy are they and blessed are they.

The delay of His Holiness Afnan, Aqa Aqa Siyyid M, upon him be all glory, and their tardiness has caused sorrow to the Leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree, upon them be the glory of God. God willing, this too shall pass according to His good-pleasure, just as this great journey was completed with perfect ease and comfort, and they attained to that which had no equal. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to grant His confirmation. He is powerful over all things.

And regarding what you wrote about His Holiness Afnan, Aqa Siyyid 'Ali, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, who showed kindness - God is my witness that they have always been and continue to be before my eyes. I beseech the True One, exalted and glorified be He, to shelter all beneath the shade of the Divine Lote-Tree and grant them anew the fountain of meeting. The wretchedness of the servants has become a barrier. Once this blessed word was revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance: "Were it not for the heedlessness of the heedless ones and the oppression of the oppressors, We would not have given the Afnan permission to return, and would have assigned them a station in this very land." Nevertheless, whatever has happened and continues to happen has been and is according to the requirements of divine wisdom.

To the spiritual beloved, Aqa Ahmad, upon him be the glory of God, I send greetings. God willing, may he be confirmed and assisted, and likewise to all other friends in that land, upon them be the glory of God. Regarding what you wrote about the beloved Habib, truly whatever that Beloved One hath said is correct and complete. This matter has been greatly prolonged. Your word was timely. God willing, may we attain to what He desires. Verily, what is beloved is what He desires for us, as evidenced by what we have and what is with us.

Regarding the beloved's journey, permission has been granted that they may proceed whenever they wish. This is glad tidings from this servant to you. And God speaks the truth and guides to the path. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beautiful. God willing, after completing the work with the beloved, they will proceed, and regarding what was written about Aqa Mirza Muhammad and the sum that was given, these matters are in your hands - act as you deem appropriate. Peace be upon you and upon God's righteous servants, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and Power

Praise be to God! Through His loving-kindness the gates of mercy, bounty and protection are opened wide. His loved ones speak forth the blessed word of unity "There is no God but Him" and acknowledge His oneness and singleness. I beseech Him, exalted be His glory, to illumine His servants, meaning all who dwell on earth, with the lights of the Day-Star of unity, that every tongue may confess what He hath revealed in His perspicuous Book. And blessings and peace be upon Him through Whom were manifested the mysteries of His most beautiful names and most exalted attributes, Whose shoulder was adorned with the seal of Prophethood and Messengership, and Whose temple was adorned with the ornament "but He is the Messenger of God and the Seal of the Prophets", and upon His family, the dawning-places of the hopes of the sincere ones, and upon His companions, the daysprings of His outpourings for all in the heavens and earth.

To continue: Repeatedly have letters from that honored brother arrived, each one a sign sent from the King of love. Every believer and sincere one can detect from the fragrance of each word the fragrance of your sincerity and humility. Well done to your hand and arm! Your poetry brings joy and your prose causes delight. The tongue seeks to become worthy of giving thanks for divine bounties. There is no bounty greater than His recognition - it gives eternal sustenance to the soul and bestows conquering power upon the temple. Through His grace, loving-kindness and generosity He has granted this most great bounty to His loved ones - a bounty which is in truth sanctified above the description of describers and the mention of those who make mention. It has now become clear and evident to every person of knowledge and understanding that the tongues of the world are incapable and fall short of giving thanks for even one of His bounties. In every breath a hundred thousand bounties exist - exalted be His greatness, magnificent His bounty, perfect His favors and gifts. There is no God but Him.

After the reading of each letter it was presented before His presence, and each time the Luminary of loving-kindness shone forth and the Sun of grace was manifest. You yourself have witnessed the waves of the ocean of utterance - there is no need for this servant to elaborate.

You yourself know what that pure water

Says to the flowers and saplings

You yourself know what the sun in Aries

Says to the flowers and thorns

Regarding what you wrote about the light of my eyes, dear Aqa Abdul-Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God (96), after it was presented He commanded that whatever the two Most Exalted Names deem advisable should be done. This is a word that has flowed from the Pen of love both before and after. Take it, relying upon God, and set aside all else. There has never been and is no doubt that whatever is advisable for His loved ones, that is what He has commanded.

Tonight, which is the eighteenth night of the month of Jamadi'ul-Avval, we were occupied with your remembrance. At the end of the day of this night, the poems you composed in praise of the Lord were honored to be heard. Praise be to God, both night and day were spent in remembrance of you. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to ever bestow His loving-kindness and grant unto you and His loved ones the fruits of the Tree of knowledge and wisdom at all times, and to provide sustenance. He is the Powerful and He is the Bestower. His is the generosity and bounty and grace which the nations are powerless to reckon.

The companions in prison send greetings, especially those who circle round. Furthermore, convey greetings and praise to the loved ones and friends in that land. God is witness and the lamp bears testimony that I have ever beseeched and do beseech for each one protection, health, mercy, loving-kindness, blessing and bounty. Verily He has power over all things and is worthy to answer prayers. Peace and praise and mercy and glory be upon you and those with you and upon God's sincere servants. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.

God is the Most Great, God is the One, God is the Self-Subsisting, acknowledging His Books and His Messengers and His chosen ones and His pure ones, and their loftiness and their transcendence and their might and their grandeur and their stations and their attributes before God, our Lord, the Lord of earth and heaven and Lord of the mighty Throne.

In truth, the food of the spirit is the remembrance and praise of God, exalted be His glory. If, God forbid, this most great bounty and supreme grace should be cut off, would life remain? Nay, by God! What of life - all would perish.

Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having caused us to acknowledge Thy unity and recognize Thy Books and Thy Messengers, and to stand before the gate of Thy grace, beseeching the wonders of Thy gifts and favors. O Lord! Withhold not from Thy servant and Thy loved ones the wonders of Thy grace, nor the rain from the heaven of Thy knowledge. We are poor and weak; we seek Thy conquering strength and Thy all-encompassing power. O Lord! Thou seest Thy loved ones in the lands of Iran among the enemies of Thy Cause. I beseech Thee to protect them through Thy sovereignty and the power of Thy Will. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Ruler, the Commander, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

The letter of that spiritual beloved arrived, praise be to God, adorned with Divine unity and mention of His Prophets and chosen ones who strove in His path with befitting striving and conquered the servants and lands through His Name. After its reading and review, proceeding to the Sacred Presence, after presentation They said: "God willing, may he be assisted in all conditions in that which causes the elevation of existence."

O Mahdi! Upon thee be the peace of God and His loving-kindness. Thy letter was honored to be heard, from which the fragrance of love was diffused. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to open before thy face the gates of gifts and favors, to give thee to drink at all times from the Kawthar of divine knowledge, and to adorn thee with that which will elevate thy station among His servants. Verily, He is the Master of creation and the Ruler in the beginning and in the return.

We make mention of and send greetings to him whose heart was illumined by the lights of the knowledge of God, the Lord of the worlds, and whose countenance was brightened by the radiance of His face - he who was named Muhammad-i-Rida in the Book of Names - and to God's loved ones there who were not prevented by anything from His remembrance and praise. We beseech God on their behalf for that which befits His generosity and bounty. Verily, He is the Single, the One, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

Praise be to God, thou art mentioned in the Holy Presence and art the recipient of favor. The kindred are, praise be to God, adorned with the ornament of health. I beseech the True One to assist that spiritual beloved in that which will cause his remembrance to endure and persist. Verily our Lord is the Answerer of His servants' prayers and fulfills them through His grace and sovereignty. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Generous.

I convey remembrance, greetings and praise to the beloved of the heart, his honor Haji - upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness. He has ever been and continues to be mentioned. His honor, the apple of the eye, Aqa Mirza Mustafa - upon him be the Glory of God - is today present and successful in his stead, and adorned with the glory of acceptance. Likewise, I convey greetings to the other loved ones of that land. God is witness and testament that this evanescent servant, in times of attendance, both outwardly and inwardly makes mention of them and seeks true success for all. In all conditions I have been and am turned toward Him and beseeching at the gate of His generosity. Verily, He is the Munificent, the All-Bountiful, and He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.

The Star bulbs all arrived. Certainly, if the apple soldiers from right and left like marshalled hosts and ordered ranks - your reward is with God, the Lord of grace and bestowal, and the Master of remembrance and praise. There is no God but He, the Most High, the Most Exalted. It is hoped that at some time you will see them when their flowers appear. Verily, He is the Helper, the Powerful, the All-Wise. Peace and mercy and glory be upon thee and upon God's righteous servants.

O Most Holy, Most Impregnable, Most Exalted One! Make mention of him who turned towards Thee until he entered the Spot wherein shone forth the Sun of the Beauty of Thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised, that the rapture of the verses might seize him in such wise as to make him steadfast in the Cause of God and in His love. This, verily, is a glorious station. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou hast hastened to the Goal and attained the presence of His Countenance and hearkened unto that which the Tongue of Grandeur and Glory hath spoken. This, verily, is a great triumph.

Give thanks unto thy Lord for this bounty. Say: O my God and the God of all who are in the heavens and on earth, my Beloved and the Beloved of the worlds! I testify that through Thee the fragrance of the Robe hath wafted over all regions and the faces of the righteous have been illumined, and through Thee the banners of sanctity have been raised throughout the lands and the standard of detachment hath been planted upon the highest mountains. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue all created things and caused all beings to speak forth Thy remembrance, O Thou Who sendest down the verses and Who art the Originator of earth and heaven, to make me wholly detached from all else save Thee and turning in all conditions towards the court of Thy bounty and the horizon of Thy favors. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.

O my Lord! Thou knowest that I have turned towards Thee and hastened to the place wherein He Who is the Manifestation of Thy Self, the Dawning-Place of Thy verses and the Dayspring of Thy evidences was imprisoned. Had it not been for Thy grace and bounty, how could I have attained unto this station from which Thy servants and creatures were debarred? Praise be to Thee, O my God, for that which Thou hast honored me through Thy generosity and bestowed upon me through Thy grace. I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Ultimate Hope of the sincere ones and the Beloved of the hearts of the lovers, to aid me in serving Thee and in promoting Thy Cause amongst Thy servants and creatures, and to make me one of those who have partaken of the wine of steadfastness and assurance and have attained unto that which Thou didst desire for them, O Thou Who art the Lord of Religions and the Creator of the worlds.

O Lord! Deprive me not of that which lieth with Thee, nor withhold from me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Make me one whose will is subordinate to Thy Will, whose movement is by Thy Command, whose flight is by Thy leave, whose repose is in Thy love, whose refuge is in Thy presence, and whose shelter is in Thy court, in such wise that I turn to none save Thee, speak naught except of Thy love, and set my face toward none but Thy face. Verily, Thou art He Who hath ever been supreme through Thy Will and shall ever be powerful through Thy Purpose. All things are captive in the grasp of Thy might, every wealthy one is poor before the ocean of Thy riches, and every mighty one is abased before the surging sea of Thy greatness.

I beseech Thee, O Thou Who controlleth the winds and Who causeth the dawn to break, to absolve me of whatsoever Thou lovest not, then preserve me beneath the shade of the Tree of Thy mercy and the Lote-Tree of Thy oneness. Verily, Thou art He in Whose grasp is the kingdom of all things and in Whose right hand are the reins of all names. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy sovereignty and ordainest what Thou pleasest through Thy power. Every possessor of might, O my God, confesseth his powerlessness before the manifestations of Thy might, and every possessor of wealth acknowledgeth his poverty before the evidences of Thy wealth.

I beseech Thee, O Lord of creation and Beloved of all who dwell in the realm of invention, to assist me in all conditions to turn towards the Kaaba of Thy Cause and to arise independently to manifest Thy love amongst Thy creatures. Then write down for me, through Thy grace, that which shall profit me in this world and in the world to come. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the All-Powerful.

O Ali! Recite what hath been sent down unto thee. Verily, it will strengthen thee in the Cause of thy Lord and protect thee from those who have disbelieved in God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. This is a gift which hath shone forth from the horizon of the bounty of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. When thou hast attained unto it and been nourished thereby, turn with thy heart toward the Qiblih of existence Who is imprisoned among the Jews, and say: Thine is the giving, O Bestower of gifts, and Thine is the bounty, O Lord of justice! I testify that Thou art the Source of all good things and the Dawning-Place of all blessings. Thou dost send down to whomsoever seeketh Thee that which is best for him, and ordain for whomsoever loveth Thee that which shall profit him in every world of Thy worlds.

O Lord! Drive not away him who hath drawn nigh unto the ocean of Thy favors, and deny not this poor one access to the shores of Thy bounties. The atoms testify that Thou art the Lord of names and attributes, and that Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the All-Bountiful.

Praise be unto the Lord of creation! O Jafar, may the effulgent rays of the Most Great Countenance illumine thee! The successive calls and repeated voices raised by thee have reached the ears of the Lord of all beings. He calleth thee with the most excellent and wondrous call. Today, praise be to God, through the bounty of the All-Merciful, the Living Waters are flowing, the Celestial Stream is coursing, and the Sealed Wine is unsealed. Be thou gladdened by the favors of God and freed and detached from the veils of creation. Think not that thou art forgotten from His sight. He is possessed of great faithfulness.

We beseech God to assist thee in all conditions and to ordain for thee the best of circumstances. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.

The Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - hath said that the purpose of all that is in the Bayan is that on that blessed Day the people may attain unto the good-pleasure of the Beloved and be engaged in His remembrance, even as He saith: "The word of good-pleasure from that Dawning-Place of Names is better than all that existeth and is visible." Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto this station, inasmuch as thou didst seek the Intended One and attain unto His presence, and the word of good-pleasure hath appeared from the Source of Revelation. What sorrow remaineth and what care?

The Trusted One, the Faithful, saith: "Be not sorrowful on Our account. Soar with the wings of joy and delight in the atmosphere of the Manifestation." Blessed art thou in that God hath enabled thee to achieve that which most of His servants have failed to attain. Be thou thankful unto Him and be of them that render thanks.

O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Hearken once again unto the call of thy Lord, the All-Glorious: "Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Gracious." Whensoever thou movest, He is with thee, and whensoever thou speakest, He heareth and seeth. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Grieve not over the world and its conditions. By My life! His love sufficeth thee, wert thou of them that know. He beareth witness for thee with such a testimony that wert thou to recognize it, thou wouldst cry out for joy. Thy Lord is verily the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth.

Remember when thou wert by the sea and didst drink what was ordained for thee by thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wise, and didst attain unto the presence of God and didst hear His most wondrous, most sweet, mighty and impregnable utterance. Can anything grieve thee after being under the glances of thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful? Rejoice thou in the Spirit of God and His grace, and be of them that are thankful. Recite thou the verses of God with the sweetest of melodies. Then wilt thou find thyself in manifest ecstasy and the breezes of revelation will seize thee in such wise that thou wilt regard all existence as kneaded clay.

O thou who rememberest Me! The Remembered One calleth thee and saith: "Thou art of them that have attained." Can the testimony of men equal His testimony? Nay, by My Self! But most men are heedless. All things have been awakened by the breezes of revelation, yet they remain asleep.

Glorify thy Lord and say: "O my God! I beseech Thee by the oppression of the Source of Justice whom Thou seest lonely amidst the hands of the oppressors among Thy creatures and the transgressors among Thy servants, to protect me from the allusions of them who have turned away from Thee and have denied Thy signs and have risen in tyranny in Thy days. Then make me of them whom neither cares have seized at the surging of the ocean of Thy joy nor sorrows at the manifestations of Thy gladness, that I may give unto the people the glad-tidings of Thy tidings, that every possessor of spirit may rejoice in Thy remembrance and praise. Thou art He in Whose grasp is the kingdom of names. Thou doest what Thou pleasest through Thy sovereignty that hath encompassed all who are in creation and through Thy power that hath prevailed over the worlds.

"O Lord! Make all my deeds as one deed and all my remembrances as one remembrance, that whatsoever appeareth from me may tell of Thy remembrance whereby the heavens and earth have been illumined. O Lord! Leave me not to myself. Make me moved by Thy will, breathing by Thy providence, willing by Thy command, and speaking by Thy leave. Thou art He Whose knowledge hath preceded all in creation and Whose mercy hath encompassed all in the worlds. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Gracious."

Regarding what was written about the land of Kha, it was submitted to the Most Holy Presence. This is what was revealed in reply:

O H! Praise be to God that through the grace of the All-Merciful thou hast been adorned with the ornament of recognition and hast quaffed from the choice wine of utterance in the days of God. On a day that was mentioned and recorded in all the divine Books, Tablets and Scriptures, thou didst attain unto His recognition, at a time when most of the divines, mystics and men of learning remained veiled from recognizing Him. Night and day they busied themselves with countless proofs and clear expressions to establish His truth, power and sovereignty, yet on the Day of His Manifestation they remained veiled from the very Object of their proofs. Not every soul is worthy of this living water. All the Afnan must at all times be mindful of and thankful to the All-Merciful Lord, for they have attained unto a great bounty. Although its true station is not evident now, God will assuredly make it manifest in truth - a promise from His presence. He is verily the Rememberer, the Informer, the All-Knowing. O My Afnan! Ask thy Lord, the All-Merciful, to aid all to turn towards Him and arise to serve Him. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Most Exalted. Thy efforts in the Cause of God have not been and will not be forgotten. Whatever thou hast done is acceptable. The Afnan who are here have mentioned and continue to mention thy services to God's Cause. He will assist thee in His service even as He assisted thee to believe in Him. By My life! Thou hast attained unto the Kawthar and Salsabil from God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Preserve what thou hast been given by God. Soon what We have concealed today will be revealed. He is verily the Powerful, the Mighty. Thou hast been and will continue to be watchful over God's Cause in all conditions. By the life of thy Beloved! That in which the servants glory and of which the people of the lands are proud shall perish, but that which is attributed to thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Wise, shall endure.

Regarding what was written about S, it was submitted. According to His command: Deal with him with patience. He rises at one time and falls at another. Thus doth the Lord of all being inform you from the precincts of His remote prison. But God may make him steadfast in His Straight Cause and guide him to the right path.

O My Name! Write to the Afnan that 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar hath ascended unto God and that he speaketh from the Supreme Horizon, saying: "Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds!" Blessed is the soul that remembereth him and remembereth what the All-Merciful hath revealed for him in a mighty Book. God willing, the Afnan of the Tree should attend to his affairs to the extent possible. This is Our command unto them. He is verily the Commander, the All-Wise.

As for what was written about Jenab-i-Amin and Jenab-i-Aqa Mirza Abu'l-Hasan - upon them be 96 \[Baha'u'llah\] - it was submitted. They stated that Abu'l-Hasan himself had also expressed this matter to the servant. In any case, permission for trade was given to them from before. Let them act in whatever way the Afnan deem advisable. According to His command, send one hundred tumans from the funds of the land of Kha to the land of Sad to Jenab-i-Aqa Mirza Isma'il, and write to them that this sum has been sent as a gift from one of the friends to serve the two honored descendants of the Twin Luminous Lights, and they have requested this servant to deliver it, hence it is being sent. The trouble of delivering it rests with your honor. And according to His command, fifty tumans from that sum should be delivered to the son of Jenab-i-Aqa Mirza Muhammad-'Ali-i-Qa'ini - upon him be 96 \[Baha'u'llah\] - and thirty tumans should be delivered to the mother of Jenab-i-Sulayman Khan in the land of Ta. A portion has also been designated for the poor of this land, as some are in utmost hardship. Therefore, whatever remains of that sum should be sent to the Land of Purpose.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most High

Praise befitteth my Beloved Who, through a single drop from the ocean of His knowledge, bestowed the garment of existence upon all creation. And this drop is none other than the Primal Word which, at the time when the Ancient Beauty was established upon the Most Great Throne, He uttered. It is the Sun of Truth through whose rays the realm of hearts and souls hath been illumined. It is the True Cup-bearer Who, from time immemorial and unto all eternity, hath bestowed and continues to bestow the choice wine of inner meanings upon the world of humanity. How blessed is the one whom earthly doubts have not held back from the divine horizon, and whom the murky troubles of the material realm have not deprived of the spirituality of the worlds of oneness. I beseech God, exalted and glorified be He, that He withhold not from the people of the earth the effulgences of the Sun of grace, and that He guide them all to the supreme horizon. Verily He is the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

And then, it is submitted that your letter, from which wafted the fragrance of love, was received. In truth it brought joy to the heart and gladness to the soul. God willing, may you ever abide beneath the shade of the bounty of the Self-Sufficing Lord, and with the utmost effort and endeavor be occupied in spreading His mention with perfect wisdom. As to your expression of inability to adequately praise and glorify God - this very admission of powerlessness is itself a perfect praise and an acceptable mention. Praise be to God that you have been confirmed in acceptance and certitude of a Cause at whose mere mention most of the earth's peoples have been thunderstruck. This is a blessing whose bounty none but God, exalted be His glory, hath reckoned or ever shall reckon. Were the pen to gallop in the arena of this theme, surely the clamor of all would be raised from every direction.

After your letter was read in the Most Holy Presence, that which was written was submitted. He spoke, and His word is the truth: "We beseech God to assist him, to strengthen him, and to grant him the good of this world and the next. Verily He is the Protector of the doers of good." That which at this point was manifested from the Dayspring of bounty - this servant is powerless to set it down.

Regarding what you had mentioned about Haji Abdullah, that you had appointed him as representative to submit a petition - this matter was presented. He said: "We have heard mention of him and recognized his turning to the Supreme Horizon. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Generous. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to him and say: Blessed art thou in that the breeze of grace hath wafted over thee in this wondrous Day. Place thy trust in God in all matters and say: O my God! Enable me to do what Thou lovest and approvest. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful."

From this servant also convey greetings to him. God willing, we hope that with perfect steadfastness he may drink of the choice wine of recognition at all times. And if you meet Haji Abdullah, convey greetings to him from this servant as well. He was mentioned in the Most Holy Presence. From what is understood, certain souls have caused him difficulty. In any case, he is commanded to wisdom - he must act with wisdom. Trust in any soul is not permitted. Since the decree of wisdom hath been revealed in the Tablets beyond counting, all must look to it. And God willing, we hope that the hardships they have borne in the path of God may lead them to its fruits.

Furthermore, you had mentioned Haji Muhammad Ali as well as Aqa Abdullah. All the names mentioned in your letter were presented in the Most Holy Presence. Convey greetings from this servant to all of them. And further, as per your deputization in the manner you had written, this servant attained the honor of visiting it, and whatever you had written was presented in the Most Holy Presence. He said: "God willing, they have been and shall be the recipients of divine bounties. Sufficient for him is what the Tongue of the Wronged One hath spoken in this exalted station."

He is the One Who rules over all who are on earth and in heaven. Praise and glory befit the Lord of the Kingdom of Names, Who, in the midst of the world's upheaval and the discord of nations, has raised aloft the banner of true unity with complete power and supreme might, and through the potency of His All-Powerful Name has adorned the arena of existence with the lights of His Revelation. He has caused the precincts of hearts and minds to attain supreme joy and greatest gladness through the utterance of Him Who conversed on Sinai. He is the One Incomparable Almighty and the All-Knowing Sage. There is none like unto Him, nor has He any peer or likeness in all creation. Exalted be His grandeur, magnificent His signs, great His Cause and His sovereignty.

O My Name! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. The letters which Asad - upon him be My glory - sent to thee, both earlier and later ones, have each attained the honor of being presented and heard, and have been adorned with the glory of acceptance. Each has testified to his devotion, his recognition and his steadfastness. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to give him to drink, from the hands of bounty, the wine of immortality, to make him a champion of His Cause among all peoples, and to ordain for him that which He has ordained for those who have attained His presence. Verily He is the Lord of the throne and earth, and the Ruler of earth and heaven.

O My Name! Upon thee and upon him be My glory and My mercy, and upon those with him who have acknowledged and recognized that which the Tongue of Grandeur has spoken, and who have acted according to that which they were commanded in His perspicuous Book.

O Asad! Blessed art thou for having attained unto verses that cannot be equaled by the treasures of kings and princes, and unto a mention that cannot be matched by any other mention. Rejoice thou in this supreme bounty, then praise thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Bountiful.

A Tablet was previously revealed specifically for Ahmad. We beseech God to assist him in that which He loves and is pleased with, and to enable him to behold the divine verses with his own eyes and hear them with his own ears. The Exalted Herald - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - has said: "Bear witness with the eye of thy heart, and look not upon Him except with His eye, for whosoever looks upon Him with his eye shall perceive Him, otherwise he will remain veiled." They were and are unaware of the essence of the Cause, for due to the requirements of wisdom and the flame of hatred and malice burning in the hearts of the people of every kind, most matters were concealed. Blessed is the one who has shattered the idols of vain imaginings through divine power and has turned with his own sight and hearing to the lights of the Daystar of certitude.

If they would, for but an hour, sanctify their hearing from what they have heard, and likewise their sight from what they have seen, and turn to the revealed verses that have encompassed the kingdom of earth and heaven, they would cry out at the top of their voices among all peoples "The All-Merciful has come with manifest sovereignty" - in such wise that their cry would be heard even in the prison. In truth it would be a pity for them to hesitate in this Day, for this is the Day of striving and service. Should one partake of the Kawthar of immortality that lies hidden within the Most Exalted Words, he would give the world the glad tidings of the appearance of Him Who conversed on Sinai upon the throne of Revelation. Though he has not attained His presence and meeting, yet his level of understanding is evident to this Wronged One. Should he be assisted to turn to God's will, it will increase and be made effective.

Some time ago the letter of Samandar - upon him be My glory and loving-kindness - and thy letter arrived, and in both his mention was made. In those same days the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed, but there was delay in its dispatch. We beseech God, exalted be He, to draw him nigh unto Him and sanctify him from all else but Him, that he may hear and hasten with his heart unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. If they would consider all that has transpired from the beginning of the Cause until now, they would testify to the power, majesty and sovereignty of God, exalted be His glory. The glory proceeding from Us be upon thee and upon thy nephew and thy family who have turned to and believed in God, the One, the All-Informed. Praise be to God, the Lord of the mighty throne.

He is God, exalted be His glory! You had mentioned the tribulations of the friends. Praise be to God that each of His loved ones, according to their capacity, has drunk from the cup of tribulation in His path and partaken of the chalice of destiny. No glory endures, nor abasement, neither heat remains, nor shade. Will those who recline upon the couches of might and majesty endure, while those who walk barefoot perish? No, by God! All shall perish outwardly, but the former, if they walked the path of desire, shall be destroyed and perish, while the latter, if they turned to God, shall be saved and endure. Those who are occupied with the world and heedless of God, the Most High, are all worshippers of vain imaginings, for that with which they are occupied and for which they turn away from Truth is unreal and evanescent, like a mirage that appears to exist but leaves no trace to those possessed of insight. That which is subject to change and alteration has no worth and never will. Say: O servants! Look beneath the earth - can you distinguish between master and servant, noble and base, wise and heedless, rich and poor? Can any distinguish between the bones of kings and subjects? Where are those who sat upon thrones of glory and reclined upon couches of grandeur? And where are those who rose up to war against God and considered all in the realm their possessions? Is there any trace of those souls to be found, or any mention of their fruits? All have become a ruined people, and destiny has scattered them like dust. We should view things with an eye that changing circumstances cannot alter, and trust in God's grace and thank Him for whatever He has willed and for all that appears from Him. In brief, comfort and hardship, ease and difficulty, sorrows and joys are all passing. All these matters depend upon and are sustained by human existence, which is itself subject to change and transformation; how much more so then the branch than the root! Blessed is the state of those who, in their love for God, are tried by the love of His creatures. Not an atom of the deeds of men is hidden from God. Today He regards with the eye of grace His loved ones who have turned to Him and remained steadfast in His love, and mentions them with the tongue of His grandeur. By God! This is what the chosen ones prefer, and nothing past or future can equal it. O thou who art renowned in the land and mentioned in all regions! Hear My words: Be not grieved by what has befallen thee and the loved ones of God. Aid thy Lord within thyself, then remember Him among thy brothers and thank Him in all conditions. Indeed He has protected thee from those upon whom the sun has not risen upon any more wretched. Know thou that this Ocean's waves will not still, this Breeze's wafting will not cease, this Musk no vessel can contain, this Fragrance no seal can confine. How excellent are these words: "Were the sweet-scented breezes of Thy fragrance to blow in the East, while in the West one suffered from a cold, his sense of smell would be restored." Praise God that in this great calamity, mighty tribulation, and countless afflictions, thou hast entered this fortified ruined city. By God! This remembrance and what has appeared and will appear in this city shall endure unto the eternal future. Soon shall the gates be opened, for thy Lord is the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. Blessed are they who do not stumble in this upheaval but remain firm. In this imprisonment are concealed a hundred thousand wisdoms - soon shall what is hidden from eyes be revealed. Since you had written about the details of the tribulations of the friends, it was mentioned before the Divine Presence that one of the servants should recount some details of events that occurred from the time of departure from the Land of Mystery until arrival in this land, that the two accounts might be joined together. And He is the All-Remembering, the Mighty, the Bestower.

Firuq - Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, is he who speaks in the Kingdom of utterance. Glorified be He Who hath appeared and revealed that whereby the hearts of them that are endued with understanding have been attracted, and hath sent down the Book as a token of His grace, and commanded all to act in accordance with what is therein. He is, verily, the Commander, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Bountiful.

O people of the earth! By God, the appointed time hath elapsed, and the Self-Subsisting hath come, and through Him hath been fulfilled that which God foretold in the Scriptures and Tablets. Through Him the Known hath appeared, and the back of vain imaginings hath been broken, and the seal of the choice wine hath been broken. Come ye, and hasten, O people of light! This is the Day whereon the Great Resurrection hath occurred, and the Hour hath cried out before the pavilions of grandeur. By God, the most excellent of hours hath come. Blessed is he who hath drunk the Salsabil of Revelation from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Lord of the Final End. Woe unto him who hath broken the Covenant and his pledge, and denied that which the Book hath uttered.

The world hath been illumined by the lights of the Countenance, and hearts and minds have been set ablaze by the fire of the Word of God, the Lord of Lords. Beware, O people of the earth, lest the vain imaginings of the world withhold you from the Lord of all men. Cast away what ye possess, then turn unto the Most Great Ocean which hath appeared and spoken: "There is none other God besides Me, the Mighty, the All-Knowing."

O Ali! We have heard thy call and perceived from it the fragrance of thy love. We have remembered thee in this Tablet, to which the Most Great Name in the world hath borne witness. Be thou grateful and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all men!" Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee and My turning towards thee from this Prison which God hath made the circumambulation place of the righteous. Say: "Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having remembered me by Thy Most Exalted Pen, and made known to me Thy path in the kingdom of creation, and strengthened me to recognize the Dayspring of Thy Revelation and the Manifestation of Thy Self, at Whose advent all things spoke and the mountains passed away. O Lord! Thou seest me turning unto Thee and turning away from Thine enemies. I beseech Thee to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones who have cast away all else besides Thee. O Lord! The atoms testify to Thy generosity, Thy mercy, and Thy favors. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of what is with Thee, then record for me the reward of attaining Thy presence. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful."

We make mention of him who is named Muhammad, that he may rejoice in the verses of his Lord and be of the thankful ones. O Muhammad! Rejoice thou in that the Wronged One remembereth thee in His Most Great Prison and announceth unto thee the bounty of thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

We make mention of him who is named Nasru'llah and We enjoin him and My loved ones to be steadfast in this mighty Cause. Give thanks unto God for having turned unto thee and mentioned thee in His decisive and impregnable Book.

We make mention of My loved ones there and counsel them with that which will exalt the Cause of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O My loved ones! Be not grieved by the hardships of the world and its conditions. Soon will all that ye see today perish, and there shall remain for you what hath been sent down from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Informed. Hold ye fast unto the cord of unity and soar with the wings of yearning in this perfumed and gentle atmosphere. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken from this noble prospect.

I bear witness that the Servant visited Me on thy behalf and on behalf of him who is named with M and H, and attained the honor of acceptance in this exalted station. The Glory shining from the horizon of the tender mercies of your Lord, the All-Merciful, be upon you and upon those who have attained unto this wondrous Cause.

As to what thou didst mention concerning the Huquq, We have commanded him who circleth round the Throne to write for thee what God, the Lord of the worlds, hath desired. When thou readest My letter and findest the fragrance of My utterance, say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Beloved of those who are in the heavens and on earth!" I testify that through Thee the cock of eternity hath crowed, and that which was hidden from time immemorial hath appeared. I beseech Thee by the Name through which every door was opened, and every hidden thing was revealed, and every stammering tongue spoke forth, to make me in all conditions one who uttereth Thy Name, who standeth in Thy service, and who is aided to accomplish what Thou hast desired in Thy Book and sent down from the heaven of Thy Will. There is no God but Thee, the Munificent, the Powerful, the Forgiving, the Generous.

In the name of the Desired One of the worlds! The Divine Lote-Tree calleth out from the crimson spot, addressing the people of creation, saying: O My chosen ones throughout the lands! Hearken unto My most sweet call and unto My rustling which hath been raised betwixt earth and heaven. Beware lest the affairs of the world grieve you. By the life of God! They shall pass away and perish, while glory and power shall endure for you in the worlds which none can alter. God hath sanctified them from all that is mentioned and seen. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Truthful, the All-Informed One.

O 'Ali! Thy letter which thou didst send to Nabil-i-Qa'in hath come before the Wronged One, and the servant who standeth before the Throne presented it, and We found therein that which moved My Most Exalted Pen, as a token of Our favor unto thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Hearing, the Answering One.

O 'Ali! Thou hast heard the call of God time and again. Now hearken unto this call wherein the Most Pure Countenance turneth toward thee and calleth thee from the direction of His Greatest Horizon with a call whereby the eyes of the mystics are gladdened and the hearts of the sincere ones are stirred. By the life of God! Wert thou to inhale the breaths of revelation as befitteth, longing would seize thee in such wise that the affairs of the world would not disturb thee, nor what hath appeared and shall appear from those who have cast the Command of God behind their backs and have chosen that which will lead them to the nethermost fire.

Give thou the glad-tidings of My remembrance unto My loved ones. Say: By God! We remember you at all times, and Mine eye hath ever been directed toward My chosen ones, and My glances have been cast over My servants. My tongue, My Pen, and My pages whereby all in the world are stirred bear witness to this, and beyond them, My all-encompassing knowledge. Say: Hold ye fast unto the wisdom We have sent down in the Book, then act according to what is therein. Verily it is the Most Great Stronghold. Blessed is he who hath turned unto it and held fast thereunto. He is of those who have attained.

O 'Ali! Where is thy previous day and where is that which appeared in the previous year? The world testifieth to its evanescence, yet most of the people are heedless. Say: Cling ye unto that which shall endure for you throughout the endurance of the Kingdom and the Realm, and abandon that which every truthful and trustworthy one acknowledgeth as perishable. Say: We have ordained for you in Our Crimson Tablet from My Most Glorious Pen that which shall gladden your hearts, rejoice your souls, and cause the hearts of the slumbering ones to soar. It behooveth you to stand firm in the Cause, and it behooveth Him to fulfill what He hath promised you in His Guarded Book.

O loved ones of the All-Merciful! The Beloved mentioneth you in His Most Great Prison and calleth you with such sweetness that were anyone to sense it, he would soar on the wings of detachment throughout creation and celebrate the praise of God with such remembrance as would cause hearts to be attracted and the breasts of those who have turned unto Him to be dilated.

Convey My Great Glory unto My loved ones who have soared in the atmosphere of My love, who have quaffed the choice wine of My bounty and have attained unto the Kawthar of My steadfastness. We testify that they are they upon whom the Concourse on High pray, and who have circumambulated the Throne by God's leave, the Mighty, the Wise. Then convey My Great Glory unto him whose grief thou didst mention, and give him glad-tidings from the Wronged One that he may rejoice and be of those who are gladdened. Say: By God! There hath been sent down for thee on this Day of God that which a single verse thereof surpasseth all that hath been created in the heavens and earth. Be thou assured in the grace of thy Lord. He ordaineth for thee that which shall profit thee in this world and the next. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. Reflect upon thy Lord's favor, how He hath turned toward thee from this spot and remembereth thee in this far-off stronghold. Say: I testify that Thou art the Lord of the world and the Sovereign over the nations. Thou doest what Thou willest by Thy command, and Thou art the Munificent, the Mighty, the Generous.

Then We convey from this spot Our Great Glory unto the faces of My handmaidens who have sought the horizon of My bounty, who have heard My call, who have turned with their hearts toward My Beautiful Countenance, who have drunk the Kawthar of My knowledge, and who have remembered their Lord through successive years. They are assuredly of the people of this wondrous Scene. At the end of Our utterance, We counsel Our servants with wisdom, then again with wisdom. Say: Ask ye God to grant you success therein and to bestow upon you that which floweth from this wondrous Spring.

O Muhammad-Baqir, upon thee be the Glory of God! He is the Just, the All-Knowing, the Wise.

God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath come from the heaven of certitude is, verily, the Dawning-Place of His mighty signs and the Dayspring of His most excellent names. Through Him were unveiled the treasures of inner meanings and utterance throughout all creation, and the Dove of Knowledge warbled upon the loftiest branches: "Dominion belongeth unto Him Who hath appeared with the truth and Who in every state hath proclaimed: 'Verily, I am God, there is none other God but Me, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.'"

This is an epistle from Us unto all that dwell on earth, that the sweet savors of revelation may draw them unto God, the Lord of existence. O peoples of the earth! Hearken unto My call, for verily it guideth you unto the path of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Cast away what ye possess. There hath come unto you from God that which shall profit you and draw you nigh unto Him, and shall exalt you throughout all lands. He, verily, is the One, the Alone, the Mighty, the All-Loving.

O Ba! Hear the call from the Most Exalted Horizon. Verily, He shall transform thy sorrow into supreme joy, thy hardship into ease, thy distress into comfort, and thy exile into dwelling in God's native land, the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Beloved.

The All-Glorious hath received thy letter and presented it before His Face. We have revealed for thee that which shall bring solace to all eyes. We have heard thy call and answered thee, and We have witnessed thy devotion and turned unto thee from this exalted station. The dwellers of the cities of My love have been overtaken with grief at what hath befallen thee from every oppressor who hath oppressed, and from every denier who hath disbelieved in God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen. There hath befallen thee what befell Us when the oppressors rose against Us and expelled Us from Our native land with such tyranny as caused the inhabitants of the Kingdom to lament.

O Ba! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Names. Say: O my God, my Lord, my Support, and my Purpose! Were it not for tribulations in Thy path, how would the stations of Thy lovers be made manifest? And were it not for afflictions in Thy love, by what means would the conditions of Thy yearning ones be revealed? By Thy might! The companion of Thy loved ones are their tearful eyes, the solace of Thy seekers are their heart's lamentations, and the sustenance of those who long for Thee are the fragments of their hearts. How sweet is the deadly poison in Thy path, and how precious are the arrows of the enemies for the exaltation of Thy Word!

O my God! Give me to drink in Thy Cause what Thou desirest, and send down upon me in Thy love what Thou hast ordained. By Thy might! I desire only what Thou desirest, and love only what Thou lovest. I have placed my trust in Thee under all conditions. Verily, Thou art the All-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.

O Qaf-Ra! We read this prayer, and We have read it before in successive years. Read thou and be of those who rejoice. Verily, nothing escapeth His knowledge. He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Take wisdom and that by which the hearts of those who have been heedless of this Most Great Cause and this Mighty Message may be attracted.

In the Persian tongue, hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. We have enjoined wisdom upon all. The Divine Tablets bear witness to this truth. All friends must hold fast unto it and adhere to that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, for if they act according to what hath been commanded, they shall attain the most exalted station in this world and the next. Verily, thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

Counsel the loved ones regarding that which hath been revealed in the Tablets from the Dayspring of God's Will. Verily, He shall protect them, deliver them, and draw them nigh unto Him. He, verily, is the All-Hearing, the Trustworthy.

The answers to the petitions have been revealed and sent from the Kingdom of utterance. We beseech God to give them to drink, from the cups of His utterance, the Kawthar of His knowledge. Verily, He is the Protector of whosoever turneth unto Him, and He is the One, the Alone, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

One of the sons of the Friend and inheritors of Him Who conversed with God - upon him be the Glory of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing - hath made mention of thee. We beseech God to adorn His servants with the ornament of faithfulness. When We perceived from him its fragrance, We made mention of him in such wise as hath spread abroad the sweet scents of the mercy of God, the Lord of the worlds. Convey My greetings unto him and give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance of him, and I am the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing.

The Glory be upon thee, and upon him, and upon those who have held fast unto wisdom and acted according to that which they were commanded in My perspicuous Book.

In the Name of God, the Most Invincible, the Most Holy, the Most Wondrous, the Most Glorious

I had previously sent a petition to your honor, and this is another time, for whenever anyone turns towards you, my heart is set ablaze with the fire of your remembrance and love, and compels me to mention and praise your honor. Although mention from one such as I befits not one whom God has singled out for the service of His Cause, the manifestation of His Word, and the teaching of His creation. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid me to do what is befitting of His loved ones who have detached themselves from all else save Him and have arisen to aid His Cause among the worlds.

Previously when his honor Mulla Muhammad-'Ali was departing, a detailed response to that beloved's letter was submitted and sent. And now too, since his honor Amin and Mulla Abu'l-Hasan and Aqa Hasan, upon them be the glory of God, were departing, I felt obliged to engage again in mention of that beloved. God willing the previous petition has arrived and the books, as mentioned before, were sent. Whosoever wishes to make a copy, please grant permission, but much emphasis is needed that they preserve them so they do not become blackened or lost. And since there was no bookbinder here, they were therefore sent without binding.

The loved ones of the land of Ta had requested prayers. To whatever extent possible, deliver them to them. And in these days the Kitab-i-Aqdas has been revealed from the holy heaven - blessed is he who looks into it and ponders what has been sent down of the verses of his Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The reason was that in recent years some questions regarding divine laws were asked from various quarters. However the Supreme Pen paused - in the Land of Mystery a brief text was revealed in Persian but was not sent anywhere. By command it was preserved in its place until in these days again the petitions of the questioners were presented at the Most Holy Court. Therefore in the most wondrous melodies in the language of verses this wonderful, exalted Book was revealed. And since his honor Aqa H.M., upon him be the glory of God, was present here, whatever was currently expedient to be revealed was bestowed upon him - that is, permission was granted for him to make a copy of it. God willing you will attain unto it and will act according to wisdom. Blessed is he who has a taste to find its sweetness, and who has eyes to recognize what is in it, and who has a heart to discover its symbols and mysteries. By God, the back of utterance trembles at the greatness of what has been revealed in it and the veiled allusions due to their intense manifestation.

By command: they must strive with utmost effort and endeavor to maintain the unity and harmony of the loved ones. They must at all times be focused on the Cause and its exaltation, detached from all directions. Once the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these words: Write to his honor 'Ali, upon him be the glory of God, that your service has been and will be noticed, and will not be lost with God, and you are counted among those souls of whom He says "no fear shall be upon them, neither shall they grieve." Therefore they should not be distressed or saddened by certain matters arising from the loved ones. With perfect detachment and reliance engage in promoting love and unity and association, such that even if harm befalls you it matters not, for good deeds will not remain hidden from the All-Knowing and the Commander. Soon you will witness the reward for what you have done and what you have borne in the path of Truth. Be thou grateful and be of the thankful ones. End.

Furthermore it is hoped that at all times you will write of your blessed circumstances, for this has been and will be the cause of joy to the heart of this ephemeral servant. Verily glory be upon you and upon those who love you and who hear your words and who associate with your honor purely for the sake of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Generous.

The Servant \[of God\]

O Muhammad, upon whom be the Glory of God! He is the Most Holy, the Most Great!

The world hath been set ablaze by the Fire that hath been kindled from the Tree of God's Command, the Lord of all worlds. By God's life! Moses heard from it "Verily, there is none other God but I, the Mighty, the All-Wise," and Abraham hastened with his heart unto it and cried, "Yea, yea, O Beloved of them that know!" And the Friend ascended and soared on the wings of understanding to the Kingdom of the All-Merciful, the station wherein he beheld My greatest signs and heard My sweetest call. Verily thy Lord is the All-Informed, the All-Knowing.

Every prince had been awaiting the days of God, and every learned one did lament and weep and implore God for its appearance and manifestation. Yet when the horizon of the world was illumined by the Sun of My Most Great Name, they turned away and denied, save whom God willed, the Lord of all worlds. Say: This is the Day wherein the Trump beareth witness unto Him Who conversed with God upon the Mount, and wherein the Bugle proclaimeth "The Kingdom is God's, the One, the All-Informed!" This is the Day wherein every sick one hath been healed, and every silent tongue hath spoken, and that which was hidden in the treasury of thy Lord's knowledge and recorded in God's Books, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, hath been made manifest.

O thou who art mentioned before the Face! Bear thou witness unto that whereunto God did testify before the creation of the heavens and the earth: "Verily there is none other God but I, the Mighty, the All-Praised." The servant who was present hath brought thy letter and read before the Wronged One that which thou didst commune with God, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed be thine eye for what it hath beheld, and thine ear for what it hath heard, and thy tongue for having uttered the praise of thy Lord when the divines of the earth pronounced judgment against Him with manifest injustice.

Say: Cast aside your books and your pens, then hearken unto the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree which hath been raised betwixt earth and heaven, and be not of the heedless ones. By God! That which ye possess will profit you not this day - to this doth the Tongue of Grandeur testify, and behind it every fair-minded and perceiving one. Rejoice thou that We found thy letter sanctified from the mention of aught else but Me - to this do My Pen and My Tongue bear witness in this wondrous Tablet. Be thou thankful unto God for having attained unto that whereby thy mention, thy turning unto Him, and thy recognition of the perpetuity of His imperishable Kingdom shall endure.

Had men known, they would have cast away what they possess and hastened to the Most Great Ocean which surgeth by virtue of this Name that exerciseth sovereignty over all who are in the heavens and on earth. By God's life! The fragrance of the Divine Utterance hath been wafted throughout creation, yet the people remain wrapped in a thick veil. Counsel the people to remain steadfast in this Cause whereby feet have slipped and every lofty mountain hath been scattered. Arise from the horizon of utterance with wisdom and clear exposition, and convey the Command of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, in such wise as to cause the hearts of them that know to take wing.

Say: This is the Day of Standing, were ye to know, and this is the Day of Remembrance and Praise, were ye to be of them that remember. Say: Beware lest desire debar you from the Most Exalted Horizon. Cast away what ye possess and take what God possesseth. Thus doth your Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Kind, command you.

The banners of Divine Utterance have been raised upon the branches. Blessed is the soul that seeth, and woe unto the heedless! Say: O people! Abandon vain imaginings. By God! The Self-Subsisting hath appeared with a sovereignty that no hosts can intimidate nor the combined forces of the world prevent. He speaketh at all times, calling the servants unto the most sublime station and the highest Paradise, yet most of the people are turned away.

Say: O people! Doth slumber overtake you after ye behold God's Eye watching over you? Do ye sit while the Beloved standeth before your faces? Fear God and follow not every remote idolater. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of that which hath come unto you. Turn ye to the Living Waters, then drink therefrom once in His Most Great Name, and again in remembrance of His Beautiful Name.

O Muhammad! We have heard thy call and have answered thee with a Tablet that shall bear witness for thee in every world of thy Lord's worlds. Give thanks and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Glory of all who are in the heavens and on earth!" Glory be upon thee and upon them who have kept God's Covenant and His Testament, and who have acted according to what hath been commanded in His perspicuous Book.

He is the All-Knowing in the Most Exalted Horizon!

Say: The verses have been sent down from the Kingdom on high from the presence of the King of Names and Attributes. Through them were rent asunder the veils between earth and heaven, and the maidens of Paradise emerged with their heads from the chambers, crying out with the most beautiful call: "This is none other than a mighty tiding!" And we would sacrifice ourselves as did he who loved Him and was martyred in His path, and who took for himself a station on the shore of nearness that was faithful to the truth.

O servant! Grieve not for thy father. He hath ascended unto God and entered the Most Great Paradise, the seat of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. At every moment he drinketh of the pure water of life before the throne of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and at every instant there shineth upon him the beauty of the All-Glorious through wondrous manifestations of might. Thus doth God single out whom He willeth through His grace and sendeth down upon him mercy from His presence. There is none other than He who hath power to recompense those who have drawn nigh unto Him and detached themselves from all else with the most excellent reward. He, verily, is the Best of rewarders, the All-Wise.

And thou, walk thou in the footsteps of thy father, then follow his guidance and be steadfast in the Cause at a time when most faces shall turn away and the feet of the mystics shall slip. Preserve thou the words of God in this Tablet, then recite them day and night that the fragrances of the Cause may attract thee to a holy and luminous seat, and bring thee to a station which God hath sanctified from the knowledge of all things save those whose hearts hear the mention of God and in whose movements and stillness is seen the tranquility and dignity of God, and from whose faces shineth the freshness of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Beautiful.

Know thou that thy father was martyred in the path of his Lord through the tribulations and hardships that befell him from those who transgressed against him and were among the wrongdoers. With thy Lord he hath a station that none can attain save those whom thy Lord willeth from among the truthful, the near ones, then the assured ones and the sincere ones. And whosoever dieth while certain of God his Lord, knowing himself, and turning unto Him, hath verily died a martyr. To this doth the tongue of thy Lord now testify from this holy and glorious seat.

And thou, mention from Our presence those servants who loved him and were in his company and took him as a friend to themselves and were among those present before him. Had all who are on earth held fast to the cord of his love, We would have effaced their evil deeds and clothed them in the robe of forgiveness. But when they veiled themselves, their portion was decreed and they were in manifest loss. Thus did the grace of thy Lord precede all created things, and His mercy encompass all beings, and His word excel all the worlds. But the people veiled themselves therefrom and followed the path of error in that they followed every rebellious devil.

Say: O people! Be not of those who name the Point of the Bayan as the Beloved while at the moment this name issueth from their mouths their eyes turn right and left in show of their longing for Him, yet they slay His very self and essence with the swords of rejection and turning away, and are not among those who perceive. Those who have denied this Cause have not believed in the Messengers of God, and their mention shall never ascend unto God, and their names shall never be remembered before the Throne, even should all creation prostrate before them.

Say: O people! Have ye taken fancy as your lord besides God? What then is the difference between you and those who mention the Names but deny their Creator? Consider this, O heedless ones! Those ones are encompassed by the veils of self and passion, and are seized by vain imaginings, and are among the polytheists. By My life! Whoso reflecteth upon this Revelation for less than a moment will recognize what none recognized before, and will find no likeness for it in creation, and will be among those endowed with certitude. Thus hath the word of thy Lord been fulfilled in truth and justice, and His proof hath been made manifest, and the Face hath shone forth between the heavens and earth. And glory be upon you, O people of the pavilion of majesty, from this Cause, the gleaming, the luminous, the holy, the most mighty, the wondrous!

O Jinab-i-Haji Ghulam-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, who hath migrated and attained unto the name of the One True Speaker.

The Pen of the Wronged One beareth witness to the oneness of God, the Almighty, and testifieth that Haji Ghulam-Qabli-'Ali, upon him be My Glory, attained the Most Holy Court and mentioned the friends in the presence of His Countenance, and each received his portion from the ocean of grace. How sweet is the fragrance of grace and favors on His Day!

O Ghulam-Qabli-'Ali! Return to thy homeland with God's leave and favor, and in every land make mention of the people of God on behalf of the Wronged One. Say: Strive ye, and on this blessed day deprive not yourselves of the waves of the ocean of divine bounty. The gift of utterance is present and the feast of knowledge hath been sent down. Each one among the people of God must remember the Truth, exalted be His glory, through this most exalted Word: Verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.

My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having illumined my heart through the effulgences of the lights of the Day-Star of Thy Revelation, and for having enabled me to turn unto Thee when most of Thy creatures turned away, and for having guided me through the light of Thy knowledge unto Thy path, and for having nurtured me through the hands of bounty and generosity to attain Thy presence in Thy days. O my Lord! I am Thy servant, and the son of Thy servant, and the son of Thy handmaiden. My hope is in Thy grace, my desire is Thy good-pleasure, my quest is to meet Thee, and my aspiration is to stand before the gate of Thy generosity. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy knowledge, the heaven of Thy wisdom, the power of Thy Will, and the might of Thy Purpose, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the doubts of Thy creatures nor the veils of Thy servants shall hold me back. Ordain for me, O my God, that which beseemeth Thy pardon and bounty. Strengthen my children in that whereby my remembrance and my name shall endure throughout the eternity of Thy kingdom and Thy dominion. Verily, Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful and the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

O Ghulam! The people of God who dwell in that land and its surroundings have each attained unto mention and are illumined by the lights of the Countenance. Give thou the glad-tidings unto all. In accordance with wisdom, not all names have been revealed by the Pen at this time, yet each standeth before His Countenance and is present beneath the glance of His favor. Blessed are they and joy be unto them! Say: O people of God! The oppression of the oppressors and the lies of the liars shall soon return to nothingness, as ye have witnessed and heard. I swear by the Sun of Truth, there hath been ordained especially for you that which shall not be seized by extinction and shall abide for the duration of the kingdom and the realm. Thou hast been in the Most Holy Court and art aware of the wisdom that hath been enjoined. All must walk in the path of truth and in all conditions keep their gaze fixed upon wisdom. Among the loved ones there are both the strong and the weak, and wisdom hath ever been the cause of preserving the strong and likewise the source of strength for the weak. We counsel all and beseech God that He may preserve all through trustworthiness, religious devotion, chastity and faithfulness, and guide them to His straight path. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.

Praise be to God! Thou didst attain unto His presence and didst convey the petitions of His friends to the Most Holy Court, and each was honored with His hearing. Blessed is the name that appeared before My Countenance, the heart that turned toward My Kingdom, the eye that beheld My horizon, the servant that soared in My atmosphere, the mention that was honored with My hearing, the wise one who held fast to My Book, the steadfast one whom the oppression of Mine enemies did not deter, the seeker who arose before the gate of My grandeur, the soul that made My remembrance and praise its concern and the promotion of My Cause. Upon it be My glory and the glory of those in My kingdom and dominion, and the glory of the Supreme Concourse and the most exalted Paradise, and the glory that hath shone forth from the horizon of My Will and Purpose, and the glory of all who are in the heavens and the earth.

We make mention in this station of My handmaidens who have believed in Me and in My verses, who have heard My call and turned toward My bright and luminous horizon.

O Mirza Siyyid 'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the One speaking from His most exalted horizon.

A letter from the Wronged One to him who has turned to God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, that the call may draw him to the most exalted horizon and bring him near to Him Who hath come from the heaven of grace with a proof that nothing possessed by the nations can equal. He Who possesseth the known Book beareth witness to this. The horizon of knowledge hath been illumined by the light of the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who hath seen with his own eyes and blessed is he who hath heard with his own ears the call of God, the Mighty, the Loving.

O 'Ali! We have heard thy mention and have remembered thee with that which nothing in the world can equal. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this bounty and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O God of the seen and unseen!" Beware lest the people of the Bayan prevent thee from thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Be thou steadfast in service to the Cause, turn thy face toward its horizon, speak forth its praise, and hold fast unto its strong cord. When thou perceivest the fragrance of revelation in the verses of thy Lord, say with wisdom and utterance: "O people of the world! The All-Merciful hath come with manifest sovereignty." Beware lest the veils of the divines withhold you, or the might of those who have denied God's right, the Lord of existence, frighten you. Say: "O concourse of divines! By God, the dwellers of the highest Paradise lament because of your tyranny. Fear God and be not of those who have denied God's favor after it was sent down." Thus doth My Most Exalted Pen counsel you from its praiseworthy station. Through you was shed the blood of the Primal Point, and the limbs of the Concourse on High did tremble. Thus did their souls entice them, and you today do not understand. Cast away your idle fancies and take what ye have been given from the presence of the Truth, the Knower of the unseen, Who hath come with the banners of verses, with the Primal Point at His right hand and a company of angels at His left, if ye but knew.

O 'Ali! Behold and then recall what the people of Iran perpetrated when the Herald of thy Lord's Cause, the All-Merciful, appeared. They pronounced judgment against Him with such injustice that the Holy Spirit lamented, as did the dwellers of the divine pavilions and the inhabitants of the Kingdom.

Hearken in the Persian tongue to the call of the Wronged One and ponder the deeds of the Shi'ih sect. Throughout ages and centuries they awaited the appearance of Him Who conversed on Sinai, and in the nights and days they lamented and supplicated God, glorified be His majesty, yearning for His presence. But when the blessed Morn dawned and the holy Tree sprouted forth, all surrounded Him with swords of hatred and pronounced judgment to shed His most pure blood. "It was not the rulers who slew Him, but rather the divines, would ye but understand." For in the early years, all the divines pronounced judgment to slay the Lord of the saints, and by the verdict of those heedless souls there occurred what occurred. Reflect a little, that perchance thou mayest drink from the ocean of awareness and bear witness to the wronged state of the Truth. The Shi'ih sect counted themselves the most learned, most excellent and most God-fearing among the world's peoples, yet with one clear test it became evident they were the basest of all the earth's peoples. They committed that which no other people in the world had committed. Even now their deeds are manifest and evident. The cry did not bring them to their senses, nor did the call awaken them. They stand in pulpits cursing the Intended One and perceive it not.

Now the people of the Bayan too have intended to organize a party from among the Shi'ih. In any case, hearken to the call of the Wronged One. Stand for God's sake and speak for God's sake, that perchance former delusions may not be renewed and the helpless people may become free and attain true unity. Service to the Cause is binding and obligatory upon all. Convey My greetings to the friends in that land. Say: While time remains, turn ye to the eternal Kingdom and arise to redress what hath escaped you. The world is transient, its days are transient, and all that is seen is transient. Strive that ye may achieve such deeds whose fragrance shall never fade from the world and may be recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book. Verily He is the Protector of those who remember Him and those who act. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

O Ibn-i-Dakhil, upon thee be the Glory of God, He is the Speaker, the Rememberer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! Praise be to God that the verses of God are spread abroad and His fragrances diffused, and every day from the horizon of the Supreme Pen's heaven the Sun of utterance dawneth and the light of wisdom shineth forth. Blessed are those servants who have attained to beholding and hearkening thereunto.

O Ibn-i-Dakhil, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful! At this hour the Branch of the Divine Lote-Tree, who hath been named Badi'u'llah in the Book, hath attained to Our presence and presented thy letter in its entirety before the Most Holy and Exalted Court, and this response hath been sent down from the Source of Divine knowledge and the Dawning-Place of heavenly utterance, that thine eyes and the eyes of those who have been attracted by the Call when it was raised between earth and heaven might be solaced thereby, and who have attained to the choice wine of utterance from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the Generous. Blessed art thou for having been present and witnessed the waves of the ocean of thy Lord's utterance, and for having attained to that wherewith God's Books and His Messengers had promised thee, both in the past and future. We beseech God to preserve thee and to aid thee with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, and to enable thee to reform and educate souls. He is verily the Helper, the Almighty, the Powerful.

Thou didst mention the pilgrimage to the House of God. Until now its ordinance hath been and remaineth concealed. We beseech God to reveal that which will draw people near unto Him. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous.

As to what thou didst mention regarding Mirza Ibrahim-i-Shishvani, verily We made mention of him before his letter reached Our presence, and We revealed for him that whereby all things were attracted. Say: O Ibrahim! The Call hath been raised on the Mount of Knowledge, giving glad tidings unto all of Him Who conversed thereon, through Whose manifestation that which was hidden in God's knowledge was revealed and that which was concealed from eyes and sight became evident. Say: O people! Cast aside what ye possess and take what hath been given you from God, the Commander, the All-Wise.

O Ibn-i-Dakhil! Beseech God that He may aid His loved ones to attain unto wisdom - wisdom which hath been revealed in the Tablets consisteth of deeds that cause the drawing nigh of the servants and the enlightenment of the people of the lands. Pure, contented and well-pleasing souls must guide and lead the women and men of the world to the Dawning-Place of Revelation and the Source of Inspiration through holy deeds and praiseworthy character. Today deeds and character are reckoned among the hosts of God, exalted be His glory, and these hosts have ever been and shall forever remain victorious. The decree of holy war and strife hath been erased from the Book by the finger of divine power.

From the loved ones of 'Ishqabad appeared that which caused the joy of the people of the Most Great Scene. After the martyrdom of one of the loved ones who was named Rida in the Book of Names, all held fast to patience and tranquility and adhered to what God had decreed in the Books and Tablets, and moreover interceded for the murderers and oppressors. This deed was adorned with the glory of acceptance and the ornament of divine good-pleasure. Now We beseech God to aid that company to unity, harmony, love and faithfulness. He is verily the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Powerful.

Thou didst make mention of Rida. Verily We heard his cry and turned toward him from this direction and revealed for him from the heaven of grace that which shall endure as long as the kingdom and the heavenly dominion shall endure. We beseech God to aid him to be steadfast in this Cause whereby all were thunderstruck save whom God willed, the Lord of this exalted station.

O Ibn-i-Dakhil! Set ablaze the loved ones with the heat of the Divine Word, but with such a blaze as would cause attraction and be the cause of turning unto God and of unity, not of conflict and contention. Verily We have mentioned all and do mention them. Thy Lord is indeed the Forgiving, the Merciful. We make mention of My handmaidens and those who are with thee and those who hearken to thy mention in this wise mention. The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and upon those through whom steadfastness hath been manifested among the people - such servants as God hath described in previous Books and in this Clear Tablet.

O honored beloved, esteemed Haji K_r, upon him be \[Baha'u'llah's\] 966 and His care - let him observe:

He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power

Your letter arrived at a time when opportunity was as rare as the phoenix. As Aqa Siyyid Taqi, upon him be God's peace, intended to return, and now that three hours have passed in the night, this servant engaged in writing multiple letters, that perchance they might spread forth the carpet of joy. Then, turning toward the Presence, they were submitted before His face and He graciously heard all the letters. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to make each one a sign in His kingdom - that is, to appear manifest and evident like banners in support of the Cause. Then, turning to you, He said: "O 'Abdu'l-Karim! Upon you be My peace. The doubts of Iran's divines have debarred the world from the Goal of all existence. They cling to vain imaginings while considering themselves people of certitude. After more than twelve hundred years, the fruit of their deeds was what you heard - they all issued verdicts to shed the most pure blood. Give thanks to the peerless Beloved that He confirmed you, showed you the way, and guided you to the straight path. Praise be to God, you have drunk from the cup of recognition and attained to the remembrance and praise of the Goal of the world. What is now required is wisdom, for people are immersed in the sea of heedlessness. If they gain even slight awareness, they will arise in opposition. Until now, the purpose of this Wronged One remains unknown, for had they discovered it, all would have sought to attain His presence and, cleansing themselves with the water of return unto God from doubts, allusions and sins, would have undertaken pilgrimage. Beseech God not to deprive the peoples of the world from the Kawthar of nearness and debar them from the ocean of knowledge. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Capable. You intended to journey to this land - consult together. If it truly accords with wisdom, there is no harm in coming; otherwise patience is preferable until We send you another command. This is quite clear and evident. The gaze of favor has been and remains fixed upon you. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to ordain through His complete power the means of nearness. Verily He is powerful over what He willeth and He is the Strong, the Mighty."

Praise be to God that you have attained to the true feast and drunk from the cup of recognition. This bounty has had and has no like or equal. As commanded, you must hold fast to wisdom lest the clamor of the heedless be raised. The souls who have accepted should not outwardly change, for some, out of love for Satan, wait to seize upon something and arise according to what their desires command them. Such is the state of the heedless people. Otherwise those possessed of insight know with clear certainty that there has been and is no purpose save the refinement of souls and the manifestation of true divine unity. We beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to guide all and lead them to the straight path. As for your journey, the command is clear and in effect. God willing, it shall be acted upon. Verily He has guided us to the right path of utterance. To those gentlemen who have drunk from the wine of love for the All-Merciful and who gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon, I convey greetings and praise, and I beseech God, exalted be His station, to confirm them all in what He loves and is pleased with. Two petitions arrived and after being submitted to His presence, two prayers were graciously bestowed. Let them recite these and drink of the wine of certitude concealed therein. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Great. Peace, praise and mercy be upon you and upon those who love you and upon God's near servants. Praise be to God, Lord of the Day of Judgment.

Mulla Ja'far of Kashan

In the name of God, exalted be His remembrance! A letter from your honor arrived before this servant indicating excessive anxiety and distress. Nothing was observed therein except the mention that two persons in that land had read a writing which indicated that people should go to Baghdad to render assistance to the Truth. Subsequently your honor, resorting to reason, did not deem it advisable and attributed it to falsehood. In any case, this matter did not warrant lamentation, nor was grieving permissible, for absolutely no one has ever been commanded to do such a thing. Secondly, several years have passed since these servants were expelled from their homeland and have taken up residence in the land of exile. And now two years have passed during which the enemies have been plotting day and night, lying in ambush. Naturally some writings mention these successive tribulations and calamities that have befallen us. If someone should read such a writing containing these matters, it is no proof that assistance is being sought. It is strange that your honor was not pained and saddened by such statements, but instead began to complain. We pour out our grief and sorrow unto God. Is it not evident that these servants are manifestly in the hands of enemies? "Is one who strives in the path of God like one who sits idly at home?" If the servants had tasted but a drop of divine love, by God they would not remain settled in their homes, but would wail in the mountains. This is why all are occupied with wisdom - that is, with whatever preserves the commanding self. If they had drunk a drop from the cup of love, they would surely burn a hundred thousand wisdoms with fire and cast a hundred thousand prudences to the wind. Surely in your honor's eyes the deeds of those lovers of the Ka'bah of the Beloved who have laid down their lives in the path of the Friend and freely given up a world for His sake have never been and are not praiseworthy, for the prophet of the body, which is reason, would never confirm such matters. And the Prophets too, in every age and time, when people saw their actions contrary to their own reason, were therefore judged insane and were not believed. Apart from all this, if someone invites a lover to the land of the Beloved, it becomes cause for him to send letters of complaint to all regions. By God, the fragrance of the love of God has not been inhaled, else you would have sacrificed your life for those very letters and would have been grateful too. A ray cannot be prevented from the sun, and a fish cannot be kept from the sea. Have you not seen how the moth gives up its life around the lamp? Have you not heard that the nightingales of the divine rose-garden have fallen prey to Satan's talons, and the spiritual songsters are being barred from the holy and spiritual rose-garden? If you do not wail from your soul, why then complain? If you have no grief for the Beloved, why then rejoice? All these words are because this year several letters came from that direction expressing longing, and permission was given from here that whoever wishes to journey to the Ka'bah of the Ultimate Goal and the Sanctuary of the Worshipped One is not forbidden, and has never been and will never be forbidden. This decree happened to be contrary to the temperament of some. And God knows the reformer from the corrupter. Now you should forbid all people from ever setting out in this direction. By God, the Truth is beholden to none and He is indeed independent of all worlds. Praise be to God that We have never sought any helper and have desired no assistant besides Him. And God is sufficient as witness.

O Nabil, the traveler! He is the Most Wondrous in the Supreme Horizon! This is an epistle from the Beloved to him for whom God hath ordained a station in the Ridvan, and who hath received a portion from the mercy of his Lord in the Tablets. Be patient, O servant, in hardships and in the sorrows that afflict thee from the manifestations of Satan, for He verily recompenseth the patient ones their rewards and sendeth down upon them such wondrous bounties as will establish them in His Cause - and none knoweth this save every discerning sage.

Say: O people, fear God and render not your deeds vain, and follow not every doubtful polytheist. Say: The thunderbolt of chastisement hath come upon you, and the forces of divine wrath have seized you from every direction. Then there shall be no escape for anyone from God's command save by entering beneath the shadow of this penitent servant. Those who have departed from the shadow of God's mercy - these are they whom all things curse, and every mature and sagacious one beareth witness to this.

Say: O company of the deluded ones! Ye are but a clot of fancy and a morsel of conjecture, and ye have not clothed the bones of your heedlessness with the flesh of understanding from the presence of the Mighty, the Beloved. We behold you between Paradise and the Fire, as though ye had fled from God's bounty and mercy, and warred against His Self and His sovereignty. Soon shall most of you be seized by the angels of the flame.

O people! Hearken unto God's counsel regarding your own selves and transgress not against it. He hath counseled you at all times with clear verses and conclusive proofs, and He desireth naught for you save what shall deliver you from the darkness of fancy and draw you nigh unto the lights of certitude, near unto God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Reckoner.

Say: O people! Do ye follow him who neither heareth nor seeth, and do ye deprive yourselves of God, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, the Answerer? And among the people is he who doubteth God, the Originator of the heavens and earth; when the Youth of the Spirit entereth upon him with God's Tablet and His testimony, and reciteth unto him from God's verses, he is at peace within himself, but then he turneth unto those who have disbelieved, turneth within himself, then doubteth.

Say: O people! Fear God and consort not with those who have denied God and His verses. Then shun such as these. Thus have We commanded you before and do We command you now, that perchance ye may purify your souls for God, the Powerful, the Generous, the Bestower.

Say: O people! Are ye not ashamed before God Who sendeth down upon you from the clouds of grace the verses of His Cause even as He sendeth down from the clouds the rains of mercy - nay, greater still, for the mercy We send down from the clouds perisheth, while that mercy can never be cut off or exhausted - and to this every discerning and sagacious one beareth witness.

O My Name! Leave the mention of those who have disbelieved and warred against God, then stand firm in the Cause at a time when the leaves of faith fall from the trees of men, and every ignorant one is disturbed, and every denier fleeth away. Thus have We inspired thee and sent down upon thee the verses of the Cause with clear and decisive evidences, that thou mayest remain steadfast in thy Lord's Cause and in what hath touched Him of harm from those who were created by His word. By God! They are this day behind a veil and barrier.

Rejoice within thyself at the Spirit's glad-tidings and despair not of God's bounty. Soon shall He send down upon thee that which shall make thee independent of all else and shall increase thee in all things if thou remainest firm in the Cause. And verily His bounty unto mankind is nigh. Thus did We give thee glad-tidings before and do We give thee glad-tidings now, as a favor from Our presence and a mercy from Us upon thee and upon every wayfaring stranger who hath taken shelter beneath the shadow of their Lord's mercy, who, when God's verses are recited unto them, are moved in their very foundations with longing for the meeting with God, and from whom waft throughout creation the sweet fragrances of holiness. These are they whom nothing shall prevent from the ultimate retreats, the vista of their Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and they shall hasten through the wilderness of love even upon burning sands.

Say: O people! Turn ye unto God in repentance for what ye have neglected in His presence, then call upon Him secretly and openly that He may forgive you through His grace, for verily He is the Answerer of prayer and the Observer.

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Glorious

By my spirit and my being may I be a sacrifice unto Thee! How wonderful that I was blessed with thy letter, whose heading was adorned with the crown of the remembrance of our Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, and whose form was embellished with the ornament of love for the Beloved of the worlds. Its outward form attracted me through the breezes of certitude that wafted from it concerning the Cause of our Lord, the Most Merciful, and its inner content gave me to drink of the wine of life that was pressed from the fingers of steadfastness in praise of God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. When I attained and found and knew, I arose and presented myself before the Throne and read before the face of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, after the sun of permission had dawned from the horizon of the will of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. May my soul be a sacrifice for thy soul, O thou who hast turned to the Qiblih of the mystics! May my spirit be a sacrifice for thy spirit, O thou who, when thou didst hear the call, didst say "Here am I, O God of those who are in the heavens and on earth!" Blessed be thy knowledge whereby thou didst attain in these days wherein the spring of bounty and generosity hath overflowed in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Blessed be thy pen in that it hath flowed in His remembrance and praise, after most of those on earth had forgotten Him. O spirit of this mighty station! Were I to say it is a lamp, I would observe that the lamp illumineth the outer aspect of things, while the lamp of thy remembrance in praise of our Lord, the Most Glorious, illumineth the hearts of those who are nigh. May my being be a sacrifice for thy fire, O thou who art attracted by the fire of God that is kindled between the worlds! May my reality be a sacrifice for thy water, O thou who hast quickened with the water of thy Lord's knowledge every decomposed bone!

He is the Ever-Present, He is the All-Seeing

O Name of Bounty! The letter of Ali-Asghar - upon him be My Baha - which he wrote to that one has been presented in the Most Holy Court and attained the honor of being heard. We beseech God to confirm him and grant him success in remembrance, praise and service to the Cause. His mention has been made repeatedly and his name inscribed by the Pen of the Wronged One. God willing, may he be adorned with such an adornment that its light shall be effulgent and its fragrance diffusive. He had mentioned Muhammad-'Ali Kh. We ask and beseech God to enable him to recognize that for which all created things have been brought from nothingness into being. O 'Ali-Asghar! By the life of God, this word which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen concerning him is better for him than all that is witnessed and seen. He is the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the last and the first. He should say: "My God, my God! I have turned toward Thy most exalted horizon after hearing Thy sweetest call. O my Lord! Illumine my face with the lights of Thy countenance, my heart with the lights of Thy knowledge, and my breast with the effulgences of Thy names. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy knowledge, the heaven of Thy grace and the sun of Thy bounty to draw me near unto Thee in all conditions and ordain for me that which shall profit me in every world of Thy worlds. Verily Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, the All-Merciful, the Most Generous."

O Pen! Return to the mention of him who traveled through the lands to exalt My Most Great Word and My Most Glorious Remembrance, who was named Haydar-'Ali in the Book of Names from God, the Cleaver of the heavens, that the breezes of revelation may attract him once again and draw him nigh unto the Most Exalted Horizon, the station wherein naught is heard save the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and the murmuring of the water flowing in the Most Exalted Paradise. And I am the Expositor, the Teacher, the All-Merciful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Hearken in the Persian tongue, that perchance the people of Iran may be attracted by the heat of the utterance of the All-Merciful and attain unto their purpose. By the life of God! The Light is manifest, and He Who speaketh on Sinai is speaking, and the Sun is shining, and the verses are being revealed, and the proof is resplendent. Nevertheless all are heedless save those who have been moved by the movement of My Most Exalted Word, and have drawn nigh and heard the Call of God, the Lord of the worlds. Say to those who have turned away: Fear ye God and be not of the wrongdoers.

We counsel all to read the Persian Bayan. Whosoever considereth it for the sake of God will find himself independent of the dawning-places of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Glory be to God! What objections they have raised against the Truth - exalted be His glory! Say: O company of the heedless ones! First reflect upon the Truth Itself and Its proof and evidence, and judge with fairness. After the establishment of this most exalted station and most glorious rank and most resplendent horizon, other objections are not and have never been befitting. What have those souls understood from "He doeth whatsoever He willeth" and what have they comprehended from "He ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth"? Lost indeed are they who have denied the signs and proof of God, rejected His evidence, and turned away from His shining countenance.

The Truth - exalted be His glory - hath ever been among the people. His deeds are manifest, His utterance evident, and His Book eloquent. That one himself hath been for some time in the Most Holy Court. By the life of God! There hath appeared that which hath no likeness or parallel. The infidels have become veils and clouds. We beseech God to sanctify the lights of the Sun of Truth from these veils and clouds, that the seekers and wayfarers may attain their Desired One and their Intended Goal, may behold the Straight Path and hold fast unto it. The Command is in His grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. And He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon those who have soared in My atmosphere, spoken My praise, held fast unto My cord, clung to the hem of My robe, and arisen to serve My friends who have not broken My Covenant and Testament and have acted according to what was enjoined upon them in My mighty and great Book.

He is God, exalted be His station in loftiness and transcendence

O my God and my Beloved! I know not how to remember Thee or by what means to mention Thee, for I perceive that the very reality of remembrance is in itself severed from the places of Thy description, and in its essence and being is bewildered before the effulgent rays of the Sun of Thy Glory. By its root and substance it declares: "O Source of all sources! Remaineth there in the unseen of the unseen, or in the worlds which Thou hast created by the Word of Thy Command, any remembrance wherewith Thou hast been remembered, or any description wherewith Thou hast been described, or any name whereby Thou hast been called?" I testify, O my God, that Thou hast remembrances within the pavilions of preservation and beauty whereof no Manifestations whom Thou hast manifested from time immemorial have become aware, and no Dawning-places of Thy Most-Learned Name have uttered mention of any of them. Should I say I desire to remember Thee by such remembrances, I see this is not my station or rank. Nay, were the thought of this station to cross my mind, I would have committed a sin beyond compare with any other sin in existence. Were it not for Thy pre-existing grace and mercy, I would deserve eternal destruction and endless consignment to an unquenchable fire that knoweth no end. For I would have desired to drink from a sea wherefrom Thy chosen ones, Thy trusted ones, the Manifestations of Thy Cause and Dawning-places of Thy wisdom have not drunk. Alas, alas! My very being nearly dissolveth from fear. O Lord! Have mercy upon me through Thy grace, then hold me fast by the hand of Thy loving-kindness. Verily Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful.

And should I desire to remember Thee with remembrances wherewith Thou hast been remembered before, by Thy glory! My heart would not be content therewith, nor would the essence which Thou hast deposited in my heart and stored within my innermost being be pleased thereby. Therefore, O my God, cause me to drink from the pure wine of Thy love to such degree that it may intoxicate my entire being and remove the spirit of consciousness from all my limbs and members. Then shall the tongue speak through the heat of Thy love's motion and describe Thee as Thou dost manifest through the appearances of Thy grace and the emergences of Thy favors. Yet I know, O my God, that none can ascend into this atmosphere and no soul can rise into this cloud save through love of Thy loved ones and friendship with Thy chosen ones. For their love is identical with Thy love in the worlds of Command and Creation. Therefore I beseech Thee, O my Beloved, to give me to drink from the pure water of this cup from whose depths shineth forth the star of Thy love and wherein Thou hast manifested Thyself through the lights of the Sun of Thy Glory - a cup which hath two most exalted names in the heaven of names and one name before Thy Most Great and Most Exalted Throne.

Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having singled him out for Thy love, confirmed him in Thy service, made him manifest in Thy days, and caused him to be among those who have attained and succeeded in reaching the city of Thy nearness and the sanctuary of Thy reunion and presence. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Beautiful.

Thou hast sent unto this evanescent servant that which perfumeth the hand of him who receiveth it, illumineth the eye of him who beholdeth it, gladdeneth the heart of him who learneth what is therein, enricheth him who possesseth it, and preserveth him who treasureth it - for it was sent through the love of God, the Mighty, the Wise, and containeth the gems of remembrance and praise of the Beloved of all worlds.

The letter of that honored one, which was purified from allusions and indications, reached this evanescent servant. All the elements attained, through what was ordained for them, to the wondrous remembrances that were revealed in praise of the Chosen Beauty and to the spirit of communion with the Lord of Names and Attributes. God willing, may this eternal spring water ever flow and descend from the fountain of the spiritual heart, that the dead lands of the hearts and souls of the servants may attain, through these sweet and subtle waters, unto a wondrous new life and become the place for the appearance of the plants of faith and knowledge. This is not difficult for God. The exalted branches of the divine Tree remember that honored one with wondrous praise. Glory, holiness and splendor be upon you.

In His Name, the Answerer

O 'Ali, upon thee be My glory! The letter which his honor Samandar, upon him be My glory, wrote to you was presented before the Face. Praise be to God that he is engaged in service to the Cause and adorned with the ornament of steadfastness. Blessed is he and those who have drunk the Kawthar of steadfastness from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Strong, the Mighty. His sighs in divine love were witnessed and his words of longing and yearning were heard. His is to praise God throughout the dominion of earth and heaven. From the phrase "He is the Helper in all conditions" a most sweet fragrance was diffused, and this word from the realms that have no beginning supported him according to its meaning, until it manifestly appeared in this season which is the spring of all seasons and in this century which is the beginning of centuries, flowing from his tongue and pen and heart. Its beginning was from the confirmation of the Truth, glorified be His majesty - there is no doubt that its end too shall return to the Truth. This opening to his letters is blessed and auspicious, and assuredly its effect has appeared and will appear. That which he wrote that "until now I have not consented to its change" - the Truth too does not consent. Say: Be steadfast in the Cause, detached from all beings and all names. We make mention of Muhammad-i-Qabli-?adiq, upon him be the glory of God, and give him glad tidings of My remembrance of him and My turning toward him from this mighty, exalted station. And We send greetings from this station upon him and upon those whom God has related to His servant - verily He is the Compassionate, the Generous. And We make mention of him who was named 'Abdu'l-Husayn and 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar and he who was named Javad, that they may rejoice in God's favor and mercy and remember God in His mighty, wondrous Day.

O friends! Arise with utmost steadfastness in the Cause of the Beloved of the worlds, in such wise that the entire world may testify to this most great station. The degrees of steadfastness, detachment, firmness and constancy become apparent only at the time when the clamor of the barking ones, the polytheists and the atheists is raised. God willing, drink at all times from the pure water of the Kawthar of the utterance of the Beloved of all possibility. Its intoxication is the cause of awareness and its taste is the taste of everlasting life. The Most Exalted Cup is before the faces of the people of creation. Blessed is he who drinks, and woe to the heedless! This is a Day when the denizens of heaven have turned toward the people of earth, for the earth has become the seat of the Most Great Throne. Blessed is he who has recognized this station and held fast to the favor of his Lord and clung to His luminous, flowing robe.

And concerning what was mentioned about the khans - God willing, may they be occupied with the remembrance of the Truth, glorified be His majesty, and hold fast to His favor in such wise that neither might and grandeur nor worldly means may prevent them from the Most Exalted Horizon. May they be confirmed in that which causes the fragrance of eternity to be inhaled. In truth, if anyone in this place of tribulation occupies himself with the mention of transient things and worthless ornaments and their accumulation, every person of insight would testify to his loss. If human aspiration is confined to these numbered days, such a one was not and is not worthy of mention. Beseech the Truth to confirm His loved ones in that which is lasting and eternal. Verily He has power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous.

And concerning what was written about the leaf who was the wife of him who ascended to God - We heard. Divine favor was and is with her. God willing, may she attain to what is befitting and be adorned with the ornament of steadfastness. We have made mention and continue to make mention of all those related to you and to his honor Samandar, upon him be My glory, both female and male, young and old. All are beneath the gaze of favor and the pavilions of grandeur. Beseech the Truth to assist all to preserve their stations. Verily He is the Guardian of the Cause in this world and the next, and the Powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His sovereignty that encompasses all who are in the heavens and the earth. The glory from Us be upon you and upon them and upon My loved ones and chosen ones who have aided My wondrous Cause.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power

O beloved of my heart! Although the beginning of every word, book and volume should be adorned with the mention of God, glorified be His majesty - and this evanescent one too, in most responses to the petitions of friends, has ventured to mention what befits this evanescent one, a mention created by and returning to me, and this is a previous word and good words are good, blessed is he who utters them - yet sometimes when consciousness and fairness are attained through God's grace, I feel shame and embarrassment to mention a Purpose of which I have no knowledge except to the known degree which He Himself has taught and made known. Glory be to Him, glory be to Him, there is no God but Him! Even if these mentions and praises are befitting for the chosen ones, that would still be good, nay very good - though even that is not certain. Now we must, with complete supplication, humility and submissiveness, beseech the unknowable King and ask that He perfect our imperfections, make spoken our unspoken words, and through His grace adorn our unperformed deeds with acceptance. He is the All-Knowing and He is the All-Powerful.

And then, in response to the telegram of the beloved His Holiness the Physician, upon him be the Glory of God, according to instructions a promise of reply was made. And since some time ago this servant submitted and sent a detailed letter to him, therefore this time he did not venture. According to instructions, that beloved one should write in response to his letter which he wrote to that beloved one: "O Physician! Upon thee be My peace and My loving-kindness! Thou hast ever been and art remembered in the presence of this Wronged One. We beseech God to aid thee in all conditions in such wise that the world may testify to thy standing firm in service to the Cause. We also beseech Him to make the heedless ones aware through the fire of love and keep them enkindled. As for what thou didst report regarding the house outside the sanctuary, We have held back since this Wronged One had no funds to transfer, and We did not wish to afflict thee with new troubles. The tribulation of the house that has occurred is sufficient for thee. In any case, We beseech God that means may be provided in joy and fragrance that will bring ease and comfort. May God, glorified be His majesty, grant fairness to the heedless souls. They sell our property back to us. By the life of God, they have been and are usurpers though they perceive it not! It seems they have taken God's law as a plaything. With properties that were outwardly and inwardly associated with and belonged to this place, they have done what is outside justice, fairness, religious and customary law. The people of Iraq would testify to this, were they to speak with truth and justice. Peace and praise be upon thee and upon those with thee." End.

Indeed, by what religious law do heedless souls sell property to its owner, while authoritative deeds bearing the seals of that land's clergy are in hand? In any case, that permission was withheld now due to lack of funds there and other reasons. That beloved one should write the details of what you have done so far and what you intend to do, and how much has reached them so far, how much has been spent on repairs. They said that now, given the lack of apparent means, one must be content with less, as we do not wish to impose upon anyone. We beseech God to manifest that which will cause the exaltation of His Word. Verily, He has power over all things. End.

I convey greetings to all the friends and loved ones of that land, and I seek divine confirmation for each one. Peace, remembrance and glory be upon them and upon those with them, and upon the people of unity who have attained to the recognition that there is no God but Him.

HE IS GOD, EXALTED BE HIS STATION, THE GLORY AND THE POWER

O Nabil, son of Nabil! Sorrows from every direction have encompassed the Wronged One. This sorrow is not due to the imprisonment of the friends or the tribulations of the chosen ones, for through His love every prison is the Most Exalted Paradise and every affliction is choice honey. Rather, it is due to the heedlessness that has seized all. It is observed that they have forsaken the Water of Life and turned to and continue to turn toward the mirage. The various ephemeral colors of the world have so seized them that they remain heedless of that which benefits them and cling to that which harms them. Soon they shall see the fruits of what they have planted and the recompense of what they have wrought. They are so bereft of knowledge and insight - nay, even of outward perception - that though they witness the flames of tyranny and oppression, they remain heedless and deprived of awareness.

It is the custom of one of the kings that if any of the helpless princes who have spent years serving him in loss should pass away, the king inherits the wealth that was amassed through tyranny and oppression, considering himself the heir to all. Even as in these days he has seized the wealth of one of the princes, and likewise in Shiraz, after the ascension of the Mushir of that land who had served for years, as had his fathers and forebears, all his possessions were confiscated. Nevertheless, other princes continue in service and seek favor through a thousand tricks and stratagems.

Do they not see or do they not hear?

Take heed, O you whose hair has turned black in place of taking heed

Take heed, O you whose hair has turned white upon your cheeks

Some people exert the utmost effort to amass something through lawful or unlawful means to leave for their heirs, unaware that both possessions and heirs shall pass away. No name endures on earth except that which is connected to the Truth. Now let any person of understanding reflect: to attain one word from the Truth is better than all the treasures of the world, for it endures eternally in the dominion of earth and heaven.

In brief, people are attracted to their own kind and occupied with the desires of self, save whom God willeth. We beseech God not to deprive His loved ones of the ocean of vision nor prevent them from the dawning-lights of the sun of knowledge. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.

Praise be to God, from the beginning you have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon. The prevention of preventers, the might of aggressors, the power of the strong, and the authority of princes did not hold you back from turning toward Him. You have ever been engaged in serving the Truth, to which every discerning person bears witness.

His Eminence Ism-i-Jud, upon him be peace, sent your letter to this Servant. After perusing and hearing it, this Tablet was sent that you might rejoice thereby and be among the thankful ones. Mention was made of the Land of Khidra. Some time ago numerous Tablets were sent to that region - it was truly a comprehensive and decisive Book. Likewise, Tablets have been sent twice thus far to Ishqabad. Verily, He remembers His loved ones in the nights and days.

Through the movement of the Most Exalted Pen all things are stirred and in motion, yet most of the servants are observed to be heavier than mountains. Ask God to make souls aware and not deprive them of His grace. Write to the Land of Khidra and inform them of what was sent. In all conditions you should be joyful, for the glances of grace have been and are with you. Therefore thank your Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for you the good of the hereafter and of this world.

Convey My greetings to His Eminence Ghulam-Qabli-Husayn. He is among those who attained the presence, won victory, drank, and gave thanks to his Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. Now that it is the beginning of noon on the Day of the Feast of Sacrifice, this Wronged One is occupied with your mention. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds.

O Nabil, son of Nabil, upon whom be the peace of God! He is God, exalted be His glory in wisdom and utterance.

O Nabil, upon thee be My peace! Thou hast ever been and art still remembered. There hath befallen thee what hath befallen the Wronged One. Verily, He is the All-Patient and hath commanded all to exercise beautiful patience. No matter remaineth hidden - all is manifest and evident before God. He knoweth the treachery of eyes and what the breasts conceal, and He is cognizant of all things. Grieve not over anything. Place thy trust in God and commit all affairs unto Him. Verily He is with whomsoever desireth Him, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful.

Such as thyself must needs be patient and forbearing. By My life! There hath befallen Us in this land that which hath caused sighs to ascend and tears to fall. We forbade all the people of Iran from coming to this region. Thou and the fair-minded and just ones bear witness to this. Nevertheless, without permission, a certain person arrived with one of the handmaidens. We banished him at that time. He returned and dwelt for a period in the surrounding areas, and for some time now hath entered this city. Each day he disputeth with one of the friends of God, engaging in conflict, cursing and reviling. And from some others too there hath appeared, without permission, that which caused the eye to weep and the heart to lament.

This Wronged One is afflicted in the midst of heedless souls. No outward power exists. They do what they wish and say what they desire, while this Wronged One hath in all conditions chosen silence and solitude. We beseech God not to deprive His servants of the adornment of spiritual virtues and goodly deeds. He is the Lord of bounty and the King Who doeth as He willeth.

Thou too must choose patience in such matters. Forbearance and tolerance are necessary. No harm shall come to thee from conflict and dispute, from vain imaginings and suspicions, from backbiting and taunts. We and thou have accepted afflictions and tribulations in the path of the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven. All things have testified and do testify to what hath been mentioned. We beseech God to bestow justice upon all and not to deprive them of the lights of the Day-Star of equity. The people need education. The blessed word "Remind them" is a truthful witness. Be not grieved. What hath been mentioned is the truth wherein there is no doubt. Every hardship in God's path is the sovereign of ease, and every trial is the essence of comfort.

We beseech God to assist thee in that which causeth the remembrance and awakening of the heedless and the negligent. The Name of Munificence, upon whom be My peace, sent Me thy letter. All of it was read in the presence of My face. As what befell thee was for the sake of God, there is no harm in it. It is most evident and known that thou didst turn to that city purely to serve the Cause and the friends. No fair-minded one hath denied or will deny this matter. Blessed art thou for having fulfilled thy covenant and pledge.

We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist thee through the invisible and visible means and to confirm thee in that which He loveth and which pleaseth Him. Verily, He is the Lord of creation and the Lord of the last and the first. We made mention of each of the souls mentioned. After perusing this, thou shouldst send it on. We beseech God to assist all to act according to what He hath revealed in His mighty Book.

Prayers and peace be upon Him through Whom prophethood and messengership were ended and the breezes of revelation were cut off, and upon His family and companions throughout the duration of the kingdom and the realm, and of might and power. And peace be upon thee and upon thy son and upon those with thee and upon those who act according to what they have been commanded by God, the Lord of the worlds.

If thou shouldst find a loved one or friend, convey the greetings of the Wronged One. We beseech God for success and confirmation for His servants. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful, and He is the Hearer, the Answerer.

The Dove sings upon a branch of the branches with melodies that no melody can resemble, were ye to hear - through one melody He guides the misguided to an extended path of glory, and through another melody He guides the believers to the heaven of holiness and then the lovers to the beauty of the Beloved, and through a melody all who are in the heavens and earth swoon away such that none remains in the kingdom possessed of limitation and consciousness, then calls out "To whom belongs the Kingdom?" and none answers Him, and He answers Himself by Himself "To God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Sovereign, the Single, the One, the All-Conquering, the Self-Subsisting." Thus does the Dove sing upon the melody of possibility according to a determined measure. By God! She has melody after melody and sings song after song, and were one of her melodies to appear as God has ordained for her, hearts would be convulsed and bodies would tremble and faces would be transformed. And thou, O handmaiden of God, then O my mother, rejoice within thyself and be glad in thine essence at what has been sent down to thee - an inscribed Book wherein are recorded the mysteries of knowledge and wisdom from the Pen through which appeared the decree of the K and the N. Then know that thy letter came before Us and We learned what was in it, and We ask God that He may enable thee in His Cause and draw thee near to His presence and grant thee the good of this world and the next and all that thou lovest and art pleased with, and verily He is the Generous, the Giving, the Forgiving. Beware, O handmaiden of God, grieve not over anything in this world and trust in all matters in God thy Lord, for in Him do the detached ones put their trust. Then know that We have arrived in the prison beyond seas and valleys and cities and lofty mountains, and for this We thank God and praise Him and glorify Him and mention Him and sanctify Him for what He has sent down upon Us of His firm decree and His determined ordainment, and We are patient through His might and power, and verily He will fulfill the rewards of those who were patient and trusted and were of those who return unto Him. And the Spirit and the Light and the Glory and the Splendor be upon thee and upon those who keep company with thee for the love of God, the Mighty, the Beloved.

O Ahmad, upon thee be the glory of God! He is the Compassionate Speaker, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. We arose this day and there were present before Us the images of My loved ones in Ishqabad. We have sent down for each one of them that whereby the cities of wisdom and utterance have been illumined, and the city of knowledge hath been adorned in this exalted station. This is the day wherein the City hath descended from the heaven of God's command, the Lord of the worlds. Give thou this glad tiding to those servants whom We sent aforetime and made them to be among the Messengers. O Ahmad! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to exalt thee through His Name amongst His servants and to aid thee in that which will cause His sovereign Word to be upraised among all created things. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. This Day is God's Day, and the Call is His Call, and the Remembrance is His Remembrance, and the Cause is His firm and mighty Cause. Blessed art thou inasmuch as thou hast turned and hearkened and attained unto that which was inscribed by the Pen of God in the Books of the Prophets. Thy mention hath gained admittance into Our presence, and We have sent down for thee that whereby all things have cried out and proclaimed: "All praise and glory belong unto God, the Lord of the heavens and earth!" Blessed are they who are enkindled this day with the fire of divine love. Say: O people! Hearken unto the Voice of the Wronged One and ponder the past ages and centuries. What was the cause and reason that in the days of their appearance each of the Manifestations of the Cause was afflicted with the torment of the enemies? What was the cause of the denial of the Seal of the Prophets - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - and what was the reason for the rejection and revilement of the Spirit (Christ)? Say: Reflect ye upon Moses and that which was visited upon Him by the idolaters. If the followers of the Qur'an would but ponder a single verse, they would find their way to the Straight Path and the Most Great Announcement. This is what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an through His words: "There came not unto them a Messenger but they did mock at him." All the Prophets were rejected by the peoples of past ages and centuries and were martyred through diverse afflictions and trials. O people of God! This Day is a blessed Day, for the Lord of Revelation hath appeared and is established upon the throne of utterance. Blessed is he that hath heard and seen, and woe unto the heedless and the deniers. We beseech God to aid that company and to make them foremost among the peoples of those regions. This is a mighty bounty which hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book. This affirmation shall not be erased by extinction nor shall it be altered. Rejoice, O My loved ones, at this most exalted Word which We have sent down from the heaven of the bounty of your Lord, the All-Wise, the All-Knowing. Today the world is ablaze and the atoms of all created things are proclaiming "The Lord is come!" Blessed are ye, O My loved ones in that gathering, and O My chosen ones there. God will soon manifest through His grace and mercy, which have preceded both earth and heaven, that which He hath purposed - a command from God, the Ancient of Days. The Most Great Glad-Tidings is that the mention of that gathering hath been made repeatedly before the Countenance. By the life of God! Its fragrance shall never be cut off from the world. He Who speaketh in every condition beareth witness unto this: Verily He is God, there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Powerful. O My loved ones! We desire to make mention of My Afnan who have attained unto My days and have quaffed the choice wine of reunion from the hand of My bounty. Blessed are they and blessed is he who loveth them. We beseech God to open before their faces the gates of grace and bounty. Verily He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His mighty and wondrous Word. Convey My greetings unto thy two brothers and remind them of My verses and give them the glad-tidings of My turning toward them and of that which hath been sent down for them from the Kingdom of Mine utterance, the Wondrous, the Glorious. Light and glory and praise and honor be upon thee and upon My loved ones there who were not kept back by the vicissitudes of the world nor by the affairs of the nations from drawing nigh unto the Most Great Ocean, from whose waves can be heard: "The gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of the Kingdom of Names hath come with manifest sovereignty."

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and the Might

Praise be to God Who has manifested that which was sanctified beyond the knowledge, recognition, comprehension and understanding of all things. He has ever been and will forever remain sanctified above all thoughts, even as He has always been. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. And His manifest blessings be upon Him Whom He created and sent forth to His creatures to guide them to the straight path, and upon His family and companions through whom His Cause was spread throughout the lands among the servants.

My spirit be a sacrifice for you. The blessed autograph of His Holiness addressed to the honored master, his eminence the Overseer, upon him be the peace of God, and dated the sixth of Rabi'u'l-Avval, truly renewed the existence of this ephemeral one, for it spoke of the well-being of that Beloved One. It brought spiritual joy and true gladness - to Him be praise, grace and bounty. Since the honored master, upon him be God's care and grace, was not present, this servant received it on his behalf and with his permission. Now on this 19th of Rabi'u'th-Thani this response is submitted.

Regarding what was written expressing joy and gladness at the acceptance by His Holiness the Branch of God, Aqa Mirza Diya'u'llah, may our spirits be sacrificed for him, of the book that was sent - praise be to God it arrived and was accepted and is being read. Even the Desired One, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, has perused it several times. Your reward is with God.

Another submission: His Holiness the Most Great Branch - may my spirit, being and essence be sacrificed for the dust of his footsteps - is not present these days, having departed for certain reasons. He graciously gave me a page to send to that beloved one. That page was sent, and similar verses to what that beloved one has should be corrected, and this page and other such pages that were sent should be destroyed.

At this point They gained presence in the Holy Court and said to write to Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin: "O Zayn! The Wronged One counsels His loved ones with that which will elevate their stations before God: pure fear of God, goodly deeds, trustworthiness, religious devotion, chastity, truthfulness, patience, steadfastness, deliberation and reflection, and acting according to what they have been commanded in the Book. We beseech God to assist them and aid them to act upon what the Pen of Counsel has proclaimed at all times. And We implore God, the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven, to draw them near to Him and grant them the good of this world and the next. Verily He is the Lord of the throne and earth. O Zayn! Upon you be the peace of God, His mercy and His care. Man must adorn himself with that which befits him and be embellished with conduct worthy of him. In the nights and days the Pen of Counsel has not ceased, and has revealed that which is the cause of the exaltation and elevation of souls and the comfort and tranquility of the people of the world. Ask ye of God that He may assist all and grant attentive ears. Verily He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer."

Furthermore, all those circumambulating send greetings, and this evanescent servant also extends greetings to each one. Peace be upon you and those with you, and the mercy of God and His blessings.

One more submission: Regarding what was written about travel from that land, one day these words were heard from the blessed tongue: "If the companions in Mosul, upon them be God's peace, were to gradually move toward Iran and Arab Iraq with perfect wisdom, it would be very good. Apart from these considerations, in these days this land has somewhat been affected by certain odors due to the intimations of some malicious ones."

The honored and respected mother of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-'Ali who has repeatedly migrated to God.

He is the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Glorious

Praise be to God Who has aided His chosen servants and His pure handmaidens to recognize the Dawning-Place of His Self and the Dayspring of His Revelation, and has made known to them and to them what draws them nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. And praise be to God Who has taught His loved ones the paths of guidance and directed them to the Path which hath appeared through His Most Glorious Name between earth and heaven. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the One sanctified from every similitude and utterance. Praise be to God Who hath manifested the River of Life amidst all created things and hath given them to drink from the hand of bounty as He desired, through His Name, the Most Merciful. Verily He is the One exalted above every mention and sanctified from every praise. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this at this moment, even as it bore witness in the beginning that hath no beginning.

And after praise to God, that honored and respected lady hath been adorned with the ornament of recognition in the days of the Most Merciful and hath testified to that which the Beloved hath testified. By the life of the Beloved, this is indeed an imperishable treasure, and this blessed deed God, exalted be His glory, preserveth in the treasuries of His protection, and its effect hath not vanished and shall never vanish. Verily He is the Generous, the All-Bountiful.

Although due to the abundance of revealed verses there hath not been and is not opportunity to express matters, yet purely for the sake of God I trouble to convey greetings to the loved ones of that land, namely those souls who are detached from all else save God and who in all conditions gaze toward the supreme horizon. I beseech God that He may strengthen those sanctified souls who have quaffed from the Most Glorious Wine, that they may arise with utmost endeavor to serve the Cause - that is, that they may engage in teaching the Cause of the Most Merciful with perfect wisdom and utterance.

O friends! Strive that the fruits of humanity may appear from the tree of existence. By the Ancient Beauty, if accepted souls had acted according to divine counsels, most of humanity would now partake of the ocean of knowledge. God willing, through divine grace there is hope that all the loved ones may drink from the Kawthar of certitude and quaff from the Salsabil of assurance, and strive to draw those of doubt and uncertainty to the holy and most holy station, that the breast of the world may be sanctified from the whisperings of satanic souls and turn toward the realm of oneness. All the atoms of creation have testified and do testify to the transience of the world and its transformation and change. Blessed is the eye that seeth and readeth the word "transient" from the tablet of all things, that it may entirely pass beyond all else save God and hold fast and cling and adhere to the court of the One Friend. I beseech Him, exalted is He, to aid all to what He loveth and approveth, and to make His loved ones like mountains in this Cause whereby the greatest terror hath appeared and earthquakes have seized all the tribes of the earth. Verily He is the Powerful, the Most High, the Bestower, the Generous. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

And further, the sent handkerchiefs which numbered 9 according to their letters ha and dal arrived and were accepted in the Most Holy Court. Several were distributed in His presence and bestowed upon those circling round, and several others were designated specifically for the blessed Person and the holy Branches - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps. Rejoice thou at this and be of the thankful ones. How excellent is the reward of the workers, men and women! In truth the souls of that land have endured much hardship. Each year their handiwork hath been witnessed in the Most Great Prison before the Throne. I beseech Him, exalted is He, to ordain for them, men and women, that which will gladden hearts and bring joy to eyes.

Beirut. The Most Great Afnan, upon him be all glory. 21 Dhi'l-Hijjih 1301.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and the Power.

Praise be to the All-Praised One and the All-Desired One Who created Muhammad, peace be upon Him, through the sovereignty of might and power, and sent Him with the truth, and dispatched Him unto the servants with manifest signs and clear evidences, before which, when they were revealed, the realities of all created things and the most exalted essences of all contingent beings bowed down in submission. He is verily the Straight Path Who gave tidings of the Great News. Through Him did God transform polytheism into unity, until the light of faith encompassed most lands. And manifest blessings from the horizon of the heaven of utterance from the All-Merciful be upon Him and His family and His companions, through whom the darkness of vain imaginings was illumined by the light of certitude, and through whom the heaven rained and the earth brought forth vegetation, and the banners of guidance were raised amidst all creation. These are servants whom God hath described in His Books, both before and after, and through them hath He aided His Cause and empowered His loved ones. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent.

My spirit and my body be a sacrifice for your love and for your steadfastness. The servant hath attained unto the traces of your pen which calleth out in the world and among the nations that which draweth them nigh unto the horizon of the love of God, our Lord and your Lord, our Goal and your Goal, and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth. When I read and understood, I presented myself before His countenance, first presenting that which your honor had presented, then that which had been bestowed upon me through your favor. When this was completed, the Master - may our spirits be a sacrifice for Him - spoke and said: "O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My favor. We have heard thy call and found the fragrance of thy love and beheld the horizon of thy sincerity towards God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for you that which befitteth the heaven of His generosity and the ocean of His grace and the sun of His favor, and to inscribe for you from the Supreme Pen that which shall delight the eyes and vision, and to provide you with that which is better than the kingdom of the hereafter and of the former times. And We make mention of My other Afnan who have attained unto that which God hath revealed in the Book, and We remember the leaves of My divine Lote-Tree who have clung to the Tree and believed in God, the One, the Chosen One." Ever hath the mention of all been and still is before the Wronged One. Whatsoever hath come to pass hath been in accordance with wisdom, and the reward of every deed is recorded and preserved with God. Verily, He is with you, hearing and seeing, and He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

In truth, hardship hath befallen your honor and those with you, and the utmost favor hath also been made manifest, for in days when the light of justice was veiled and the horizon of equity was concealed behind clouds of oppression, and when outward polytheism was manifestly at its height of rebellion and the domains of the unitarians were besieged - in such times did your honor and the other companions attain unto the visitation of the House and that which was revealed in the Books of God. Praise be to God, the visitation and devotions and orientation and acceptance were all made manifest, and all attained unto these true spiritual bounties. This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth God that He may cause your honor to attain repeatedly and ordain whatsoever He hath willed. He conveyeth greetings to the two Najmis - upon them be the glory of God - and to the honored leaves - upon them be the glory of God - and expresseth his nothingness.

Another entreaty: At present, due to lack of time, the response to the letter of His Holiness Aqa Siyyid 'Ali - upon him be God's peace and favor - hath been delayed. I seek his pardon, for your honor knoweth that this ephemeral one is occupied day and night. Should any service be neglected, he seeketh forgiveness. I convey greetings to the beloved Haji Siyyid Javad - upon him be the glory of God - and to the beloved of the heart, Aqa Muhammad Mustafa, if he is present, and Aqa Mirza Mustafa - upon them both be the glory of God - and to the other friends, and I beseech confirmation for all. Verily, He is the Answerer, the All-Bountiful, and praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O Mulla Muhammad! He is God, the Glorious, the Most Glorious!

Hearken unto what the Tongue of God inspires thee from His holy, mighty and impregnable dominion, that thou mayest hear the call of thy Lord, rend asunder the veils, and emerge from behind the veil of concealment through My Name, the Mighty, the Inaccessible, the Impregnable. Perchance thou mayest become among men as the sun by which all created things are illumined, or as a tree which bears fruit at all times, or as an angel crying out between the heavens and the earth: "This is indeed the Ancient Beauty Who hath appeared once again in the mantle of grandeur, yet the people of understanding have opposed Him, as have these polytheists who have openly denied God and turned away from His verses after they were sent down in truth." Thus doth it descend even now from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed.

Say: By God! The clouds of bounty have been raised up and the rain clouds of grace have appeared, showering forth at every moment clear verses that bewilder the minds of the monotheists. Say: By God! Were but a single letter thereof cast upon the graves of all created things, they would surely emerge from their tombs, humble before God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Impregnable. And were another letter thereof cast, they would return to what they were. Thus have We made the Word to be the Sword of God, distinguishing thereby between the monotheists and the polytheists. Those who are brought to life by the Word of God - these are the companions of eternity who soar in the atmosphere of the spirit on wings of detachment, and upon whom shower blessings the angels of the divine Command, then those who dwell in the precincts of the Divine Essence, then those within the veil of the Kingdom, then those in the atmosphere of the Realm of Might, then those in the earthly realm, if ye be of those who know.

As for those who flee from the Word of God, depart from its shadow, and die to the holy melodies - these are like unto ashes, if ye be of those who witness. Even as ashes are not moved by anything, these are not moved by the Word of God and its forms, nor by the divine fragrances and glory. Thus do We impart unto thee the mysteries of what was, that thou mayest be of those who know.

O My Name! Leave behind the veils of earth and the coverings of sovereignty, then arise from the dawning-place of the divine names through My Name, the Self-Sufficient, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Convey the Cause of thy Lord to the East and to the West. Tarry not therein, and be not of those who linger. Be as a flame of fire or a pillar of light, such that if thou appearest from one direction, thy radiance is manifest from another. Thus doth the Pen of Holiness command thee from the presence of One Mighty, Wise.

When We desired to withdraw Ourself from among these people, We sent down unto thee that which would render thee detached from all the worlds. We have sufficed with these verses, that thou mayest be mindful within thyself and remind the people of days the like of which the eyes of the lords have never seen, how much less the eyes of the veiled ones. We had indeed sent down unto thee aforetime a Tablet wherein was treasured in each letter a fragrance which, were it to waft over all created things, would cause them to arise from the dust of heedlessness and turn with their faces toward the countenance of God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. However, We did not send it unto thee until its time should come, for all matters are dependent upon the signature that returns to the Decree that returns to Destiny that returns to the Will that returns to the Primal Will which creates by My command, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Most Exalted, the Powerful, the Impregnable.

Thus have We given thee glad tidings thereof, that thou mayest be gladdened within thyself until it is revealed unto thee with the sovereignty of letters and words. This is indeed My bounty unto thee and unto all the worlds. As for those whose names thou didst mention in thy letter, convey unto them from Us greetings and mercy and salutations and loving-kindness and glorification and spirit and sweet fragrance, that they may rejoice within themselves and be of those who return unto God, unto Whom all matters return on the Day whereon the feet of the sincere shall slip. Say: By God! The Day hath appeared in truth in the temple of the Youth. Blessed be God, the Most Wondrous of the wondrous ones, the Manifestor of the treasuries of the unseen as He pleaseth. He is, in truth, the Single One, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Generous.

He is the Glorious, the Most Glorious

O thou Name of God! Hearken unto the sweet melodies of the Spirit, and take no heed of them who have disbelieved in God and His Verses, and who have turned against His Cause. Follow thou the Faith of the Spirit in the love of thy Lord: this is the root of religion, though none shall know it save all that are well-assured and discern aright. Say: O people! The veils of idle fancy have been torn away; the heaven of impiety hath been cleft asunder; and God hath come down upon the cloud of holiness, surrounded by a host of angels. Thereupon all things were changed; every soul was shaken; and every proud and lofty peak was reduced in dust. Remain thou steadfast in the Cause through the power of God and His might; and assume thou in this state a seat of conspicuous glory. Assist then the Cause to the extent that thou art able, for the people of the Bayan would fain return the Cause unto the abyss where they themselves are fallen. Lay hold upon the reins of the Cause lest the fingers of impiety profane it: this is that which hath been destined for thee in His glorious and preserved Tablets. We have decreed that every soul should write touching this Cause that whereby the feet of them who are endued with understanding shall be confirmed in an exalted honour. O Khalil! Shatter thou the idols of imagination through the power of thy Lord; then lead out the people from the darkness of passion, and usher them into an abode of safety beneath the shadow of the Divine Lote Tree that hath sprung up in truth from beside a mighty throne. Beware lest aught distract thee; do thou of thine own accord draw nigh unto God, Who created thee, fashioned thee, and appointed thee to be a glorious remembrance unto His servants. Shouldst thou wish to learn what hath touched the Beauty of an Effulgent Glory, know that He hath fallen into the well of envy: here is His raiment, bespattered with His blood, which we have sent unto thee that thou mayest have clear proof of Our claim. Thus have we inspired thee, and revealed unto thee what befell the Manifestation of the Self of God at the hands of His servants who, though created by a mere indication of His purpose, as articulated by His pen, dealt frowardly towards their Lord. Be thou the Word of God, and the Sword of His Command among His servants, that through thee He may distinguish between those who believed in God and His Verses, and those who disbelieved and rebelled against the Cause. Take heed that thou aid thy Lord at all times, and approach not those from whom thou inhalest the odour of animosity towards this Youth, Who hath shone forth above the Dawning-place of Eternity with manifest dominion. Say: O people! If ye believed in 'Ali because of the revelation to Him of the Bayan; and before Him in Muhammad because of the revelation to Him of the Furqan; and again in the One Who conversed with God (Moses) because of the revelation to Him of the Torah, then by the righteousness of God these are their selfsame Verses, which, in this peerless form, have been sent down from the throne on high. These apart, the whole earth hath been filled with the evidences of a sovereignty that hath encompassed all the worlds. Be ye then abashed, O people, before God, Who created you by His command; and repent ye for having failed in your duty towards Him - a duty that is owed here, did ye but know it. Say: Blind are the eyes that will not turn towards His court; and mute is the tongue that will not celebrate the wonders of His praise; and deaf are the ears that will not hearken unto the sweet melodies of the Spirit uttered by this tongue, which proclaimeth in all things: "I, in very truth, am God: no God is there but Him; His knowledge, truly, embraceth all things." Say: O people! Cast away that which ye possess. Take hold, then, of the Tablet of God with a power born of Him, and inhale its savour: should ye discover therefrom the fragrance of the All-Merciful, guard it from the blight of demons. Then assist Him so far as lieth in your power: He, verily, assisteth His loved ones as He pleaseth; and verily His assistance is nigh unto the believers. Beware that ye dispute not with God; nor contend with the One Who is His own Self; nor repudiate that whereby your names shall be exalted, and the truth of your own religion hath been established. Fear God, and be not distant from the shore of nearness. The Spirit be upon thee, and upon all who follow thy Lord's command at even and at morn. It is complete: revealed a second time from the Abha Kingdom by Our Name Ha'.

O Dawning Place that hath shone forth from the lights of the morn of oneness and that telleth of the radiance of the horizon of eternity! I bear witness that I have read and understood what the dove of thy love warbled upon the twigs of the Sadrih of thy heart, and have perceived and reckoned what the bird of thy longing stirred upon the branches of the tree of thy inner heart. I have heard its melodies of nearness and its songs of reunion. Well is it with thee, O Essence of the Cloud of Unknowing, in that thou hast been patient in the Cause of God and hast fulfilled thy covenant, and hast not been heedless of the remembrance of thy Lord in the hidden recesses of thy mystery and the pavilions of thy spirit. There hath befallen thee in the paths of thy Lord such tribulation and hardship as none knoweth save God alone. Yet with all this thou hast remained patient, content and well-pleased, to such extent that thou hast sacrificed thy self, thy spirit and thy body when thou didst detach thyself from all who are in the heavens and the earth, and didst journey for the sake of God and migrate with His servant and she who was treasured in the essences of the spirit of the Cloud and concealed in the heart of Baha. Thou hast striven in the path of God until thou didst arrive in the Holy Land, the right hand of the Spirit, the Valley of Grandeur, the spot of Sinai, Paran of Light, Horeb of the Manifestation, and didst hear the call of the Almighty from a branch of the fire, that He is God, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Compelling. Thou didst attain at the time when the earth of the divine Essence was split asunder and the heaven of Oneness was cleft and the mountains of Eternality were crushed and the cords of knowledge were severed and the sun of the Cloud was darkened and the moon of glory was eclipsed and the spirits of the abstracted ones ceased to be and the sanctified souls fled away. Thou didst witness all this and perceive it all, yet thou didst not turn aside from God thy Lord in any matter nor forget Him in anything, as though thou hadst turned with all thy being to God and turned away entirely from all else, and relied upon God in thy beginning and end and in thy public and private affairs. Therefore praise God Who thus created thee and fashioned thee and made thee to be among the well-pleased ones. As for what thou hast complained of regarding My love for thee, know that thy love for Me is the essence of My love for thee, such that there is between them neither connection nor separation. Be certain and assured of this and doubt it not, and be not of the despairing ones. And as for what thou hast mentioned regarding the mention of what thou didst mention, pay no heed to it nor to those who claim it. For by God, I love all the servants who have believed in God and migrated in His path and striven in His Cause and ascended to the center of eternity in the pole of the Cloud until they entered the sanctuary of the divine Essence and the house of Oneness. By thy life, My longing for them and My yearning for them is like the longing of the spirit for the light and the taste of the unseen for manifestation - nay, even more than that. And likewise I have detached Myself from these who follow the desires of their souls and are not conscious in any matter, and whose only concern in this world is to put themselves before God's servants and to sit in the chief seats of gatherings and to boast and make claims about that which they neither know nor understand. Say: Woe unto you! By what proof have ye believed in God and by what aspect have ye turned away from Him and by what evidence have ye gathered against this Servant, who, if ye were to traverse the regions of the world from East to West, ye would never find a servant more humble before God and more lowly unto himself? Yet with all this ye were not ashamed before God and the Manifestations of His Cause, and ye did unto Him what ye did and brought upon Him what ye brought, and ye violated your covenant and broke your pledge and denied Him in Whom ye had believed and turned away from Him with Whom ye had migrated. Say unto them: Repent unto God and return from that wherein ye fell short, for the kingdom of the world and its pleasures are passing and have no permanence, while that which is with God endureth; and this is better for you, did ye but know.

In the Name of Him at Whose advent all are disturbed save His honored servants. In the Name of God, the Exalted, the Great. O thou remnant of My family! Hearken unto My call from the precincts of My throne, that the melodies of the All-Merciful may attract thee to a station raised above the understanding of the worlds. Blessed art thou, for the breezes of the Spirit have seized thee in His days, and thou didst attain the presence of the Beloved Who was martyred in My path and ascended to the pavilion of holiness, the spot concealed from the eyes of the idolaters. Verily, We were with thee in thy disturbance and tranquility, and We have effaced the disturbance and confirmed the tranquility in a Tablet preserved in the shelter of protection. We have accepted what befell thee of hardship and tribulation in the path of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, and We have quickened thee from the Kawthar that floweth from the right hand of the Throne, and given thee to drink from this Cup that was held in the hands of God. Drink yet another draught in the name of thy Lord, the Most Glorious, and fear not the concourse of creation. By God! Verily thy Lord protecteth thee as He protected thee in truth, and He is powerful over all things. Move thy tongue in My remembrance, then adorn thy heart with My love, then thy temple with the robe of distinction through this Name through which appeared the Kingdom of Names and the Dove of Eternity warbled upon the branches of the Tree that was planted by the hands of God. Purify thyself from the conditions of earth and all who dwell thereon, then ascend at all times to the heaven that was raised up in the name of God. Remind the people of this Most Great Remembrance. Beware lest anything prevent thee from this, for thou hast been numbered among the successful ones in the holy Tablets by the Pen of Command. Let not thyself be prevented from the lights of this Sun which hath shone forth from the horizon of eternity with lights that encompassed the worlds. Give thanks unto God that thou hast entered His party and attained the presence of the Beloved in days wherein the dwellers of earth and heaven were disturbed, and the hosts of revelation were sent down with banners visible to all the worlds. Blessed art thou and those who attained His presence and stood before Him and heard His melodies and sheltered beneath His shade and circled round about Him and drank from the Kawthar of His utterance and aided Him as they were able until they were martyred in His path and soared in the atmosphere which God had sanctified from every rejected idolater. O thou remnant of the family of God! By God! There hath befallen the Beloved what hath befallen no one, for He drank the cup of tribulation from both friends and enemies, and thou art aware of some of what befell Him from those who were around Him, but God forgave them inasmuch as they were martyred in His path and adorned them with the ornament of forgiveness, for He is indeed Kind, Forgiving. But there befell His loved one in those days what had not befallen Him or anyone before. By God! All things wept at this, and the dwellers of the cities of eternity lamented, and the eyes of grandeur and majesty wept, and the hearts of the Prophets and Messengers were disturbed in a Paradise that was created through My love, for the Beloved was afflicted before one who was known among the worlds by His name. Say: By God! He for Whose meeting the people of Paradise yearn, and by the dust of Whose door the Concourse on high seek blessing, and by a movement of Whose Pen all created things were brought into being, was afflicted before an idolater who was known among the company of polytheism as being among the monotheists. Therefore weep thou for Me, then cry out at My tribulation, then lament in thy soul for My suffering, and be not of those who show patience in the Cause of God and care not for what befalleth Me, remaining joyful in their seats. Thus have We informed thee and made mention of thee that thou mayest be apprised of what befell the Beloved and be numbered in the Tablets among those possessed of insight. And the Spirit and Glory be upon thee and upon those who have known God through God in this Manifestation whereby truth was distinguished from falsehood and the Ancient Beauty appeared with a sovereignty that was mighty in truth.

He is the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Inaccessible, the Most High

O servant! Thy letter hath come before Us, and We have understood its contents. God is indeed aware of what is in thy heart. Nothing escapeth His knowledge. He knoweth what is hidden from sight and concealed from minds, and He is independent of all worlds.

And now concerning thy reference to the existence of two Gods. Beware, beware, lest thou be led to join partners with the Lord, thy God. He is, and hath from everlasting been, one and alone, without peer or equal, eternal in the past, eternal in the future, detached from all things, ever-abiding, unchangeable, and self-subsisting. He hath assigned no associate unto Himself in His Kingdom, no counsellor to counsel Him, none to compare unto Him, none to rival His glory. To this every atom of the universe beareth witness, and beyond it the inmates of the realms on high, they that occupy the most exalted seats, and whose names are remembered before the Throne of Glory.

Bear thou witness in thine inmost heart unto this testimony which God hath Himself and for Himself pronounced, that there is none other God but Him, that all else besides Him have been created by His behest, have been fashioned by His leave, are subject to His law, are as a thing forgotten when compared to the glorious evidences of His oneness, and are as nothing when brought face to face with the mighty revelations of His unity.

He, in truth, hath, throughout eternity, been one in His Essence, one in His attributes, one in His works. Any and every comparison is applicable only to His creatures, and all conceptions of association are conceptions that belong solely to those that serve Him. Immeasurably exalted is His Essence above the descriptions of His creatures. He, alone, occupieth the Seat of transcendent majesty, of supreme and inaccessible glory. The birds of men's hearts, however high they soar, can never hope to attain the heights of His unknowable Essence. It is He Who hath called into being the whole of creation, Who hath caused every created thing to spring forth at His behest. Shall, then, the thing that was born by virtue of the word which His Pen hath revealed, and which the finger of His Will hath directed, be regarded as partner with Him, or an embodiment of His Self? Far be it from His glory that human pen or tongue should hint at His mystery, or that human heart conceive His Essence. All else besides Him stand poor and desolate at His door, all are powerless before the greatness of His might, all are but slaves in His Kingdom. He is rich enough to dispense with all creatures.

Know thou that all things are nurtured under the shadow of one of the names of thy Lord, and He hath created that name through His originating Will which He ordained within the essence of creation itself. Therefore, bear witness to His sovereignty and His power, then to His greatness and His might, then to His loftiness and His transcendence, that thou mayest become aware of that which hath been hidden from the eyes of the world.

Hold thou fast unto God, then detach thyself from all else besides Him, that He may give thee to drink of the wine of understanding from this cup which the fingers of the All-Merciful cause to circulate in this Paradise which hath been raised up, by God's leave, in the highest heaven. Purify thy heart from the defilement of those who believed and then denied the faith, and who are recorded with thy Lord as being among the opposers. Cast the world and all that hath been created therein behind thee, that God may open before thy heart's face the gates of knowledge and meaning, and raise thee to a station wherein thou shalt behold all who are in the heavens and on earth abiding under the shadow of one of thy Lord's names. Thus hath the Sun of Utterance shone forth from the horizon of speech from the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.

Verily, We have answered thee regarding what thou didst mention in thy letter because We loved thee. Otherwise, by Him Who is unique in majesty and glory, such tribulations have befallen Me as none can reckon save God, and thereby hath the Pen been prevented from remembrance, and this wrong hath been recorded as grievous in the Mother Book. By God! He who hath warred against My Self was indeed created by My Word, and those endowed with keen vision know this to be the truth wherein there is no doubt. But those who are seized by vain imaginings have taken him as their protector instead of Me. Leave thou the people to their selves and their desires, then make mention of thy Lord and fear no one. Place thy trust in God, and verily He will protect thee with manifest sovereignty. And the glory be upon thee and upon every illumined heart.

O Ali! Upon thee be the Most Holy, Most Glorious, Most Resplendent Baha! Hearken unto that which thy Lord, the Grief-Stricken, the Stranger, Who is encompassed by sorrows from every direction through those who have disbelieved in God when He came with His Great Name, revealeth unto thee. Take heed lest the mention of grief sadden thee. Verily, thy Lord is not saddened by aught of what hath been created in the heavens and the earths. By God! His station is one which the birds of the hearts of the doubters can never attain, nor the fragrances of the hearts of the mystics. Were We to manifest this station, thou wouldst be bewildered within thyself and wouldst say: "Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest." Thou wert hidden in the eternity of eternities and shalt remain treasured in the pavilions of Thy Cause. None knoweth Thee save Thine Own All-Knowing Self.

O Ali! Whenever We turn towards the stations of the earth and its conditions, We make mention of sorrows and the like thereof. Dost thou not witness how by the fragrances of My utterance all things have been stirred, and by the outpourings of My Pen every mouldering bone hath been quickened? Can grief prevent the Ocean of joy? Nay, by thy Lord, the Ever-Forgiving! Verily, He is the One Who dominateth over all who are in the heavens and on earth. We are radiant in the darkness and standing firm among those who sit still - those who, when it is said unto them "Arise!", they remain seated. They are indeed among the losers. Blessed art thou for having drawn nigh unto the station wherein the horizon of utterance hath shone forth with the mention of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

O Ali! Were We to make mention of tribulations, rest and tranquility would be cut off. Consider them as a mercy, for they have been sent down in the path of God, the Beloved of the worlds. Say: O people! The Tongue of Grandeur speaketh, yet ye hear not, and the Counsellor calleth you, yet ye understand not. The Herald cried out before Me, yet ye heard not and hear not. The verses have been sent down and the signs have appeared, yet ye know not. All things have testified to the Creator of heaven, yet ye are as dead. How long will ye look to yourselves? This is the Spirit of God - behold ye bear witness! We draw you near through the cords of grace, yet ye flee. Will that which ye cling to profit you? Nay, by the Self of God, the Dominant, the Self-Subsisting! Will your divines avail you this Day? Nay, by My life! Rather, they are the ignorant ones, did ye but know. How long will ye look with eyes that have been blinded by the ophthalmia of ignorance, were ye to be fair! Behold Me with Mine eye - thus have ye been commanded in a hidden Tablet.

Arise with supreme steadfastness in the Cause of the Lord of Names, then summon the concourse of creation to this praiseworthy station. Verily, those who hesitate this day are a people who shall not be helped. They cling to their vain imaginings as did the servants before them. They are indeed a blind people. Vain desire hath prevented them from My Most Glorious Name, and they hasten in the wilderness of error. When it is said unto them: "Come ye to the Dayspring of the Cause," they say: "Sufficient unto us is that which we possess." Thus spoke those before them. They call upon God, yet know Him not. They journey to the House from the furthermost lands, while the Object of their quest witnesseth that they are turned aside. They turn towards different directions, thinking themselves to be the triumphant ones.

Say: All directions have ended in My direction, and all paths in this manifest Path. Say: Fear God and take not your vain imaginings as lords besides God. Follow Him Who calleth you to the Mighty, the Loving. That which never appeared in creation hath appeared. Blessed is he who hath attained and hath said: "Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the seen and the unseen!" Those who have been given insight by God - they are the people of vision, and those besides them are deaf and blind, to which thy Lord, the Knower of the unseen, doth testify.

Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee and dispatched them to thee that thou mayest recite them at eventide and at dawn, and remember thy Lord Who hath come with the truth, whereby the horizons have been illumined. Convey My greetings unto My loved ones who have believed in God and been faithful to the Covenant, that they may arise to make mention of their Creator and aid Him with the swords of remembrance. The glory from before the All-Glorious be upon thee, O thou who gazeth toward God, and upon those whom the oppression of the enemies hath not prevented from drawing nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Bestower.

O Nabil! Your petitions have been presented and your call has been heard. Its answer depends on the time, for some are still present in this land. After their departure, God willing, judgment will be rendered according to what is required. Be not distressed. Be the embodiment of "announce glad tidings." Beware, beware lest you mention your Lord to anyone. O Nabil! Many times have We commanded, and again We say: In the wilderness of Syria, mention of the Lord of all names is not and has not been permissible, for its people are exceedingly remote from the shore of nearness and deprived of the choice wine of grace. Its land is supremely blessed, yet its people are supremely unfortunate, save whom thy Lord willeth. Should they, after countless counsels, desire to draw near, their approach would be and will be like the approach of a serpent. Shun them and be of the vigilant. All have been raised in corruption and nurtured in corruption. Likewise the strangers in these parts have never had and do not have any worth. Some souls, being cut off from all directions, will grasp at any rope that appears and cling to it. But this clinging has been and will be for the sake of passion - the effect of hellfire will become manifest from it. Although from Our first arrival in this land and entry into the Most Great Prison, this Servant has not uttered a word except what God has ordained, and we have ever spoken what is in the Holy Books, nevertheless you saw what they perpetrated and heard what they said. The human-like beings are more fearsome than these people, as if they were born of Satan. Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to all the loved ones and friends. Counsel all to guard their tongues. O Nabil! Drink secretly in this land the living waters in the name of the Lord of all possibility and the Beloved of the worlds from His hand of favors, and leave others to themselves. These people are occupied with their own evil and deprived of the glad tidings of God. Speaking of the Friend with a friend is beloved, not with those who devour flesh and chase after skin. Say: O friends! This Wronged One speaks only what contains your welfare. Pass not beyond His counsel and pursue not your own desires. These lands have become pregnant from the divine fragrance - how long until spiritual children are born from it? He is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. In brief, all the loved ones are commanded to silence and contemplation of divine favors, merciful manifestations and godly conditions, and are forbidden from aught else. O Nabil! All trials and afflictions have been borne so that all people might be adorned with spiritual qualities and heavenly attributes. Until the divine friends drink from this spiritual cup, they will not be able to give others to drink. They must first drink themselves, then give others to drink. Ever has God's purpose in sending Messengers, revealing Books, establishing firm laws and ordained religions been several things, among them the preservation of souls and their rights, and this depends on the appearance of the light of trustworthiness among people. Counsel the friends of God to conduct themselves among people with perfect trustworthiness, religiosity and what was mentioned before. Whoever is adorned with these qualities is attributed to Truth and reckoned of Truth; without them one has never been and will never be accepted. Therefore all must drink from the pure water of this cup and entirely close their eyes to the desires of self. Peace be upon him who has heard the call of the Wronged One and responded to what he was commanded. Again it is mentioned: Convey Our boundless greetings to the friends present in that land. Indeed glory be upon you all.

Port Said. To Aqa 'Ali-Muhammad. Upon him be \[Baha'u'llah\]. Sha'ban 1307.

He is God, exalted be His majesty, grandeur and power!

In these days the outpourings of divine grace and the effulgences of the light of the Luminary of the All-Merciful are manifest and evident from every direction. Every blind one bears witness to His favor and every weak one acknowledges His power. Yet some servants have taken the crooked path and proceed thereon, while others follow the straight way. All things shall perish save those rescued by the hand of God's will. Our purpose and the purpose of all who are in the heavens and earth is that which befits this Day: truthfulness, sincerity, justice and faithfulness. Blessed are they who have attained to these holy attributes and goodly deeds. They are detached from the world and all that is therein. Their words are for God and their deeds for His Cause and His love. The ornaments of the world and the colors of nations have not deprived them of the recognition of the Lord of ancient days. They hold fast to the firm cord and cling to the luminous hem. And prayers and peace be upon the Hands of His giving, the Dawning-places of His grace and the Rising-points of His mercy - they who acknowledged and confessed the oneness of God and the Seal of His Prophets, through whom appeared the path of justice and rained the clouds of bounty - and upon his family and companions whom neither commerce nor trade nor any matter prevented from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of might and bounty, the Possessor of the Standard and the Banner.

The letter of that honored friend arrived and as the fragrance of love wafted from it, joy was attained and gladness reached us. After its reading it was taken to the Most Exalted Station and presented before the countenance of the Lord. He said: "O 'Ali-Qabli-Muhammad, let not the counsels of the Wronged One which thou didst hear in His presence escape thy notice. Adorn thy temple with the ornament of detachment and thy head with the crown of the fear of God. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee and enable thee to perform deeds whereby thy station may be exalted among His servants. He desireth for His creation naught save drawing nigh unto Him and holding fast to that which will establish His traces in His kingdom."

We hope that the friends of God will be distinguished among the people and be adorned and illumined with His attributes. Should all attain to what hath been mentioned, each one would find himself seated upon the throne of glory and established upon the seat of detachment. This is the station of attachment to God and severance from all else beside Him. In all matters consult with His Holiness Afnan, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, and act according to what appeareth. This is Our counsel to thee. Say: "My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Dominant over all names, and by Thy sovereignty which hath encompassed all things, to open before my face the door of Thy bounties, favors and gifts. Verily Thou art the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Generous."

This servant beseecheth and imploreth God, exalted be His glory, that after hardship He may grant ease, and after difficulty, relief. Verily He is the One who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word "Be" and it is. I convey greetings to the friends in that land. Their mention hath ever been and still is made in the presence of the Prison. We beseech God to enable them to do what He loveth and approveth. The work and matter with which thou art charged by the Lord - may our spirits be sacrificed for Him - is this: that in all conditions thou shouldst have thine eye upon reform, and likewise that thou shouldst strive to win the good-pleasure of that honored gentleman, His Holiness Afnan - upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious. This matter is in truth like powerful wings for soaring in the atmosphere of love. Well is it with them that understand. According to instructions, regarding thy request several words were written to the honored friend Aqa Nuru'llah - upon him be \[Baha'u'llah\] - and sent. We hope that they will consider whatever is in the best interest of thy work. Verily God doth not suffer to be lost the reward of the doers of good. Peace be upon you and upon God's righteous servants.

The nightingale of separation, perched upon the branch

of the horizon, calls out in grief, you who are filled with yearning;

The bird of loyalty sings upon the tree of eternity

with the strains of this parting, you who are filled with yearning;

As does the dove of the two seas upon the twigs of the lote-tree of separation--

that the departure is imminent, you who are filled with yearning.

Say: the time of union has been fulfilled, and by virtue of the decree

that of absence has begun through this parting, you who are filled with yearning;

Tears have flowed from the eyes of the immortals in the concourse

on high because of this farewell, you who are filled with yearning;

The breezes of joy that blew from the paradise of splendor

have been stilled by this departure, you who are filled with yearning.

By God, the faces of the celestial maidens in their chambers

have paled at the prospect of this absence, you who are filled with yearning;

The houris rouge their cheeks blood red, for they have heard

about this leave-taking, you who are filled with yearning;

And will never adorn their bodies with the silks of eternity

after learning of this departure, you who are filled with yearning:

No sorrow shall ever compare to this grief in the realm of the unknowable essence, for the wind of separation is blowing, you who are filled with yearning!

In this time, when the bird of eternity has flown from the land of Iraq and the people of longing and yearning burn with the fire of separation, this letter is being sent by this ephemeral ant to the friends of God. Friends, weep for as long as you have eyes, and cry out for as long as your souls exist, for the carpet of union, joining, nearness and encounter has been rolled up. Instead, the sovereign of destiny has, by virtue of a preordained decree, spread out the quilt of parting, leave-taking, absence and departure. The gales of separation and regret have gusted with such force that they have clothed the branches of being, whether visible or invisible, with the cloak of nothingness, then repaired to the blustery autumn of eternity.

Then, eyes should weep, ears listen to the wailing, tongues moan and lament, and bodies tumble into the dust of their birth-places. Nevertheless, we praise God for having singled us out for these repeated misfortunes and unceasing afflictions, and give thanks to him at all times and in all circumstances. He is, in truth, witness to his own words. In all the past scriptures it is mentioned that a time will come, a season will arrive, that the bird of Persia shall sing an Arabian melody. Therefore, hasten to him, lovers of the celestial beauty, you who are distracted by the divine sanctum. Now, that time has arrived, that breeze has wafted, and that bird has flown, but you have not seen it nor attained to it, and have not accomplished the goal. Indeed, you have not advanced toward what was written, nor have you listened. Now that moment has passed, and that day has slipped out of your grasp. That breeze shall not blow again in this land, that rose shall not again flower here, and that door shall never again open. Have you never heard that the nightingale of the divine garden seeks repose and settles only in the spiritual rose bower; that the hoopoe of the Sheba of love only makes its home in the Sinai of the spirit; or that the hearts of lovers seek no visage save the beauty of the beloved?

Lovers, you have become immersed in thoughts of your own selves, and never set out for the lands of the beloved. What a marvelous heedlessness has overtaken contingent being and encompassed existence! The sun is radiant, brilliant and shining in the midst of the sky, but all are singing along with and have become intimates of the birds of night. I shall close with what the nightingale of separation sang in the land of Iraq, calling out to all who dwell beneath the horizon: The bird of immortality has flown to the city of the unknowable divine Cloud, and the dove of the spirit has taken flight from its branch and sought another perch. Then weep, lovers and people of the concourse on high.

Thus do we cast upon you the verses of parting, so that perhaps you will rise from the couches of heedlessness and join the ranks of the mindful. Say: Hypocrites, this nightingale of constancy has taken wing from the rose of union, has set out for the garden of separation, and has consumed all the lovers in the precincts of Iraq. Friends, do not forget the union of souls while you are in the affliction of separation. Lament this departure, but sow the seed of patience in the good earth of the heart, watering it with your tears, so that it will give forth sweet fruit. This is the counsel of the nightingale of the divine garden. Therefore, heed it.

He is the Mighty, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!

These are the verses of God which have been sent down in truth from the heaven of a glorious Name. Therein lies that which would sever the peoples of the world from all else beside them, were they to purify their holy ears from the croaking of the idolaters and hearken unto the Word of God which hath been detailed in truth and sent down from a holy and exalted heaven. O Kazim! Rejoice within thyself and in thine essence, inasmuch as the Pen of God hath moved in thy name. This is a bounty that cannot be equaled by aught that hath been created between earth and heaven, as doth testify the Tongue of truth that knoweth. We had previously sent thee an epistle in the Persian tongue and dispatched it unto thee upon the breezes of holiness - if thou be aware thereof. By God, the True One! Shouldst thou not hold thyself back from that which hath wafted upon thee from the direction of the Ancient One, it would, in less than a moment, cause thee to turn unto a seat of glorious love. The lights of the Spirit would shine upon thee and make thee abide in the eternity of thy Lord. Thus have We detailed the matter unto thee that thou mightest turn in thy innermost heart toward the direction of the Throne and draw nigh unto a praiseworthy shore. Close thine eyes to all who are in the heavens and on earth, then turn thy face toward the direction of the Cause and be possessed of luminous insight. Then remind the people of that which the Spirit hath cast into thy breast. Deprive not thyself of the breezes of the All-Merciful in these days wherein all are veiled by the veils of their own selves. Arise with divine arising between earth and heaven, then summon the people that they might remember within themselves and take unto the Lord of the Throne a path. Say: By God! Every path hath been cut off, every proof prevented, every learned one confounded, every mystic brought low, and every known name overturned. Beware, beware! Arise thou to the Cause with a steadfastness from Us and a sovereignty from Our presence. Fear no one and place thy trust in His own Self, the Truth. Verily, He will protect thee from every rejected enemy. Purify thyself through that which We have caused to rain upon thee from this heaven that hath been raised in this atmosphere, that it might sanctify thee from the mention of aught besides God and cause thee to ascend unto a heaven of wondrous remembrance. Thus have We sent down unto thee the Book and inspired thee with that which will make thee independent of all save thy Lord, shouldst thou act upon what is contained therein and be severed from all the worlds entirely. Know thou that We had previously commanded thee to divide what thou hast of the rights of God into three portions, then spend two-thirds upon thy kindred and upon the poor in that place, for We have heard the cry of those in distress and therefore have We commanded thee thus. Act thou according to what thou hast been commanded by One All-Wise, All-Knowing. Then inform the wealthy not to be heedless of Our poor servants, for they are God's trust among you. Say: Beware lest ye be unfaithful concerning them. Preserve them from the harm of poverty and desperation. Thus doth command you the Pen of might and blessing. If thou wouldst purify thyself from the veils of idle fancies, by God, the True One! this would be better in thy Lord's sight than spending the fullness of the heavens and earth in red gold. Thus have We detailed the matter unto thee in detail. What God desireth from His servants is their detachment from all save Him and their entry beneath the shadow of mercy that encompasseth all the worlds. He hath ever been independent of all else beside Him and self-sufficient above all things, and the kingdom of wealth is created by His word, if thou be aware thereof. Thus have We sent down unto thee the verses as a mercy from Our presence and a light from Our nearness, that the lights of the Face might take thee from the direction of a praiseworthy might. Then remind on Our behalf all who have believed in God and sought guidance through the guidance of the days, then taken shelter in the shadow of the Cause at the Ultimate Tree, the spot wherein the fire is kindled and shineth forth from the Chosen Lote-Tree and speaketh the truth with that wherewith the Spirit speaketh in a wondrous holy Lote-Tree. The Spirit, the glory and the splendor be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon those women who are in thy household and upon every young and old one.

O Afnan, Haji Mirza Muhammad, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God!

He is God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise

Praise befitteth the Lord of Names and the Sovereign Who doeth what He willeth, Who was not prevented by the tyranny of the aggressors nor the turning away of the deniers from His purpose. Through one exalted Word He guided the peoples of earth and heaven to the Straight Path and the Great Announcement. The hosts of the world and the ranks of nations did not hold Him back from His Will. How great the power and majesty that brought forth the precious gem of recognition from a handful of dust and exalted it above the heavens! The realm of understanding is bewildered by His operations and the denizens of the Kingdom of Utterance are without mention or name before them that are nigh unto His court. Glorified be His greatness, exalted be His might, and sanctified be His utterance! There is no God but Him.

Praise, glory, magnificence and light be upon the Tree and its branches, twigs and leaves, and upon them that hold fast and cling unto it - a magnificence whose fragrances shall never cease throughout the duration of the kingdom of earth and heaven, and whose effusions shall never end throughout the sovereignty of might and grandeur; a magnificence whereby they that are nigh unto God ascend to the heaven of nearness and reunion, and the sincere ones unto the Most High, the Self-Subsisting; a magnificence whereby the hearts of the Concourse on High are attracted and the dwellers of the Most Glorious Paradise are gladdened. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to draw His servants nigh unto the court of His presence and to give them to drink from the Kawthar of reunion from the hands of His bounty. Verily He is the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.

O My Afnan, O Muhammad! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. The days of thy presence, by night and day, in the court of the Wronged One are remembered. Mankind was created for the knowledge of God, yet all have remained heedless and veiled from Him. They have forsaken eternal glory and clung to the desires of self and passion, tyranny and wickedness. Soon shall they behold the recompense of their deeds in this vain life, for divine justice and heavenly wisdom will not forgo reward and punishment, and upon these two depend the order of the world and the tranquility of nations. Blessed are they that understand.

Praise be to God, the Afnan have attained to that which hath no peer or likeness. The Hand of Power delivered him and the Divine Will, through the assistance of means, caused him to reach the shore of the sea of reunion, until he stood before the Door and heard the call of God, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this most great favor. Praise thy Lord for this supreme bounty wherewith none among mankind hath been favored save whom God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, hath willed.

Today all must gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon, detached from all else, especially the Afnans of the Blessed Tree who were brought into being from nonexistence for the service of the Cause. Outward events and the oppression of tyrants diminish not their station, as attesteth the Most Great Book of God in its mighty and impregnable position.

Be not grieved at his ascension to the heaven of nearness and reunion. By My life! At this very moment We witness and hear from him mention of Me and of thee. Thus have We unveiled the matter as a grace from Us unto thee and unto My Afnan who was mentioned in My court of glory, who stood before My face and who spoke in praise of My Beautiful Name.

O Muhammad! Were the veil to be lifted, thou wouldst be so overjoyed that neither the taunts of the enemies nor the calumnies of the hateful ones would prevent thee from rejoicing or deprive thee of the most great gladness. The petitions thou didst send have all been answered and dispatched. We beseech God to give all to drink from the cup of His utterance, the Kawthar of His bounty. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Generous.

The light shining and gleaming from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon My Afnan and upon thee and upon whoso is with thee by night and day, and upon My Afnan there and upon My loved ones who have cast aside all else but Me and have taken what they were bidden by God, the Mighty, the Powerful.

In the Name of the Peerless Lord God

Praise that is sanctified above the comprehension of created things and the understanding of contingent beings befitteth the most luminous, most holy court of that Desired One Who created the entire world through a single word, and through its fragrance guided detached souls to the supreme horizon. He is the One with power Whom neither the opposition of the aggressive nor the objections of the heedless have prevented or will prevent from His purpose. He hath commanded all the peoples of the earth to observe what is right and forbidden what is wrong, that in all hearts the lamp of unity may be lit and all tongues may proclaim "We are God's." Blessed is the soul whom these fleeting two days have not deprived of eternal life, and whom transient conditions have not barred from the Dayspring of the light of oneness. This evanescent one testifieth that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been and will forever be sanctified above any peer or likeness, and exalted above all that is subject to decline. And I bear witness that He hath ever been one in His essence and attributes, hath been and will forever be as He hath always been. There is none other God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.

Thereafter, your letter dated the 28th of Safar was received, bringing glad tidings of that honored friend's well-being. God willing, may this herald not be barred from bearing glad tidings, and may this messenger not be deprived of the ultimate goal and highest purpose, which is the place where the light of truth is made manifest. This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth the Desired One of the world and the Beloved of the nations to assist you in that which shall endure in both the earthly and heavenly kingdoms. We are powerless before the manifestations of His might and weak before the expressions of His power. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid us in serving and obeying Him and to assist us in preserving what He hath graciously bestowed through His generosity and bounty. Verily, He is the Protector of whosoever turneth unto Him, holdeth fast to His cord, and cleaveth to His robe. There is none other God but Him, the All-Forgiving, the All-Generous.

Praise be to God that you have attained to that which is acceptable in God's sight. In truth, your letter was a cause of joy and gladness, for the fragrance of love wafted from it. Praise be to God in all conditions. Verily, He is the Desired One in both beginning and end.

As to what you wrote regarding the sum sent by Aqa Muhammad-Husayn, brother of him who circumambulated the House - upon them both be the glory of God - the aforementioned person (may God's loving-kindness and grace be upon him) sent word from the great city and wrote that after the bill's term expires it will be sent. Whatever reaches them, they will forward. The servant beseecheth God, exalted be He, to send down from the heaven of His bounty a blessing from His presence upon him and upon you and upon him whom He aided to discharge His rights. Verily, He is the Protector of those who act and are sincere.

Convey on behalf of this evanescent one greetings to Muhammad-Qabli-Husayn. God willing, may he ever be assisted in what is befitting and drink without pause or delay from the cup of recognition of the Beloved of all possibility. You mentioned Haji Muhammad-Rahim who intended the House and attained his desire. Praise be to God, he hath been and is in our thoughts, and his mention hath not been and will not be erased. Convey greetings on behalf of this evanescent one, and likewise to the friends - that is, those souls who with complete detachment drink of the Kawthar of the love of the All-Merciful. Deprived is the one who hath not attained the outpourings of the true Bestower of abundance and hath not arisen to make good what was lost. God willing, in this luminous dawn may all the peoples of the earth be awakened by this sweet spiritual breeze and attain to the ocean of awareness. Verily, He is the Lord of the mystics and the Desired One of all the worlds. Peace and mercy be upon you and upon God's assured servants. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.

In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord

The Holy Branch, His Honor Aqa Siyyid M, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God

Praise that is sanctified beyond tongues and pens and exalted above the comprehension and minds of all who dwell in the realm of possibility is befitting the most holy, most sacred court of that Divine Lote-Tree Who chose certain souls from the world and \[...\] Exalted is the favor of our Lord and great are His bestowals. This servant beareth witness to the greatness of this most exalted station and His grace which hath encompassed all who are in earth and heaven. We desire to testify with the tongues of all who dwell in the kingdom of creation that He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. He doeth what He desireth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Single One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

May my spirit be a sacrifice for your honor. For some time this evanescent servant has been deprived of mentioning the Afnan of the Divine Lote-Tree, as the volume of correspondence has reached such a point that truly finding time and opportunity is like finding the phoenix in all lands, or like finding patience in the hearts of lovers. In all conditions God is witness and testifier that you are remembered and present in heart and tongue. The purpose of submitting this brief petition is that several months ago you had sent a list of names of those who had paid some of the Rights of God. This was presented in the Most Holy Court and according to command I should send receipts for those funds, but due to the press of duties it slipped from view until this time when your letter to His Honor the Name of God M, upon him be the Glory of God the Most Glorious, was seen. This evanescent servant became mindful of what had transpired and therefore seeks pardon through this petition. Assuredly pardon has been and is beloved by your honor. And today when your letter was presented before the Throne, He commanded that receipts be sent to each of those souls so that all may rejoice and give thanks to God, exalted be His glory, for through the Afnan of the Tree their mention was made in the Most Great Prison and they attained to God's wondrous and exalted favors. They must rejoice and give thanks to Him Who mentioned them and aided them to turn unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

Therefore this evanescent servant wrote several pages and sent them to your honor so that the souls mentioned may know with clear certitude that God, exalted be His glory, hath accepted from them that which they sent.

Another submission is that previously it was written to that beloved one according to command regarding the two hundred tumans from Sabzivar, that it should \[be delivered\] to His Honor Mirza 'Abdu'llah-i-Nuri, upon him be the Glory of God, who resides in the Land of Ta, and they should deliver it according to the draft. Now according to your letter this sum was sent to Alexandria and from Alexandria this matter was also written about. Now if any of these mentioned funds from before or after remain with your honor, \[kindly\] send them with utmost haste to the aforementioned Mirza. This matter is most essential. His Honor the Name of God Mahdi was also commanded in His presence to write again to your honor. The Command is in God's hand, the Lord of the worlds and the Beloved of the mystics.

This servant is most ashamed that for some time no petition has been submitted to His Honor of the Two Most Exalted Names, His Honor Khalil and proclaimer of the mighty Cause, upon him be from all glory its most glorious, and likewise to the honored gentlemen, the Afnans - may my spirit be a sacrifice for their steadfastness - who are present in that land. However there has been and is complete trust in the mercies of the Afnan. The Glory that is manifest and shining from the horizon of the favors of the Lord of the worlds and the Beloved of the nations be upon you and upon those who love you and remember you and draw nigh unto you and hearken to your words concerning the Cause of God, the Exalted, the Great.

May the honored servant, Haji Muhammad Baqir, upon whom be God's peace and care, take note.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power!

Praise and glory befit the Goal of all the worlds Who, through the mighty hands of His manifest Law, established an impregnable fortress and, through the blessed words "in retaliation ye shall find life, O men of understanding," preserved the wealth, properties and lives of His servants. His Command is the water of life for creation and His decree is a manifest protection for His servants. Glorified be His grandeur, exalted His sovereignty, and magnificent His power! And blessings and peace be upon the ocean of His knowledge, the heaven of His bounty, and the sun of His grace, Who was named Muhammad in the most exalted Kingdom and the realm of creation, and upon His family and companions through whom the breeze wafted, the Word was uplifted, the sun of justice shone forth, and the river of equity overflowed - blessings whose fragrances never fade and whose effusions never alter.

And now, the letter of that honored servant arrived. Each of its intimations was a truthful witness and a harmonious messenger, for it brought glad tidings of health, love, affection and steadfastness. After its reading and review, it was taken to the Sacred Presence where it attained the honor of being heard. Praise be to God that they are recipients of grace and bounty. The glance of favor has been and continues to be directed towards His loved ones. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid him in His remembrance and praise, to reinforce him with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, to draw him near unto Him, to ordain for him that which will gladden his eyes and rejoice his heart, to give him to drink from the immortal fountain through the hands of His bounty, and to decree for him the good of this world and the next. Verily He is the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below.

The mercy, compassion and grace of God, exalted be His glory, have encompassed His servants. Through loving counsels and firm ordinances He has preserved them. Indeed, the laws and commandments of God are protectors and guardians for the preservation of the world and its peoples. Blessed is he who holds fast to the Book, and woe to every heedless and remote one.

As to his request that His Holiness the Name of God Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty, write whatever he deems advisable for that honored one - the command has been issued and, God willing, he will write. And concerning his mention of the departed and elevated Haji Ibrahim, upon him be God's mercy - after it was presented before the Lord, He spoke this most exalted word: "Praise be to God that that honored one has acted appropriately regarding the departed one and has held fast to what was befitting. We beseech God to write down the reward of your deed and make it a treasure with Him. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer. And we beseech Him, exalted be He, to forgive him who has ascended unto Him, to cause him to enter the most exalted Paradise, and to make him a companion of those near ones and the sincere ones. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful."

And regarding what was written about his legacy which, in truth, is not worthy of mention - in this matter one must act according to what God has decreed in the Book: first the payment of debts, and then distribution to the heirs. Praise be to God that one like that honored one has been present and has acted and continues to act accordingly. And concerning what was written about marriage - they should consult with the guardians. Whatever results from that consultation, there has been and is no objection to acting upon it.

This lowly one conveys greetings to the loved ones of that land. I send greetings to the comfort of my eyes, Aqa Ali-Rida, upon him be God's peace, and likewise to Aqa Muhammad-Taqi, upon him be God's peace. And I beseech God, exalted be His glory, on behalf of that honored one and them, that which is the cause of everlasting remembrance. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon God's righteous servants. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord

O Jinab-i-Aqa Ghulam-Husayn, upon him be 96 \[Baha\], from the land of Q

This evanescent servant was gladdened by the sight of your letter. God willing, may you ever remain speaking in remembrance of the eternal Goal and gazing toward His horizon. These are days when not a single atom among atoms has been deprived of the lights of the Sun of grace, and not a single drop among drops has been forbidden from the bounty of the divine ocean. Every soul who has turned toward Him has attained the outpourings of the Most Exalted Pen, and concerning every heedless one the blessed and excellent word "rend asunder his veils" has been revealed. His grace has encompassed all things. If all the pens in the world were to write forever describing a single one of His infinite bounties, they would never complete it. Who can reckon what has appeared and will appear from the Kingdom of God, the Lord of all worlds?

After perusing your letter, this evanescent servant sought permission to approach the Most Exalted Horizon. After permission was granted, it was presented before His presence. This is what the Tongue of the All-Merciful spoke in the Kingdom of Utterance:

In My Name, the Wronged One

O Ghulam-Husayn! We made mention of thee before, and I am the All-Seeing Witness. We sent down verses for thee, and I am the Ancient Sender. We manifested clear proofs to all who are in earth and heaven, and I am the Kind, the Generous. We immortalized thy remembrance in a Book revealed for him who was named the Nightingale, and I am the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Therein did We make mention of My loved ones who soared in My atmosphere and acted according to what was revealed in My Book, and I am the Manifest Book. Every name that turned to the Lord of all beings was inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen, and I am the Trustworthy, the Faithful. We counsel thee to patience and forbearance, and to trustworthiness which God hath made a crown for the heads of them that are nigh unto Him. Be thou of such character that thy very limbs shall testify for thee, and that the seal inscription "The Kingdom belongeth to God, Lord of all worlds" shall be seen upon thy brow. Dost thou perceive the fragrances of utterance? Dost thou hear the call of the All-Merciful? Say: Yea, this is through the grace of my Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. By My life! He that attaineth to true hearing ariseth to serve My Cause in such wise that neither the divines of this age who have become corrupt and have corrupted others, and who pronounced judgment against God when He came with a Cause before which all things that were and will be created stand powerless, can hinder him. We make mention in this station of My nightingale who warbled upon the branches of the tree of My knowledge, and whose song is heard from the atmosphere of My loving-kindness, and then of those who are with him, and I am the Rewarder, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We send Our greetings upon them from this station and We cast upon them the verses of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thus have We sent down the verses as a mercy from Us, that thou mayest be of the thankful ones. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.

Beloved is the soul who reads the divine verses and finds their sweetness. A bounty hath appeared the like of which hath never been seen in the world nor shall ever be seen. God willing, may we all be enabled to make up for what we have neglected in the divine days. O brother! Reflect upon His grace and with thy outer and inner tongue proclaim "Thine is the praise, O Beloved One." How can one who hath seen no light comprehend mention of it? How can one who hath not reached the water derive any portion from describing it or gain any awareness thereof? The point is that souls who are today heedless and veiled are seen to be deprived of all bounties. It is better that we conclude our mention of heedless souls with the blessed word "Leave them to their vain discourse and play" and turn to mention of the friends of God. On behalf of this evanescent servant convey greetings to all and say: God willing, reflect upon what hath been mentioned and what is being mentioned, and seek assistance from the oceans of grace and loving-kindness and generosity, that He may assist all to know that which causeth enkindlement and love and affection and unity. The glory be upon you and upon God's chosen ones and loved ones in those regions and upon those who have attained to this mighty Cause. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

Afnan Hasan, upon him be the Most Holy, Most Impregnable, Most Mighty, Most Exalted Glory of God! A remembrance unto him who hath attained unto the lights of divine knowledge in the days of his Lord, the All-Merciful, that the fragrance of remembrance may draw him to a station wherein he shall cast aside all sorrows and immerse himself in the ocean of life through this remembrance, before which the Spirit proclaimeth: "The Joy of the worlds is come!" He is a helper to him that hath no helper, and a son to him whose son was martyred in the love of God, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Great.

All atoms and all things in their entirety, and beyond them the Tongue of God, the King, the Transcendent, the Mighty, the Impregnable, bear witness that he who dieth in the love of God is assuredly among those who have been martyred in His path and was of those who have attained. Wouldst thou grieve after that which the Tongue of the Wronged One and the Most Exalted, the Self-Subsisting, hath spoken? Through this word the denizens of the highest Paradise rejoiced, and the Dove warbled upon the branches of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. Blessed is he whom God hath singled out for this bounty, whereby the faces of His chosen ones were illumined in the most exalted Paradise, and the sweet fragrance of loving-kindness wafted over the dwellers of the heavens and the earth.

From thy Lord's word have been planted the trees of hope in the hearts of all created things, and the sun of generosity hath shone upon all in existence from this horizon which hath been illumined by the countenance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful. By My life! Hadst thou been present before the Face and heard with thine own ears the verses of thy Lord, thou wouldst have forsaken the world and all that is therein, and wouldst have arisen amidst the peoples of all worlds, calling upon thy Lord, the All-Merciful: "I am content with Thy good-pleasure, O Thou the Beloved of the worlds, and I praise Thee for my son's martyrdom in the year wherein the Son of the Wronged One was martyred in the land of exile. Blessed are the two sons who have attained unto God's remembrance and His Word, and whose names have adorned the Tablet of Creation from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Wise."

Marvel not at the supreme loving-kindness of thy Lord, for He beholdeth that which none hath comprehended save His all-embracing Self, which encompasseth all created things. Were We to acquaint thee with the station of him who hath ascended unto God and his love for his Lord, thou wouldst assuredly arise to praise and remember him at all times. The Cause is in the grasp of thy Lord's power - He ordaineth what He pleaseth for whom He pleaseth, and bestoweth upon whom He willeth that which He desireth. He, verily, is the Ruler over what He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Praised.

Follow thou thy Lord. Neither afflictions nor sorrows have deterred Him from that which He was commanded in the path of God, the Lord of all religions. In the ocean of tribulation, He calleth those on land among the peoples of creation to this Cause, through which the horizon of certitude hath been illumined. When the rapture of the All-Merciful's utterance overtaketh thee and thou drinkest the choice wine of life from the hands of grace and bounty, arise and lift up thy hands unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds.

Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I have come unto Thee, detached from all else beside Thee, heedless of any other than Thee, turning unto the horizon of Thy grace, the Dayspring of Thy generosity, and the Source of Thy favors. I beseech Thee by the wrongs suffered by Him Who is the Manifestation of Thy Self, and by His exile in Thy lands, and His loneliness among Thy creatures, to make me one of those whom the might of Thine enemies hath not kept back from drawing nigh unto Thee, and whom the veils of Thy creatures and the coverings of Thy people have not prevented from beholding Thy face.

O Lord! Thou seest me standing before Thy gate, enkindled with the fire of Thy love, gazing toward the hidden gifts of Thy bounty, content with what Thou hast ordained for me in the tablets of Thy decree and the pages of Thy destiny. I beseech Thee by Thy Self to strengthen me in Thy love in such wise that I shall suffice myself with Thee as mine aid. O Lord! Turn unto him who hath turned unto Thee, then ordain for him what is best in Thy knowledge, for Thou knowest him better than he knoweth himself, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Grant me, O my God, the sweetness of that which hath proceeded from the mouth of Thy bounty and descended from the heaven of Thy grace. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me the outpourings of the heaven of Thy mercy and the rain-showers of the clouds of Thy tender care. I have committed my soul into Thy hands; turn it about as Thou pleasest with the fingers of Thy power. This is my request and my hope, O Thou Beloved of the hearts of them that know, and Thou Goal of the hearts of them that are nigh unto Thee.

Part 1: The beginning portion is already translated. Here is the translation of the remaining Persian/Arabic text:

In My Name, through which the Standard of Guidance hath been raised amongst all peoples

Glorified be God Who hath manifested His Cause and made all things speak that there is none other God but Him, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. The Wronged One testifieth to His oneness and His singleness. He hath ever been known through His Own Self, sovereign through His authority, and manifest through His signs. There is none other God but Him, the Single One, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed is the soul that hath cast away vain imaginings and idle fancies, and taken hold of that which hath been commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.

O Muhammad, We have heard thy call and have answered thee with a Tablet from whose horizon shineth the light of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of existence. When thou art illumined by the light of My utterance and holdest fast to the cord of My bounty, say: My God, my God! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, hoping for the wonders of Thy grace, and anticipating what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty which hath encompassed existence and by the light of Thy Cause which hath encompassed both the seen and the unseen, to make me speak Thy praise, to be steadfast in Thy love, and firm in Thy Cause and service. Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Loving. O my Lord! Deny me not the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty, nor the splendors of the Daystar of Thy Revelation. Thou art, verily, powerful over what Thou willest through Thy word "Be" and it is.

The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those whom God hath related unto thee. Remind them of My verses and give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and illumine them with the light of My grace which hath encompassed what was and what shall be.

O Moses! This is a day wherein the Interlocutor hath attained the lights of the Ancient One and hath quaffed the choice wine of reunion from the cup of the bounty of God, the Lord of the worlds. The gate of grace hath been opened and the standard of justice hath been raised up, inasmuch as the All-Bountiful hath come riding upon the clouds with manifest sovereignty. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen raised its call in remembrance of him who hath turned unto God, the Mighty, the Most Praised. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon thy kindred and those who are with thee in this Great News.

O Siyyid Abu'l-Qasim! Give thanks unto God that the Pen hath turned toward thee by command of My Most Great Name, and desireth to make mention of thee with a remembrance that shall endure throughout the eternity of My kingdom and My dominion. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of Names, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Lord of mankind, for having guided me unto Thy path and having revealed unto me that which draweth me nigh unto Thee. Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O Tongue of Grandeur! Make mention of him who hath been named Zaynu'l-'Abidin, that the utterance may draw him nigh unto God, the Single One, the All-Informed. This is a day wherein the rains have fallen, the rivers have flowed, the trees have yielded their fruits, and the righteous have cried out: "The kingdom and the dominion and the glory and the majesty belong unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment!" Blessed is the soul that hath arisen to serve My Cause and to speak My beauteous praise. Take hold of My Book with My might and cleave tenaciously to whatsoever commandment thy Lord, the Ordainer, the All-Wise, hath prescribed therein.

In the name of God, the Self-Sufficing, the Most High!

O my God! Every night I am consumed by the fire of separation from Thee, and every day I am gladdened by the wondrous tokens of Thy bounty. In the night-time I weep in my despair at being remote from the evidences of Thy triumph and Thy loving-kindness, and in the daytime I laugh with hope at the wondrous manifestations of Thy generosity and benevolence. Glorified art Thou, O my God! All days have passed, yet the tribulations of Thy chosen ones have not ceased; every matter hath ended, yet the afflictions of Thy trusted ones do not end. It is as though adversity hath become eternal through the eternity of Thy Being, and hardship abiding through the permanence of Thy Self, and enduring through the endurance of Thy Countenance, wherein all things in Thy dominion change save the tribulations of Thy loved ones, and all things in Thy realm are transient save the abasement of Thy chosen ones.

By Thy might, O my Beloved! Abasement hath reached its utmost degree, and there hath come from the ignorant that which cannot be recounted in words. O Thou unto Whom all grace and bounty lead, and verily Thou art the Lord of beauty and majesty! Dost Thou not, O my God, look upon Thy loved ones with glances of Thy tender mercy, and dost Thou not, O my Hope, turn toward Thy creatures with looks of Thy loving-kindness? Is there anyone besides Thee to whom they might flee? Is there any sovereign but Thee to whom they might turn? Nay, by Thy might! And I, being among Thy lovers, do testify before Thee now that they have desired none but Thee, have worshipped none but Thee, have known none but Thee, and have cut themselves off from all directions to turn to Thy face of oneness, and have abandoned all dwellings until they entered the precincts of Thy divine singleness.

How long, O my God, wilt Thou not send upon their hearts the breezes of Thy mercy, and not cause to waft over their souls the gentle winds of Thy grace and loving-kindness? Didst Thou not promise, O my Lord, to gather the detached ones in the shelter of Thy greatest mercy? And didst Thou not promise them a haven of security beneath the shadow of Thy Most Exalted Name? Then fulfill what Thou hast promised, and manifest all that Thou hast covenanted, for verily Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful and the Fulfiller of the needs of them that seek Thee.

Thou knowest, O my God and my Lord, that I complain not for myself, nor grieve for my own being, nor sorrow for my body, for on the day when Thou didst make Thyself known to me and made me drink the wine of Thy beauty, I sacrificed my spirit for Thy spirit, my being for Thy being, and my body for Thy body. Thou knowest what hath befallen me in Thy path and what hath touched me through the courses of Thy decree. By Thy might! I cannot mention it before Thee, nor can any of Thy loved ones bear to hear it. In all conditions I have been thankful for Thy bounty and content with Thy decree. Nay, I have been waiting for the swords of Thine enemies in Thy path and the arrows of Thy decree in Thy love. I have not preserved myself for even an hour, and I have been as a burning fire among Thy sinful servants, as a shining lamp before Thine enemies, and as the rising sun above the heads of the wretched ones.

Every day they conspire to banish me, and every night they gather to slay me, while I say: "O my God! Increase their unbelief and heedlessness, then their polytheism and wretchedness, that thereby my meeting with Thee may draw near, until I return unto Thee and appear before Thee, for this is my hope from Thee and my expectation in Thee." But O my God! When I witness the agitation of Thy loved ones and the distress of Thy creatures, I am saddened to a degree that cannot be counted in words nor completed by the pen in its task. Verily, if Thou wert to remove from them the veils of the Cause as Thou hast removed them from this Thy servant, they would not be agitated in the places of Thy trials nor confused in the courses of Thy decree. But Thou hast veiled it from them through Thy all-encompassing knowledge and revealed it to Thy perishing servant.

Therefore, I beseech Thee, O my Beloved, by Thy Most Exalted Manifestation, by Thy mirrors that reflect Him, by Thy Most Sublime and Eternal Mirror, and by the tongues that speak of Him, that Thou make us among those who arrive at the shore of Thy detachment, who descend into the city of Thy bounty, who drink from the cup of Thy beauty, and who rest upon the carpet of Thy majesty. For in Thy hand is the kingdom of all things, and verily Thou art the Mighty, the Single, the Most High, the Self-Subsisting.

O Ancient, Eternal, Most Holy One! Thy letter hath come before Our face and from it We have inhaled the fragrance of love and fellowship. Therefore hath this Most Great Tablet been revealed unto thee. It behooveth thee to render thanks unto Him Who caused thee to hear the cooing of the Dove and guided thee to this straight Path. Arise to assist the Cause of thy Lord with wisdom and utterance. He, verily, aideth whomsoever He willeth through the power of His behest, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful.

We beseech God to make thee a knight of inner meanings in this field and to number thee among those whom vain imaginings have not kept back from God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Take thou the chalice of eternity in the name of thy Lord, the Lord of all names, then drink therefrom and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who givest to drink unto those who have known Thee!

The divine fragrance hath been wafted, and the breeze hath blown, and there hath appeared from Zion that which was hidden, and from Jerusalem is heard the Voice of God, the One, the Incomparable, the All-Knowing. This is what was sent down aforetime from this wondrous Pen. Say: The Temple hath been built by the hands of the power of the Lord of all causes, and the All-Merciful hath been manifested from this resplendent Horizon. Say: Is that which hath been built by the hands of the All-Merciful better, or that which is built of clay? God calleth unto all else besides Him and giveth them glad tidings of this Cause which hath shone forth and gleamed from the horizon of the will of your Ancient Lord.

Know thou that when We adorned the Kingdom with the ornament of the name of thy Chosen Lord, the fish in the seas were struck with awe, the fruits fell from the trees, the denizens of the Kingdom of Might were bewildered, the tribes of the human realm lamented, the people of the cities of names were halted, and the pillars of all who are in earth and heaven were shaken, save whom thy Lord, the All-Wise, willed otherwise. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thy name hath been mentioned in the Kingdom of thy Lord, and there hath been sent down for thee that which shall cause thy remembrance to endure as long as God endureth. This is of His grace unto thee, wert thou of those who know.

The Spirit hath indeed come with the ornament of God, and every pillar of His pillars proclaimeth: "I am the Beloved of the worlds." When the promise came to pass and the veil was rent asunder by the finger of destiny, all who are in creation were terrified, and the fire of hatred was kindled in the hearts of the oppressors, and they committed that which caused the dwellers of Paradise to lament and the Spirit of Faithfulness to rend its garments.

Say: Tribulations prevent Us not from that which We have purposed. We speak the truth, though all the swords of the world be drawn against Our face. Say: O concourse of prelates! That which ye were promised in the Tablets hath come to pass. Fear ye God and follow not the imaginings of them that have gone astray. Cast away what ye possess and take hold of the Tablet of God with the authority that proceedeth from Him. This is better for you than all ye possess. Unto this testifieth every knowing, perceiving one. Ye glory in My Name, yet ye shut yourselves out from My Self. This is indeed a strange thing.

Say: O concourse of bishops! The Lord of all creatures hath appeared. He, verily, is calling humanity in the valley of guidance, while ye are of them that are dead. Blessed is he who hath been stirred by the breeze of God and hath arisen from amongst the dead through this manifest Name.

Say: O concourse of archbishops! The earthquakes have seized all the peoples, and He Who is the Everlasting Lord calleth aloud between earth and heaven. Blessed is the ear that hath heard, and the eye that hath seen, and the heart that hath turned unto the Qiblih of all who are in the heavens and on earth.

O concourse of priests! The Day of Reckoning hath appeared, and He Who was in heaven hath come. He, verily, is the One Whom ye were promised in God's Holy Books, the Mighty, the Praised One. How long will ye wander in the wilderness of heedlessness and vain imaginings? Turn with your hearts toward your Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous.

Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee that thou mayest rejoice at My mention of thee and be of them that are firmly established. Remember when thy first letter came before Us when the Most Great Sea was mounted upon the Ark by reason of that which the hands of the idolaters had wrought, and this is another time thy letter hath come before Our face. We have read it and answered thee with this decisive and all-encompassing utterance. Be thou observant in all circumstances of the dictates of wisdom, and speak unto men according to their capacities, for should an infant be given meat in its early days, it would perish. Thus doth thy Lord, the Merciful, counsel thee.

O Uncle Mashhadi Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the Hearing, the Seeing, the Answering One.

My Most Exalted Pen hath testified from the direction of the white spot, from the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. We have sent down the verses and manifested the evidences and sent down the heavenly table from the heaven of grace, but the people have deprived themselves of that which God, the Lord of lords, hath willed. This is a day wherein the mysteries of the Books of God, both past and future, have been revealed. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto every heedless liar.

O Husayn! The Wronged One hath made mention of thee and hath revealed for thee this Book whereby the horizon of utterance hath shone forth and all things have spoken: "The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of what was and what shall be." This is a day at the mention of which the eyes of the chosen ones were solaced, but when it appeared the divines and religious doctors denied it, save whom God, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning, wished. I bear witness that through their oppression the servants have broken God's Covenant and His Testament, and have committed that which hath caused the denizens of the most exalted Paradise and the dwellers of the pavilion of grandeur to lament at eventide and at dawn.

Blessed art thou for having rent asunder the veils and shattered the idols of fancy and vain imaginings in the name of God, the Lord of all men. How many a learned one hath been deprived of the ocean of divine knowledge, while thou didst turn and drink therefrom from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and didst attain unto that which most of the servants have failed to attain. God hath elevated thy station to one wherein He remembereth thee in the Most Great Prison with a remembrance through which the fragrance of life passeth over all creation. Glorify thy Lord with praise and thank Him at all times.

Well is it with thee for having cast away what the people possess, yearning for that which is with God, and for having arisen to serve the Cause with spirit and fragrance. By My life! We were with thee when thou didst speak in remembrance of My Most Great Name, turning toward this horizon whereby the horizons were illumined.

O Husayn! Dost thou know Who mentioneth thee and Who calleth thee from the precincts of the Prison? Say: Yea, by my Lord, in Whose right hand are all who dwell in the heaven of Command and creation, and in Whose grasp is the reins of all who are in the kingdoms of earth and heaven! The ears were created for this Most Great Day and the tongue for this Cause before which, when it appeared, all religions have bowed down.

O uncle! We have manifested unto thee the ocean of utterance and shown thee its waves and what floweth upon it by My Name, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. Reflect upon the stations of them that are veiled. All count themselves among the people of truth and await the days of manifestation, yet when the standards of divine expression were raised and the banners of the Revelation appeared, all were found to be veiled save whom God wished. The Truth, exalted be His glory, in all the Books both past and future, hath given everyone the glad-tidings of this most wondrous, most glorious Day. He Who possesseth the Mother Book beareth witness unto this. In all ages and centuries they have beseeched and implored God not to deprive them of the fragrances of His days, yet due to their heinous and unseemly deeds they have been deprived of their goal and forbidden from that for which they were created. He it is Who hath made their highest to be their lowest and their lowest to be their highest.

We convey greetings to all the friends in that land and give them the glad-tidings of God's loving-kindness and bounty. We beseech God that all may be recorded and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book as the fish of this ocean and the stars of this heaven and the letters of this Tablet. By My life! The world and all that is therein cannot be compared with this most exalted Word, for if a soul be recorded in the aforementioned Book, he shall attain unto special favors in all the divine worlds. Were We to describe this station, all who are in the heavens and earth would swoon away. Verily thy Lord is the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing.

Glory be upon thee and upon My loved ones who were not hindered by the affairs of the world from the Most Great Name and who cast away all that they possessed, clinging to the cord of the bounty of their Lord, the Strong, the Predominant, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

He is the Manifest, the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! The ocean of oneness hath surged, and the Ark hath sailed, and the fragrance of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, hath been wafted. Blessed is he who hath clung to the cord of bounty and turned to the Most Exalted Horizon, and woe betide him who hath been kept back from the Daystar of certitude by following vain imaginings and idle fancies.

O youth! Bear thou witness unto that whereunto God hath testified in this most exalted Station, this most sublime Summit, and this most glorious Horizon, that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling over what hath been and what shall be. We have mentioned thee aforetime with verses from which the fragrance of My loving-kindness was diffused amongst My servants, that thou mightest render thanks unto thy Lord, the Lord of existence. And We have sent down unto thee, time and again, that whereby the realities of all things were attracted. To this testifieth the Lord of the Kingdom of Names, Who is established upon the throne of "He doeth whatsoever He willeth" through His Most Holy, Mighty, and Beloved Name.

Thou wert mentioned aforetime by the Trusted One of the Bayan, upon him be the Glory of the All-Merciful, and then by him who was named Haydar-'Ali, upon him be My Glory. We have remembered thee with that whose fragrance shall never cease to endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven, and We have sent thee a Tablet wherefrom the sincere ones inhale the fragrance of God, the Lord of all that was and shall be. And at this moment one of My Branches, who hath been named the Light in My Beloved Tablet, hath presented himself, bearing thy letter which thou didst send unto him who was named with the first part of My Name, and it was read before Our face.

We have sent down from the heaven of bounty that which delighteth the eyes of the maidens secluded in the Most Exalted Paradise and attracteth the hearts of the dwellers of the supreme Paradise. Verily thy Lord loveth him who loveth Him and remembereth him who remembereth Him, and He is the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Loving.

O youth! There hath befallen Us tribulations whereat the Concourse on High hath lamented, and afflictions wherewith hearts and souls have been consumed. They have cast aside trustworthiness, truthfulness and faithfulness, having followed the dictates of self and passion. Lo! They comprehend not. We desired glory for them, yet they desired for Us supreme abasement. Thus have their souls enticed them, and they have committed that which hath caused the tears of the faithful to flow, they who have believed in God, the Lord of this praiseworthy station. Neither the might of the world shall frighten Me, nor shall the harm of those who have disbelieved in the Witness and the Witnessed hold Me back.

When thou hast quaffed the choice wine of bounty from the cup of the utterance of thy Most Glorious Lord, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having caused me to soar in the atmosphere of Thy love, to be set ablaze with the fire of Thy affection, and to be illumined by the light of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds and the Desire of the nations, by Thy Most Great Name, whereby the hearts of them that are nigh unto Thee were illumined and the faces of them who broke Thy Covenant and Testament and denied Thee and Thy signs were darkened, to assist Thy loved ones to serve Thy Cause and guide Thy creatures, and ordain for them that which shall draw them unto Thee in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.

O Lord! Thou knowest and seest that I have desired naught save to make mention of Thee amongst Thy servants, to exalt Thy Word, and to manifest that which shall raise them unto the heaven of Thy glory. I beseech Thee to aid me in that which I have purposed in Thy path. Verily, Thou art the All-Bounteous, the Generous, the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.

O Lord! I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and to Thy loftiness and Thy transcendence, and to Thy sanctification above the recognition of Thy creatures and Thy exaltation above the comprehension of them that are in Thy realm. I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of bounty and Lord of the Kingdom of Names, by Thy Beloved One whom Thou didst deliver from the polytheists who sought to shed His blood without any proof from Thee or testimony from Thy presence, and by Thy Cause whereby Thou didst raise up the Spirit to the heaven of Thy grace and didst preserve Him from the evil of them that turned away among Thy servants and the transgressors among Thy creatures, and by the Will whereby Thou didst deliver Moses from the tyranny of the Pharaohs of the earth and its oppressors, to protect Thy sheep from the wolves of Thy earth and the embodiments of trustworthiness from the calumniators and treacherous ones among Thy servants. Then assist them with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, and preserve them through Thy power which hath encompassed all things. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

He is the Hearer, the Answerer

This is a Book sent down in truth from the Wronged One to him who hath turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon and heard the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree - a bounty from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

O thou who gazeth upon the Face! Hear the Call from the precincts of the Prison - verily there is no God but Him, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Thy letter hath arrived and been presented by the servant in the presence of the Face. We have answered thee with this Tablet, inscribed, from whose horizon shineth the light of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Lord of all existence.

Say: O peoples of the earth! Fear God and deny not Him from Whose Most Exalted Pen hath flowed the Kawthar of utterance and every ordained matter hath appeared. Know ye Who calleth you and recognize ye Who remembereth you? Come ye, come ye, that I may show you the Most Exalted Horizon and cause you to hear the most melodious Pen and acquaint you with Him Who in every state proclaimeth: "Verily there is no God but Him, the Truth, the Lord of the visible and invisible."

By God! The Promise hath appeared and the Promised One hath come from the horizon of power with the banners of verses. Blessed is he who hath heard and turned toward Him, and woe unto every heedless doubter. This is the Day which God's Books have announced aforetime and afterward. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the Most Great Ocean which hath appeared before the faces of the world and from whose waves is heard that which the Interlocutor heard. Fear God and be not of those who denied God's favor and His signs, and committed that which caused the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise to lament, and those who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide.

Thus have We showered from the heaven of grace upon the earth of existence the rains of wisdom and utterance, as a mercy from God, the Lord of all men. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My knowledge be upon thee and upon those whom the veils of the divines have not withheld from the Lord of Names, nor the allusions of the mystics from Him Who hath arisen before all faces and summoned the servants unto God, the Lord of Lords.

Now hear in the Persian tongue: Today is the springtime of mention and utterance. Blessed is the one whom the veils of the people of the world have not deprived of this supreme bounty. Praise be to God, thou hast been confirmed and attained unto that whereby existence itself came into being through its recognition. Today the Divine Lote-Tree in the midmost heart of contingent being proclaimeth this most sublime Word: "The King hath come! The Kingdom is God's, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!"

Beseech ye God to make the ears of the servants ready for that for which they were created and brought from nothingness into being. Say: Strive that ye may attain unto the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. By the life of God! One word thereof cannot be equaled by all that is seen and visible. The ocean of bounty is surging, the sun of grace is shining, yet the servants are heedless and veiled. Say: Strive and, with the utmost lowliness and supplication, beseech the All-Sufficient, the Exalted, for that which is the cause of eternal salvation. Beseech thou God to kindle all with the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree and illumine them with the light of recognition. He is powerful and mighty.

Glory be to God! At all times hath the Pen of the Most Merciful, without veil or concealment, called the kings and subjects of the world and guided them to the Most Exalted Horizon. Until now they have not arisen from the couch of heedlessness. All have testified and do testify to its transience, yet they have deprived themselves of the eternal life and everlasting bounty.

Say: My God, my God! Regard not Thy servants and what they have wrought in Thy days, but rather their poverty and Thy riches, their weakness and Thy power. Aid them, O God of existence and Lord of the visible and invisible, to hearken unto the rustling of Thy Pen and to behold the horizon of the heaven of Thy bounty and grace. O Lord! Purify them with the water of inner meanings and utterance from that which hath withheld them from turning toward Thy Name, the Most Merciful. Then send down upon them from the heaven of Thy grace that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and cause them to know Thy path. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.

In the Name of Him Who is the All-Compelling over what was and what is to be!

This is a Book whose verses have been sent down in Arabic, and it is indeed detailed from the Mother Book by God, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Through it the Spirit casts truth in all times. Verily, there is no God but Him. And He Who speaks is indeed the Dawning-Place of God's Books, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Through Him God quenches the thirst of the unitarians with the Kawthar of life, and gives unto the sincere what cannot be mentioned in words. He brings glad tidings to all in the world of the appearance of the Lord of Eternity and draws the peoples near to the Most Great Name, Who speaks at the heart of contingent being in such wise as to make the very backbone of religions tremble. How many a standing one has sat down at the might of the Cause, and how many a sleeping one has arisen at this Name whereby standards were hoisted upon hilltops and mountains! How many a learned one was prevented by vain imaginings from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of Days, and how many a heedless one attained to the lights of the Countenance when it shone forth from the horizon of power! How many a philosopher claimed unity, but when the Manifestation of detachment appeared and the Dayspring of Revelation shed its radiance, denied God, the Lord of all men!

Say: The learned one is he who hath attained unto My knowledge, and the wise one he who hath turned unto My face and attained the mysteries of My wisdom, and the eloquent one he who hath become fluent in My Cause, and the one who speaketh is he who hath spoken forth with this Remembrance that God hath made the Dawning-Place of all remembrance. Say: By God! On this day the mention of notables will not profit you, nor form and matter. Behold this Reality from which all realities were made real and all things proclaimed: "There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Knowing!" Among them is one who claimed he heard from every tree what the Interlocutor heard, yet when the appointed time came and the Tree called out with the most exalted call between earth and heaven, We found him thunderstruck upon the dust - the decisive Word had come.

He distinguisheth between the servants, and with Him is the Mother of Tablets. Rend asunder, by My Name, the Self-Subsisting, all the veils of fancy. Beware lest the affairs of the world withhold thee from the Lord of Names. What thou possessest shall perish, and what hath been ordained for thee by My Most Exalted Pen shall endure in a Tablet that God hath made the Dayspring of inspiration. Dost thou choose silence after the Tongue of Grandeur speaketh among all creation? Dost thou fear the might of those in power after thou beholdest the Dawning-Place of the Cause standing among the servants with a sovereignty whose might hath seized all regions? Beware lest thou exchange the Kingdom of immortality for what thou seest in the realm of mortality. Turn with thy most luminous heart to the Most Great Vista, then hearken unto that which the Lord of Destiny proclaimeth in this Prison wherein the atoms cry out: "The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Revealer of verses!"

Hold fast to the glory of God, turning away from what thou seest as glory for thyself among men. Glory belongeth unto the Lord of creation and unto those who have turned with their hearts toward the direction of the Beloved and believed in God, the Lord of Lords. Beware lest wealth hold thee back from the final destination, or possessions occupy thee from God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Leave all else, then read what hath been sent down for thee in this Tablet. It will draw thee to a station wherein thou shalt see dominion behind thee. Then shalt thou say: "Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having enabled me to attain unto the most exalted station!"

Know that We make mention of thee for the sake of God, that We might fulfill some of what We have been commanded by Him. The Kingdom and the Dominion bear witness to this. Blessed are they who possess insight! We summon all unto the sealed wine whose seal hath been loosened by the finger of the Self-Subsisting, and We give the near ones to drink of that which draweth them closer to God, the Lord of all men. Say: O concourse of divines! Beware lest ye muddy the pure water of this spring with what ye possess of conjecture and fancy. Arise from the couch of heedlessness, then speak forth among all creation with the remembrance of your Lord. This is better for you, if ye be of those possessed of understanding. Leave the pond, for behold, the Most Great Ocean hath surged when the breeze of the All-Merciful stirred in all existence. Thus have the rains of My bounty poured forth from the clouds of My utterance. Beware lest thou deprive thyself thereof. Draw nigh with thy whole being and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having remembered me while the Dawning-Place of Thy Cause was imprisoned among the servants."

In His Name, Who rules over all who are on earth and in heaven! This is a Book that speaks the truth and reminds the people of the signs of God, the Lord of the worlds, and guides them to the path which hath been established in truth, and speaketh, saying: "O people of the earth! Turn ye unto Me with radiant faces, and follow not the imaginings of the ignorant ones who have turned away from the Countenance and denied Him in Whom they had believed. They are assuredly among the wrongdoers in the Book of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne."

In the Persian tongue: Hearken unto the divine call which is raised at all times, giving unto all the glad-tidings of that which is the cause of eternal blessing and everlasting bounty and endless, abiding life. The people of that land have ever been and continue to be under the glance of His loving-kindness. Blessed is the Ba before the Qaf, for he hath attained unto the Most Great Remembrance, when every heedless and remote one was debarred therefrom. We beseech the Most High to aid him at all times and draw him nigh unto Him. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Powerful.

O Abu-'Ali! Render thanks unto the Goal of all the worlds, that He hath aided thee to turn unto Him and hath manifested through thee one who is occupied in service and dwelleth beneath the canopy of grandeur. Thou didst desire to attain His presence; however, due to the great distance and the opposition of the deniers and the objections of the oppressors, this matter is now postponed. Yet We beseech God to record, through the Most Exalted Pen, its reward for thee and for others, and to adorn it with the glory of His acceptance. Be grateful and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art wronged by the world, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Glory of those in the heavens and the earth!"

O 'Ali! We have made mention of thy father, and We now make mention of My handmaiden, thy mother. We beseech God to forgive her and ordain for her that which beseemeth the kingdom of His bounty and the heaven of His grace. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Powerful.

Praise be to God! His honor Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin speaketh in remembrance of the sincere ones, the near ones, and the devoted ones, and hath attained unto the presence. Blessed is he and blessed is he who hath loved him and hearkened unto his call in this momentous News. He hath ever made mention of those regions and the loved ones of that land, and continueth to do so, and hath besought from the ocean of the All-Merciful's mercy and the heaven of divine generosity, for each one, that which hath had and hath no likeness or equal.

O Hajar! Thy name hath been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One, and thou hast attained unto the bounty of God, exalted be His glory, and the evidences of the Most Exalted Pen. Recognize thou the station of this Most Great Remembrance and this Most Exalted Word. By the life of God! The treasures of the earth cannot compare with but one word of the divine utterances. Today all the books of the world cry out with one voice: "O people of the earth! The Mother Book hath appeared and calleth from the most exalted station, summoning all unto God, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Hearken ye, hearken ye, then turn with such steadfastness as cannot be deterred by the hosts of the world, and be not of those who turn away."

O 'Ali! Give the glad-tidings of My remembrance and My bounty to thy brothers. We beseech God to aid them to remember and praise Him, to draw them nigh unto Him, to ordain for them the reward of those who have turned to My Most Exalted Horizon, and to give them to drink of the Kawthar of bounty from the hand of His favor. He, verily, is the Compassionate, the Generous. We have remembered them time and again, and likewise those whom God hath related unto thee, as a mercy from His presence. He, verily, is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Guardian of the sincere ones.

The glory be upon thee and upon them and upon My loved ones there, from whom those who have turned unto God inhale the fragrance of My wondrous and incomparable love.

My God, my God! Thou seest Thy loved ones and Thy friends. Ordain for them what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have hastened with their hearts to Thy horizon, soared in Thy atmosphere, and have sacrificed their spirits in Thy path. O Lord! Withhold them not from the outpourings of Thy days, then send down upon them from the clouds of Thy mercy and the heaven of Thy bounty that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and aid them in that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Thou art, verily, the Forgiving, the Merciful. There is none other God but Thee, the Commander, the Judge, the Mighty, the Powerful.

His Holiness Aqa Mirza Mahmud, upon him be 966 \[Baha'u'llah\]

On 7 Dhi'l-Hijjih 1305

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power

Unto Him be praise and greatness and glory, for He hath ordained for His loved ones in His presence the blessing of nearness and meeting, and in absence the food of remembrance and praise. At times He speaketh in presence in the form of utterance, and at others in absence in the form of writing. Unto Him be praise for all of this and in all conditions. And blessings and peace be upon His Beloved, whom He made a Book wherein was inscribed that which none knoweth save His own Self, and established him in His station in the realm of creation, and made him the Dawning-Place of His names and the Rising-Point of His attributes and the Manifestation of His signs and evidences, and upon his family and companions through whom was raised the Most Great Word whereby earth and heaven were illumined, and through whom eyes witnessed and tongues proclaimed that there is none other God but Him. These are servants through whose might was revealed God's justice throughout creation and His power amongst the servants - blessings which the speaking tongues, enkindled hearts and penetrating, all-encompassing perceptions are powerless to reckon. The servant beseecheth his Lord to aid us in that which He loveth and approveth. Verily He heareth and seeth. There is none other God but Him in the hereafter and the former times.

The letter of that beloved of the heart was as collyrium for the eye of love, an antidote for the temple of affection, and a heavenly stream for the thirsty in the valley of search. After manifestations of joy and gladness, delight and rapture, it was brought before the Face. He said - may our spirits be sacrificed for Him - He is the Helper, the Mighty, the All-Wise.

O Mahmud! Upon thee be the peace of God, the Lord of the seen and unseen. The servant was present before the Face with thy letter and was honored to hear the Wronged One. Every word thereof testified in the most exalted call to thy steadfastness, attachment, love and affection. Well is it with thee for having drunk the wine of love from the cup of thy Lord's bounty, the Lord of creation, and for having attained that which the world was debarred from, save whom God, the Lord of eternity, wished. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid and assist thee in that whereby His remembrance may be exalted amongst His servants and His Word in His lands. Peace be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon those who have drunk the wine of recognition from the cup of their Lord's bounty, the Mighty, the All-Wise.

We make mention of his honor the Emigrant who hath emigrated from his place, seeking the Most Exalted Station, that joy may take hold of him and draw him nigh unto Him. Verily He is the Protector of those who love Him. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful. Praise be to God, his honor 'Ali-Qabli-Muhammad hastened with his heart in love of God until he attained the presence and beheld the waves of the ocean of utterance and heard that which was the hope of those in former ages and centuries. The Wronged One beseecheth God to aid him in that whereby his mention may endure amongst mentions, his name amongst names, his deed amongst deeds, and his spirit amongst spirits. Verily He is the Ruler over what He willeth through His word "Be" and it is. That which he sent hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. He should rejoice and be of the thankful. Peace be upon him and upon the two leaves and upon every believing servant and every maidservant who hath turned unto God, the Lord of the worlds.

Praise be to God, they have attained unto the wine of utterance and been honored by the bounty of the Goal of the world's peoples. From mention and utterance the degrees of grace and bounty are evident and clear. Well is it with thy honor and with him. This servant conveyeth greetings and praise to them and beseecheth from God, exalted be His glory, whatsoever is the cause of exaltation and advancement. Verily our Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Peace and remembrance and praise be upon your honors and upon those with you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

In the Name of God, the Mighty! The Goal of the world's peoples has willed on this blessed night of the month of Ramadan to make mention in the luminous tongue - that is, in the Persian language - of one of His loved ones, that perchance the penetrating power of the Most Exalted Word and the potency of the Supreme Pen may enable the people of the world of creation to attain eternal life and everlasting existence. O My loved ones and My friends! With wisdom, impart to the peoples of the world the greatness of this station, this Revelation and this utterance, and make it known to them, that perchance they may be quickened and refreshed by the breathings of the Holy Spirit and arise to promote the Cause with joy and delight. This Wronged One has, in the nights and days, summoned all the peoples of the earth to the horizon of Him Who conversed on Sinai and guided them. However, the unjust people became a barrier and, through false tales and fabricated statements, prevented ears from hearkening to the scratching of the Divine Pen. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to adorn all with the ornament of truthfulness, sincerity, trustworthiness and fidelity. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing. Today the loved ones must manifest supreme kindliness and greatest mercy, and awaken the heedless, that perchance they may discover and comprehend the station of these days and the purpose of the Beloved of the worlds. God is aware and the people bear witness that this Wronged One had no desire save the exaltation of the blessed Word. Nevertheless, from all directions fly the arrows of denial and hypocrisy. Soon will the heedless witness their stations before the seat of God's justice, the Lord of all worlds. By My life! Not a single fruitless or ineffective deed remains or has remained. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist His servants in that which befits His days. Verily, He has power over all things. Today all must gaze toward the horizon of Revelation and hold fast to whatsoever hath been manifested from the Source of God's command. This is the truth, there is no doubt therein. Blessed is he who hath laid hold upon it and cast away all else, as bidden by the Ordainer, the All-Wise.

O Letter F before T! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and remind the servants of what hath been sent down to them from the heaven of the Will of God, the Mighty, the Praised. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou seest and knowest that I have turned toward Thee, holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty and clinging to the hem of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee by the Word whereby Thou hast subdued the world, and by Thy Name through which Thou hast illumined the hearts of the nations, to open before the faces of Thy servants the doors of Thy generosity, then draw them nigh unto Thee in all conditions, then grant them to drink from the cup of steadfastness such that neither the doubts of the nations nor the oppression of those who have denied Thy Most Great Name may cause them to slip. O Lord! They are Thy servants and Thy creation. Unveil to them what Thou hast unveiled to Thy loved ones, then make known to them Thy straight Path, at whose appearance hearts and minds were agitated, except for those whom Thou didst protect through Thy hosts of power and Thy sovereignty. O my God! Send Thy blessings upon Thy chosen ones who have confined their affairs to Thy remembrance and praise and the promotion of Thy Cause in Thy lands. Verily, Thou art the Almighty Whom the affairs of creation cannot frustrate, nor can the might of those who have denied Thy proof and Thy testimony and who dispute Thy signs that have encompassed the heavens and the earth prevent Thee. Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds!

O thou who standest firm in My service! Mention of the loved ones of that land has repeatedly been made in the Most Holy Court and continues to be made. One day among these days, the Most Great Branch and the Name of Bounty, upon them both be My glory and My loving-kindness, made mention of you, and your letter attained the honor of being seen and heard. We have therefore answered thee through this mighty Tablet and this perspicuous Book. Give thanks unto thy Lord and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all beings, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Possessor of the hereafter and this world, for having remembered me in Thy prison and for having sent down that whose fragrance shall never be cut off throughout the duration of Thy commandments and ordinances. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over whatsoever Thou willest through Thy binding and wise command. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

O Haji Mulla Mahdi, upon him be the Glory of God! In the name of the Beloved of the worlds:

The letter which you wrote to this Servant present before the Throne was mentioned in the presence of the Face, and signs of grief were evident from it, although you should in all conditions manifest the Most Great Joy, inasmuch as through God's wondrous favor and His infinite mercy you have attained the most great bounty and are gazing toward and turned to the Most Great Horizon. Think not that your services in the path of the Cause have been effaced from view, or that even an atom thereof has departed from the Divine Mirror of Knowledge. Most often you have been and are mentioned before the Throne, as all who seek the right hand of the All-Merciful and circle the Kaaba of divine knowledge bear witness, and beyond them your Lord, the Speaker, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. In most years, successive and continuous exalted Tablets were revealed and sent especially for you, and if you reflect carefully upon those Tablets you will become aware of the special divine favors. In times when you were speaking in remembrance of the Truth and occupied with teaching His Cause, He was with you. Verily He heard and saw, and hears and sees. He is the Witness, the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing. It is incumbent upon the loved ones in that land to show you love and render service. Your assistance is in itself a witness and testimony to this blessed and goodly Word which has dawned from the horizon of the Divine Will. If any soul has shown neglect toward you, be not grieved. Occupy yourself with the remembrance of God, for He has been and ever will be sufficient. If you were to become aware of what has befallen the Wronged One, you would surely forget your own tribulations. Observe how, though imprisoned in the Most Great Prison among the nations, while most of the people of the world, among the wielders of authority and power, have arisen against Him with utmost hatred, He is occupied with the utmost joy and gladness in spreading God's Cause and exalting the Most Great Word. Since you too are of the Tree and related to Him, you have had and have your portion.

O Mahdi! By the life of God, this Servant has not been saddened by any affliction, nor has any clamor caused Him to hesitate in God's Cause. The grief that has affected and affects Him are the words that are heard from those who are veiled among the people of the Bayan. In these days one named Siyyid Yusuf from the people of Sad sent a petition to the Most Holy Court - and he is among those who turned away from the Truth and followed Satan in his soul and imagined himself to be of the people of the Bayan. We testify that the Bayan is innocent of him, and God speaks the truth and He is the Truthful, the Trustworthy. Among other things he asked about the sign of the Manifestation being that they would remove two well-known Shaykhs from their graves and hang them on two withered trees, whereupon those trees would instantly be observed to become green and flourishing. Observe how deluded this person is and at what station he stands. They carry their burdens upon their backs and perceive it not, and the volumes of allusions rest upon their hearts yet they understand not. And among other things he wrote that Azazil, meaning Satan, flows like blood in the veins of man, and other such delusions whose mention has been and will be a cause of grief. It seems the veiled ones among the people of the Bayan have not attained even a drop from the pure water of divine wisdom and heavenly knowledge. All grief has been and is in hearing such words, even though they have observed that the greatest matter which was established and confirmed among the Shi'ih party for one thousand two hundred years or more proved contrary to fact. Nevertheless, they now cling to similar things and remain deprived of the court of oneness. By God! They have no share of the Book and its meanings, its outer and its inner aspects. We testify that he is among the most lost ones.

This is a Tablet revealed previously for Ali-Qabli-Rida, which was sent because the messenger was lost.

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted!

This is a remembrance from the Prisoner to him who hath believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Worship none but Him, then detach thyself from all that was and shall be, out of love for God, the Mighty, the Beloved, the All-Powerful. Stand firm in the Cause of God, thy Lord, and say: "O people! There hath come to you the news at which all in the heavens and earth were struck with terror, save the near-servants who have detached themselves from the world and all within it, purified their vision from human limitations, and turned with their hearts to their Lord, the All-Merciful, in this time when the Sun of Utterance hath shone forth from the horizon of all existence with the ornament of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Loving.

Say: O people! This is the Cause ye were promised in all the Tablets. Fear God and be not of those who differ. Say: This is He of Whose meeting the Primal Point gave you glad tidings in the Tablets of Destiny, and made the Bayan a paradise for Me and My loved ones who now rejoice therein. Fear God, O people, and withhold not the Word from its station, nor the Names from their Creator, nor divide the Letters that were joined together in truth by God's command, the King, the Mighty, the Praised. He counseled you throughout the Bayan not to pause at the time of His manifestation for anything created between the heavens and earth. Now ye are in it - look, and be not of those who understand not.

He said - and His word is the truth: Beware lest ye be veiled by what was revealed in the Bayan from meeting and knowing Him. He is the One Who cannot be known through aught else - all are His servants and all act by His command. Yet ye have been veiled by the Names though ye had no knowledge of them or their command. Woe unto you and those who perceive not! Do ye read My words, then object to My Self? Do ye cite His verses, then deny their Revealer? Say: This is the Youth of God among you Who hath come with all the signs, if ye be fair-minded.

And thou, O thou who gazest upon the Face, hearken unto what is revealed unto thee from this blessed and holy Quarter: There is no God but Him, and He Who hath appeared in truth is His Glory unto all who witness and are witnessed. Preserve this Tablet and recite it in thy days - this is better for thee than all that was created in existence and all that is hidden. Say: O people! If ye deny this Cause, then by what testimony do ye believe and have certitude? Fear God, spread not corruption in the land, and be not of those who opposed God on the Day when Ali came with truth with manifest sovereignty. By God! None can protect anyone today and none can find refuge save in God Who created all things by His command, then established Himself upon the Throne, around which circle the denizens of the Supreme Concourse and honored servants.

Say: He desireth naught from you - He calleth you unto God, and His reward is with Him Who sent Him with truth and dispatched Him to those created by God's Word, the Mighty, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Rend asunder the veils of the people through the power of the Lord of Names and Attributes, then sever them from those who make allusions, who openly denied God and followed every rejected idolator. Blessed art thou for having drunk the holy Kawthar in this Paradise which hath appeared at the heart of existence by God's command, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Beloved.

We counsel thee in this Tablet regarding the remaining descendants of Husayn in that place, and she who is related to him who was in another land. Thus doth command thee this imprisoned servant. Neglect not the loved ones of God - be kind to them. Thy Lord shall fully reward the doers of good. The Spirit and Glory be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God and detached themselves from those who disbelieved and associated partners with God and who act according to what they were commanded.

He is the Dawning from the Horizon of the Heaven of Utterance

This is the Day whereon the Trump hath been blown, and it is My Most Exalted Pen, whereby those who lay buried have arisen, despite those who disbelieved in God, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have sent down the verses and made manifest the clear proofs, yet most of the people remain behind an evident veil. Hearken unto the Call from the Lote Tree beyond which there is no passing, raised up in the Most Exalted Paradise: O concourse of earth and heaven! The Lord of all beings hath come, with the standards of His signs to His right, and to His left the hosts of revelation and inspiration. Blessed be the ear that hath heard and responded, and woe unto every heedless and remote one.

As I was walking in the House and meditating on God's mysteries that lay hidden in the realities of all things, there entered one of My Branches, who in the Kingdom of Names is called by the name of Light, bearing thy letter which he read before the face of the Wronged One. We have answered thee with a Tablet from whose horizon shineth the light of thy Lord's loving kindness. We have found from every word of the words of thy letter the fragrance of love and affection. We have turned to thee and revealed for thee that which shall endure as long as God's kingdom endureth, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.

This is the Day wherein the Hour hath appeared with its signs, and the Resurrection with its mysteries, and the Caller hath called from a near place. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid thee and grant thee success in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily He is the Lord of the hereafter and of the former life, and within His grasp lieth the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Blessed art thou for having turned to the Face and acknowledged the oneness of God and that which He revealed in His ancient Book.

When the breezes of the dawn of His Revelation stirred thee and the melodies of Him Who conversed on Sinai took hold of thee, say: My God, my God! Unto Thee be praise and glory, and unto Thee be might and splendor. I beseech Thee by the Point through which the Books of the world were distinguished, and by the Light whereby the hearts of the nations were illumined, and by the pearls of the ocean of Thy wisdom and the manifestations of the sun of Thy proof, to make me one of those whom the might of the world deterred not when the Day Star of Thy Most Great Name appeared, and whom the clamor of those who broke Thy Covenant and Testament, denied Thy proof, and disputed Thy signs, did not prevent. O Lord! Thou seest me attracted by the fragrances of Thy Revelation and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me from the heaven of Thy grace and the clouds of Thy mercy, nor from the ocean of Thy bounty. Thou art verily the Generous, the Lord of supreme bounty. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

As to what was asked concerning the blessed Surih of Unity, its stations have been repeatedly revealed. Let his honor look into the Tablets; he will attain unto the ocean of divine utterance and the manifestations of the Sun of true unity. Today the Book of Unity, meaning the Book that comprehendeth the stations of unity, singleness, and detachment, is this most mighty, most holy, most glorious Tablet.

He is the Expositor, the All-Knowing

True spiritual oneness consists in acknowledging and confessing the unity of God, exalted be His glory, sanctifying His Essence from all likeness and purifying His Being from all similitudes. This has ever been and shall ever be the case. The Shi'ih sect, however, failed to attain this most exalted station, this most glorious rank, this ultimate purpose and this most resplendent summit. For it is evident and proven to those immersed in the ocean of truth and them who hold fast to the cords of knowledge and wisdom that God, exalted be His glory, has ever been and shall ever be the Unknowable, the Inaccessible. The birds of the hearts of them who are nigh unto God are powerless to soar in the atmosphere of His knowledge, and the highest understanding of the knowers is limited and falls short. After establishing this lofty station and this glorious seat, true oneness refers to His Vicegerent amongst His servants. He is the Dawning-Place of revelation, the Dayspring of inspiration, the Manifestation of His Self and the Repository of knowledge. He is the Treasury of names and attributes. Whoso hath known Him hath known God, and whoso hath clung unto Him hath clung unto God. Should anyone accept for Him in His station any peer or likeness, or should anyone confess to such, that soul is deprived and forbidden from the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of true oneness. The proof of faith has ever been and shall ever be the acknowledgment of the Dawning-Place of Revelation alone. Whosoever attaineth unto faith in Him is accounted among the people of unity in the sight of God. Without this, the sanctification of His Essence from aught else and the purification of His Being from all others can never be established. Blessed is the soul who in this day beholdeth with his own eyes the waves of the Divine ocean of utterance and heareth with his own ears His call. The call is loud, but the channels of the ears are narrow. The realm and atmosphere of the servants' understanding is limited, and this arena cannot contain the Horseman of the court of oneness. Blessed are they that know.

The Shi'ih sect hath set up many partners for God, exalted be His glory, and yet they count themselves among the people of unity. By God! They have not even caught its fragrance, for their station was made clear and evident to all from the recompense of their deeds on the Day of Judgment - clear, that is, to them possessed of insight, not to every ignorant one who followeth vain imaginings. Their deeds were such that on the Day of Judgment they denied the Truth and pronounced sentence upon His martyrdom. And now all the divines of Persia are engaged in cursing and reviling Him from their pulpits. Beseech God that no group like unto that group might ever appear in the world, and that He may raise up servants who, through His power and might, shall pass beyond the gulf of names and attain unto the Most Great Ocean, and who shall preserve the servants from the pit of previous suspicions and vain imaginings. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.

It is incumbent upon all to preserve this station, and it is hoped that you and all who have turned towards God will not be deprived of the effulgences of the Sun of true unity, will regard all else but God as non-existent, and will cling unto Him. Verily He is the One Who speaketh in every condition: "Verily He is God; there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise." The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My Kingdom be upon you and upon those who have cast away all else but God, turning unto God, the One, the All-Informed.

He is the All-Witnessing, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing!

O My Name! The letter from his honor Afnan Aqa, upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness, which bore your name, was mentioned by this servant in the presence of the Wronged One. May he, through God's grace, be blessed in all worlds with the infinite outpourings of His Excellency the All-Bountiful. He is the One Who hath witnessed and seen from among the greatest signs of his Lord, and hath spoken and praised the Lord of all beings when he heard His call from His most exalted horizon. Thus did God testify for him from His Most Glorious Perspective. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Compassionate, the All-Generous. The glance of loving-kindness hath been and is directed towards him. The fragrance of God's love hath at all times wafted from him. Beseech ye the True One, exalted be His glory, that He may aid all to achieve that which beseemeth this divine Day.

O Mahdi! The Most Exalted Pen hath, in most tablets, made mention of the greatness of this Day, and its mention hath been recorded in the divine Books and Scriptures of the past and future. Nevertheless, the people of the world are seen to be heedless and veiled therefrom, except those whom neither the affairs of princes nor the doubts of the divines have kept back from this Path which itself proclaimeth between earth and heaven. Blessed is the eye that hath seen, blessed the ear that hath heard, and blessed the heart that hath turned unto God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.

We make mention of the Afnan once again, that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. O My Afnan! The fragrance of thy love hath wafted abroad, and every possessor of spiritual sense hath perceived it. Be thou fair in the Cause of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Every tongue hath spoken in praise of God, but We behold those who claim knowledge to be in heedlessness and behind a veil. Blessed is the learned one who hath cleansed his heart with the waters of his Lord's mercy, the Powerful, the All-Forgiving. They have cast the Truth behind their backs, yet they imagine themselves to be of the people of Paradise.

The divines of the age have been and are the cause of the heedlessness of souls and the veiling of servants, even as hath been sent down from the Most Exalted Pen in tablets past and future - that which sufficeth them that are endowed with vision. In all the Books mention hath been made of the opposition of rebellious and transgressing souls, yet in this Most Great Revelation a great number of divines have turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon and have quaffed from the Most Pure Wine. Whosoever hath today attained unto the recognition of the Truth is recorded with God among the divines and inscribed in the Divine Book. We have previously informed all servants of that which would cause the elevation of souls and the preservation of being. Beseech ye God that He may aid all and deprive them not of the splendors of the Sun of inner meanings and utterance. He, verily, is the All-Witnessing, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.

O Afnan! The Beloved of all possibility maketh mention of thee in the midst of sorrows. He, verily, loveth him who loveth Him, and turneth unto him who turneth unto Him. Thy Lord hath been named the All-Merciful in His mighty Book. We have veiled that which hath occurred before and shall occur hereafter, lest the heart of him who hath turned unto God, the One, the All-Informed, be saddened.

The Truth is today manifest in the Promised Land and seated upon the mentioned throne. This is the land that was referred to as the Holy Land in the Qur'an, and likewise in previous Books, and the call of the Prophets was raised in this wilderness. Yet its people are recorded and inscribed as the offspring of vipers, and this Wronged One, in the midst of this group, summoneth all parties unto God, exalted be His glory. Blessed are they that attain, blessed are they that hear, and blessed are they that know.

Mention was made of the Most Exalted Leaf and the honored mother, upon them both be the glory of God. Two most holy, most glorious Tablets have been revealed and sent specifically for them, and likewise specifically for the Afnan, upon them be the glory of the All-Merciful. God willing, they will deliver them that they may drink from the Kawthar of divine utterance. Let not the Most Exalted Leaf, upon her be My glory, be saddened by the delay and postponement. By My life! That which hath come to pass hath been in accordance with wisdom and expediency. With Him is the knowledge of all things, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Glory be upon thee, upon them both, upon them, and upon those who have drunk the choice wine of revelation through My name, the Best-Beloved.

He is the One Who standeth manifest, speaking before all faces.

O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! My Most Exalted Pen desireth to reveal unto thee the pearls of wisdom that lay hidden in its treasuries, to cause thee to hear the call of God, and to show thee the waves of the ocean of utterance in these days wherein He Who was hidden hath appeared with His Name, the Self-Subsisting, and hath, with the hands of grace and bounty, proffered His sealed wine. Blessed is he who hath cast behind him all else, who hath advanced and hastened until he partook and drank thereof, and said: "Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth!"

This is the Day whereon the breezes of the All-Merciful have wafted over all creation, wherein the Dove of proof hath warbled upon the loftiest branches, and given glad-tidings unto all on earth of that which was promised in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou hast heard the Call and turned unto it, and wert not hindered by the veils of the world, nor frightened by the might of the nations who broke God's Covenant and His Testament, and perpetrated that which caused the Faithful Spirit to lament.

We took a handful of dust and breathed into it less than the eye of a needle of spirit from Our presence. When it stirred, it arose in sedition, having been beguiled by one who had no station with God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Arise to serve the Cause with a power from Us and a strength from Our presence, and say: "O concourse of the heedless! Be fair in your judgment, by God, then look into the traces of His Pen, and that which hath appeared from Him, and that whereof He hath informed in His Books, His Scrolls, and His Tablets, and be not of them who denied God's signs, His proof, His testimony, and His traces, and pronounced judgment against their Lord without clear evidence from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed."

He who loved Me and soared in Mine atmosphere and attained My presence and drank the choice wine of utterance from the cup of My bounty hath mentioned thee. We have remembered thee in this clear Book which calleth out with the most exalted call, saying: "By God, the Truth! The veil hath been rent asunder and the All-Bountiful hath come, riding upon the clouds, desiring naught save the reformation of the world and the refinement of your souls, if ye be of them who know, and He hath forbidden all from corruption and commanded them to fear God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy."

Say: Aid your Lord through such conduct and deeds as will exalt the station of the blessed Word and your stations among the parties. He, verily, is the Counselor, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We counsel thee with wisdom in all circumstances, and with that which beseemeth man. Blessed is the All-Merciful Who hath commanded all with that which attracteth the hearts of them that have turned unto Him.

Know thou that the wolf hath devoured My sheep, the oppressor hath slain the She-Camel of God, the Lord of the exalted Throne, and the serpent hath opened its mouth and bitten him whom God made a light unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as there hath been sent down unto thee that which shall endure as long as God's names and attributes and His mighty and impregnable kingdom shall endure.

Preserve this most exalted station in the name of thy Lord, the Lord of all mankind, and say: "Glory be unto Thee, O God, O Thou Who art the Creator of the heavens and the Possessor of the Kingdom of Names! I beseech Thee by the blood that hath been shed in Thy path, and by Thy loved ones whom nothing whatsoever, nor the oppression of the enemies, could deter from drawing nigh unto Thee and attaining Thy presence, to aid me in that which shall make me detached from all else save Thee and holding fast to the cord of Thy loving providence. O my Lord! I have forsaken the community of a people who denied Thy bounty and the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance and the manifestations of the Sun of Thy Revelation. I beseech Thee, O Lord of eternity, by Thy Most Great Name, to make me steadfast in mentioning that which Thou didst reveal in the Qur'an unto the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation and the Dayspring of Thy signs. Thou didst say, and Thy word is the truth: 'Say: God; then leave them to their vain disputes.' 'Verily, we are God's, and to Him shall we return.'"

The glory from Us be upon thee and upon him who hath heard the rustling of the Lote-Tree of the Ultimate Boundary in the Most Exalted Paradise and hath said: "Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of names and in Whose right hand are the reins of all that was and shall be!"

O Ibn-i-Ism'ullah'il-Asdaq, upon whom be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious! He is the One Who calleth before the faces of all parties. O thou who gazeth upon the Countenance and standeth before the Gate! Hearken unto that which hath been raised from the rustling of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha in the prison of 'Akka. Verily it attracteth thee and draweth thee nigh unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The mysteries have been revealed, yet most of the people understand not. The verses have been sent down, yet they hear not. We have manifested that which was hidden. Verily thy Lord is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth through His word "Be" and it is.

O son of My Name! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Thou hast ever been mentioned in the presence of the Countenance. We beseech God that He may aid thee in such deeds as are the cause of sanctification and the source of detachment. The Son of Mary said unto His companions that they should emigrate from any land for the sake of God and the exaltation of His Word, taking nothing with them from that land, not even its dust, meaning that neither their garments nor their limbs should be soiled with dust. Praise be to God, thou hast been favored with His special bounty and the gaze of His loving-kindness hath at all times been directed towards thee.

Say: My God, my God! Aid this Thy servant in that whereby Thy Cause may be exalted amongst Thy servants and Thy signs may be spread throughout Thy lands. O my Lord! Thou seest me clinging unto Thee and detached from all else beside Thee. I beseech Thee by the burning of the hearts of Thy lovers in their separation from Thee, and by the yearning of those who long for Thee in their remoteness from Thee, to aid me in that whereby the hearts of Thy creation may be attracted and the stations of Thy friends may be exalted. O my Lord! Thou art the Generous, possessed of great bounty. Ordain for me in all conditions that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. Verily Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.

Glory be to God! Although the veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings have been rent asunder by the finger of divine Will, and the Pen of the Lord of all mankind hath been engaged day and night in counsels and admonitions, yet now it is observed that veils greater than before have withheld the people. Hadi of Dawlatabad, despite having mounted the pulpit and repeatedly uttered that which caused the hearts of them that are nigh unto God to melt, is now again occupied with nurturing the Shi'ih party. Not for a single moment did he turn with pure intention to the divine verses. Time and again did We mention him and summon him with kindly counsels and admonitions to the straight path of God, yet no effect was manifest. It is incumbent, nay obligatory, upon that honored one and the other friends to protect the weak servants from the claws of his hatred, lest they be afflicted as were the previous party. Although these are the days of God, exalted be His glory, and ears should at all times be turned to the supreme horizon that they may hear that which appeareth from the Kingdom of Utterance of God, the Lord of all worlds, yet some are observed to be deprived of the Truth and clinging to vain imaginings through a name among names or a word among words of the barking ones.

Say: My God, my God! Protect Thy friend whom Thou hast mentioned in verses that are not equaled by the mention of the world, from the whisperings of them that have turned away from Thee. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.

The letter of Jinab-i-Fa'iz, upon whom be the glory of God, His loving-kindness and His mercy, which thou didst send hath attained the Most Holy Court, and the answer hath been sent down from the heaven of favor. Let him rejoice and be of them that are thankful. Say: Grieve not over anything. Soon will God open before thy face the gate of joy and gladness. O son of My Name! Great favor hath been shown towards him. We have commanded him to that which is the cause of eternal life and everlasting sovereignty.

Say: My God, my God! Aid him in that which beseemeth Thy days, then assist him with the hosts of the unseen and the visible, then open before his face the doors of bounties and favors. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.

Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the friends of that land. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon him who heareth thy word concerning this Most Great News.

After completing the letter of Mirza 'Abdu'llah, this was written:

He is God! O beloved of my heart! Regarding what you wrote mentioning Qurratu'l-'Ayn Aqa Siyyid Husayn, upon him be the peace of God - after it was presented before His presence, He said:

He is God, exalted be His station! To Him be glory and power! O Husayn! Upon you be the peace of God and the peace of His loved ones. His honor Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali, upon him be God's peace and grace, and you have been and are mentioned before the Wronged One. Although this Wronged One has commanded all to act with goodness, and likewise to that which God has revealed in the Book, and My purpose has been nothing but the preservation of the people of unity and their might and power and exaltation, they have done that which is beyond mention. The power of the people of the cities of unity and detachment reached such a station that the limbs of the polytheists and heedless trembled from it and hearts were troubled. Now weakness has reached such a point that opponents have attacked from all sides. Each day some harm arrives and some tribulation appears. They have denied this bounty and imagined this justice to be tyranny. Therefore the Wronged One is afflicted in the Most Great Prison. But tribulation in His path, exalted be He, has been and is beloved. In all conditions We have wished and do wish the good of the people of the world. We beseech God to adorn all with the ornament of justice, that they may speak with fairness and observe with sanctified vision. The purpose of what was mentioned is that the friends may become aware of what has transpired and know that this Wronged One has loved and loves meeting His loved ones, but the heedless servants have become a barrier.

O Husayn, say: My God, my God! I am the one who has turned to Thee and placed my trust in Thee. I beseech Thee by the trees of the gardens of inner meanings and utterance, and the leaves of realities and exposition, to ordain for me that which will profit me. Verily Thou art more knowing of me than I am of myself. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, and worthy of answering prayer.

O Husayn! Praise be to God, thou hast attained to that of which most are heedless. Be not grieved at what hath befallen this Wronged One. Reflect - We have mentioned thee with a mention that is the cause of greatest joy. We beseech God to assist thee and make thee successful and ordain for thee the best of what He hath revealed in His Book. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Generous, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.

This servant also conveys greetings and beseeches from God that which is the cause of loftiness and elevation. To his honor your father, upon him be God's peace and care, I send greetings. He has ever been and is mentioned. The servant asks his Lord to protect him and ordain for him the good of the hereafter and this world.

Mention was made of the light of my eyes, the honored 'Abdu'l-Hadi and his brothers, upon them be God's mercy and grace. After presenting their mention, He mentioned them both, and likewise mentioned the honored leaf of the family, upon her be God's peace. Concerning each one was manifested that which testified to bounty and care. Blessed are they and joy be unto them. This servant also conveys greetings to each one and seeks divine confirmation. Verily God is the Hearer, the Answerer, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous.

Mention was made of ?abibu'llah, upon him be 96 \[Baha'u'llah\]. After presenting this, He spoke these words: "Verily We have mentioned thee before and at this time, and We ask God to assist thee and make thee successful and render thee protected, steadfast, firm and resolute in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to ordain for thee what beseemeth His generosity, exalted be He."

This servant also conveys greetings and makes mention with that which is the cause of enkindlement. God willing, may they be assisted in all conditions to act with goodness and with that which will elevate their station among the servants. Peace and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon God's near servants.

We make mention at this time of him who is named Nuru'llah and give him glad tidings of the mention of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. O Nuru'llah, rejoice in My mention of thee, then give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And We make mention of him who is named Ja'far that the mention may attract him to a station wherein naught in the world shall prevent him from the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having mentioned me in the prison and manifested unto me Thy Cause and illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge. I testify that Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Goal of them that know Thee. O Pen! Make mention of him who is named 'Ali-Qabli-Muhammad that he may thank God, the Lord of the mighty throne. Hear thou the call of the Wronged One in the Most Great Prison. Verily He hath borne tribulations for the salvation of all on earth. Every discerning one beareth witness unto this. Say: Praise be unto Thee for having given me to drink the Kawthar of Thy knowledge and enabled me to turn unto Thee. I testify that Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful. And We make mention of Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali with verses that all the treasures of the heavens and earth cannot equal. When thou findest the fragrance of My utterance, say: Praise be unto Thee for having guided me unto Thy straight path and mentioned me in Thy great prison. O Ibn-i-Mahmud! Hear the call of God, the Mighty, the Loving. Verily He hath mentioned thee in His praiseworthy station which God hath made the point of adoration of the Concourse on High and the Dawning-Place of His Cause in what was and what will be. When thou hearest My call and findest the fragrance of My utterance, say: May my soul be a sacrifice for Thy prison, O Thou Wronged Stranger! I testify that Thou hast appeared and manifested what was hidden in the knowledge of God, the Lord of existence. And We make mention of all My loved ones and give them glad tidings of the mercy of God, the Lord of the seen and unseen. O loved ones of God! By God, the Truth is with you, but most of the people are heedless. Ye have arisen in the love of God and His remembrance, but most of the people understand not. Leave them in their vain imaginings, placing your trust in God, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal. And We make mention of My handmaidens there in this exalted station. Verily We give them glad tidings of God's loving-kindness and His bounty that hath encompassed existence. O My handmaiden Hajar! Thy name hath come before the Wronged One. He maketh mention of thee with that which shall never perish as long as the kingdom and the heavenly realm endure. Rejoice thou in this Most Great Mention from which the near ones inhale the fragrance of the loving-kindness of the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. And We make mention of My handmaiden Begum and give her glad tidings of that which hath been sent down for her at this time from the Pen of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. O My handmaiden! Rejoice thou in My mention of thee, then remember thy Lord at eventide and dawn. The glory from Us be upon the loved ones of God and His friends, and upon His handmaidens who have believed and attained when the Call was raised between earth and heaven. We bear witness that they are among the triumphant men and women in My \[destined\] Tablet. O Zayn! Loving-kindness appeareth and is visible as the sun. Ask thou of God that He may make the servants ready for the recognition of the Luminary of Truth and the Ocean of Verses. That one should write replies to the letters of some of the attaining souls. The Most Exalted Pen moveth by night and day. We beseech God that He may enable His servants to drink of that which floweth and streameth from its fountain. The Command is in His hand and He is the Compassionate, the Generous.

O Abdul-Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the One dawning from the horizon of the heaven of proof! O Abdul-Husayn, upon thee be My Glory! The Holy Forerunner utters this word, saying: "I have written a gem in His remembrance - verily He cannot be indicated by My indication nor by what was revealed in the Bayan." Should one, through divine grace, drink from the ocean of meanings concealed within this word, he would become aware of the greatness of the Cause. Today the friends of God, who in the Tablets are designated and known as the Party of God, must turn from the river of names to the ocean of meanings. The deniers among the people of the Bayan have not, to this day, recognized the station of this Day. They remain occupied with former names and former words. At times they engage in misinterpretation, and at times they cling to names. Blessed is the soul who, by divine power, has transcended names and attained to that which is befitting this Day. They deny the station which He declares cannot be known through Him or what was revealed in the Bayan, measuring it by their own vain imaginings. Sometimes through mention of Ali, sometimes through mention of the Mirror and the like, they deprive the helpless servants from the straight path and the mighty announcement. For one thousand two hundred years they said "O Ali," and in the end they martyred One through Whose word a thousand Alis could be created. By the life of God, such oppression was manifested by that party as had not been seen from the beginning of the world until now. They cursed Him from all pulpits, and now again Hadi Dawlatabadi is occupied with organizing such a party. Let someone for God's sake tell him: these same words existed before - what was their result? Was anything seen to result except infidelity and cursing and reviling from the pulpits?

O thou who gazest toward My horizon! Hear My call from the precincts of My prison. Verily it draws thee to a station wherein the Tongue of Glory proclaims: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Bestower! Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and He hath revealed for thee from the treasuries of His Most Exalted Pen that which nothing in all things can equal, as the Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness in this most sublime station. Say: O people of the Furqan! The All-Merciful hath come with a sovereignty before which all parties are powerless. Cast aside what is with the people and take what ye are commanded by God, the Mighty, the Bestower. The carpet of idle fancies hath been rolled up. By God! The Sun of Certitude hath dawned from the horizon of the world by the command of God, the Lord of Lords. Say: What ye possess will not profit you today. Turn ye toward the Most Sublime Horizon with spirit and fragrance. Then, O people of the Bayan, die in your wrath! He Who was hidden in the eternity of eternities hath appeared, and He Who was recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books and Tablets hath come. By God! Neither your clamor nor the murmuring of those who have disbelieved in the Beginning and the Return can hinder Him. Say: This is God's Day, did ye but know it, and this is a Day wherein naught is mentioned save Him, did ye but perceive it. He is not known through names; rather, they are created by His command.

We make mention of thy father and ask God to confirm him in steadfastness in this Cause, whereby the hearts of those who have disbelieved in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, have been shaken. We make mention of thy brother and give him the glad tidings of My remembrance of him, that he may thank his Lord, the Possessor of existence. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to enable him to make mention of Him and praise Him among His servants with wisdom and utterance. Verily He is powerful over what He willeth through His word "Be" and it is.

O Abdul-Husayn! At the end of the letter We make mention of thee again. Blessed art thou for having shattered the idols of vain imaginings and turned toward God, the Lord of the Unseen and the Seen. By the life of God! Those who have turned away from the Truth, these are the worshippers of vain imaginings in this praiseworthy station. Aid thy Lord with the hosts of utterance, placing thy trust in God, the Possessor of the Promised Day. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon those whom neither the doubts of the world, nor its ornaments, nor its vicissitudes have withheld from this irrevocable Cause.

In the Name of the Peerless Lord!

O Muhammad-Qabli-Sadiq! Through the effulgent rays of the Sun of Revelation the world is illumined, yet the people of the veil remain heedless and veiled from Him. The mention of this blessed Day hath been recorded in most of the divine Books, and all were expectant; yet when the morn appeared and the breezes of God wafted, He found all wrapped in slumber, save whom God willeth. The wine of vainglory hath debarred men from the Sun of Revelation. Consider those souls who are known and honored by the name of Truth: in the night season and during the day they are occupied with the mention of the Lord of all being, and in mosques and temples they voice His praise; yet when the Ocean of Revelation became manifest and the Promised Beauty emerged from behind the clouds, all clung to their own idle fancies and were debarred from Him. Would that they had been content with this! Nay, they preferred the ornaments of the people to the verses of God, and suspicions and idle fancies to the Sun of knowledge and certitude. The punishment of their deeds in this vain life shall soon seize them through God's justice. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful.

Today the divine Balance hath appeared in the form of the word "yea." Whosoever attaineth unto it, his works shall be adorned with the ornament of acceptance and be reckoned among the dwellers of the highest paradise; and whoso is deprived, shall be mentioned among the people of the lowest depths. By the life of God! He who hath turned to Him, recognized and believed in Him is among those endowed with vision in the Most Sublime Vision. The Lord of Destiny beareth witness to this in His mighty prison. He who hath turned away cannot be truly credited with possessing sight, hearing, or understanding. To this hath testified the Lord of creation on the Day of Reckoning, yet the people are in strange delusion.

Rejoice thou that thy call hath attained unto the ears of the Lord of Names, Who hath answered thee through this perspicuous Tablet. We have heard thy cry and the sighing of thy heart in thy separation from God, the Lord of the worlds, and We have heard thy lamentation for My Name, the H. Verily thy Lord is the All-Hearing, the Answerer. Blessed is he, and his brother, and he who was named Kazim - they whom the clamor of the people could not withhold from the Truth, and who drank the choice wine of steadfastness from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous.

O My Name, the H! By the life of God, the denizens of the highest Paradise have lamented at what befell thee, and the Most Great Spirit hath cried out in the morning and the evening. Blessed is the tongue that hath uttered thy mention, the heart that hath turned toward thee, the visitor who hath presented himself before thy resting-place, the seeker who hath sought thy station and visited thee with that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken - a bounty from His presence. He is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing.

Praise be to God that thou hast been assisted to recognize the Truth, to love the Truth, and to praise the chosen ones of God who have cast the world behind their backs and have taken what they were bidden by the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Grieve thou not over anything. Place thy trust in God in all matters. He, verily, hath remembered thee and will continue to remember thee, and is with thee under all conditions. Nothing escapeth His knowledge, and He is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing.

Say: Praise be to Thee, O Thou by Whose Name all things between earth and heaven were attracted, and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke forth in the most exalted station, inasmuch as Thou didst acquaint me with Thy Most Great Book and Thy Most Glorious Tablet which appeared in the name of the Most Glorious in the kingdom of creation, and didst cause me to hear Thy sweetest call when the Sun of Manifestation shone forth from Thine exalted horizon. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, directing myself to Thy countenance, speaking Thy praise, and awaiting the wonders of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee by the Most Great Word whereby the heaven was rent asunder, to make me in all conditions detached from all else save Thee and clinging to the hem of Thy bounty. Thou, verily, art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Then write down for me, O my God, that which Thou hast written for Thy chosen ones who have attained in Thy days and whom none of Thy creatures have preceded. Verily, Thou art He Whom nothing can frustrate and no affair can hinder. Thou doest what Thou pleasest by Thy sovereignty and ordainest what Thou willest by Thy power. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.

O Muhammad-Quli, upon thee be My glory! He is God, exalted be His station in the realm of possibilities. O Muhammad-Quli, upon thee be My glory! I bear witness that they who have turned to My horizon, attained My presence and drunk the choice wine of revelation from the hand of My bounty - they have achieved that which was the hope of those who are nigh and the sincere ones from time immemorial. The Word of thy Lord cannot be compared with the books of the people, with what they possess, or with what lay hidden in the treasuries of kings and sovereigns. Thus hath the Supreme Pen raised its shrill voice and mentioned thee on this blessed, mighty and wondrous Day.

His honor 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, who was present before the gate of My grandeur and before My throne, sent thy letter to the Wronged One. We have answered thee with this evident remembrance, whereby the very rocks have taken flight, let alone the spirits. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful. Blessed is he who hath soared in this atmosphere and heard the rustling of the winds of My loving-kindness and the sound of the wings of the birds of My grace and mercy. He is among the sincere ones in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds.

O Na'im! We have heard thy mention and mentioned thee, and seen thy name. We have revealed for thee that which, were it to be cast upon the mountains, thou wouldst see them speaking in remembrance of God, thy Lord, the Lord of the mighty throne. We have sent down for thee from the heaven of grace that which shall endure as long as the kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Wondrous, shall endure. That which hath befallen you in the path of God hath caused the Pen to lament, and the wrongdoers shall soon see the recompense of their deeds. By the life of God! There hath been ordained for them such chastisement as no tongue can describe. Thy Lord doth testify, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Grieve not over anything. The days shall pass away, and sovereignty shall remain with God and His loved ones who have borne hardships in His love and good-pleasure, whom neither the might of the oppressors nor the clamor of the aggressors hath deterred from drawing nigh unto His holy and luminous horizon. O Na'im! God hath favored thee on this Day whereon the Wronged One hath desired to turn in another direction by His command, and He is the Ancient Commander. They who have held fast to My strong cord, turned to the lights of My countenance and entered beneath the shadow of My loving-kindness see themselves detached from all save God and from the names which the deniers have adopted for themselves as lords beside God. Thus hath the Pen spoken while the people were in evident doubt.

Say: O company of deniers! Die in your wrath. Neither your remembrances, nor your children, nor your deeds, nor your words, nor your orientation shall profit you except through holding fast to this Cord, by whose movement all created things were moved. The very atoms bear witness to this, if ye be of them that deny. Say: O scheming one! Steal not My verses nor alter them. Be fair concerning that which hath been sent down in truth from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Thy calumnies shall not profit thee, nor thy embellishments, nor shall the Baqir or any other benefit thee, nor shall it avail thee to hold fast to all things. Thy Lord speaketh the truth, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.

Thou hast not seen thy brother nor associated with him. The world and its adornments have deceived thee as they deceived people before thee. Fear God, then return unto Him. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Loving. We summoned thee unto God, but thou didst turn away after having accepted. Repent unto God Who created thee and fashioned thee, and be not of those women who witnessed, then denied and broke God's covenant, the Lord of what was and what shall be. How many a maidservant hath heard, accepted and drunk the choice wine of revelation from the hand of the bounty of her Lord, the Lord of the earthly realm and the Kingdom! Thus hath the tongue of grandeur spoken as a grace from Him. He is verily the Mighty, the Kind, the Forgiving.

O Muhammad-Quli! We have desired to mention thee once again at the end of the Tablet, and We say: The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon those with thee, and upon every servant who hath turned and every maidservant who hath turned and achieved this Cause whereby the idolaters have lamented and the Evil One hath cried out.

Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having manifested Thyself on this Day unto all things through all names, O Thou Who art possessed of majesty, grandeur and glory, and Who art endowed with power, might and bounty! This is the Day whereon the Tongue of God, the King, the Most High, the Most Exalted, hath spoken from the Kingdom of eternity: "The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the Most High, the Most Glorious!"

Glory be to Thee, O Sender of the winds, Cleaver of the daybreak, Revealer of verses and Manifester of clear proofs! All things proclaim that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, the King, the Almighty, the Most High, the Most Great.

Glory be to Thee, O Creator of the heavens, Fashioner of names, Who hast manifested Thyself unto all things through Thy Most Great Name, whereby the Dove hath warbled upon the branches that sovereignty in all times belongeth unto God, our Lord, the All-Merciful!

Glory be to Thee, O King of eternity, Sovereign of nations and Quickener of moldering bones! Praise be to Thee - praise such that the tongues of all created things are powerless to describe, praise whereby the rains of Thy mercy descend upon all contingent beings, and the lights of Thy countenance are manifested unto all who are in earth and heaven.

Praise be to Thee - praise whereby every infirm one uttereth Thy praise, every remote one draweth nigh unto the seat of Thy mighty throne, and every thirsty one is guided to the Salsabil of Thy mercy and the Kawthar of Thy grace. Praise whereby the fragrances of the garment of Thy mercy are wafted over all who dwell on earth and in heaven, and the sweet scents of the roses of Thy paradise are diffused among the dwellers of the cities of eternity, and whereby every name uttereth Thy praise and glory.

Praise be to Thee - praise whereby the hearts of Thy loved ones are strengthened, such that the veils of creation prevent them not from beholding the horizon of Thy favors, nor doth the tyranny of any oppressor frighten them from gazing upon the wondrous dawning of the lights of Thy countenance. Praise whereby the remembrance of aught else but Thee is effaced from the hearts of Thy servants, and they are aided to promote Thy Cause and spread Thy remembrance throughout all regions.

O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Beautiful Names and Most Exalted Attributes, and I beseech Thee by them who have soared in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and Thy good-pleasure, who have ascended on the wings of trust and detachment unto the Dayspring of Thy Name, the All-Merciful, and by the blood that hath been shed in Thy path, and by the sighs that have been uttered in Thy love, that Thou accept from us on this Day whatsoever we have wrought in Thy path.

This is the Day whereon the All-Merciful hath manifested Himself unto all names - how blessed are we in what God hath bestowed upon us! This is the Day whereon the Hidden Mystery hath appeared, governing what was and what will be - how blessed are we in what God hath bestowed upon us! This is the Day whereon the mighty idol hath been shattered - how blessed are we in what God hath bestowed upon us! This is the Day whereon the All-Merciful hath manifested Himself unto all creation - how blessed are we in what the All-Merciful hath bestowed upon us!

This is the Day whereon Pharaoh was drowned and Moses beheld the Beauty of God, the Most Glorious - how blessed are we in what God hath bestowed upon us! This is the Day whereon the idol of vain imaginings hath been shattered by the power of our Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing - how blessed are we in what God hath bestowed upon us! This is the Day whereon the waves of the Most Great Sea have appeared at the Most Great Scene - how blessed are we in what God hath bestowed upon us! This is the Day whereon all things have been called to the presence of their Lord, the Most High - how blessed are we in what God hath bestowed upon us!

This is the Day whereon everything hath spoken as spake the Tongue of Power at the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing - how blessed are we in what God hath bestowed upon us! This is the Day whereon the Most Exalted Pen hath appeared from the fingers of your Lord, the Most High - how blessed are we in what God hath bestowed upon us! This is the Day whereon fingers have rent asunder the veils of the people of heaven, and behind them hath risen the Sun of eternity, inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen: "The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the Almighty, the Most High, the Most Glorious!" - how blessed are we in what God hath bestowed upon us!

By God! The Hidden One hath appeared and God hath come upon crimson clouds, surrounded by the denizens of the highest Paradise - how blessed are we in what God hath bestowed upon us! This is the Day whereon the sincere ones have ascended to the most exalted chambers and the unitarians have beheld the Beauty of God, the Most Glorious - how blessed are we in what God hath bestowed upon us!

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and Power

Praise be to God Who has established Himself upon the throne once in the Ridvan, and again in the garden, and at times in the mansion which was the Greatest Scene by virtue of the One Who is the Lord of Power having turned towards it, and once He established Himself upon the seat of His Most Glorious Name amidst the Concourse on High, and at times upon the crimson spot which was designated in the Book of God as the heaven of this heaven. Exalted, exalted be His all-encompassing power, exalted, exalted be His pervading Will, and exalted be His dominion that exercises sovereignty over all things, and exalted be His Name, the All-Powerful over all names. I bear witness with my feeble tongue to that which the Supreme Pen has testified in the Kingdom of Utterance that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Gracious.

And furthermore, you had written that after the arrival of the blessed Tablets, gatherings were held for several days during the afternoon hours and the friends were engaged in the remembrance of God. These matters were presented in detail at the Most Holy Court. He said: "Blessed are they who have fulfilled the Covenant of God and His Testament, and blessed are they who have taken the choice wine of utterance and drunk it in His Name, the All-Merciful. God willing, the beloved friends and seekers of the Ka'bah of the Intended One should at all times be enabled to partake of the Kawthar of divine knowledge and be confirmed in the remembrance of Truth which is, in reality, the water of life for the body of contingent beings. Verily, He is the Confirmer, the All-Wise."

I beseech and implore God, exalted and mighty be He, to confirm you at every moment with a fresh confirmation so that you may entirely occupy yourself night and day in praise of the Beloved of the worlds.

Regarding what was mentioned about Safi, upon him be 966 \[Baha'u'llah\], his mention has always been and continues to be at the Most Holy Court. In truth, he attained the most exalted station, for he took and drank the most pure and luminous choice wine from the hand of the Sovereign of the unseen and the seen. The Truth Himself called him and he responded, and this is a station whose mention shall never be erased from the Tablet of Creation. Blessed is he, again blessed is he, and blessed is she who dwelt in the sanctuary of God for successive years and was named "Guest" by the All-Merciful. In any case, their mention has been and continues to be in the divine pavilion of infallibility and among the people of the divine sanctuary. A hundred thousand thanks that they have reached this degree and attained this station. Convey these details that were mentioned on behalf of this evanescent one to them.

And regarding what was written about the Blessed Place, it was presented. This is what the Beloved uttered: "God willing, may the Truth, exalted be His glory, not withhold His blessing from it and may He enable the friends to preserve, support and serve it. Verily, He is the Ordainer, the All-Wise."

And regarding the mention that was made of Master Husayn the Coppersmith, it was presented before His presence. He said: "O Husayn! We have accepted thy turning if thou wilt be of the steadfast. He writes for whomsoever He willeth the reward of attaining His presence. Verily, He is the Powerful. Verily, He seeth and knoweth and He is the All-Informed. Verily, he who turneth toward God, verily he turneth toward Him and He commandeth him that which profiteth him and verily He is the All-Knowing. If thou wert to ponder and look with the eye of the heart upon what hath been revealed for thee, thou wouldst find therein that whereby thou wouldst soar in the atmosphere of thy Lord's will, the Sanctified, the Powerful, the Speaker, the Transcendent, the Mighty, the Inaccessible."

With expressions of praise, glory and splendor, I present my greetings to all the friends. Please convey mention of this evanescent one's annihilation and sincerity to all. And further, this servant conveys on behalf of all the friends of this land greetings and praise to you and all the beloved ones. The glory of God and the praise of all atoms be upon you and your family.

O spiritual friend, his honor Nabil ibn Nabil, upon him be 96 \[Baha'u'llah\], the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful - may they take note.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power

Praise be to God Who illumined the horizons with the light shining forth from the heaven of Hijaz, whereby the world was illumined and nations were enlightened, and that which was hidden in knowledge and recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds, was made manifest. Oceans of prayers and peace, and seas of mercy, glory and praise be upon Him and upon His family and companions, through whom was established what the All-Merciful revealed in the Furqan, and through whom were raised the banners of guidance among all peoples, and upon those who followed Him and acted according to the Book of God, Master of the beginning and end.

This servant was attracted by your mention, praise and exposition, and what flowed from your pen in praise of God and His chosen ones, His pure ones and His ambassadors. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to enable this servant to remember Him Who remembered him, and praise Him Who praised him, and to confirm him in steadfastness in His love, His remembrance and His Cause. He is the One to Whose power testify all who are in the kingdom of earth and heaven, and to Whose sovereignty bear witness all who are in the unseen and visible realms. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O beloved of my heart! Your love has ever dwelt in my heart and your remembrance has flowed from my tongue. I beseech God to assist you in all conditions and to aid you in your works, deeds, commerce and endeavors. Truly, humility, submissiveness, seeking and supplication are from the servant, and the answer is from God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all in the heavens and earth.

If they desire news of this land: Through God's grace, exalted be His glory, all enjoy the bounty of well-being. One group has attained the greatest steadfastness and drinks from the pure chalice of submission and contentment, while another group rises at times and falls at others, and as for the rest - knowledge is with God, the Lord of all beings. However, we beseech God to assist all in what is intended and to enable them to act according to what is in His Book.

Today in truth the people of God are seen to be encompassed while others are encompassing. As you have observed, they have taken over Islamic lands under various pretexts. The time has come for all to turn to the Self-Sufficing Lord with utmost lamentation, crying and supplication, that perchance the ocean of mercy might surge and the sun of grace might shine forth, and abasement be changed to glory and weakness to strength. Indeed, whatever has befallen and continues to befall the favored community is from themselves, as has been said: "All this is from our own ill-fitting, ungainly form." Consider the former glory of Islam, what station it had attained, and now what abasement has come upon it. I seek God's forgiveness for what I have said and say. Verily He exalts whom He wishes and abases whom He wishes. He gives and withholds. His is the creation and the command, and He is the Strong, the Predominant, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

If wisdom permits, convey greetings and praise to the friends of that land on behalf of this ephemeral one. This servant has sought and continues to seek confirmation and success for all. The command is in His hand. He does what He wills and decrees what He desires. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

Peace, mercy, glory and splendor be upon you and upon God's sincere servants. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.

The paper, rose seeds, narcissus and hyacinth bulbs that were sent have arrived. God willing, the former will be honored with writing and the latter with planting. The decree belongs to God, Master of destiny.

O Mirza Rafi' in the land of Alif! In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Exalted! O people of Baha! Raise up the pavilion of holiness upon the shore of this Sea, unto which all seas flow and upon which sail the ships of the Cause by leave of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Choosing. Board these ships, O people, and tarry not, for this is what hath been ordained for you in the heaven of destiny, in the Tablet of the Command which God hath preserved from the gaze of all eyes. Say: The Tree of Eternity hath been made verdant through the remembrance of God and His glory. Blessed is he who seeketh shelter beneath its shade and tasteth of its fruits which appear at all times by the command of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Say: O people, hesitate not in the Cause of God, but look with the eye of fairness. By God! It hath appeared with a sovereignty that hath encompassed all contingent things, and none deny it save every froward denier. Purify yourselves from the defilement of allusions, and cling not unto them as did the people of the Furqan before, and before them the people of the Gospel, and before them the people of the Torah. Thus do We set forth the matter for you now, that ye may take heed, O people of insight. Say: O people, by God! When the sun ariseth the stars fade, and likewise when the breezes of the All-Merciful blow, the lamp is extinguished of itself. This is not of its own accord, but by leave of One mighty and compelling. Witness ye the breeze - though it extinguisheth the lamp, yet by it are all contingent things given life. Thus observe ye and ponder what issueth from the Pen of Command, O people of understanding. Beware lest ye doubt Him by Whose command the seas were made to surge, the trees to bear fruit, the suns to shine, the heavens to be raised up, the mountains to be fixed, and the Dove to warble upon the branches of the Tree of Holiness behind the veils and coverings. Is there any doubt concerning God, or concerning His power which hath encompassed all contingent things? Fear God, O people, and be mindful of this Day wherein the breezes of the Command waft from every direction. Purify yourselves from those who have disbelieved in what they had believed in, and who denied the proof of God and His evidence after He appeared in truth, around Whom circle the suns and moons. Though We find none on earth possessed of insight, yet make thou thy presence the presence of God, then open the eye of thy heart and observe what hath proceeded from the Tongue of Eternity in these days wherein the idolaters have encompassed Him from every side, and the clouds of grandeur rain down in grief for Him. Perchance thou shalt discover the root of the matter and what hath befallen the Youth from those who were created by His word, and thou shalt aid Him to the extent thou art able, though He hath never sought help from anyone save God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Were one possessed of insight, he would cry out between earth and heaven saying: "O people! By what proof have ye denied this Beauty Who hath dawned from the horizon of holiness with sovereignty and power? If ye believed in Ali, by God, he weepeth now in the Most Exalted Companion by reason of what hath befallen His Most Glorious Beauty in His latter manifestation, Who hath appeared with all the signs and from Whose Pen flow forth ordinances and mysteries." And he saith: "O people! Fear God and cling not to the idols of your desires. By God! This is My Beauty, then My Manifestation, and My Power, and My Sovereignty. He hath appeared unto you greater than what I revealed unto you, and this is testified to by the tongues of all created things, and beyond them the Tongue of God, the King, the Mighty, the All-Choosing." Thus have We imparted unto thee that thou mayest hear the word of truth, that thou mayest arise to aid Him Who hath no helper and Who hath fallen into the depths of this pit, wherefrom the feet of the righteous and the chosen ones are cut off. And the Glory be upon thee and upon whosoever hath turned unto God and turned away from every disbelieving infidel.

O thou who art present before the Throne! There hath been sent down for him who hath been named 'Ali, that he may arise to serve the Cause and be God-fearing in His religion. He is the Rememberer and the Remembered. O 'Ali! Bear thou witness within thyself that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who appeared with the name 'Ali before Nabil is verily the Manifestation of His Self, the Dayspring of His Cause, the Treasury of His knowledge, the Rising Place of His Revelation, the Repository of His signs, and the Source of His mercy unto all worlds. And He Who hath appeared and shone forth with His Most Luminous, Most Glorious Name in His latter Manifestation is for His glory, then His might and grandeur over all who are in the heavens and the earth. Through Him light was distinguished from darkness, and the fortunate from the wretched. Through Him was established the Temple of the Cause upon a throne of mighty glory, and through Him every ignorant one ascended to the Kingdom of knowledge and utterance, while every learned one returned to the nethermost depths. Through Him were the names and their kingdoms transformed, such that darkness was changed into light and light into darkness. Through Him descended the hosts of revelation from the heaven of decree, and the matter was decided by One mighty and powerful. Thus have We adorned the heavens of the Tablet with the ornament of remembrance and utterance, and sanctified it from the knowledge of every accursed satan. And thou, O servant, hearken unto what God hath revealed unto thee from the direction of pre-existence, then arise to serve the Cause and be among those who arise with such arising whereby all things shall arise to serve and assist God. Without this, it beseemeth not those who are established upon a holy and secure seat. By God the Truth! Whoso today yieldeth up a breath in love of his Lord and detachment from all else, God shall make him influential among the realities of things - and none shall comprehend this save every detached and discerning one. When thou attainest unto this station, thou shalt seek whatsoever thou willest through My Most Exalted, Most Great Name, and shalt accomplish what thou desirest through the name of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. By My life! Whoso attaineth unto this maturity shall speak only for God, move only by God, rest only by His command, walk only in the paths of His good-pleasure, witness naught but His beauty, and fear no one even should all creation combine against him. O thou who believest in God! When thou readest the Tablet of thy Lord and art seized by the breezes of the Spirit that waft from the direction of the verses from the traces of thy Lord, arise to teach by Our command and be not among the patient ones. For the honor of the servant lieth only in his remembrance of his Lord. Thus hath the matter been ordained for the near servants of God. Deliver unto the people the remembrance of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, and fear not the manifestations of Satan. He will guard thee from the hosts of devils. When thou openest thy tongue in utterance, then shall the Holy Spirit confirm thee, and the Spirit of Glory shall teach thee from the direction of eternity, and the Spirit of Truth shall speak upon thy tongue. Thus have We commanded thee and given thee leave that thy heart may be strengthened and thou mayest be in mighty assurance. Beware lest thou cast the Cause of God behind thee and be among the inactive ones. Remind the people with wisdom and utterance, for this is the station of man, and without this it beseemeth not the sincere servants of God. Know thou then that thy brother who journeyed unto God hath entered the seat of thy Lord's throne, stood before His presence, was illumined by the lights of God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Luminous, attained unto the meeting, heard the verses of his Lord, and was among the successful ones. He wrote thy name upon the Tablet and presented it before the Face. When the glances of thy Lord turned unto it, there was sent down for thee from the direction of the throne verses of wondrous glory, and We sent them unto thee as a mercy from Us upon thee and upon Our assured servants. Glory be upon thee if thou forsakest imitation, ascendest to the heights of unity, and makest thyself purely devoted unto God, the King, the Sovereign, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O \`Abdu'r-Rahim! In the name of the one true Friend. I pray that through the grace and favors of the Lord of Names you may be the cup-bearer of the wine of immortality that flows from the fountainhead of the Supreme Pen. At all times, drink and give others to drink of this life-giving water in the name of the All-Merciful. Today it is incumbent and obligatory upon souls like yourself to serve the Cause, and His service has been and will continue to be the teaching of His Cause amongst humanity. Consider the heedlessness of the peoples - though the Most Great Luminary shines at its zenith, all walk in darkness, oblivious to it, save whom thy Lord willeth, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Blessed is he who hath cast away vain desire and turned unto guidance, detached from all else but God.

This is the Chief of all days and the King thereof. Great is the blessedness of him who hath attained, through the sweet savor of these days, unto everlasting life, and who, with the most great steadfastness, hath arisen to aid the Cause of Him Who is the King of Names. Such a man is as the eye to the body of mankind. Thus hath decreed the Ordainer of destiny. Verily, He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth.

God willing, you must bring to life the decaying bodies through the outpourings of the divine ocean of bounty and the breath of the All-Merciful. At all times strive to give the far one to drink from the Kawthar of nearness and let the deprived one taste the living waters of reunion. For the mercy of God hath taken precedence and will continue to do so. Therefore, with utmost kindness and compassion, you must invite people to the court of the Friend and detach them from all else. Some among the people, with complete deception and guile, have been and continue to be lying in wait for the souls who have accepted the Faith. Be not heedless, and protect the paradise of the hearts of the loved ones from the poisonous winds of the deniers and the treachery of the thieves.

Great is this Day and mighty the Cause, while most people are weak. Where are they who stood firm in the Cause such that neither the tempests of deception nor the storms of the Evil One could move them? And where are they who cast away the world and held fast to the cord of the name of their Lord, the Lord of Names? And where are they who arose to aid the Cause of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise?

O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Hearken unto the call from the Prison wherein speaketh the Dawning-Place of Names: There is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Arise to serve thy Lord in such wise that neither the might of kings nor the whispers of the lowly shall hold thee back. Thus doth command thee He through Whom hath appeared the Kingdom of thy Lord's command, the Mighty, the Powerful.

Say: In the Name of God and by God! Take the chalice of certitude with the hand of assurance in the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Then drink from it at all times in My Name, the All-Encompassing over the worlds. Thou art he whose mention hath moved the Supreme Pen. Know thou the station of this rank and be of the thankful ones. Shun those in whom thou findest words without deeds - they are among the contemptible ones. Were all the peoples of the earth to gather against Me with swords of hatred and rancor, I would not believe any of them regarding their satanic deeds.

Say: O people! Avoid that which ye have been forbidden in the Book of God. Fear God and be not of the heedless ones. Grieve not over anything. Remind the people of that which thou hast been commanded by the Presence. We have willed for thee a station among stations which We shall soon reveal in truth. Verily, He is the Powerful over what He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.

Immerse thyself in the ocean of thy Lord's favors and glorify His wondrous Name. The Glory be upon thee and upon those with thee who show in their faces the radiance of faith in these days of the All-Merciful - they are indeed among the near ones.

O Husayn, upon thee be the Glory of God! In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted! God willing, mayest thou at all times and under all conditions abide beneath the shade of the All-Merciful, occupied in service to the Ancient Beauty amidst the peoples. The gaze of loving-kindness and the glance of favor have ever been directed towards thee. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this and be thou of the grateful ones. Arise to serve the Cause in such wise that neither the contingent happenings of the world nor the whisperings of the idolatrous souls may sadden thee or prevent thee from the remembrance of the Lord of all created things. Observe how this Wronged One is afflicted in the Most Great Prison between two parties. By the truth of His own Self, wert thou to be truly informed of what hath befallen Him, thou wouldst weep with the weeping of them that are bereft. Nevertheless, at all times the stream of wisdom and utterance floweth from the right hand of the throne. Draw near to thy chalice unto Him and fill it, then drink in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful. How many who are distant are with Me in the loftiest heights of detachment, and how many who are near are in a place remote. Thy services are remembered before God and recorded in the divine Tablets. Their reward hath not been and shall not be lost. If certain outward matters have not proceeded according to thy desire, be not saddened. God willing, through divine bounty and merciful grace they shall be set right. Every matter is bound to its time. This is naught but divine wisdom and infinite mercy. Then know thou that Rida hath openly rebelled against God and committed that which none before him hath committed. He hath squandered God's Cause and spread abroad that which the Pen is powerless to mention. Thus have We been afflicted in this mighty Prison. He committed in the Land of Mystery that which caused the Spirit of God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds, to lament. Yet We concealed it, for thy Lord is the Concealer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. They consumed swine's flesh there. We said: Fear God and commit not that which would cause God's Cause to be lost among the Muslim people. Thereby did hatred intensify until fate arrived. Verily thy Lord is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. When Victory saw the signs of death he repented and returned, then passed away at that time. Therefore We forgave him and recorded him among the penitent. And after him Rida appeared and repented of what he had done. Though We found him in hypocrisy, We concealed his affair as a grace from Us. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. When We entered this Prison he committed lewdness and spread the carpet of wine-drinking, showing no shame before God. He rebelled and led astray a number of souls to his deed. Then his sister joined in his actions. Thus do We recount unto thee the truth that thou mayest be among them that are informed. One day she entered before the Presence. We saw her in great drunkenness. When she was forbidden, she left and cried out. Thus were We afflicted by a wicked and most lost people. O servant who gazeth toward God! Thou knowest the ocean of My mercy and the mountains of My tranquility and the heaven of My patience. Observe what deeds they have committed, that despite My mercy which hath preceded and encompassed all the worlds, they have become outcasts. Be not thou grieved by this. Verily thou hast an exalted station with thy Lord. Hold fast to thy connection with Him. He sufficeth thee. Be thou detached from all the worlds. Manifest in thy love for thy Lord a fire that the waters cannot quench and a light that the veils of them that are on earth cannot obscure. This beseemeth thee, for thou art of the people of this luminous station. Thy likeness and those who have believed have appeared before the Presence. We have therefore recorded for thee and for them the reward of them that have attained the presence of their Lord in this manifest Prison. Give thanks unto God for having been mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen, and We have ordained for you the reward of them that have won this noble perspective. Verily the Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon thy family and thy descendants from the presence of One Mighty, Praiseworthy.

In the Name of the one true God, the All-Knowing! O Muhammad! God willing, thou shalt be enkindled like fire in thy love for the All-Merciful, and flow like water beneath His Lote-Tree, spreading far and wide. Praise be to the Goal of all worlds that thou hast attained unto the most great honor and been enabled to serve Him. A servant present before the Wronged One presented in the Most Holy Court the letter which Mirza Ata'u'llah had written to you. Praise be to God, the fragrance of love wafted from it. God willing, they will observe with perfect wisdom and utterance this word which hath appeared from the Dayspring of the All-Merciful's utterance: "Be thou wholly for God, the One, the Single, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting." This blessed word shineth forth like the morning star from the horizon of the heaven of God's Book. \[The remainder of paragraph 1 is already translated above.\]

O 'Ata! Hearken unto the call from the precincts of 'Akka from this Wronged One Who hath borne in God's path what none knoweth save His all-compelling Self, the sovereign Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thy mention was made before the Wronged One and this clear Book was revealed for thee. Consider the divines and what they have committed in My days. We created them and strengthened them to exalt My Cause, yet they pronounced judgment against My Self and against those whose sanctity was attested by the Concourse on High, the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise, and every possessor of a tongue who hath judged fairly in this mighty Cause. They recite the Book while denying its Mother. They make mention of God while issuing decrees against Him. Woe unto them and unto those who followed them without My firm and mighty Command! Did what the leader of the people wrought profit him? Away with him and those who followed him! Did he gain aught from what he did? Nay, by My Most Great Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous! Most strange, passing strange, that the one named after Husayn should slay Husayn - this is what the All-Merciful foretold, yet most of the people are heedless.

In their vain imaginings they intended to extinguish the light of God's Cause, unaware that God's Cause is far too great for such deluded souls to be able to prevent it, extinguish its light, or quench its fire which speaketh in the Blessed Tree. In His blessed name the standard of "He doeth whatsoever He willeth" is raised aloft. The whole world cannot oppose His will. The hosts of earth and heaven cannot withstand His Cause. O 'Ata! God willing, thou shalt speak the praise of the All-Merciful with the utmost joy and radiance, and conduct thyself with perfect wisdom, for the deniers lie in wait to find some pretext and raise the cry of "O shame upon the Law!" Say: O My loved ones! Drink ye the Kawthar of My utterance despite them, and associate with men that they may find a path for themselves to God, the One, the All-Informed. We have commanded and continue to command all to act with wisdom, lest some event occur causing hearts to be troubled. He manifesteth His Cause as He pleaseth through His sovereignty. He is, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful.

Corruption, conflict and disputation are forbidden. All must associate together with utmost love. God willing, the penetrating power of the Word will become manifest in the world. The helper of the Truth hath ever been the Word of Truth and the utterances of detached souls who summon mankind unto the Truth. Glory be upon you and upon the handmaidens of God who have believed in God, the Mighty, the Wise.

O Muhammad! Hearken unto the melody of God that hath descended from the heaven of the Command's might, and rend asunder the veils of idle fancies through the power of the All-Merciful. Make not thy dwelling in the jungle of the world and its ornaments. Empty thy heart and enter the city of maturity. How long wilt thou, like children and youths, remain occupied with the dust of vain imaginings and the clay of idle suppositions? Rend asunder the veils of heedlessness that thou mayest become aware of the Countenance of Oneness that hath dawned from the Orient of glory and grandeur.

O Muhammad! The Word of Truth, like the Existence of Truth, is manifest and evident, radiant and apparent and visible. Therefore, deprive not thine ear from hearing it and prevent not thy heart from knowing it. Enter into the presence of God - and that is the station wherein thou openest the eye of justice, seeing neither right nor left, and with the gaze of fairness and a pure heart thou knowest the Truth by the Truth. In whatever station thou attainest unto this bounty, it is as though thou standest in the presence of God.

O Muhammad! Reflect a while upon the proofs of the Prophets and consider the ways of the Messengers. If thou wert asked by what proof thou didst believe in the former one, and by what proof thou didst turn away from the latter one, what wouldst thou say? Nay, by Him Who holdeth my soul in His hand, thou wouldst find naught to suffice thee and wouldst be in grievous perplexity.

In truth, the favors of God have ever encompassed thee, but when He found thee heedless, He left thee bereft. Now attention is drawn to the former favors shown unto thee, that thou mayest never entrust the reins of vision to another. Enter the most great prospect, which is and shall ever be the station of recognizing the Beauty of the All-Merciful.

O Muhammad! Bind not the spiritual wings with the cords of self and passion, and prevent them not from soaring in the holy atmosphere of the All-Bountiful. I swear by the Beauty of the Most Great Point that the purpose of these utterances is the elevation of the manifestations of names and attributes, that perchance those who are uncertain may enter the arena of mighty certitude and drink of the wine of steadfastness and assurance. For it is observed that certain ones have desired to contaminate the pure essence of unity with the clay of limitation and imitation. Therefore strive that thou mayest deliver thyself from the depths of extinction and enter beneath the shade of the glances of eternity. If thou hearest what God hath counseled thee, verily it shall profit thee in the hereafter and the former life, and apart from this, He is indeed independent of all the worlds.

Reflect a while upon the people of the Furqan (Qur'an), who for one thousand two hundred and seventy years unconsciously rejected some while unknowingly accepted others. At last the fruit that appeared from them was that they suspended the Divine Beauty in the air and martyred Him with the bullets of unbelief. The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people! And now too, if thou observest well, the people of the Bayan are engaged in the same deed. As thou seest, they have all turned toward this All-Knowing Beauty with swords of the tongue and arrows of polytheism from every direction, although He appeared with such clear proof and came with such manifest power that from the beginning that hath no beginning until now, none hath heard or seen the like thereof. Nevertheless, those who were more abject than dust raised objections against Him - evil indeed is that which they do!

In any case, this much is expected: that the people of the Bayan may not make themselves like the people of the Furqan, and that they may not be veiled from the Lord of Mighty Oneness by the limitations of mention and name and description and attribute. Know ye God by God, for whatsoever is besides Him is but a creation in His presence, if ye be of them that know.

In the name of God, exalted be His glory, grandeur and power!

Praise be to the gracious, merciful Lord, Who alone is worthy and deserving, Whose gates of forgiveness are ever-surging, and Whose ocean of pardon and bounty lies before all faces. And blessings and peace be upon those through whom God's verses and ordinances were spread abroad and His sovereignty and commands were made manifest, and upon their families and companions through whom God illumined the world with the light of His oneness and the radiance of His knowledge.

The letter from that honored brother arrived at a time when sorrows over recent events had seized all pillars. As it conveyed news of your well-being, it brought some joy. This servant beseeches his Lord to strengthen and assist you in that which will exalt the names and manifest noble qualities. The purpose of that honored brother's remaining in that land is that human qualities and his station may be spread in that city, and that the fragrance of trustworthiness, religion, chastity, truthfulness, sincerity and faithfulness may be diffused. There is still hope that, God willing, you will arise to make up for what was lost.

Regarding what was mentioned about obtaining permission concerning the person from whom the Nazir (upon him be 66 9 \[Baha'u'llah\]) purchased the papers - that you would identify him and establish that he obtained the papers from him rather than finding them in transit - if this statement truly has basis, certainly make it known and present it to the honored master, His Holiness the Afnan (upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God), so that all may know and understand that you are truthful in your statements and can prove it with clear evidence. If this matter is proven, it would be very good. O brother, I tell you truthfully this matter cannot be overlooked. They are ever observant of justice and fairness. You yourself know that the purpose is to establish harmony and unity between hearts. If this matter is truly proven, one can speak of you and likewise assist in affairs.

The store of the honored Shaykh (upon him be the glory of God) had and has no connection whatsoever to this place. I swear by the Master (may our spirits be sacrificed for Him) that these words are true. Some have supposed it has some connection here - God forbid! His Holiness the Afnan sought permission to open a store purely for business and earning, and permission was granted. And you know that they have made every matter contingent on consultation, and whatever judgment emerges from consultation, they have endorsed and will endorse.

Those like yourself should be the cause of manifesting praiseworthy qualities. They should hold fast to justice, kindness and fairness so that all may attest to that which bespeaks the loftiness of human station. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist you in that which contains good and benefit for yourself and other servants. If you prove this matter according to what you have written, it will bring joy and happiness. But if, God forbid, it is not established and made clear, it will cause endless shame, for mention of you has been good from the earliest days until now and has spread everywhere. Every fair-minded sage and every knowledgeable mystic bears witness to this. In any case, I seek assistance from God, exalted be His glory. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.

My God, my God! You know and see that this servant desires by his mention only the sanctification of Your servants and their purification from what You have forbidden them in Your Book. O Lord! Adorn them with the ornament of trustworthiness, justice, truthfulness and sincerity. Verily You have power over whatsoever You will. There is no God but You, the Forgiving, the Generous.

In the Name of the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing

Praise be to the Beloved Who is worthy and deserving, Who hath quickened and sustained the hearts of the sincere ones and them that are nigh unto Him with the Kawthar of divine knowledge. These are days the like of which have never been witnessed nor recorded in the divine Books, for the Hidden Mystery doth, with hands of bounty, summon all who are in creation to the Most Exalted Wine. Blessed are they who have drunk deep of this call and who have attained with complete certitude and assurance to the revelation of God. The Supreme Pen hath ever called and continueth to call the loved ones to the most exalted horizon at all times. Beseech ye God, exalted and glorified be He, that ye may remain firm in this Cause and not be deprived of this divine table which hath been sent down from the heaven of grace. At all times take your portion through the Name of the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Well is it with him who hath recognized and turned unto Him and hath attained unto the grace of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

Thereafter, thy letter reached the Holy Land and attained unto the Most Great Vista. Concerning what thou didst mention regarding the divine Tablets, that it appeareth therefrom that victory belongeth to the enemies - the intent is other than what thou hast mentioned. Should the loved ones act in accordance with the divine wisdom that hath been revealed in the Tablets, no one would ever prevail against them. Thus hath it been sent down from the Pen of Command, did ye but know it. Praise be to the Beloved of the world that thou hast attained unto His love and thy mention hath flowed from the Supreme Pen. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.

\[Already translated portion about marriage follows\]

O Supreme Pen! Make mention of the loved ones in that land who have cast aside all else but Me and hearkened unto My call and turned unto My face and drunk the choice wine of My revelation and directed their hearts to the horizon of My beauty and held fast to the hem of My bounty and clung to the cord of My favors and soared in the atmosphere of My love and were honored by My commandments and were stirred by the breezes of My days and caught the fragrance of My garment and arose to serve Me and to aid My Cause and spoke My praise and held fast to the wisdom that was sent down from the heaven of My command in the kingdom of My will. Blessed are ye, O loved ones of God! Know ye the value of this mention that hath flowed from the Supreme Pen on this wondrous and glorious Day. By My life! This is a mention that cannot be equalled by what ye have reckoned or what any reckoner may reckon. Rejoice ye therein and place your trust in God, the Mighty, the Wise. Beware lest what is with the people prevent you. Drink ye the wine of steadfastness with the hands of the bounty of your Lord at all times. Should anyone turn with the eye of innate vision toward My most exalted horizon, by God! neither the happenings of creation nor the might of them that have drunk the Zaqqum of vainglory from the cups of heedlessness and passion shall prevent him. They are indeed among the abased ones.

We then make mention of those women who were stirred by the Word of God, and We make mention of their names before the Throne every year, nay every month, nay every hour, nay every moment. He is with them and heareth their cry and seeth what they do in the path of God, the Most High, the Most Great. O people of the letter Kha! By God! The Tongue of Eternity speaketh your mention from this Most Glorious Horizon. Rejoice ye in this joy around which circleth the joy of all in creation. Your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, beareth witness unto this. All glory be upon you from God, the Lord of all the worlds.

He is the All-Manifest, the Speaker, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise

Praise sanctified above the mention of all contingent beings, the comprehension of created things, and the knowledge of existent things, befitteth the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court of Him Whom the tyranny of the oppressors, the calumnies of the slanderers, and the power of the opposers did not prevent or hinder from His purpose and from revelation. Throughout the nights and days the Supreme Pen hath been moving and engaged, detached from all else, in remembrance of the loved ones. That which hath flowed from it is the water of life for those who thirst in the arena of love and affection, and the spirit of life for the companions of grace and guidance. The penetrating influence of the Most Exalted Word hath encompassed the world, and the power of the Most Glorious Pen hath seized all. Say:

My God, my God! Thou seest me aflame with the fire of Thy love, attracted by Thy verses, and translating in the world of utterance that which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy utterance and the atmosphere of Thy Will. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have held fast to Thy cord, through whose movement all created things were moved by Thy power and sovereignty, and I have clung to the hem of Thy grace, through whose light Thy earth and heaven were illumined. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and wisdom, and by the mysteries hidden in the sea of Thy utterance, to aid me to remember Thee and praise Thee, to exalt Thy Cause and manifest Thy Word with wisdom and utterance. Then protect me, O my God, from mine enemies, and make me to be of those whom neither the happenings of the world nor the chains of the wicked have prevented from drawing nigh unto Thee and turning toward the lights of Thy countenance. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Most Generous.

Thy letter was read before the face of the Wronged One. Praise be to God, the fragrance of love, affection, humility and devotion wafted from it. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to protect thee and cause thee to attain unto that which hath previously been sent down from the Supreme Pen. None can reject His command or repel that which hath been revealed from the heaven of His decree. He is, verily, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

Concerning thy mention of a certain person at the time his spirit was separated from his body: all events that have occurred have not been without purpose or reason. If thou wouldst reflect upon the deeds and deserts of certain souls, thou wouldst testify that whatsoever hath happened or will happen is pure justice, nay rather, pure bounty. And that which was witnessed, or will be witnessed, regarding the seizing of the existence of negation at the time of its return to its place - this too was pure bounty, for that deceitful dissembler acted, both outwardly and inwardly, in such wise that others besides God are incapable of reckoning it. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to exalt His Cause through thee and to reveal unto thee that which He hath sent down in thy Book. Verily He is the Powerful, the Protector of all who are in the heavens and on earth.

The Truthful, the Trustworthy hath said and continueth to say: "His mercy hath preceded the earth and heaven." Should any soul reflect with penetrating vision upon the deeds of certain ones, he would testify that whatsoever hath occurred or will occur hath been from the ocean of bounty, mercy and bestowal, and were justice and desert to be considered, God forbid, its reckoning would not be possible. Reflect upon the matters that occurred in this past year in the great city: despite the utmost kindness shown to that person, out of pure greed and avarice he acted in such wise that were justice to be meted out, the scribes of the world would find themselves powerless to record his punishment. Through the instigation of the Sheikh of Yazd and his chief he acted in such manner as became clear and evident to the discerning ones among those souls. And likewise were the deeds of that heedless returning soul. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid His servants to return unto Him. Verily He is the Powerful over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Pardoner, the Merciful.

O divine friend, his honor Aqa Abdullah, upon him be the glory of his Lord... He is God, exalted be His station, to Whom belong greatness and majesty.

Praise sanctified above mention and utterance befitteth and beseemeth the Purpose of all contingent beings, Who through His perfect power made manifest the words of the Preserved Tablet in human temples and sent them forth to the arena of the world, and through those sacred and luminous temples illumined and enlightened the world. He sent forth Moses with the rod of Command and the white hand of knowledge. All people arose to oppose Him, yet this only increased the loss of the wrongdoers. And afterward the cloud of mercy was once again raised up and the heaven of bounty adorned. He sent forth the Spirit (Christ) to summon all the world to His oneness, for acknowledgment of this oneness is the cause of fellowship and unity among the peoples of the world. And when the light of unity encompassed the earth and overcame darkness, all were seen as one soul. At that time perfect peace appeared and became manifest, and the temple of justice was established upon the throne of appearance. Then was there seen in the earth neither crookedness nor abasement. And after opposition and objection, at the second level and station, the blessed word "We strengthened them with a third" appeared from behind the will of the All-Merciful, and the Sun of Batha (Muhammad) shone forth from the horizon of creation. Again the people of hypocrisy broke God's covenant and arose with all their might to extinguish the light, imagining they would be able to accomplish this. But verily He, exalted be He, showed them their own powerlessness until His light was perfected in all lands and the banners of His name were raised throughout all regions. Exalted be His dominion and exalted be His power!

I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to strengthen weak eyes with the light of His bounty that they may behold the Sun of Manifestation and gaze upon its horizon. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. No thing can frustrate Him and no matter can prevent Him. He commandeth through His sovereignty whatsoever He desireth. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Thereafter thy letter arrived and brought joy and delight. God willing, thou hast ever drunk and wilt ever drink from the cup of the irfan of the Beloved Who perisheth not, and hast caused others to drink therefrom. Regarding what thou didst write about his honor the Letter S, upon him be the glory of God - it is incumbent upon him to be circumspect, that is, not to believe every statement nor accept every claim. This blessed word hath shone forth from the dayspring of the heaven of utterance, written to one of the loved ones - exalted be His utterance: "Believe not every speaker, trust not in every newcomer, enter not every house, and hearken not unto every claimant." For it hath been observed and continues to be observed that the liar adorns himself in the garment of truthfulness, and the one who turneth away displayeth himself in the robe of the one who advanceth. In no circumstance should wisdom be relinquished. Any Jew who becomes aware will certainly arise in enmity and intend harm. Association with Jews should take place only externally, without eating or drinking. It behooveth you to conceal the light of justice from every oppressor and transgressor. Assuredly \[...\] become aware and \[...\] unto God and be turned toward God. Convey this ephemeral one's greetings to his honor. I beseech God to preserve you in all conditions through His hand of bounty. Verily He is the Strong, the Powerful, the Mighty.

All the friends send remembrance and greetings, and they beseech God, exalted be His glory, for your protection and wellbeing. Glory and spirit and radiance be upon you both and upon all who have turned to God, the Mighty, the Wise. And blessings and peace be upon him with whose name \[...\] was sealed, and upon his family and companions.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and Power

O Mirza Maq?ud!

Praise be sanctified above the realms of meaning and utterance unto the Beloved of all possibility, Who is worthy and deserving, for by His blessed name the banner of "He doeth whatsoever He willeth" hath been raised and planted in the kingdom of creation. Exalted be His greatness and glorified be His majesty! There is none other God but Him, the Powerful, the Mighty.

Thereafter, thy letter reached this Wronged One of the world in the Most Great Prison, and as it indicated thy well-being, it brought joy. God willing, in all conditions - coming and going, turning and advancing - may it be for God, in God, and unto God. O Maq?ud! I swear by the Sun of Justice which is concealed behind the clouds of oppression that there hath been and is no purpose save the attainment of the servants to their highest stations. Nevertheless, there hath befallen this Wronged One that which no one hath seen or heard. I call them unto the light while they call Me unto the fire. We beseech God, exalted be He, to judge between us with truth. Verily He is the Commander, the Just, the Wise.

Both before and after, mention of thee hath been made in this Prison. We beseech God, glorified be His majesty, to aid thee in that which He loveth and pleaseth, and to protect thee from the oppressors and transgressors of the earth. Thou hadst mentioned bewilderment. In one station bewilderment is highly praiseworthy. The Seal of the Prophets hath said: "Lord, increase my bewilderment in Thee." However, regarding outward matters, keep thy gaze fixed upon this blessed word which, like the Most Great Luminary, hath dawned from the horizon of the heaven of wisdom. He saith: "The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with two luminaries: consultation and compassion." In every matter consult with souls who are assured, tranquil, content and pleasing to God, and act upon that which is found preferable. Verily He speaketh the truth and guideth the way. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beautiful.

This Wronged One remembereth thee in the midst of sorrows, and were We to mention that which hath befallen and continueth to befall, it would surely cause grief to overtake the friends. Therefore silence is preferable. In these days adverse winds are blowing in this land. We conclude Our words at this point with: There is none other God but Him, and he who holdeth fast unto patience and forbearance is among the triumphant ones in the perspicuous Book. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

Thy second letter which thou hadst sent from the Holy Land arrived and what was mentioned and written therein was observed and presented before His presence. He said: Write: "O Maq?ud! We have heard thy call and hearkened unto thy lamentation and sighing in thy longing and eagerness. Praise be to God that the fragrance of love was wafting from every word. God willing, may this station endure. The servant present hath repeatedly recited what thou hadst composed. Thou hast been mentioned before the Wronged One and the glances of grace and kindness have been directed towards thee. Man is great; his aspiration too must be great in reforming the world and bringing comfort to nations. We beseech God to assist thee in that which befitteth the station of man. In all conditions, keep thy gaze fixed upon wisdom, for certain among the possessors of ulterior motives have been and are attempting - Glory be to God! - to attribute to this holy station, which hath desired naught save love, fellowship, the development and betterment of the world and humankind, that which causeth the tongue and pen to be ashamed to mention. We have remembered and do remember thee, and We beseech Him, exalted be He, to protect thee through the hands of power and might, and to acquaint thee with that which shall profit thee in the Hereafter and in this world. Verily He is the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below, and the Master of all humanity. There is none other God but Him, the Powerful, the Mighty." God willing, this Wronged One is among the faithful and hath not forgotten nor will forget thee.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and Power

Praise befits the One sought by all, Who has ordained the good news of the health of friends to be among the finest blessings of the world, and Who has renewed and continues to renew the world through pure and goodly tidings that are the cause of joy and delight. Praise be unto Him, again praise be unto Him. And blessings and peace be upon His Prophets and chosen ones, and upon Him with whom prophethood began and ended, and upon His family and companions, an everlasting peace forever.

And now, the letter of that spiritual friend has made old things new and withered things fresh. It was like an agile sweeper, for it swept away the straw and stubble of care and grief and spread the carpets of joy and delight. In truth it was not a sweeper but a spiritual messenger, for the fragrance of love was inhaled from it. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid that honored friend and make him the recipient of special favors, together with health and wellbeing and blessing and wealth and ability. After reading and becoming informed of its contents, I turned in supplication and presented it before His presence. He said: "O Ali, upon thee be My peace and My glory. Thy letter arrived and the servant present mentioned what thou didst mention. It was right and correct. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid thee and to set right all thine affairs. Be thou not sorrowful in any way. Verily He is the One Who sets right the affairs of His servants. Verily He hath power over all things."

As to what thou didst write regarding the property at the door of the house which is with the peasants, that whatever they have should be taken, whether livestock or other things that may exist - after this matter was presented He said: "O Ali, fix thy gaze upon the horizon of justice and fairness. Action must not depart from mercy and loving-kindness. Therefore if means exist there is no objection to taking payment, but in their absence thou must be patient. In all cases consideration for the poor is necessary before the Wronged One. Take what they are able to give and obtain promissory notes for the remainder. O Ali, mercy hath preceded and the form of compassion standeth present before His face. God is witness that were it not for this gathering, We would not take a penny. Take what is reasonable in this Cause of Mine. This is what We have counseled Our loved ones and friends before and after. Verily He is the Protector of the doers of good."

"As to thine own debts, act as thou wishest, for thou art in debt and no blame resteth upon thee. Grieve not over this debt. For years this Wronged One was in debt and no one knew of it. Days and nights passed in prison with no sustenance at hand. Through patience and forbearance and resignation and trust the days came to an end. According to the servant present, the essence of food attributed to God was present, for in the noble tradition it is said: 'Hunger is God's food, by which He giveth life to the bodies of the truthful.'"

"As to what was written about barley, it is not necessary since good barley can be obtained here. But as for wheat, it would be good if whatever amount possible could be obtained from there or elsewhere and sent. This too only if possible, otherwise no."

O my God, my Lord and my Master! I beseech Thee by the Mother Book and by the Preserved Tablet and by the hearts of Thy Prophets which Thou hast made repositories of Thy utterance and treasuries of Thy remembrance, to aid him who hath turned to Thee and dwelt in Thy vicinity for successive years. O Lord! Take his hand with the hand of Thy loving-kindness, then send down upon him from the heaven of Thy bounty a blessing from Thy presence. Verily Thou art the Forgiving, the Generous. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

His honor Nabil, upon him be the Glory of God

2 Ramadan 1303

He is God, exalted be His station in wisdom and utterance

Praise befitting and worthy be unto the Creator of contingent beings, Who made utterance the dawning-place of wisdom, will and knowledge. He is that Word within which books lie concealed and psalms lie hidden. From Him have appeared the hosts of divine commands and prohibitions which are the cause of the order of the world, the comfort and tranquility of nations, and the reason for fellowship, unity, love and affection. The protection of cities and lands through justice and fairness has been and continues to be through these blessed hosts. The Dawning-Place of this utterance in the world of creation was the Seal of the Prophets, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him. O God, bless Him and His family and companions through whom were opened the gates of knowledge to all in creation and through whom appeared the path of Thy commands amongst religions.

And then, O beloved of my heart, the distinguished letter whose allusions were delightful and whose worth was precious to the people of knowledge - not every appraiser can know this pearl nor undertake to determine its value. In any case, since it was adorned with the lights of love, humility, submissiveness, attention and acceptance, after reading it the wine of its words intoxicated this lowly one and involuntarily I approached the Presence where it was granted the honor of being heard. O Nabil, upon thee be My peace. Praise be to God that through the grace of the All-Powerful and the compulsion of the Self-Sufficient, the Almighty, thou hast attained unto both. This compulsion is the cause and reason for the stability of existence and the firmness of its pillars. In truth, the insightful ones detect the fragrance of grace from all affairs that occur. This Wronged One testifies to thy burning with the fire of love and thy attraction and longing for the light of knowledge. Thou hast drunk from the cup of mystical knowledge and quaffed from the ocean of grace. Divine love causes dust to transcend the heavens and brings the heart to light. The servant present with thy letter mentioned what thou didst mention. In truth it removed grief and brought joy, took away sorrow and bestowed delight. According to the inappropriate sayings of the world: "O time, thou art pleasant that thou hast made our time pleasant." Although this verse outwardly has no elements, yet a subtle fragrance emanates from it. We beseech God that thy mention and that of the friends has ever been and continues to be in the court of the Lord. This evanescent one at all times beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to assist all to do what is befitting. That honored master should convey on behalf of this evanescent one greetings and praise to each one. The servant asks his Lord to make them manifestations of glory among creatures, dawning-places of faith among the people of creation, and rising-points of certitude for the people of mystical knowledge, and to protect them from the evil of His enemies and draw them near to Him in all conditions.

His honor the Name 66, upon him be from all the Most Glorious of God, arrived and attained the presence and dwelt in the shadow, and his honor the Beloved too, upon him be the peace of God, was in his service for a time and then the command to return was issued for some of their own affairs. They arrived with utmost joy, delight and gladness and returned in the same manner. Give my greetings and praise to the comfort of eyes. God willing, may they be at rest in the shadow of grace and provided for from the Tree of bounty.

As for the mention made of his honor Mulla Ali, upon him be the peace of God, praise be to God his name attained the honor of being heard in the Presence and was adorned and illumined with the light of grace. This servant too sends greetings to him and beseeches God for his success. Peace and praise be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who hear your words regarding good deeds and upon every knowing, steadfast mystic.

Mulla Muhammad in Khunsar - He is the Most Glorious, the Most Luminous

Make mention of thy Lord's mercy unto His servant Muhammad, who emigrated unto God and entered the City at the time when the Ancient Beauty departed therefrom with mighty sovereignty - a sovereignty that encompassed all created things, and this proved grievous for the idolaters. Therefore bear witness within thyself, then rejoice in thine inmost being, that God hath accepted thy obedience and raised up thy name in truth among the worlds, and hath ordained for thee in nearness a station that none can attain save those who are brought nigh, if thou wilt not slip upon this Path from which every wicked sinner hath turned away. Be thou enkindled by this Fire, then \[kindle with it\] the people of the lands, and be not of the fearful ones. Come forth from the garment of silence, then be one who crieth out between the heavens and the earth. Cast the world behind thee, then call the people to the Most Great Paradise in this Most Pure, Most Manifest Garden, and be not of the silent ones. For silence is praiseworthy except in My remembrance, the Mighty, the Inaccessible; and patience is commendable except in My love - this is a revelation from One Who is Mighty, Beautiful. Arise amongst the people with the steadfastness of thy Lord, then remind them of this Mighty News. Make My remembrance thy shield, then My love thy fortress, then reliance upon My Self, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate, thy army. O Muhammad! By God the Truth! If thou remainest steadfast in My love, and all who are in the heavens and earth oppose thee, God will cause thee to prevail over them through My sovereign might, the Powerful, the Omnipotent, the Almighty. And if all the divines of every religion dispute with thee, thou shalt confound them through My Name, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, for at the time when thou contendest for God with His enemies, the hosts of the unseen will aid thee, and when thou speakest with souls concerning thy Lord's Cause, the Holy Spirit will confirm thee from the presence of One Mighty, All-Wise. And I am He Who speaketh in all things that I am God, there is no God but Me, the Guardian, the Mighty, the Generous. Then know, O Muhammad, that the Concourse of the Bayan turned away from this Beauty and returned to their abode in the nethermost hell, save whom thy Lord willed, and thus doth the All-Knowing inform thee that thou mayest be of those who are well-aware. Say: O people! This is the Beauty of the First One Who hath appeared in the Temple of the Last One, and these are His verses which have been sent down in truth from a kingdom of ancient glory. Say: O people! Fear God and refute not the truth with your mouths, and be not of the losers. And do thou inhale from this Garment that thou mayest find therein the fragrance of the All-Merciful and be of the firm ones. Then know that victory lieth not in the sword and its like, but victory lieth in the tongue and what proceedeth therefrom of utterance for the Cause of God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. Say: O people! Remind mankind of the remembrance of God with wisdom and counsel. Beware lest ye spread corruption in the earth and be of the corrupt ones. O servant! Set thy face toward the Egypt of the All-Merciful in this Paradise, and if thou beholdest Satan at its gate preventing thee from entering the sanctuary of the All-Merciful, seek refuge in God from his evil, then enter therein and be of the secure ones. Thus have We acquainted thee and taught thee and made mention of thee that thou mayest glory thereby between the heavens and the earth. Then make mention from Us to the loved ones of God who have attained the presence of the Throne and heard the melodies of their Lord and were of the triumphant ones. Say: Blessed are ye for having attained the presence of God at a time when neither ye nor anyone among all created things recognized Him. Then make mention of those who were in thy land and in other lands, upon whose realities the clouds of holiness have rained down showers of purity that cleanse them from the dust of contingent things and sanctify them from whatsoever \[would hold them back from God\], the Mighty, the Powerful.

In the Name of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful!

Glorified be He Who hath sent down the verses in truth from the heaven of transcendent might, and made them a proof from His presence unto all the worlds. Even thus do We apprise you of the Manifestation of the Primal Point in this Revelation. Thus have We sent down the verses in truth, and verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is powerful over all things. God counseled the servants in the Bayan not to tarry in this Cause even for a moment, yet the people of the Bayan broke God's covenant and His testament, and opposed the Sovereign of Revelation with a tyranny grievous in the Tablet. The more the proof increased, the more their wretchedness increased, and the reminder from One mighty and wise profited them not. Nay rather, they sought to slay the Youth after He summoned them unto their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Thereby did the dwellers of the cities of names lament, and God was indeed aware of this.

Say: O people! In all the Tablets ye were commanded to make your way unto this Countenance, and at the time of the Revelation to cling to naught else. Yet ye have clung to a mere name and denied Him Who created all things by His command, and were far removed from the shores of nearness. Say: He hath appeared as 'Ali appeared aforetime. Open your eyes that ye may behold Him now upon this most luminous horizon, speaking forth the truth with a sorrowful voice saying: "Do ye deny, O people, Him Who created you from dust, then from a drop of fluid, and made you complete beings? Fear God, and commit not what the people of the Furqan committed when I came to them from the dawning-place of the name 'Ali. Consider, then remember their objections at the time of My manifestation, that ye may perchance become aware of this Cause which hath shone forth from the horizon of the will of your Lord, the All-Merciful, with manifest lights."

Cast aside what ye possess and take what is with God with power, and be not doubtful of His presence. By My life! He is the One promised in the tablets of old, and I was indeed the herald of His manifestation in the days which were illumined by the light of the Countenance. But when the promise came to pass and the heaven was cleft asunder and the Youth came with hosts of invisible might, ye denied Him and opposed Him and followed every wicked denier. Say: O people! God created you to be servants of this Cause which was promised in the Tablets, and to be as glass globes for this Lamp lest the winds of every idolater blow against it with enmity. Yet ye did not fulfill what ye were commanded in the Book; nay rather, ye arose to extinguish this Light which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Countenance with brilliant rays. By My life! Were all who are in the heavens and on earth to gather together to extinguish this Light, they would be powerless and unable, even were they to aid one another.

Say: This is a fire kindled by the will of the All-Merciful - can anyone extinguish it? Nay, by His own Self, the Bestower! Yet the people are behind a thick veil. Say: Can ye prevent the clouds from raining, or the sea from its waves, or the sun from shining? Then be fair, O people, and be not tyrannical and wretched. Thus have We explained to thee what shall make thee independent of all else and keep thee steadfast in the Cause. Blessed art thou for having been mentioned by the Pen of the Command in these days wherein all have arisen in opposition save those whom God preserved with sovereign protection. Remember thy Lord among His creatures, that perchance through thy words may be quickened the hearts of those whom death hath overtaken from every direction and who have taken Satan as their friend. God hath prescribed for every soul the teaching of His Cause, and this was sent down at the beginning of this Revelation from the heaven of transcendent might with resplendent glory. Follow what thou hast been commanded in the Tablet and tarry not even for a moment. The glory be upon thee and upon those who hearken to thy words concerning this Cause, whereby the hearts of all who hesitate have been sorely troubled.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful

Glorified art Thou, O my God, O God of Names and Creator of heaven! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden. I acknowledge Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and I bear witness to Thy greatness and Thy sovereignty and to that which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy Will in Thy Most Manifest Book, which informed the people of the Great Announcement and gave them glad tidings of meeting with Thy manifestation on the Day of Judgment through Thy words "The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds." O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, holding fast to the cord of Thy favor and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy grace. Ordain for me that which will strengthen me to act according to what Thou hast informed me in Thy Book. I testify that Thou hast sent the Messengers and revealed the Books for the guidance of Thy creation and to draw them nigh unto the precincts of Thy chosen ones, Thy trusted ones and Thy friends. I beseech Thee, O Educator of all beings and Lord of the seen and unseen, by the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty and the effulgences of the luminary of Thy generosity, and by Thy Beloved One Whom Thou hast made the Dawning-Place of Thy names and the Dayspring of Thy attributes and the Manifestation of Thy Self and the Source of Thy Will and the Ocean of Thy knowledge and the Heaven of Thy wisdom - through Whose advent the heavens of Thy nearness were honored, and by Whose name the standards of polytheism were lowered among Thy servants and the banners of unity were raised in Thy lands, and through Whom the dawning-places of infidelity and vain imaginings wailed and the smile appeared on the countenance of faith, and through Whom the sun of manifestation shone forth from the horizon of Hijaz and the pillars of hypocrisy were shaken in all regions, and through Whom Yathrib trembled and the valley flowed and the Kingdom of Names was adorned - to make me in all conditions one who celebrates Thy praise and speaks of Thy remembrance and bounty among Thy servants, and who acts according to that which Thou hast commanded me through Thy generosity and munificence. O my Lord! Thou seest the sinner hastening to the ocean of Thy forgiveness, and the thirsty one to the Kawthar of Thy nearness, and the poor one to the treasury of Thy riches. I beseech Thee by the power of Thy Will and by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued Thy earth and Thy heaven, to ordain for me that which will preserve me from self and passion. Verily Thou art the Protector of all mankind and the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O my God, my Lord, my Support, my Goal and my Object of worship! Send Thy blessings upon the Lord of the world and the Educator of nations, through Whose manifestation the stations of the Names appeared in Thy kingdom and the expressions of the attributes among Thy creation, and upon His family and His companions through whom Thy sovereignty and power were made manifest and the decree of unity was established among Thy creatures, and who strove in Thy Cause with true striving and aided Thy religion with true aid. Thou hast said concerning them - and Thy word is the truth - "Honored servants who speak not until He hath spoken, and who do as they are bidden." And in another place: "Men whom neither merchandise nor traffic beguile from the remembrance of God." I beseech Thee by them and by the lights of Thy Throne not to leave me to myself and my will and desire. Then I beseech Thee by Thy might, O God of all beings and Goal of all things, to make me one of those who desire naught except what Thou hast desired for them through Thy bounty, and who have made their wills extinct in Thy Will and their desires in Thy Desire. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. Nothing in all things can prevent Thy will. Thou doest what Thou pleasest and ordainest what Thou desirest. Verily Thou art the Strong, the Triumphant, the Almighty. Alas! Alas! O my God, if Thou shouldst withhold from me the Euphrates of Thy forgiveness and the ocean of Thy mercy, who would show mercy to me and forgive me? Alas! Alas! I have abandoned what Thou didst command me and committed what Thou didst forbid me. By Thy might! Despite my acknowledgment of my grievous sins and great transgressions, I testify that they all are as nothing before the waves of the ocean of Thy mercy and the heaven of Thy pardon and the sun of Thy generosity. Thou knowest and seest that this servant hath naught save weakness and weeping. Have mercy, O my God, on one who hath raised the hands of hope to the heaven of Thy favor and hath turned with his heart to the horizon of Thy pardon. Verily Thou art the Generous, possessed of great bounty. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! Thou beholdest what the tongue of no one except Thee can utter, and bearest witness unto things which no mouth can recount. The floods of afflictions are let loose, and the winds of Thy judgment have blown, and from the clouds rain down the darts of tests, and the heavens of Thy decree pour forth the arrows of trial.

Thou seest, O my Lord, how Thy servants, who have believed on Thee and acknowledged Thy signs, have fallen into the clutches of Thine enemies, how the doors of ease and comfort have been shut against them, how they languish in the Fortress wherein neither pleasantness nor hope can be found. They have suffered in Thy path what no man before them hath suffered. To this bear witness they who abide around Thy throne, and the dwellers of the earth, and the Concourse on high.

These, O my God, are Thy servants who, for love of Thy beauty, have forsaken their homes, and been so stirred up by the gentle winds of their desire for Thee that they have sundered every tie in Thy path. Such of Thy servants as dwell in Thy land and have transgressed against Thee have assailed them, and banished them from Thy cities, and made them captives, and delivered them into the hands of workers of iniquity among Thy people and the perverse amidst the wicked doers in Thy realm. And finally, they were made to abide in this place with which no other place, however loathsome, in all Thy dominion, can compare. They were seized with such trials that the clouds weep over them and the thunder groaneth by reason of the manifold tribulations that have afflicted them in their love for Thee and for the sake of Thy pleasure.

Thou knowest full well, O my God, that there is no one on Thine earth who can claim to be related to Thee except these, some of whom have suffered martyrdom for Thy sake, while the rest have been permitted to survive. Though for such as are like unto us, O my God, it beseemeth not to claim to be related to Thee, inasmuch as our misdeeds and our waywardness have hindered us from reaching the depths of the ocean of Thy oneness, and from immersing ourselves beneath the waters of Thy transcendent mercy, yet our tongues, O my God, bear witness, and our hearts testify, and our limbs confess that Thy mercy hath enveloped all created things and Thy compassion surpassed all that are in heaven and all that are on earth.

I beseech Thee, by Thy Most Great Name, through which all created things were rent asunder and the whole creation was shaken, to send down from the clouds of Thy mercy that which will purge them from every ordeal and from whatever is hateful to Thee. Raise them up, then, to such heights that no amount of tribulation will keep them back from Thy wondrous remembrance, nor any trouble hinder them from turning toward the court of Thy transcendent oneness.

By Thy might, O Well-Beloved of Baha and his heart's Desire! I myself cry out, under all conditions, unto Thee saying: "Would I had, ere this day, drawn nigh unto Thee!" When I hear, however, the sighs of such of Thy people as are wholly devoted to Thee, and those of Thy servants as enjoy near access to Thy court, who have taken no other friend than Thee, and sought no refuge except Thee, and have chosen for themselves, in Thy path, what no man hath chosen in the days of the Manifestations of Thy transcendent unity and the Day-Springs of Thy most holy sovereignty, then my heart is saddened and my soul is vexed, and I cry to Thee, imploring Thee to protect them, by Thy power that hath encompassed the entire creation both visible and invisible, from whatsoever may be abhorrent to Thee. This is not for their own sakes, but that Thy name may, through them, abide amongst Thy servants, and Thy remembrance may continue to endure in Thy dominions.

Thou knowest, O my God, that all Thy servants have turned back from Thee and risen up against Thee. Thou knowest that Thou hast no one to obey Thee except them and such as have believed in Thy Revelation, through which the foundations of the entire universe have been shaken, and the souls of all men have trembled, and all that lay asleep were quickened. Thou art, O my God, the God of bounty, Whose grace is immense.

Send down, then, upon them that which will assure their hearts, and quiet their souls, and renew their spirits, and refresh their bodies. Thou art, verily, their Lord and the Lord of the worlds.

Praised be God, the Lord of all creation!

He is the One Who is Manifest, the All-Loving, the Forgiving, the Merciful

That which is hidden beareth witness through My Name, the Self-Subsisting, that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. That which is treasured up beareth witness - and verily this is the Manifest, the Witnessed One - speaking in all things that there is none other God but Me, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. The Hidden circleth round Him Who hath appeared with truth, and the Manifest hath arisen to praise His Own Self on this Day wherein all things have proclaimed: "The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Possessor of existence." The Books have testified to this Most Great Name, and the Scriptures have bowed down when the verses were sent down from the presence of an Ancient Sender. The world hath been honored by the appearance of the Lord of Eternity. Blessed be he who hath turned and attained, and woe unto the deniers. Say: This is the Day whereon the Sun of Justice is seen behind the clouds by reason of what the hands of the oppressors have wrought. This is the Day whereof God gave tidings - the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds. This is the Day whereon the Speaker on Sinai speaketh, when the Lord of Revelation hath appeared with clear sovereignty. This is the Day adorned by its mention in the Scriptures of God, the Mighty, the Wise. Blessed is he who hath cast the world behind him and turned unto the Most Sublime Horizon with a fire whereby the hearts of the mystics were attracted, and with a light whereby the darkness of the earth was illumined. Thus hath the Supreme Pen spoken while the Wronged One was seated upon the throne of His Name, the Forgiving, the Generous.

O Pen of Eternity! The Most Great Name commandeth thee to make mention of him who hath ascended unto God, who was named Mahdi in the Perspicuous Book. Bear thou witness that he turned unto the Truth when the people were veiled by a thick veil. He it is who rent asunder the veils through the Name of his Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, and turned unto God until he arrived within the precincts of the mercy of his Lord, the Glorious, the Generous. He it is who crossed land and sea in his longing for the meeting with God, in such wise that the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise make mention of him. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this from His exalted station. By God's life! The people of the Kingdom were attracted by his turning unto God. Thus doth He make mention of him Who hath come with a Cause before which all who are in the heavens and earth shall fall prostrate.

The Light shining from the face of thy Lord, the Lord of Names, after the passing away of all things, be upon thee, O thou who didst quaff the choice wine of revelation from the hand of bounty of the Fashioner of the heavens, when trembling seized all the dwellers of the earth. Thou art he whom the affairs of the world deterred not, nor the veils of the nations. Thou art he who cast away the sources of idle fancies and turned unto My Name, the Self-Subsisting, at Whose appearance the learned wailed with the wailing of the bereaved, and the mystics were shaken, save whom God pleased, the Peerless, the All-Informed. We testify that through thee faithfulness was made manifest in this Cause, whereat every heedless doubter broke the Covenant. I bear witness that thou didst attain unto tribulation when the Call was raised from the direction of grandeur and greatness. Blessed art thou, O Mahdi, and joy be unto thee, O Mahdi! Thou art he who soared in My atmosphere, who spoke My praise, who arose to serve Me, and who bore afflictions and calamities in My path. Verily nothing is hidden from His knowledge - He was with thee in all conditions, He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the Witness, the All-Hearing.

Thou art he who left his homeland, turning toward the station of the All-Merciful, until thou didst take up for thyself a dwelling place before His face. This is a bounty whereunto nothing in earth or heaven can be compared, as witnesseth He by Whom the Snow-White Spot is adorned - this resplendent Station. Blessed be the soul that hath attained unto thy mention and praise, and blessed be he who hath visited thee, as proclaimed by the Supreme Pen. We testify that he is among the triumphant. Today thou art beneath the glances of thy Lord's loving-kindness. Whenever the Banner of the Manifestation passeth over thee, the Speaker on Sinai maketh mention of thee with such mention as causeth them that lie in the graves to be stirred. And praise be to God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Forgiving.

He is the Mighty One in the Letter Sad

Glorified be He Who hath sent down the verses in truth, that they might serve as a clear testimony unto all the worlds, and that through them His Cause and sovereignty might be made manifest. This hath ever been, from time immemorial, and to this We do bear witness. They who have been given the insight of knowledge from God are assured that these verses have been sent down from One Who is All-Wise, All-Informed. Through them truth hath been distinguished from falsehood, and light from darkness, since ancient times. Say: By God! He is, of His own Self, the Sovereign of all created things, their Originator, the Creator of all beings, and their Fashioner. He needeth no proof other than Himself for this, if ye be possessed of keen insight into the mystery of the Cause. For His Cause is more manifest than to be veiled by aught or concealed behind any veil - this is known to every one endowed with knowledge. Indeed, were there any proof besides Him, that proof would become a veil unto Him. None knoweth this save every assured and wise one. However, since men are weak in themselves and diverse in their understanding and recognition, He manifesteth that which all in the heavens and earth are powerless to produce, that it might serve as an eloquent testimony from Him unto all the worlds. This is naught but to demonstrate His bounty unto all created things and to manifest His grace unto every one, be they poor or rich. Otherwise, He, exalted be He, hath no need of anything to demonstrate His Cause and manifest His sovereignty, as every pure nature doth testify. Say: O people of the earth! Do ye not witness how He hath appeared with the truth and risen above all created things with an authority mighty and impregnable? Say: Though enemies have encompassed Him from every side and darkness hath seized Him from all directions, yet doth He shine forth among them like an illuminating pearl of holiness. Say: By God! His utterance is a testimony unto the peoples of the heavens and of the earth, if men's ears be attentive. Say: The proof is manifest in all His deeds and actions - this is a truth which every fair-minded and trustworthy one doth recognize. Can light be compared to darkness, or shade to heat, or spirit to aught else? Glory be to God! This is naught but grievous heedlessness. Say: O people of the earth! Open your eyes, sharpen your vision, and purify your ears that ye may witness that which God hath testified for you in a Tablet that hath been hidden from sight. O Ali! Bear thou witness that there is none other God but Him, and that Ali is the Manifestation of His Self and the Manifestation of His Name. Thus doth the Bird of the Divine Throne warble with sorrowful voice. Know thou that We have been cast into prison through that which the hands of every tyrannical oppressor have wrought. For this We give thanks unto God and praise Him, and We fear no one even should tribulations greater than any great tribulation descend upon Us. And thou, O servant, preserve this Tablet and recite it with a sweet voice, that there might be kindled in thy heart from this Fire which hath been secretly illuminating. Then give thanks unto God, rejoice in God's gladness, be steadfast in thy love, and be keen in vision. Entrust not the reins of thy sight and heart to anyone. Look upon all that cometh unto thee with the vision God hath created within thee - this is the best counsel, and God is indeed aware of this. For the Cause hath been veiled from sight, and none hath comprehended it, even if they were nigh unto the truth. And thou, rend asunder the veils of idle fancy and blind imitation, and be possessed of spiritual insight. Pay no heed to the people, for they are caught in the grip of creation and are weak in their essence. Whoso attaineth not unto this station hath achieved naught, even should he lay claim within himself to every wondrous thing. Thus do We reveal unto thee the verses and make mention of thee with love and aid thee in the Cause, that thou mayest be assured within thyself and content with God. The Spirit and Glory be upon thee and upon every lofty heart.

He is God! Glorified art Thou, O my God! I make mention of Thee in this hour when the doves of the sanctity of Thy sovereignty warble, and from the clouds of Thy oneness there rain down wondrous verses of Thy grandeur, and from the clouds of Thy mercy there pour forth the rains of Thy gracious favors, and from the paradise of Thy oneness there waft the breezes of Thy bountiful mercy, whereby the trees of the sanctity of Thy divinity are planted, and the Lote-Tree of Thy singleness puts forth leaves of the knowledge of Thy Being, and the branches of Thy mercy bear the fruits of Thy grace, and all who are in the heavens and earth hasten to the fields of Thy riches, and all who are in the depths of creation dwell near to Thy Lordship, and drink from the cups of Thy beauty, and ascend to the highest horizon of Thy glory, and the lovers mount up to the pavilion of nearness to Thee, and those who have attained soar in the atmosphere of union with Thee, and those drawn nigh race in the gardens of Thy presence, and the sincere are enshrouded thereby in the heaven of Thy eternity.

Glorified, glorified art Thou above all that those who make mention of Thee mention, or those who describe Thee describe! For all mention returns to its nest in the realities of Thy servants, and all description descends to its place in the hearts of Thy creatures. And since this is so, how can the description of Thy creation reach unto Thee? By Thy glory, O my Beloved! All eyes are bewildered before the wondrous dawning of the lights of Thy beauty, and every tongue falls silent before the melodies of the nightingale of Thy majesty, and all ears are deaf before the manifestations of the dawning-places of Thy wisdom's might, and all minds are as nothing before the modes of Thy novel sovereignty, and all souls vanish before the emergence of the sanctity of Thy knowledge, and all bodies tremble before the signs of Thy creative power, and all bones turn to dust before the shining forth of the mysteries of Thy strength.

Therefore, O my God, since the servant acknowledges all this and confesses to all this, it behooveth the wonders of Thy bounty and the fullness of Thy grace and favor to make him detached from all else but Thee and to cause him to return from all save Thee to the stream of meeting with Thee, that there may flow from his tongue the wondrous oceans of Thy wisdom, and from his heart the signs of Thy mighty power and strength, and from his tongue the embroideries of Thy melody, and from his inmost heart the traces of Thy favor. For Thou, O my God, didst create him by Thy command and teach him the interpretation of Thy Book and make known to him the treasuries of Thy knowledge and inspire him with the jewels of Thy wisdom and teach him what Thou hadst concealed from others by Thy grace.

Dost Thou see within Thyself, O my God, that Thou shouldst drive away a poor one who hath detached himself unto Thee, or turn back a needy one who hath stood before the sanctuary of Thy beauty, or abase a lowly one who hath clung to the cord of Thy glory? Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee! Thou art too great to disappoint one who hath stood before the pavilions of Thy grandeur or to withhold from one who hath come to the canopies of Thy grace and mercy.

Therefore I beseech Thee, O my God, if my blood be acceptable in Thy path, then shed it by Thy bounty, and if my heart be worthy of Thy knowledge, then burn it with Thy fire, and if my head be fitting for Thy good-pleasure, then raise it upon the spear by Thy power, that I may follow Thy chosen ones in Thy realm and walk in the footsteps of Thy trusted ones in Thy lands. By Thy glory, O my God! My heart yearns for Thee, and mine eyes hope for Thy beauty, and my heart awaits meeting with Thee, and shouldst Thou will to delay in all this, to burn me in these days and torment me in these nights among these transgressors, then accept from me that which Thou didst desire from me in the Most Exalted Concourse before Thy near angels, though none knoweth the knowledge thereof save after its appearance in Thy land, and shouldst Thou change all this to manifest Thy sovereignty - verily Thou art powerful over this, and Thou art the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

Then I beseech Thee, O my God, by Him Whom Thou didst manifest on the day of Thy arising and by Him Whom Thou wilt manifest in the resurrection of Thy beauty, to make her to whom this Tablet hath been returned one of the dwellers in the chambers of Thy good-pleasure. Then grant her, O my God, that whereby her eyes may be consoled, for Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.

He is the Most Exalted, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting!

Glorified art Thou, O my God! I find myself now in the vicinity of Thy great mercy, beneath the shadow of Thy Most Exalted Name, and seated before the kindled lamp of Thy grace within the niche of Thy bounty. I discover in my heart such rapture from the ardor of union with Thee and longing to meet Thee that I find no patience in separation from Thee nor composure in attaining Thee. It is as though I know not what I desire of Thee - if I seek union through the wonders of Thy favors, I witness that in union with Thee my cries are raised and my voice is lifted up; and if I show patience in separation from Thee, I witness that in Thy remoteness my spirit departs and my soul finds no rest ever. Thou witnesseth, O my Beloved, that in both conditions my heart is agitated, my body perturbed, and my frame thunderstruck. Therefore grant me that which Thou hast sanctified above these two conditions, O Thou in Whose hand is the dominion of the worlds.

I know not, O my Beloved, whence appeared this supreme rapture and this most glorious attraction - it seems to have emerged from all directions, though it was sanctified above all allusions. Yet withal I find myself veiled from nearness to the pavilions of the might of Thy sovereignty, my spirit forbidden from entering the tabernacle of Thy Oneness, and my heart deprived of soaring in the atmosphere of Thy Singleness. How long, O my God, wilt Thou not rend asunder the veils of knowledge from the eyes of Thy creation, and how long wilt Thou not burn away the curtains of separation from the hearts of Thy creatures - after Thou knowest my poverty and I know Thy wealth, Thou seest my abasement and I see Thy glory, and I know that Thou art the Powerful over all things through Thy power and sovereignty?

Glorified, glorified art Thou, O my God! If Thou takest not the hands of the drowning, who then is the deliverer of the yearning ones? And if Thou hast no mercy upon Thy helpless servants, who then is the helper of the destitute? By Thy glory, O my Beloved, I know not by what thing I may draw near unto Thee, nor by what name I may approach the lights of Thy beauty. Whenever I contemplate mentioning Thee through the words of Thy unity in the heaven of Thy oneness, that perchance through the cord of its nobility I might draw near to Thee until I attain what I desire from Thee, I witness that the Essence of unity in its pristine nature and loftiness weeps at separation from Thee and cries out in remoteness from Thee, and that the Reality of oneness roars in the desert of longing for Thee and cries aloud in the wilderness in its distance from the divine realm of Thy reunion and attainment. And I witness that all essences are thunderstruck before the dawning of the manifestation of Thy lights, and all attributes are consumed by the fire of Thy might and power. Yet withal, how can I cling to any of that or hold fast to any such matter?

Therefore I beseech Thee, O my God, that Thou make me sanctified above all that is known and said, and all that is understood through words, until I know Thy Self through Thy Self, and behold Thy beauty through Thine own vision, and Thy majesty through Thine own sight. Verily Thou art powerful over all that, and supreme over whatsoever Thou willest through Thy authority. Thou art indeed the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the Powerful, the Wise.

Glorified, glorified art Thou, O my God! When I find myself in that hour detached from all else but Thee and turned away from all save Thee, I seek intercession with Thee through the Manifestations of Thy sovereignty, by whom the horizons were filled with the lights of longing and through whom the suns of glory dawned from the direction of Iraq, that Thou cause those who have believed in Thee and Thy signs to be detached from all who are in the heavens and on earth, in such wise that they occupy themselves with naught but Thy remembrance, turn to none but Thy Name, and direct themselves to none but the ways of Thy good-pleasure - until they all hasten with their hearts to the arenas of Thy nearness and the gardens of Thy reunion. Then gather them, O my Lord, in the paradise of Thy love and the city of Thy affection. Then erase from their hearts the signs of difference and from their souls the tokens of variation, in such wise that they may remember Thee with one tongue and worship Thee in one form, and become as one soul and one spirit. Verily, Thou art over that powerful and mighty.

He is the Mighty!

Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou art He Who hath raised up the heavens by Thy command and established the earth by Thy will, and ordained between them that which befitteth Thy sovereignty and beseemeth Thy glory. Then after this, Thou didst create by Thy will and manifest all beings by Thy wisdom, and didst send unto them Messengers from Thy presence and reveal unto them Books from Thy side, and didst manifest Thyself unto the chosen ones among Thy Messengers through the lights of Thy mighty Self-Subsistence, and didst raise them to the heights of Thy glorious Divinity, such that Thou didst make them the Dawning-Places of Thy oneness and the Manifestations of Thy Self-Sufficiency and the Daysprings of Thy Identity and the repositories of Thy eternal wisdom. And Thou didst give them a proof from Thee and evidence from Thy presence, and didst make Thy greatest proof to be the verses sent down from the heaven of Thy uniqueness, and Thy mightiest evidence to be the melodies appearing from the tones of Thy wondrous Self-Sufficiency.

Then after this, Thou didst command the servants to obey them in Thy dominion and to turn unto them in Thy kingdom, that all might submit to the Manifestations of Thy Self and follow the Dawning-Places of the Sun of Thy Beauty, that they might gather all the servants upon the path of Thy grace and cause them to drink from the oceans of Thy bounty and to enter the paradise of Thy oneness and to dwell in the precincts of Thy mercy. And Thou didst not desire in all this, O my God, save that Thou mightest cause them to enter the eternal, everlasting City and join them to the immortal, sempiternal pavilions.

Despite this, they differed regarding Thy Cause and objected to Thy chosen ones and showed pride before the Manifestations of Thy Self, until they separated themselves from the precincts of Thy mercy and fled from the shadow of Thy loving-kindness. And the days passed and the nights elapsed until the matter reached unto Thy Most Great Manifestation in the beauty of Thy Most High Name. Then was the veil removed from Thy beauty and the sun of Thy grace shone forth and the moons of Thy bestowals appeared and the stars of Thy favors dawned and the seas of Thy power surged and the breezes of Thy might stirred and the paradise of Thy glory was adorned and the dove of Thy meeting warbled. Despite all this, all denied Thy truth and turned away from Thy beauty and showed pride before Thy presence, and none answered Thee in this and none turned to Thy good-pleasure, and they visited upon the Dawning-Place of Thy beauty that which maketh the Pen tremble to recount and the ink to weep for what befell Him and the people of Paradise to lament for what descended upon Him and the dwellers of the heavens to cry out for what was inflicted upon Him.

And after this, when His beauty was concealed from Thy servants and raised to His holy station and returned to His mighty hiding place in the throne of Thy grandeur, then did most of Thy servants claim to love Him and the people of Thy kingdom made mention of Him and Thy creatures prostrated themselves before Him. Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee! How great is the heedlessness of Thy servants at the manifestation of Thy Being and how mighty their turning unto Thee after the concealment of Thy majesty! By Thy might, O my God, these people walk only in the paths of blind imitation after the setting of the sun of Thy guidance, and they follow Thee only after the disappearance of Thy countenance.

Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee! The people of the pavilions of the Divine Realm are bewildered by Thy Cause, how much more the people of the Kingdom in the lands of the mortal world! All the mystics are naked of the wonders of Thy wisdom, and all the divines are foolish before the manifestations of Thy knowledge, and all the philosophers are powerless before the tokens of Thy mighty sovereignty, and all the eloquent ones fall short of attaining the arenas of Thy grandeur, and all the wealthy ones are poor before the surging of the seas of Thy riches, and all the learned ones are ignorant before Thee, and all the mighty ones are as nothing before Thee.

By Thy might! The streams of Thy knowledge have ever flowed and the wonders of Thy wisdom have ever been manifest and the gates of Thy paradise have ever been open, yet none can enter therein or drink therefrom or witness its mystery save those who have detached themselves unto Thee and turned with their whole being unto Thee. I beseech Thee therefore, O my God, by Thy all-encompassing mercy and Thy manifest favors and Thy consummate wisdom, that Thou protect us in the fortress of Thy protection and provide us with the fruits of Thy paradise and give us to drink from the cups of Thy beauty. Then raise us to a station wherein we behold no difference among Thy chosen ones and witness no variation in Thy signs, for verily Thou art the Omnipotent over all things and verily Thou art the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.

He is the Most High, the Most Great

The call of God has been raised from the right of the Throne: "Verily, I am God, the One, the Single, the Unique! Stop not your ears from hearkening to the Word of God. Turn to Him with pure and sanctified hearts. He who hath sanctified his ear to hear the Call from the luminous Tree raised upon the blessed crimson Spot - by God! The Promised One hath appeared with His name, the All-Loving, from the presence of the Mighty, the Trustworthy. Come ye forth from the cities of fancy! The King of Certitude hath come with the light of the All-Merciful. Thus hath the matter been decreed from the presence of God, the Single, the All-Sufficient.

"Necks have bowed down at the appearance of the Luminary of the horizons, yet veils of hypocrisy have enveloped the people. Thus hath spoken the Tongue of Revelation and warbled. Today all atoms proclaim: 'The King of Names and Attributes hath come, He Who hath taken neither partner nor offspring.' Say: True knowledge is the knowledge of My Self. Whoso attaineth unto it hath attained unto God, and whoso denieth it is of them that have denied the verses of the All-Merciful. Thus doth the Tongue of Grandeur speak and testify. We have adorned the Kingdom with Our names and the Realm of Power with Our signs.

"Fear ye God, O people, and follow not everyone who hath denied and deviated. Verily, the Most Holy Sanctuary is among you, and God's Sacred Precinct is before your faces, and the Sacred House for all people. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of that which hath been ordained for you and be of them that have turned away from God and then called upon all who are in the heavens and earth. Doth not God suffice you, He Who hath caused all things to speak by His sovereignty? There is no God but Him. His is the greatness and pride, His the power and transcendence. With Him are the treasuries of names which He sendeth down according to a fixed measure. They who have clung to names and turned away from their Creator - these are the worshippers of idols. God shall soon chastise them with an extended chastisement.

"Say: Do trials in the path of God, your Most Glorious Lord, frighten you, or doth fate prevent you from the Lord of Names? Rend ye the veils by the name of your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Then turn ye to the Face before which the Bayan hath bowed down and prostrated. Hold fast unto the cord of God and detach yourselves from all else. The fragrances of sanctity have wafted from this Garment - blessed is he who turneth unto them and findeth. Shun ye, O people, him who hath denied God. He is Satan and hath stood at every path and lookout. Hold fast unto God - He will protect you from the hosts of rejection and aid you with authority from His presence. His are the mobilized hosts.

"Hasten, O people, with your hearts to the Dayspring of proof. By God, He is your Lord, the All-Merciful! Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of this bounty which shall endure for you and never end. Thus hath the Sun of Glory shone forth upon you from the horizon of grandeur. He is your Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, unto Whom the atoms have turned and around Whom the verses have circled. He who turneth away from Him is of the people of tyranny and envy. We have today adorned all things with the ornament of names. Thus hath grace encompassed all in the kingdom of creation. Blessed is he who hath known and witnessed.

"O servant! Hearken unto the Call from the Most Glorious Quarter, then deliver unto the servants what We have delivered unto thee. Say: The Lord of creation hath appeared and calleth you unto Him. Beware lest ye follow him who hath denied God. We have sent down from the heaven of utterance the table of wisdom and exposition - blessed is he who turneth unto it, and woe unto him who knoweth and denieth.

"Arise to mention God and His Cause amongst His creation, then give them the glad tidings of this News which was mighty in the Kingdom of Names and great in the cities of eternity. He whom God hath chosen for Himself shall endure forever. Blessed is he who is illumined by the lights that have shone forth from the horizon of this holy, glorified Tablet. Say: The Spirit hath come as ye were promised and hath stood before the Throne, and this is the glory. Turn with all thy being unto God and be of them who have strived and endeavored in His path."

He is God, exalted be His station in wisdom and utterance. The Most Great Branch hath appeared with thy letter at the All-Luminous Horizon, wherein the Lord of Destiny speaketh forth the hidden mystery through which the Hour was made manifest and the moon was cleft asunder. Blessed is he who hath heard and attained, and woe unto every heedless doubter. We have heard thy call and have brought forth from the treasuries of My Most Exalted Pen the pearls of wisdom and utterance, as a mercy from Us upon thee and upon those who heard and responded when the Call was raised from the Most Exalted Station. We have remembered those who believed in the letters Ha' and Mim, and gave them glad tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy which have preceded all things. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.

O Abu'l-Fadl! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison once again. Verily it draweth thee to My Kingdom and imparteth unto thee that which attracteth the hearts of My servants. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Bestower. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. That which He desired hath appeared and been made manifest, a command from His presence. Blessed is he who hath held fast unto His cord and acted according to what hath been sent down in the Book. We make mention of Our loved ones there and remind them of Our verses and give them to drink from the chalice of My utterance and draw them nigh unto God, the Lord of mankind. We have remembered them before with that whose fragrance shall never cease to endure throughout the dominion of My Kingdom and My sovereignty. The Mother Book with Him beareth witness unto this.

O people of God! Hearken unto the Call from the direction of My Most Great Prison. Verily it preserveth you and giveth you glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for you by God, the Lord of Lords. Beware lest ye be saddened by the deeds of him by whom the dwellers of the cities of My justice have lamented at eventide and at dawn. Verily those who claim to believe yet commit that which they were forbidden - these are among the people of error in the Book of God, the Self-Subsisting, the Most High. We have counselled all in that whereby the stations of man are elevated in the contingent world and the Word of God is exalted amongst the religions. Among the people are those who have acted upon that which they were commanded, and among them are those who have turned away and committed that which hath caused the Leviathan of utterance to writhe in the dust.

We make mention of the children of the Friend and counsel them in that which beseemeth the days of God, the Lord of the Day of Mutual Calling. Take ye, O My loved ones, the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him, and follow not every ungrateful infidel. Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Thus hath the matter been decreed when the Light was shining from the horizon of Iraq. We have forbidden conflict and contention, and have commanded all to fear God, the Lord of creation. Blessed is he who hath cast away vain imaginings, holding fast unto that which he hath been commanded in the return.

We have remembered you before with verses that cannot be equalled by all the treasures of the earth. Hasten unto the good-pleasure of God, then act according to that which ye have been commanded in the Books and Tablets. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken when the Wronged One was established upon the throne of wisdom and utterance.

O Abu'l-Fadl! We have remembered thee time and again, and given thee to drink repeatedly. Be thankful and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast remembered me in Thy Most Great Prison, and glory be unto Thee, O Lord of all mankind! I beseech Thee to protect me from the evil of those who have broken Thy Covenant and Testament, and denied Thy proof when it was sent down in truth. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Chosen One."

Know thou moreover that whosoever layeth claim to a Cause, he is a lying impostor. My Most Holy Book, which hath been sent down from My holy Kingdom as a favor unto the righteous, beareth witness unto this. Blessed art thou for having uttered My remembrance, turned unto My face, held fast unto My cord, and stood firm in the service of My Cause in My days. Thus have We set forth the verses and sent them unto thee that thine eyes may be consoled thereby and thy heart may rejoice, and that the people may be reminded of that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of utterance of thy Lord, the Subjugator of the winds. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those who have hearkened and responded and have said: "Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of all created things!"

He is the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy

God hath heard that wherewith thou art concerned, and therefore doth He make mention of thee through His grace. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing. Blessed is he who hath attained unto these days and recognized the Manifestation of God's Self in this wondrous garment, and whom nothing between the heavens and earth hath withheld from God. Blessed is the eye that hath beheld His beauty, and blessed is the ear that hath heard His melodies, and blessed are the tongues that have voiced His praise, and blessed are the hearts which God hath made receptacles of His love and mirrors of His radiant and luminous countenance.

Remember Him, O people, for His remembrance is better for you than the remembrance of all mankind, for true worship is realized after His love and knowledge, and without this naught shall be accepted from anyone even if he should bring forth the deeds of all the world. Say: O people, fear God, then shun the hosts of Satan who have taken vain imaginings as their lord instead of God, and who recite His words at all times yet when the verses of God, the Just King, the All-Wise, are recited unto them, they deny them and return unto their households in abasement.

Say: O people, associate not partners with God, for such association is a grievous wrong. Bear witness unto that which God Himself witnessed before the creation of all things, that there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Say: He hath appeared with the truth and with Him are the proofs of all the Prophets and Messengers, and whoso hath hesitated in His Cause hath verily hesitated in the Cause of God from time immemorial and was recorded among the idolaters in the Preserved Tablet.

Say: O people, this is the glance of 'Ali which in truth from this horizon beholdeth what ye do, and He is the Witness over all created things. And this is the ear of 'Ali which from this horizon hearkeneth unto that which ye dispute concerning His Cause, O heedless ones. And this is the tongue of 'Ali which speaketh among you with the verses of God, the Mighty King, the All-Praised, and saith: O people of the Bayan! The Most Merciful Himself hath come unto you, and by Him have been attracted the realities of all creation - they who have purified their vision from the limitations of the wicked ones and turned their gaze toward the scene of their Lord, the Chosen One, and were numbered among the triumphant.

Beware lest ye object unto Him as did the peoples of old object unto God's Messengers, and as did the people of the Furqan object unto My wronged and lonely Self. We revealed the Bayan for His sake and made it as a leaf among the leaves of the gardens of His knowledge, were ye to be of them that know. Yet ye deny Him and make mention of My Name, and imagine that ye are of them who sought My presence and attributed themselves unto My Self. Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! Whoso denieth Him hath denied Me, and whoso objecteth unto Him hath objected unto My Self, and whoso turneth away from Him hath turned away from God, the Mighty King, the All-Knowing. I verily disavow those who have hesitated in His Cause. Do ye make mention of My Name while ye slay My Being and My Beloved? What aileth you, O ye that turn aside! Thus hath the Tongue of the All-Merciful spoken from the right hand of the Throne, that His sincere servants might hear it.

O Taqi, hold fast unto the cord of righteousness, then detach thyself from self and passion, then turn thy face toward the precincts of God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers of old. Say: O my God! Praise be unto Thee for having made known unto me the Manifestation of Thy Self. I beseech Thee, then, not to withhold from me that which Thou hast ordained in this Most Great, Most Mighty Revelation, and leave me not to myself, but make me to voice His praise and celebrate His remembrance and turn toward the Kaaba of His good-pleasure and the sanctuary of His glory. Verily, Thou art powerful to do what Thou willest, and Thou art, in truth, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Powerful.

O my Lord! Purify me from the allusions of them who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, then dedicate me wholly to Thy radiant and resplendent countenance. Then send greetings from God upon thy mother and thy kindred and upon them who are established upon the thrones of certitude in this All-Wise Remembrance. And praise be to God, my Beloved and the Beloved of all the worlds.

This is what hath been sent down from the heaven of grace and loving-kindness: Thy letter which thou didst send to the servant who is present before the Throne hath been read, and We have been informed of its contents. Verily thy Lord is the Hearing, the Answering. We were with thee when there befell thee what befell from the hosts of the oppressors. Nothing whatsoever escapeth the knowledge of thy Lord, and He suffereth not the reward of the well-doers to be lost. By reason of what hath befallen thee, there hath been ordained for thee that which the treasuries of the heavens and earth cannot equal. Grieve not over the vicissitudes of time.

The people rejoice in that which perisheth - rejoice ye in that which endureth in My glorious and mighty Kingdom. They have gathered treasures for others, and are unaware. Soon shall the carpet of their glory be rolled up even as was rolled up the carpet of them who preceded them, and they shall behold themselves in an abasement that hath no equal in the earth. They are indeed among the losers.

O servant who gazeth toward God! The letter from thee and thy brother hath been mentioned before the Throne. Although outwardly it was a cause of grief to them that circle round, yet We are in manifest joy, for We look to the root of the matter and what brancheth therefrom. Praise be to God that the glances of divine favors and the expressions of lordly loving-kindness have ever been directed toward you, and all that hath befallen you hath been witnessed and known in the presence of His court. Those souls who have arisen today in the utmost pride - soon shall ye behold them in the utmost submission and humility. And those who today speak with vain imaginings - soon shall they pride themselves before the people on your name and mention. Since truth is with you, the world in reality is with you. Look not to the outward affairs current among the people - all shall pass away and perish, and that which shall endure is what hath been recorded for you in the mighty Tablet. Even as is witnessed at this time, most of the people of that land are remorseful and at a loss, and are holding fast to your name. This is among the wondrous favors of the Lord. Though not apparent today, it shall soon be made manifest in truth, and there is no alteration in the command of God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. The matter that concerneth you is steadfastness in the love of God and the Dawning-Place of His Revelation. God willing, ye must needs remain steadfast in this matter with the utmost power and strength. This point being established, all circle round this station, and in its own time there shall appear whatsoever hath been and shall be meet and fitting. As for the request for permission to come to the Most Holy Court - it is well known and evident that the Truth hath appeared for manifestation and revelation, and all have been created for attainment and circumambulation. Assuredly, were it timely, permission would be granted. Until now this land hath not been at rest, and every day a fire is ignited. We beseech God to extinguish the fire of rancor and hatred and discord and hypocrisy by such means as He knoweth. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty.

In the Name of God, the Manifest, the Most Manifest!

This is an epistle from a penitent servant to those who have soared in the atmosphere of the love of the All-Merciful and have detached themselves from all created things. These are among the most exalted of creatures in the sight of God, the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful. You shall hearken unto the words of this Prisoner and become acquainted with what hath befallen Him at the hands of the hosts of the idolaters. O servants of God! Be steadfast in the Cause and follow not every sinful infidel. Remember God, your Creator, then walk in the ways of His good-pleasure and be not of the heedless. Know ye that there hath befallen Us that which hath befallen no one else in creation, were ye of them that hear. Those who were in My service have risen against Mine own Self, and thereby have they violated the sanctity of God amongst His hesitant servants. They have attached themselves to every soul and entered every house to seize dirhams and dinars, and yet they claim detachment for themselves. Behold then the servants who follow them without any clear proof or enlightening Book. O people! Make your vision penetrating, lest matters become confused to you and ye be numbered with them that perceive. Know ye that the Truth and whatsoever hath appeared from Him shall be distinguished from the deeds of all created things. O people! Fear God and spread not corruption in the land after it hath been set in order, and be not of them that slumber. Lift up your heads from sleep, for the sun hath risen to its zenith. Glorified be God, the King, the Mighty, the Most High, the Great!

O My Name! Thou wert with Us for a number of years, and We concealed from thee that which was hidden, and We were of them that conceal. We informed thee not of that which was concealed from the eyes of certain servants, preserved for His sake, which the idolaters took for themselves as a lord besides God, the King, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Although thou didst become acquainted with some of his affairs, We concealed most of his deeds from the eyes of men, out of a wisdom known to none save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. By God, O My Name! He was in the land of Ta standing before My face, and We were revealing verses unto him while he would write them and send them to the servants. Thus was the matter in the innermost mystery, and none was aware of this save God, my Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all worlds, lest any should turn their attention to the seat of the Cause, and thus were We doing. Whoso possesseth understanding and insight will be convinced that the matter was as We have cast it unto thee in truth, requiring no proof, and will be of them that are assured. When his name was elevated amongst the servants, he committed that which none in all the worlds had committed. Would that thou hadst known that which he decreed against thyself, but We concealed it from thee. When he turned against God, We turned against him and revealed the hidden aspects of his secret and his deceit amongst Our knowing servants. Were We to mention what he hath committed in this land, the Tablets and pens would not suffice, and God is witness to what I say.

Leave these ones and their like, then turn wholly toward God. Remember the people and be not of them that remain silent. Soon will Satan come to you with tablets of fire - leave him and what he possesseth in the depths of hell. Say: By God! We have been made independent of the worlds through His Own Self, and through Him have We become independent of all things, and through His praise have We become independent of the praise of every praiser who knoweth. Let the loved ones of God gather upon the Most Great Word - this is better for them than whatsoever hath been created between the heavens and the earths. Thus have We commanded thee in this Tablet and mentioned thee out of love for thyself, that thou mayest give thanks unto God, thy Creator, and remain steadfast in the Cause of God, the King, the Truth, the Mighty, the Wise. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon thy kindred whom God hath specially chosen for thee and made them to be of the believers. Then convey Our greetings to the faces of My loved ones who have remained steadfast in the Cause and have detached themselves from the worlds.

He it Is That Is Manifest, and Speaketh Forth, above the Supreme Horizon

This is an Epistle from Us unto such as have cast away the world, and laid hold on whatsoever He Who is the Most Great Name hath revealed in this Day whereon the Crier hath cried out from the right hand of the snow-white Spot, announcing that the tale of sorrows hath been retold, in such wise that the Apostle hath lamented in the All-highest Paradise, and the Virgin hath wept beside the Sadratu'l-Muntaha: thus hath it been decreed by God, the Lord of Names and the Creator of the heavens, in a Scroll whereof none is informed save God, the Lord of the worlds. He it is, in truth, Who speaketh forth from His Most Great Prison, testifying to that whereunto God Himself had testified ere the creation of all things, and ere the creation of earth and heaven. O ye beloved of the All-Merciful throughout the world! By My life! The morn of utterance hath broken, and the sun of testimony hath shone with such splendour that none save those who have disbelieved in God, the Exalted, the Great, hath denied it. Although beset by sorrows on every hand, yet is the Tongue engaged in utterance; while the Pen of the Most High moveth and courseth in the arena of wisdom and understanding with such impetuosity that neither the hosts of the world, nor the imaginations of the ignorant who, without any clear proof or Book from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, pretend to learning, can arrest it. Consider ye the people and their actions. They lament and weep at that which befell the Holy Family aforetime, disavowing all connection with those who wronged them; yet perpetrate their selfsame actions, albeit they comprehend it not. The Concourse on high have stood aghast at their actions, and the Most Great Spirit and the inmates of Paradise have lamented, yet the people perceive it not. They have given themselves up to their passions, turning aside from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Thus hath this Wronged One spoken, and sent down unto you that wherefrom ye may inhale the sweet savour of God, the All-Powerful, the Loving. He, verily, loveth his loved ones, and watcheth over them from this forbidden Spot. Hearken now in the Persian tongue unto the Call of Him Whom the world hath wronged, during these days when the dark clouds of oppression have prevented the resplendent face of the daystar of justice from shedding forth its light, and when the dove of equity is sore tried in the clutches of tyranny; that perchance ye may know with absolute certainty that the trials of earth and heaven cannot restrain the Pen of the Most High from extolling God and from celebrating His praise. Under all conditions it is occupied with the mention of Him Who is the All-Possessing, the Most High, that perchance even one of the peoples of the earth may inhale the fragrance of the utterance of the All-Merciful, and remain not deprived of the living ocean which hath been manifested in the name of Him Who is the Best-Beloved of all men. O friends! Although the calamity that hath befallen was, and is, most grievous, yet is He who created them well able to create others like unto them; He, verily, is the Almighty, the Most Powerful. Ye must, by the grace of God, be so steadfast in the Cause that the vicissitudes of temporal existence shall not debar you from the eternal kingdom. The earth is even such as ye have witnessed and do now witness, and no discerning person, who hath fixed his gaze upon the Most Sublime Vision, hath ever been, or ever shall be, deceived as to its true nature, inasmuch as at every moment he beholdeth how one group arriveth and another group departeth. Wherefore 'tis certain that no right-minded person hath ever been, or ever shall be, kept back thereby from the One True God. Strive that haply ye may become a means of quickening this wilting world with a new spirit. Thus commandeth you this Wronged One from this far-distant Spot. He that directed himself hither, and attained unto the presence of his Lord, made mention of you before the throne, whence We have made mention of you as a bounty on Our part, and I am the Rememberer, the All-Knowing. All of you are present before the Eye of God: He, verily, witnesseth and seeth, and He, truly, is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Rejoice ye at this Most Great Remembrance; then give praise unto your Lord, the All-Merciful, at every moment. The Glory of God rest upon you, inasmuch as ye hearkened, yet forbore; beheld, yet forewent; and witnessed that which none hath witnessed in the path of God, the All-Possessing, the All-Highest, the Ever Forgiving, the Most Bountiful. The world and all that is therein shall pass away, while that which hath been destined for you shall endure; thereto shall your names and your works be exalted on earth: thus informeth you He Who is the Truthful, the Trustworthy.

In the Name of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted!

This is an epistle from the Prisoner unto him who hath believed in God, the All-Possessing, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting, and who answered God when He said "Am I not your Lord?" by saying "Yea, verily Thou art God, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Best-Beloved." Blessed art thou, O servant, inasmuch as thou hast attained unto the recognition of God in these days wherein God came in the name of 'Ali with the truth, accompanied by hosts of angels who circle round the Throne, glorifying Him, and all who are in the heavens and earth were thunderstruck save those who at that time made mention of the name of the Bayan.

But when the Beloved came once again with His Most Great Name, most of them denied Him, and all in the kingdom of creation and command were terror-stricken, save His honored servants. Say: Verily, He liveth now in the Most Glorious Horizon, beholding and witnessing what ye do, and He saith: "O people! I have come to you from the Dayspring of Revelation with the tidings of God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting, and this Return is the Return whereat the people of the Mount were thunderstruck." Thus have We informed you in the Tablets, would that ye might know.

O people! Do ye read My verses, yet slay My Self and My Beloved? Why do ye not understand? Say: O people! Should ye prostrate yourselves upon the surface of the entire earth before God, your Lord and the Lord of all that was and shall be, and should ye worship God at every spot on earth for seventy thousand years, it would profit you naught except through love of the Youth, would that ye might know. Did that which the people of the Gospel wrought profit them when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came to them with manifest sovereignty? And did that which the people of the Furqan possessed profit them when the Sovereign of the Messengers came with the signs of God, the All-Possessing, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting? Nay, by My life! Nothing profited anyone save through faith. Thus hath the Pen of Command inscribed upon preserved tablets of glory.

Say: O people! Fear God and dispute not with Him through Whom the Sun of Utterance hath shone forth from the horizon of His name, the All-Merciful, with manifest radiance. Deny not the signs of God after their revelation, nor His power which hath encompassed all that was created between the Kaf and the Nun. And thou, O servant, stand firm in the Cause with authority from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: By God! The Sun of inner meanings and utterance hath risen from the horizon of this exalted heaven, and hath appeared upon the temple of the Youth. How wonderful is this Beauty, manifest, apparent, yet concealed!

Say: O people! Fear God and be not veiled by what ye possess. Turn ye unto His merciful countenance which hath appeared at the center of creation and speaketh in all things that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: He is God's trust among you and His covenant within you. Beware lest ye break it.

Arise for the Cause of God and His victory, which is to teach His Cause among the servants. Thus was the command revealed aforetime and now, would that ye might understand. Beware of shedding blood, for it hath been forbidden unto you in all the Tablets, would that ye might perceive. Sanctify your souls and your deeds in such wise that all atoms shall testify to your sanctification, and this verily is the true victory, would that ye might know.

Say: Beware, O people, lest ye commit that which would dishonor the Cause of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, for whatsoever ye commit, the people attribute to the Source of the Cause, as ye yourselves witness. Should the people gather in the religion of God, then impart unto them that which God hath imparted unto thee, that their faces might be illumined. Thus have We commanded thee in truth. Act according to what thou hast been commanded and be not of those who tarry after receiving the command.

Arise for the victory of God and His Cause, and fear no one. He will assist thee in truth by a command from His presence, for He is the Almighty, the Powerful, the Compassionate, the All-Forgiving. Then convey Our greetings unto the faces of those who have believed in God, be they young or old, female or male.

In My Name, the Caller before the face of the world! O My Name Jud! Upon thee be My Glory! Hearken unto that which thou didst hear before, when the Luminary of proof was shining from the horizon of Iraq, and Baghdad was the seat of the throne of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. I bear witness that thou didst hear the melody of God and His tune, and the cooing of the Dove of the Cause and the warbling of the Nightingale of Faithfulness upon the branch of Glory - that there is none other God but Me, the Single, the All-Informed. O My Name! Thou hast been and art beneath the glances of divine favor. Thou didst hear the Call of God, exalted be His glory, face to face, and didst witness the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of meanings. Now ponder: in what station is the Truth, and in what discourse are the people engaged! The burden of vain imaginings hath prevented their ears from hearkening to the divine Call, and the veils of learning and conjecture have deprived their eyes from beholding the lights of His countenance. Through the arms of power and might We delivered a number from the abyss of extinction and caused them to attain the most exalted horizon, and We mentioned with complete clarity the mysteries and affairs that were to come, that the doubts of the polytheists and the denial of the opposers and the insinuations of the heedless might not prevent attracted souls from the Dayspring of the light of oneness. Nevertheless, some were struck down and others were seen as uprooted palm-trunks. They have forsaken a Truth before a single verse of which all the books of the past and future bow down in humility and submission, and have clung to and followed the vain tales of old. Verily thou hast drunk from the ocean of My utterance and hast attained unto the splendors of the Sun of My wisdom, and hast heard what the polytheists have spoken - they who have not understood the root of this Cause and have not attained unto this choice wine, whose seal hath been broken through My Name, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Beseech ye God that receptive, knowledgeable souls may be assisted in that which God loveth. Most strange it is that despite this Call and the appearance of this most great Cause, most are seen to cling to the world and are disturbed and shaken by doubts and intimations. Say: This is the Day of God! Fear God and be not of the polytheists. Cast the tales behind you and behold My Cause with Mine eye. This is what ye were commanded in the Books, the Psalms, the Scriptures and the Tablets. Arise thou to serve the Cause of thy Lord, then inform the people and give them the glad tidings of this Light wherewith God gave glad tidings in what He sent down upon the Prophets and Messengers. Command all according to the wisdom sent down, and say on behalf of the Truth that which befitteth the Day of God. Every soul must engage in teaching the Cause with perfect wisdom and steadfastness. Should fertile soil be found, let him cast the divine Word, otherwise silence is preferable. Some time ago this exalted Word was revealed from the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book: The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with two luminaries: consultation and compassion. God willing, may all be assisted to act according to this blessed and decisive Word. Some of the servants are seen to be utterly deprived of understanding. Through imaginary bonds they are prevented from the firm handle. By My life! Were they to reflect with fairness upon even a small portion of what the All-Merciful hath revealed, all would proclaim: "Verily, Thou art the Truth, the Manifest One!" In all conditions fix your gaze upon the Truth and be occupied with service to His Cause. Remember when thou wert with Me in the pavilion of grandeur and didst hear from Me what Moses heard on the Mount of Knowledge. Thus did We assist thee and acquaint thee and mention thee, that thou mightest thank thy Lord, the Generous. It behooveth thee to preserve this most great station through My Name, the Strong, the Trustworthy. Convey My greetings to the faces of My loved ones, then let them hear My sweetest call. Thus doth command thee He Who commanded thee before, and I am the Commander, the All-Informed. Glory be upon thee and upon whosoever heareth thy word in this most great Cause and loveth thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is the Answerer

O My Name! The letter from Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, which he wrote to you was presented by this servant. God willing, may he ever dwell secure and at rest beneath the shade of divine favor. Verily He ordains for whomsoever He wishes whatsoever He wishes. He is indeed the Mighty, the Powerful. Some time ago a most holy, most exalted Tablet was revealed and sent especially for him. The gaze of favor has been and God willing shall continue to be directed towards him. We have commanded and continue to command all the friends to unity and harmony, yet still the fragrance of this most exalted station has not been detected. We beseech God to assist a company of souls to arise for this greatest of services.

Mention was made of Mulla Muhammad-Rida. As requested, a Tablet was revealed especially for him and sent. God willing, they will deliver it to him that he may drink from the living waters concealed in the utterance of the All-Merciful, turn wholly to the most exalted horizon, and arise to aid the Cause with wisdom and eloquence. Those souls in the land of Kaf who are gazing toward the horizon of the Cause are all remembered in the presence of the Wronged One. God willing, may they all manifest the most great steadfastness in such wise that neither human conditions deter them nor the allusions of those who have denied God, the Lord of all worlds, cause them to slip.

We previously announced the appearance of the cawers in the cities and regions. God willing, they must preserve the pearls of divine love in His name and keep them hidden from treacherous eyes. O Husayn! Remind them on My behalf, then send them this clear Book. Say: Should anyone come to you with the book of hell, know that he is of Satan's hosts and is the cawer promised in My clear Book. Cast behind you the tablets of fire, turning to God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. God willing, most holy, most exalted verses shall continue to be revealed and sent especially for the friends. He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.

O My Name! Give him the glad tidings of My mercy, My grace and My favor. We mentioned him before and sent him that from which wafted the fragrance of My favor that has preceded all worlds. Praise be to God, they were assisted in transcribing the divine verses. Blessed is the pen that moved, the ink that flowed, and the tablet that bore His mighty, exalted remembrance. This servant mentions him before the Wronged One and visits the Desired One on behalf of himself and of him who was named Haydar-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God.

O Mahdi! We address you at one time, and at another time him whose letter was read before the Throne. Verily your Lord does what He wishes and ordains what He desires. Mention was made in that letter of two of the loved ones of God. We send Our greetings to them both from this most exalted station and counsel them to show forth the most great steadfastness in the Cause of God, the Lord of the Throne and earth. Thus has the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in this luminous station.

And We make mention at the end of the letter of the letter Mim and Nun before Shin, and We send Our greetings to him and make mention of him in such wise that his remembrance shall endure in the lands, that he may thank his Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. The Glory be upon the people of Glory from the Glory.

And likewise mention was made that he attained the presence of the two brilliant lights, the King of Martyrs and his brother. Blessed is he, again blessed is he and those who have intended that destination. By the life of God! We detect from the dust of that spot the fragrance of Paradise - He with Whom is the decisive Word bears witness to this. We send Our prayers upon those who have turned to them both, visited their resting-places, and uttered that which the All-Merciful has revealed in the Book. He who visited the sister, upon her be My favor, My mercy and My grace, and the Christ in Ray - it is as though he visited Me. Thus has the Most Exalted Pen spoken from the most exalted station. We make mention of them at this time and say: Upon you be the Glory of God, and the Glory of those in the most exalted Paradise, and the Light shining from the horizon of the favor of their Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Praise be to God, the Lord of the beginning and the end.

I am the Hearer and I am the Answerer. O Jamal! Upon thee be My glory and upon those who love thee and make mention of thee for My sake and praise thee according to what hath been revealed from the Pen of My Command upon the Tablet of My bounty. Thou wert present before the Face \[...\] before the Throne and the Light was shining from the horizon \[...\] Be as thou hast been. Give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Let not the doings of the heedless ones and the allusions of the opposers grieve thee. Say: O concourse of princes! By God, We have not come to create disorder in the land but rather to reform it. To this beareth witness the Lord of the Kingdom of Names. Fear ye God and be not of the wrongdoers. God hath forbidden in this Revelation whatsoever causeth grief to hearts - how much more the shedding of blood and that which beseemeth not the station of man. To this testifieth that which hath been sent down from the Most Exalted Pen and beyond it He Who speaketh in this glorious and wondrous station. Blessed art thou and happy art thou for having traveled through the lands to exalt My Word, and there befell thee in My path that which caused every fair-minded and discerning one to weep. We were with thee when thou wert speaking in the cities and domains of God, purely for His resplendent Face. Rejoice in My remembrance in these days wherein the idolaters have risen against Us without any clear proof from God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: O concourse of divines! Fear ye God and be not of the transgressors. Behold ye and remember what hath proceeded from you and from your like against Muhammad the Apostle of God, and before Him the Son of Mary, and before Him He Who conversed with Me on the Mount of Knowledge - there is no God but Me, the Manifest, the Speaking, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O Jamal! The glances of God's loving-kindness - exalted be His glory - have been and are directed towards thee. In all conditions observe wisdom and hold fast unto wisdom. In the blessed Tablets that which is revealed is contingent upon wisdom and limited by time. For instance, it is revealed: Say: O people of the world! The purpose is proclamation, not action thereon in these days, for the transgressors and oppressors are witnessed to be in the utmost pride and heedlessness. They have no ears. Beseech God that He deprive not His servants and withhold them not from the ocean of His bounty in the days of His manifestation. Under all conditions must \[...\] qualities emanate from man. The trustees are dawning-places of names and attributes \[...\] Whosoever hath been heedless of this station hath wronged himself. To this beareth witness thy Beloved and thy Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth. Be thou confident in the grace and bounty of God. If there be delay in sending Tablets, there is no harm, for bounty is of such a degree that no matter can veil it. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Bountiful. The Glory, manifest and resplendent, shining from the horizon of My Kingdom, be upon thee and upon those who love thee for My sake and make mention of thee for My glorious and wondrous Name.

Remember thy family on My behalf and give them the glad-tidings of what hath been revealed for thee in this glorious Tablet. Praise be to God, all are remembered and have attained unto God's bounty and are and have been beneath the glances of mercy in all conditions. Convey remembrance to her from God. The first command is belief in God and the last is submission unto Him. Whatever hath befallen you, its grief hath penetrated even unto the prison. However, whatsoever occurreth is assuredly according to the requirements of consummate wisdom. We beseech God to bestow the good of this world and the next, that her eye may be solaced, her heart gladdened and her soul find rest. Verily He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer. The joy \[...\] returneth unto God. By the life of God, \[...\] cannot be equaled by this wise remembrance. Give thanks unto thy Lord, the Ancient Revealer. Glory be upon her and upon those with her and upon every maidservant who hath believed in the Lord of the worlds.

Make mention of Bahram, upon him be My glory. His name hath repeatedly been set forth by the Pen of the Most High. Praise be to God! He hath drunk from the Euphrates of God's mercy, hearkened to His summons, and recognized His signs. In this Day the signs of God are manifest in all directions, and the ocean of His providence is surging before the faces of mankind. Blessed is that soul who hath recognized Him and attained His good-pleasure, and woe betide him that hath erred and doubted. God willing, he will attain the station of servitude to the Cause, even though he hath already attained and testified thereto. That about which he enquireth this time hath been mentioned in two Tablets revealed by the Pen of the Most High. Divine confirmation hath been vouchsafed and will continue to be vouchsafed unto those who are detached from the world, who desire Him, and who are sincere. From time immemorial the glances of divine mercy have turned towards and will turn towards those who remember Him. Blessed are they, for theirs is the excellence of the Day of Return.

O Bahram! Thou hast enquired about His Holiness Zoroaster. He came from God and summoned mankind to divine guidance. The fire of love was ablaze in His hand. Although he came with the fire of divine love and revealed the Book of laws and commandments, the heedless failed to apprehend His station and did not recognize His Revelation. The Shi'ih, by reason of their heedlessness and ignorance, have rejected Him.

Gracious God! The people of Iran, despite their capacity for understanding the realities of things, are deprived. For centuries and ages they have turned in prayer to God, asking and yearning to attain His presence, but as soon as the Luminary of Hope shone forth and dawned above the morning horizon of His Will, all rushed forward to attack Him with the swords of hatred and demanded the shedding of His most pure blood. At this moment, they are standing upon their pulpits, uttering their curses and imprecations. Thus have they seduced their own selves, and in this Day they are reckoned among the oppressors in His unerring Book. By holding fast to that which is imaginary, they have deprived themselves of the truth. They are confused by idle fancies and bereft of the light of certainty. However, since His mercy is all pervading and since these days are the springtide of His heavenly favor, it is incumbent upon all, with hearts free of malice and rancor, to beseech God to guide all people. Perchance He will cause the ocean of bounty to surge, and will attire all in the blessed vesture of forgiveness.

O Bahram! Know this with absolute certainty. Firstly, He came with the Fire from the presence of the Friend and enkindled the extinguished element, and secondly, He gave His testimony concerning the Fire. The knowledge is with thy Lord. He is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.

Our glory rest upon him who attained My presence and hearkened to My call, upon thee, and upon the one named 'Ali 'Askar in the Book of God, the Lord of the visible and the invisible.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most Powerful

O Tahir! Your letter reached the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court some time ago and was granted audience with the Wronged One. O Tahir! The people are ignorant, deprived of the divine verses and their hearing, and forbidden from His evidences. The Sun of meanings has risen and shines from the horizon of the heaven of utterance, and the ocean of knowledge surges, yet they cling to their own vain imaginings. The divine proof has encompassed the world and the heavenly evidence has surrounded all creation - where is the hearing, where is the sight? Say: By God's life! Today the books of the world and all that the peoples possess have not been and are not sufficient. Fix your gaze upon this exalted Word which is as the spirit for the temple of utterance: Say: God sufficeth all things above all things, but nothing in the heavens or earth or what lies between them sufficeth instead of God, thy Lord. He is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Sufficing, the Almighty. All must hold fast to Him and not be heedless of Him. Today is the day of this blessed verse, yet the people are deprived of the bounty of this day. Today is the Day of God - nothing is seen except the Truth, glorified be His majesty, and His signs. Whoever remains deprived will not be enabled to make up for it. Say: Fear God and make not the drop the measure for the Most Great Ocean, nor the atom the balance for the Sun. A few deluded ones have clung to their vain imaginings and with the utmost cunning and deceit have intended to lead people astray. At times they cling to the Qur'an and at times to the Bayan, desiring to spread the carpet of past imaginings. Today nothing besides God will profit. How many souls claimed steadfastness but then at a single cry entered the precincts of delusion and with complete deceit and hypocrisy busied themselves with harming people. Convey My greetings to the friends in that land. Say: It behooveth you to be steadfast as mountains and brilliant and radiant as light, and to be so enkindled with the fire of God's love that the ungodly would not dare to speak, much less to prevail. The people of Baha are as shooting stars that prevent the demons from ascending to the heaven of hearts. They are the people of the Crimson Ark, and in the Book of Names this Ark is specifically for the people of Baha. As for your mention of questions from certain ones - today is not the day for questions. This blessed verse was revealed in answer to someone: "This is not the day for questions. It behooveth every soul, when he heareth the Call, to arise and say: 'Here am I, here am I, O God of the worlds! Here am I, here am I, O Desire of them that have recognized Thee!'" Today is another day and another time. Whoever fails to perceive this - the recompense of the deeds of the servants has prevented and deprived them. Those who have said that "He Whom God shall make manifest" is the Primal Point Himself have spoken unjustly. Regarding this Revelation He says "I am the first to worship Him." The Truth, glorified be His majesty, cannot today be known through the Bayan and what was revealed therein. The Point of the Bayan has said: "I have written a gem concerning His mention: He cannot be indicated by My indication, nor by what was revealed in the Bayan." Observe how lofty is the station of the Revelation, while the people are as beasts in what base station. Justice is as rare as the phoenix, for were it found, by a single verse of this Revelation one would find oneself independent of all previous books. As for what you wrote concerning the Afnan, upon him be all My most glorious Baha - he has previously been favored with permission and grace. Multiple Tablets were revealed and sent specifically for him. It is hoped he will drink from the ocean of the utterance of the Most Merciful and be illumined by the lights of the Sun of meanings. The glory be upon you and upon those with you.

O thou beloved of my heart, mentioned in my soul, and standing before the gate of my Lord! There has come upon this servant that which has weakened, exhausted, burned and melted him. By the life of the Desired One, I found myself in an ocean of grief that had neither beginning nor end. The pillars of the earth trembled from the force of this calamity, by which sorrows seized all who turned to God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. I testify that my tongue is powerless to mention it and my pen is unable to express it. This servant beseeches his Lord to pour forth upon you patience from His presence and fortitude from His realm. Verily He is the Mighty, the Wise. I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of Heaven, to send down upon Thy Afnans that which will preserve them from all else but Thee. Then pour forth upon them patience from Thy presence and assist them in all that befitteth Thy days. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Although all limbs and members are consumed by this most great calamity, yet as these are the days of manifestation, we must in all conditions hold fast to the cord of patience. That which appears from His presence is to be obeyed. May God, exalted be His glory, adorn all with the garment of patience. Verily He is powerful over all things. Glory be to God! Several months ago a Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will specifically for the Most Exalted Leaf and the Greatest Holy Leaf and the Supreme Cry - upon her be from all glory its most glorious, from all exaltation its most exalted, and from all radiance its most radiant. This servant pondered on what was revealed but, due to its greatness and power, made no representation and remained silent from asking until recently when the command was issued that the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet be written and sent. Now after reviewing the petition sent, it becomes clear that in those same days when the petition was submitted, the answer was revealed from the heaven of grace. But O beloved of my heart, the passages of the petition melt the heart, for the utmost regret, sorrow, sighs and tears in separation from her are manifest and evident. Although this state is in one respect most beloved and that condition was witnessed in them and that station was manifest in them - this flame of separation is effective in the world and a mighty influence is apparent and evident from it, for it was for God and purely for His sake, sanctified from doubts and allusions. After the arrival of the letter, only enough time was available to be enabled to express these few words. God willing, details will be submitted later. Until now, outwardly nothing has been submitted in the Most Holy Court. This servant too was for some days present in another place. Upon return he became occupied with submitting this reply. In any case, hope lies in forgiveness. To the honored ones in that land - upon them be from all glory its most glorious - convey greetings, glorification, glory and utter evanescence and nothingness. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to grant patience to all. Verily He is powerful over all things.

Another submission: The reply to Mulla Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be the glory of God, which was previously to be sent, is now sent. One copy of it should reach his honor Afnan A.H., upon him be from all glory its most glorious, to give to Mulla Rajab-'Ali, upon him be the glory of God. However, all possible effort in correcting it would be beloved. May the glory shining, manifest and rising from the horizon of grace be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon those who love you and upon every assured, steadfast one.

O Muhammad-Qabli-Taqi, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Luminous

In My Name, the Witness, the All-Hearing

Praise be to God that in all conditions thou hast been and wilt be, God willing, the recipient of the special favors of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. That which was recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book hath come to pass in thy path to God. In His love thou didst bear grievous trials and afflictions, and didst hearken to the taunts of the idolaters and the blame of the censurers. God willing, this most great and most exalted station shall remain preserved through the Name of God, exalted be His glory. This is the Day wherein all atoms of creation from every direction are vocal with "Thine is the praise, O God of the worlds," yet the base rabble of the earth remain heedless and veiled.

O thou who soarest in My atmosphere and gazest upon My countenance! Thou hast been created for the propagation of the Cause of God. With a detached heart, a radiant light, pure reliance, and supreme steadfastness, turn thy face toward the cities and villages, and heal through wisdom and utterance the ailments of heedless souls. Say: O servants! Let not time slip away, for it is exceeding precious. I swear by the pearls of the divine ocean of knowledge that no likeness or peer can be found for it. Arise to serve the Cause with illumined faces and pure hearts, that perchance the dead in the valley of bewilderment and error might be quickened by the wine of guidance and arise as becometh the Days of God. Today is the day of service, obedience, righteousness, and forbearance. Strive ye to drink from the ocean of awareness and attain unto that which shall cause the tranquility of the world and the salvation of the nations.

O Muhammad! Upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness, and My mercy which hath preceded all created things. We have mentioned thee throughout numbered years that thou mightest thank thy Lord and be of them that arise to serve the Cause of thy Lord, by which the hearts of the learned were perturbed and inflamed with the fire of hatred and rancor. Verily thy Lord recounteth unto thee that which hath appeared in His days. He is, in truth, the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. Cast aside the world and take that which thou art commanded by the Ancient Lord. Soon shalt thou behold that which hath been ordained for thee by the Most Exalted Pen in a mighty tablet. We have sent down for every name mentioned in thy letter that which hath delighted the eyes of the Concourse on High and attracted the hearts of them that have turned towards God. Whenever We heard thy call, We answered thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. We were with thee in times of hardship and tribulation. He is, verily, the Vigilant, the Near One. It behooveth thee to give the world to drink of the choice wine of utterance of the Ancient Lord. Thus have We commanded thee before and after, and at this moment.

We make mention of thy mother who hath believed in her Lord and attained unto My loving-kindness and My favor, the Mighty, the Impregnable. Give her glad tidings from Me and convey unto her face the greetings from thy Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earth. God shall soon exalt her remembrance and manifest unto all men and women that which He hath ordained for her. He is, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful.

O Taqi! There hath befallen you in the path of God that which hath caused all things to lament, as attesteth He Who speaketh in this night from this exalted station. Blessed are ye and blessed is he who hath loved you for the sake of God, who hath drawn nigh unto you and hearkeneth unto your words concerning this Great Announcement whereby this mighty edifice hath been raised up.

We make mention of thy first sister and thy other sister, and those whose names thou hast mentioned in thy letter. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Compassionate. Remember them on My behalf and give them the glad tidings of that which hath been sent down for them from the heaven of My Will--that which the learned of the earth have failed to comprehend, save whom God hath willed, the Lord of all worlds.

The glory shining forth from the horizon of My Kingdom and My Dominion be upon thee and upon those whom We have mentioned in another tablet, and upon those women who have turned toward the Most Sublime Horizon and have believed in God, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Wise.

The honored servant, his eminence Haji 'Abdu'l-Karim, upon him be the Glory of God and His care, may take note:

He is God, exalted be His station, to Whom belong grandeur and majesty! Praise be to Him Who was in the eternity of eternities powerful through His name the Powerful, and self-subsisting through His name the Self-Subsisting, and all-encompassing through the sovereignty of Names, whereby the limbs of the wretched who were seized by the wine of self and passion did tremble - those who denied His verses and disputed His proof and associated partners with His Countenance and rejected His bounty and turned away from His supreme mercy which preceded all things. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Bestower. And blessings and peace be upon the Guide of paths and Sovereign of Messengers, through whom the scrolls of the Prophets and Messengers were sealed, and upon His family and companions who cast aside vain imaginings, holding fast to the cord of certitude, and arose to assist the Cause of God with their souls, wealth and children, and strove in His path until God's laws and commandments spread throughout the cities and lands.

Thereafter, your letter which you had sent to the spiritual beloved, Aqa Mirza Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, was brought to this servant. After reviewing it, it was presented before His holy presence. He said: "Praise be to God that through the grace of the True One, exalted be His glory, you have attained and are speaking His praise and acknowledgment of His oneness. We testify that there is no God but Him. He has ever been and will ever be One, Single, Powerful, All-Encompassing, even as He was in the eternity of eternities. O servant named Karim! This Wronged One heard your call. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist you in that which is befitting and appropriate. Blessed is the mother who nursed one who acknowledged God and His oneness, and blessed is the father who raised him with hands of mercy and kindness. Be assured of God's grace and mercy. We pray that He ordain for you what will profit you in this world and the next. Verily He is the Lord of the throne and earth. He doeth what He willeth and He is the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the Wise."

Praise be to God that you have attained to the mention of the Intended One. This evanescent servant beseeches God, exalted be His station, to assist you in deeds whose mention will endure as long as God's names endure. Verily He is powerful over all things. I convey greetings to the friends in that land and beseech God, exalted be His glory, to adorn all with the ornament of supreme servitude and grant them success. The palm trees sent before and after arrived and were planted in the designated land. Praise be to God, the plants and others were accepted. His is the grace and bounty. You have taken much trouble. Your reward is with God. Praise be to God they enjoyed its fruits before planting and appearance, for they attained to wondrous and exalted mention. And his eminence the honored beloved Aqa Mirza Ja'far-Quli, upon him be the Glory of God, who was in charge, truly attained to service. Mention of them and their attention and service was all presented before His presence. He said: "We beseech God to send down upon him from the heaven of His grace that which will draw him near to Him in all conditions. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High."

This servant also has and had the utmost gratitude for the trouble taken by you and them, and beseeches God, glorified and exalted be He, to grant these deeds lasting fruits and eternal rewards. Verily He is the Generous Giver. Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings.

Tablet Revealed by Baha'u'llah on the Occasion of His Birthday Anniversary

O concourse of ardent lovers! I swear by God! This is a Night the world of creation hath never seen its like. Such is the evidence of the heavenly grace vouchsafed by God, the Mighty, the Bountiful.

In this Night the divine Spirit did intone a melody which hath stirred up the souls of all mankind, proclaiming: Rejoice! ye dwellers of the realm of Glory within the retreats of Paradise! And the Voice of God was raised from behind the pavilion of holiness and tender mercy, exclaiming: This is indeed the Night in which He Who is the Manifestation of the Essence of the Merciful Lord hath been born, wherein the Pen of the All-Glorious hath set forth every eternal decree with clarity. Rejoice then and be of good cheer, O people of the Bayan! And therein the Nightingale hath warbled its notes upon the boughs and the branches crying out: Rejoice, O concourse of the people of Paradise!

Say, in this Night the veil of glory hath been rent asunder before the eyes of the faithful and the Bird of Heaven hath chanted and twittered in the midmost heart of Paradise. Rejoice then, O Tabernacle of holiness in the City of Zaman! And therein God did manifest Himself resplendent in the plenitude of the glory of all His mighty Names, and did establish His seat in every pure and radiant heart. Rejoice therefore, O people of the Bayan!

In this Night oceans of forgiveness have surged and the reviving breeze of His benevolence hath been diffused. Be then of good cheer, O companions of the Merciful Lord! And therein all the trespasses committed by the people of the earth have been forgiven. This is indeed a joyful tiding unto all those that dwell in the hidden recesses of the world.

\#####

Say, this is the Night wherein the assigned measure of God's blessings and bounty hath been prescribed in the Scrolls of Glory and Faith, that thereby every trace of grief and sorrow may be banished form all created things, for all times and throughout all ages. Rejoice then in your hearts, O ye that have stepped into the realm of existence! Thereupon the Herald of the Spirit raised His Voice from the centre of the Kingdom of Eternity, the celestial Seat of loftiness and glory, exclaiming: Such is the evidence of the heavenly grace vouchsafed by God, the Mighty, the Bountiful.

And the cups of the ruby-coloured wine have been borne round by the hand of the peerless Joseph. Such is the evidence of the heavenly grace vouchsafed by God, the Mighty, the Bountiful.

Make haste then, O members of the human race, and quaff your fill from this choice wine of eternal life. Such is the evidence of the heavenly grace vouchsafed by God, the Exalted, the Bountiful.

Say, O concourse of ardent lovers! The Countenance of the Desired One hath shone forth, unveiled and conspicuous. Such is the evidence of the heavenly grace vouchsafed by God, the Exalted, the Bountiful.

O congregation of his loved ones! The Beauty of the Best-Beloved hath dawned resplendent above the horizon of holiness. Haste ye hither, come, with the entire devotion of your souls, O companions of the Bayan! Such is the evidence of the heavenly grace vouchsafed by God, the Exalted, the Bountiful.

Be ye cheerful, yet divulge not this closely-guarded, this most hidden Secret, lest perchance the non-believers discover that ye have drunk your fill from this choice wine which aboundeth with relish and rapture. Such is the evidence of the heavenly grace, vouchsafed by God, the Exalted, the Bountiful.

O People of the Bayan! God beareth me witness that His bounty is completed, His loving kindness perfected and that His Countenance hath shone forth with the utmost joy and radiance. Such is the evidence of the heavenly grace vouchsafed by God, the Exalted, the Bountiful.

Rejoice, O company of His loved ones, and partake of this sparkling, this crystal stream of eternal life, O concourse of His companions! Such is the evidence of the heavenly grace vouchsafed by God, the Exalted, the Bountiful.

O Nabil Q., upon him be the Glory of God! In the name of God, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing! God willing, may you, through the grace of the Beloved of all possibility, be in all times the Bearer of the sealed wine and the Guardian of the Hidden Word, Who speaks among the world and summons the peoples unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Countless glances of grace have been and will be vouchsafed unto you. To this bear witness your heart, your soul, your tongue, your sight, your hearing, and that which the Pen of God hath set in motion in His holy and all-encompassing Tablets to all who are in the heavens and on earth. Draw hearts and souls to the utterances of your Lord and illumine the horizons with the lights of His shining and radiant countenance. We complain unto you of those who claim to have faith yet commit that which tears asunder the veil of the sanctity of the Cause among the servants. They are indeed among the heedless ones.

O My Nabil! We have commanded all the loved ones to unity, harmony, love and fellowship, and likewise hath the Supreme Pen, from God, the Lord of Names, enjoined upon all goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct. Nevertheless, there hath appeared from some that which causeth the Pen to be ashamed to mention. You must strive with complete effort in the education of souls and their refinement and improvement, dispensing to each according to their capacity from the Kawthar of divine knowledge. Most eyes have been weakened by the ophthalmia of vain imaginings and are not capable of beholding at first the world-illumining Sun. Therefore these weak eyes must be treated with the kohl of divine knowledge which is in truth the supreme remedy for healing the world's ills, that they may become worthy to behold the Most Exalted Horizon and capable of hearing the words "Verily I am God."

The dark clouds of desire have veiled the horizon of guidance, but God shall soon disperse them in truth. He is verily the Powerful, the Mighty. Though the ocean of utterance surgeth with its waves and the horizon of proof shineth with the light of knowledge, you witness the people, in what state they are and to what matters they cling. They have taken certain ignorant ones to be learned, and by the command and permission of those heedless souls have remained deprived and forbidden from the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness. Blessed is the strong one who rendeth asunder the veils through the name of his Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower.

O Nabil! Kindle the fire of My Word amongst My servants. By My life! It is a light by which the horizons of My kingdom and the hearts of My servants who are prevented therefrom today through following the ignorant ones shall be illumined. Though the divines of the age have become veils between Truth and creation, soon shall all confess their own loss and speak in praise of the loved ones of God. Should all the world unite with utmost striving and effort to extinguish the light of God and quench the fire of the divine Word, they shall prove powerless and shall find themselves impotent. God shall cause them and what they possess to perish, and there shall endure what He hath ordained for His loved ones who have held fast to His mighty cord and followed His straight path.

Let not what was mentioned in Our presence escape your notice. Speak such words as will cause the souls to be attracted and enkindled. Be not grieved by certain matters - their rectification rests with God. Be assured and be of the thankful ones. Convey My greetings to all the friends. Tell them: This is the day of assistance and this is the day of deeds, for whatever is missed by anyone today can never be regained. Blessed is he who forsaketh that which perisheth and turneth unto that which endureth. Upon you be the Glory, and upon those with you who have believed in God and followed what they were commanded in His mighty Tablet.

The Beloved of God in Birjand and its surroundings

In His Name, the All-Subduing over whatsoever is not Him

These are clear verses, there is no doubt they have descended from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Whoso doubteth is among the most remote of creation - thus doth the Truth testify when He came with His mighty Cause. He who hath turned to the Countenance is among the people of this luminous horizon, and he who hath turned away is among the companions of the fire. We have ordained that hearts must turn towards Us - thus hath the decree been set down by the Beloved in a clear Book.

Blessed is he from whose brow shineth forth the sun of steadfastness in such wise that the eyes of the heedless are dazzled thereby, and blessed is the mouth from which wafteth the fragrance of determination upon this straight path.

O My loved ones! Ye are the lights of the sun, were ye to be of them that know, and ye are the fish of this ocean - immerse yourselves therein in My Name and discover the pearls of My knowledge which encompass the worlds. In every word of thy Lord's words surgeth an ocean whose shore none hath reached save him who hath circled round My Will, which hath conquered all who are in the heavens and the earth.

O chosen ones of God! Forsake all else, then speak forth in praise of the Desired One, that perchance the dwellers in the tombs may arise and turn toward the station wherein the Lord of existence proclaimeth: "The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Wise." Blessed is the mouth that hath tasted the sweetness of the Living Waters, and the tongue that hath been moved to praise its Lord, the All-Merciful, and the ear that hath hearkened unto this wondrous Call.

Are they who turned away based upon anything? Nay, by this exalted station! They are worshippers of idols, moved by the winds of passion - they are among the distracted ones. Arise to serve among humanity. Say: O people! The Dayspring of Oneness hath come with such sovereignty that nothing can withstand it. Turn ye unto Him and be not of the patient ones. He is the Word of God among you - corrupt it not, O heedless ones! He is the Spirit of God - slay Him not with your swords, O hosts of the oppressors! He is the Lamp of Revelation among you - extinguish it not with your breaths, O company of the malevolent!

Can anyone extinguish the lamp We have lit with the hand of power? Nay, by My radiant Beauty! The Word hath been perfected, the proof completed, and the evidence made manifest, yet the people are in strange drunkenness. Blessed is he who hath recognized the value of these days and attained unto the knowledge of his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, and hath taken the cup of eternity in the name of Baha and drunk thereof amidst the concourse of creation, despite those who denied the Lord of Names and rejected the signs whereby every moldering bone was quickened.

The Tongue of Eternity speaketh and all things speak with it, yet most people are prevented from hearing it, having followed every remote calf. Say: Cleanse your eyes - this is He Whom ye remember at morn and eventide. This is He for Whose mention and praise the Bayan was revealed, and by Whose leave every wise command was established. This is He Who was promised unto you in the Tablets from God, the Mighty, the Praised One. Cast away that which withholdeth you from Him, then approach with shining faces and illumined hearts - thus have ye been commanded in a preserved Tablet.

Whenever We desire to conclude Our utterance, We see it flowing like the ocean from the valleys and shining like the sun from this luminous horizon. When the Most Great Ocean surgeth, can anything still it? Nay, by My Name which hath subdued the worlds! When the winds of Will blow, can anything prevent them? Nay, by My Cause, before which the necks of the proud have bowed!

All this is of My grace upon thee - be thou thankful and among those who praise. Reflect within thyself how thy recompense should be for Our having remembered thee while We were imprisoned in the hands of the oppressors. Confine matters to the remembrance of thy Forgiving Lord, then speak of what hath befallen Him at the hands of these transgressors.

The Most Glorious Beauty from God, the Lord of Names, be upon thee and upon those who are steadfast in the Cause of their Lord, the Mighty, the Beautiful.

O Son of My Name A?daq, upon him be the Glory of God! He is God, exalted be His station in wisdom and utterance! Hearken, hearken! The Most Exalted Pen calleth aloud from the most exalted station of the world. Behold, behold! The Luminary of proof shineth resplendent from the highest horizon of possibility, that It may bestow strength and grant spiritual wings, that thou mayest soar in the atmosphere of the love of the One Friend and purify those who tarry - souls whose wings are besmeared with the clay of idle fancies - through the Name of the True One, and teach them to fly.

O Son of My Name! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. In these days His Holiness Moses hath ascended, and this servant lay upon his bed while the Tongue of Grandeur uttereth verses and the Hand of the Kingdom of all things bestoweth and taketh away. Say: O people of God! Ye must needs be so steadfast in the Cause of God that neither the onslaught of the mighty nor their ascendancy may weaken you. Stand ye for God's sake and speak for God's sake. The Truth hath been and will be with you, and neither the clamor of the divines nor the outcry of the jurisprudents hath prevented or will prevent the influence of the Most Exalted Pen and the power of the Most Great Word.

O Son of My Name! Were the whole spiritual realm to be transformed entirely into the power of hearing, one might say it would be worthy of hearkening to this utterance which hath flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful. Otherwise, these outward ears have not been and will not be capable of hearing this call, save for a limited few. Beseech thou God to grant insight and bestow the power of hearing, that perchance His poor servants may not remain deprived of the sweet fragrances of the divine Day. The people of the earth are heedless and regard the Cause of God as they regard other matters. Woe and perdition betide them! Soon shall they witness that which they now deny, and turn towards that from which they now turn away.

Say: O ye ignorant ones! Turn ye toward Zawra that ye may behold the palace of the King of Kings. Perchance ye may take warning and become somewhat aware. Let not the pomp and riches and majesty and glory of two days prevent you from everlasting glory and abiding bounty and heavenly sustenance. By the Ark of Proof which saileth upon the sea of utterance by the command of the All-Merciful! This Wronged One hath spoken only for the sake of God. Say: Have mercy upon yourselves and arise to redress what hath passed away. Yesterday is gone and today too shall pass. This impermanence is God's herald, informing all and giving tidings, that they may arise with complete determination to seek their goal and station. The Herald calleth continually from the direction of the Throne, counseling with perfect loving-kindness and grace, that perchance the servants may turn from oppression to justice and from tyranny to equity.

O Son of My Name! We beseech divine confirmation for thee, that thou mayest spend the remainder of thy days in service to the Lord of all mankind in a manner befitting this Most Great Cause and Mighty Announcement. Thine acceptance and devotion and steadfastness have ever been mentioned before the Divine Countenance. This time requireth a different effort and a different steadfastness. God willing, thou shalt be adorned with the new robe of divine favor and illumined by the lights of the Throne. Convey My greetings to the loved ones, that they may become enkindled by the Word of God and arise as beseemeth His days. That which is obligatory and essential today, and hath been repeatedly revealed from the Most Exalted Pen, is the unity and concord of the known souls who have been honored with special distinction, as well as the other loved ones. Blessed is he who hath hearkened to the divine call and held fast unto His will. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who have acted according to that which they were commanded by God, the Lord of the worlds.

We have heard thy call time and again, and thy deeds have been accepted again and again, and We have answered thee at times with that which made the world rejoice and at other times with a mention that caused the hearts of the sincere to soar. Grieve not at the events of the world and the clamor of those who denied the Manifestation when He came with manifest sovereignty. Say: O concourse of men! Follow not those who denied the Most Great Scene and turned away from Him Who came with the banners of verses from God, the Mighty, the Powerful. O Nabil! The Wronged One beareth witness to thy turning unto Him, thy drawing nigh, thy presence before His face and thy hearkening to that which was raised in the world from the Lord of eternity. This is a testimony that all the treasures of the world and whatsoever is with the nations cannot equal. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who loveth thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the mighty throne. There hath come before the Wronged One what thou didst send previously and subsequently to the Name of Bounty. We have sent down for thee that from which every one who turneth unto God hath found the fragrance of the loving-kindness of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thy mention and that wherewith thou didst call upon God have attained to His hearing. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this manifest grace. The world shall pass away but there shall endure for thee what hath been sent down before and after and at this time. Convey My greetings to thy son who hath turned unto God while most of the servants who broke God's covenant and testament denied and rejected this Proof, before which all the proofs in the world have bowed down, as attesteth every fair-minded and discerning one, every knowing and informed one. We have mentioned thee and those with thee as a favor from Us, and We are indeed the Bountiful, the Generous. There hath come before the Wronged One what thou didst send and spend by My command and authority. We bear witness that thou hast fulfilled what was incumbent upon thee by the decree of the Book, and We have accepted thy deed, and We beseech God, thy Lord, to aid thee in that whose fragrance shall not be cut off through the perpetuity of this Name whereby He hath subdued all who are in the heavens and on earth. O traveler! Grieve not at what thou hearest and seest. Verily He is with thee and guardeth thee and preserveth thee through the hosts of the seen and the unseen. Thy Lord is indeed the Powerful, the Triumphant, the Mighty. We have been with thee, hearing and seeing, and We are the Hearer, the Answerer. Convey My greetings to the faces of those who are with thee and My loved ones there, and illumine them with the lights of My wondrous utterance from whose horizon the light hath shone forth and that which was hidden from the eyes of the heedless hath appeared. When thou findest the fragrance of My remembrance and drinkest the choice wine of utterance from My words, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having caused me to attain unto Thy remembrance and to speak Thy praise and to hasten unto Thy good-pleasure and to stand firm in Thy love. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned unto Thee with the turning of one who is assured, seeing, confident and informed. I beseech Thee by Thy Name whereby Thou hast illumined the world to set right my affairs and to ordain for me from the Pen of Thy decree that which will bring me into Thy presence. Then decree for me, O my God, that which will preserve me from the clamor of the heedless ones and the uproar of the treacherous ones. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Believe in what has been sent down to you and dispute not the verses of God after their revelation, lest a severe chastisement befall you in justice. Fear God, O people, then consider what was sent down to the Prophets and Messengers, and what has been revealed in these days, that the truth may become manifest to you and you may be possessed of illumined insight. God has sent Messengers to His servants since time immemorial, who called the people to Him and gave them glad tidings of the days of God. But when the Day appeared and God came with the Manifestation of His Self, they disbelieved in Him and turned away until they arose to slay Him. Thus was the matter decreed. No Messenger was sent except the people denied Him and disputed with Him vainly, until God established the truth through His verses and seized those who disbelieved and associated partners with God and were deprived of the Kawthar of faith. Forget not those days when you entered the Garden of Paradise before the Countenance and were illumined by His lights. In those days We concealed Our face lest anyone recognize Us, according to the wisdom inscribed in the Tablets by the Pen of Command. When the appointed time of concealment was fulfilled, We unveiled the Face with a sovereignty witnessed by all creation. None deny it save those who are heedless of the remembrance of their Lord and are debarred from the shore of grace. Hearken to My words and purify yourself from all that prevents you from God, your Lord. Then take for yourself a guardian in truth, and he will protect you from all that displeases you and guard you from the harm of every harmful thing. His mercy is ever nigh unto you. Trust in all matters to your Lord and He will aid you with the hosts of the unseen with power. If you find in your father's heart love for God and the Manifestation of His Self, remind him, that perchance he may arise from the sleep of heedlessness and find a path to God. Otherwise, leave him to himself, for verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is independent of all created things. He gives sovereignty to whom He wishes among His servants and withholds it from whom He wishes. He has power over all things. Forget not the favor of your Lord when enemies surrounded you, and He protected you in truth, set right your affairs, sent down tranquility from His presence upon you, and delivered you from sorrow with an all-encompassing sovereignty. Turn your face to Him and trust in His grace. Fear no one, for He will exalt you in truth and fulfill what you desire that you may be steadfast in the Cause. Read this Tablet in times when you find yourself detached from this world and all that is therein, that it may attract you to a station praised from all eternity. Know that We have not forgotten you in this prison and sent you before this a Tablet inscribed by the Finger of Command. And now We send you this Tablet that you may rejoice in your soul and be gladdened by God's loving-kindness. When it reaches you, take it with the power of your Lord, then act according to what is in it. Thus do We teach you and impart to you that your eyes may be consoled and you may be among those who, when verses are sent down to them from the King of Names and Attributes, fall prostrate upon their faces before God Who created them by His command and made them among those who are mentioned before the Throne. And glory be upon you and upon those who have held fast to the cord of God and the handle of His grace and who have remained faithful to the Cause.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful!

Praise be to the Lord of all desire, Who is worthy and deserving, Who hath distinguished between the polytheists and the monotheists through the blessed word "There is none other God but God." This blessed word is the decisive utterance. Every word that hath proceeded from the Mouth of His Will hath been and is the decisive utterance. His words are powerful, His verses all-encompassing, and His proofs penetrating - yet the servants remain heedless, save those whom our Lord, the Lord of the Throne and of earth, hath willed. He is the All-Bountiful, the One Who hath united hearts and minds through His most exalted Word. He hath gathered the peoples of the East and West at one table and one feast, and with most eloquent utterance hath called all who dwell on earth to unity and concord. Blessed are they who have comprehended the station of unity and concord and have held fast unto it. Woe betide the heedless! Blessings and peace be upon the Lord of the world and upon His family and companions, through whom the sovereignty of God and His power were made manifest, and the treasures of His grace and favor were revealed. Through their justice oppression was shaken, through their belief in unity the limbs of polytheism trembled, through their standards the standards of the deniers and transgressors were lowered, and through their banners the banners of the heedless and the wayward were brought low.

O thou beloved of my heart! How wondrous is this messenger, how wondrous this sign that hath appeared and become manifest! The electric current arrived bearing news of thy arrival. This news was a clear glad-tiding and a trustworthy herald. After being informed, we proceeded to the Holy Court where it was presented before the countenance of the Lord and was blessed to attain His hearing. He said: "O Physician! Upon thee be My peace and My glory! Thou hast ever been remembered in the presence of the Wronged One. From the Holy Land, the honored Afnan hath mentioned thee in every instance. Praise be to God that thou art blessed with health and enjoying His bounty. Today, the bounty that is acceptable in the sight of God is the bounty of recognition and certitude. Blessed are they who have attained unto them, and woe betide the wayward!"

This land manifesteth itself differently each day. We beseech God to assist His servants to observe justice in all matters. Verily, He is the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Loving. We likewise beseech Him to assist thee in that which causeth the exaltation of being and the advancement of souls. Say: "My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having taught me Thy word of unity and revealed unto me that which was hidden from the eyes of most of Thy servants. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name, and by Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones, to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most High."

Praise be to God! Thy presence in that land hath been and will continue to be a source of joy. God willing, thou wilt occupy thyself with wisdom and utterance in uniting hearts and refining souls, that perchance the people of unity may arise from their lethargy and become deserving of divine mercy, and that through this bounty the remaining cities and lands may be preserved and protected from plunder, oppression, tyranny and transgression in the sheltering shadow of God, exalted be His glory, which is an impregnable fortress. Verily, God hath power over all things.

This servant beseecheth Him to ordain for the people of unity what He ordained for them in the beginning of days, and to manifest through them His power, His might, His influence, His sovereignty and His will. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word "Be" and it is. I convey greetings to the friends in that land, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for each one that which leadeth to eternal salvation and everlasting joy. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the Answerer, the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you.

BEIRUT. O Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be the Glory of God. 20 Jamadi'th-Thani 1305.

He is God, exalted be His glory, majesty and power!

Praise sanctified from severance and decline befitteth the Peerless Object of all, Who created the world and adorned it with the light of recognition. The bearers of this light are the Prophets and Messengers who, by the command of the Ancient King, have stepped forth into the arena of manifestation for the salvation of the peoples of the world. However, some of mankind, due to their preoccupations, and some due to lack of capacity, and others due to the consequences of their deeds, did not attain to the blessed and goodly Word of Unity. Yet others regarded the world as non-existent and hastened with heart and soul to the horizon of the All-Merciful, until that light culminated in the Lord of the world and the Exemplar of nations, He Who speaks of the Most Great Name and relates the Mighty News. Upon Him be the blessings and peace of God, and upon His family and companions through whom appeared God's authority among His servants and His fear among His creation, and through whom was revealed the judgment of the Book and the Cause encompassed all regions.

And now, O beloved of my heart, thy precious letter arrived, from which wafted such fragrances of love that were it to be styled a Tablet it would not be improper, for it had a complete effect and complete influence. Glorified be your Creator and magnified be your Maker and Confirmer! After being apprised of it, it was presented before the Master, Who said: "God willing, they will return, adorned with the blessing of health and well-being and partaking of the feast of attainment to His presence. Verily He is the Kind, the Forgiving." End quote.

Praise be to God, the affiliated ones in this land are sound and healthy. These days they attained the honor of His presence at the mansion for two days, and the spiritual beloved Aqa Mirza Mahdi, upon him be the peace of God, delayed one steamer specifically to meet that beloved one and then returned. As for the letter of the beloved of the heart, his honor Aqa Siyyid Yahya, upon him be Baha'u'llah's peace, it was seen and all of it was heard. However, before the arrival of your letter, the beloved of the heart Aqa Mirza Husayn, upon him be Baha'u'llah's peace, had already proceeded to that direction as commanded. What must now be adhered to according to the command is this: whatever arrives and they are able to obtain should be delivered to the creditors, and they should consult about affairs and act as they deem advisable, placing their trust in God. If there are excess goods they should distribute them to various places. If they request someone specific, certain souls can be sent from this land for that purpose. This matter must remain confidential and not be mentioned to anyone. In any case, consideration for them is necessary, and since they are trustworthy and the thought of betrayal has never crossed their minds, it is hoped that affairs will be set right. Whoso is for God, God is for him - unless some other firm purpose is intended from this upheaval.

Another submission: Some time ago a letter was sent to that beloved and it is not known whether it arrived or not. And this letter was sent after that beloved's arrival in Beirut. God grant it does not arrive with "Verily we are God's and to Him we return." May the hands of destiny and decree of Truth give life and bestow vitality and bring it before the most luminous gaze. Knowledge is with God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne. To his honor the esteemed master, the great Afnan, upon him be from all the Most Glorious Glory, and his honor the most luminous star Afnan, upon him be the Glory of God, I present my utter evanescence and nothingness. And likewise I send greetings to all other friends. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon God's sincere servants. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful!

All praise and glory, sanctified beyond description and understanding, befitteth Him Who is the Desire of the worlds, Who hath illumined the world through the dawning-places of His Prophets and His chosen ones. These are the divine lamps amidst His servants and the manifestations of the lights of the Throne unto all who dwell in His lands. To cling unto them is to cling unto God, the All-Glorious, and to hold fast unto them is to hold fast unto Him. These are the suns in the heavens of knowledge and understanding, and these are the guides to the path and the dawning-places of proof and evidence. Whoso hath known them hath known God, and whoso hath obeyed them hath obeyed God, and whoso hath turned away from them hath turned away from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

Glory be unto Thee, O Thou through Whom every straight path hath appeared and every mighty Book hath been sent down! I beseech Thee by Thy all-encompassing grace which hath embraced Thy creation and Thy creatures, to aid those on earth to turn towards the lights of the Sun of Thy Oneness and the manifestations of the glory of Thy Singleness. Thou art He, O my God, before Whose fear the limbs of all names have trembled, and before Whose might all who are in earth and heaven have been shaken. I beseech Thee, O Cleaver of the Dawn and Sender of the Winds, by Thy Most Exalted Self and by Him through Whom Thou didst seal Thy Messengers and Prophets, to enable Thy servants to act in accordance with what Thou hast commanded them in Thy Book. I testify that Thou hast desired for them naught save that which draweth them nigh unto Thee and acquainteth them with what shall profit them in every world of Thy worlds. Thou art, verily, the Almighty over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Thereafter, your letter was the cause of renewed joy. Praise be to God that, through the wonders of God's infinite mercy, you are enabled to remember and praise God, blessed be His glory, and are successful in that which is befitting. This hath been and shall ever remain one of the great bounties of God, exalted be His glory. Haji Mirza Abu'l-Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God, hath also written to this servant. This servant had previously sent two detailed letters to him. Thus far, outwardly, no word of their receipt hath been received. I trouble you to convey my greetings to him in your letter and to mention the details of those two letters.

The letter from Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, was also received. Praise be to God, the fragrance of the love of the Beloved of the worlds was wafted therefrom. God willing, may he ever be assisted and confirmed in that which God loveth and is pleased with.

As to what was written concerning Aqa Muhammad-Javad, upon him be the Glory of God, his petition was previously received and an answer was graciously given. Regarding his turning towards this direction, they stated that although this land appears outwardly tranquil, it is inwardly turbulent. The people of this region have been and continue to be utterly perfidious. In the holy Books of the past, the inhabitants of these lands were likened unto the offspring of vipers. This hath been and remaineth the reason for withholding permission; otherwise, this Wronged One hath ever loved not to deprive His loved ones of His presence. Let them now proceed, placing their trust in God. Verily, He guideth whom He willeth unto His straight path. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

You should convey these glad tidings in the same detail as mentioned to Haji Mirza Abu'l-Hasan and Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Husayn, upon them both be the Glory of God. God willing, this servant shall later send a reply to the letter of Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Husayn. This time there was no opportunity, and thus his reply was delayed. The glory of God be upon you and upon them and upon those who follow that which they have been commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds.

The following hath been sent down from the heaven of grace unto the servant who hath been named Javad in the Kingdom of righteousness, and thus was grace inscribed by the Pen of Justice:

He is the Beloved, the Sorrowful

Thy Lord maketh mention of His servant Javad, who hath believed and been guided, and who stood firm in the Cause on the day when the feet of the mystics did slip, and they denied God, their Lord and the Lord of the last and the first. Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the direction of the Luminary of the horizons, that the breaths of revelation may attract thee to the habitation of longing and draw thee nigh unto the prison, the seat of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the Most Glorious. We have, verily, bestowed Our favor upon thee time and again, then yet again after the first. By God! The bounty of thy Lord unto thee cannot be comprehended or reckoned, and the pens of the heavens and earth, and the hearts of the possessors of understanding, are powerless to reckon it.

We shall now recount unto thee tales of those who worshipped idols, lest the veils of men and their turning away from the beauty of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, sadden thee, that thou mayest find peace within thyself and rejoice in thine essence, and witness those who have turned away from My beauty playing with ashes, heedless of Him by the light of Whose countenance the highest heavens were illumined, even unto the depths beneath the earth. Know thou that those who have taken idols as their guardians instead of God adduce as proof that these are the manifestations of the Cause among us, and when asked by what evidence they speak thus, they say: "We have found this in our books, therefore we follow them," and they are among those who have strayed from the path and then transgressed. These are they whom naught hath prevented from the ways of unity save blind imitation, even as thou hearest in this day from the concourse of the Bayan, such that if they were asked why they have turned away from the Beauty of the Adored One, they would say: "We found mention of this in our books and we followed what was mentioned," though they understood not a single letter of the Book and comprehended not the essence of the Cause and its origin. We have veiled this through Our wisdom, and none knoweth it save those who have entered the Most Great Scene and are among those who have witnessed and seen. Were We to lift the veil from the face of the Cause, they would discover what is hidden, but We have concealed it until God shall reveal it in truth. He, verily, is the Protector of all who are patient and God-fearing.

On that Day thou shalt find most of those on earth worshipping idols and rejoicing therein. Doth this diminish aught from God, thy Lord? Nay, by My glorious and most glorious Self! These, despite their multitude, shall not be mentioned before thy Lord, as though they had never been created upon the earth. Thus recognize the condition of those who have denied God in these days and are among those who follow their passions and desires. Leave the mention of these, then ascend unto the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, that thou mayest hear the most sweet melodies in the Paradise of refuge, and sanctify thyself from base allusions, and attain unto the ultimate goal.

Say: O people! Do ye dispute with Us concerning what We have witnessed of the most great signs of Our Lord? By God! The vision of the One possessed of mighty strength wavered not from what it beheld from the most sweet Scene, and verily He it is Who is established and seated upon the throne. He sendeth down at every moment from the heaven of grace that whereof a single letter outweigheth all that hath been created in the cities of eternity. O people! The Spirit speaketh not of its own desire, but according to that which is revealed unto it from the direction of the throne of His Essence unto His most holy and most pure Self. Say: O people! Can ye prevent the sun from shining, or the sea from its waves, or the holy Tree from its fruits? By God! Ye shall never be able to do this, even if all things should follow you in what is witnessed and seen. Thus have We revealed unto thee that whereby thine eyes may be consoled.

Thus have We sent down to thee that which will solace thine eyes and turn thy heart toward the court of God, thy Lord, and will make thee a guide unto them that have gone astray and wandered far. And the mercy which floweth forth from the paradise of eternity be upon thee, O people of Baha, and upon them that have clung to the branches of this sacred and exalted Tree.

He is the Sovereign, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower

The remembrance of God in the Tree of Paradise: God, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, Who hath ordained the measures of the Cause in the Tablets of a watchful Glory. In His hand is the dominion of all things, and He is powerful over all things. His is the bounty and grace, His the power and justice. He singles out whom He willeth through His command, and He encompasseth all things. O Beauty of Holiness in the Most Great Word! Rend asunder the veils and fear no one. Place thy trust in God, the Mighty, the Most High, the All-Wise. Cast upon the people that which We have cast upon thee from beyond the ocean of destiny. Tarry not for less than a moment, and be not of the patient ones. Come forth from behind the veils of light with the adorning of God, then arise from the horizon of holiness with manifest lights of glory. And if thou art touched with tribulation and adversity in My love, grieve not, for this is My way with the Messengers. Remind the servants of that which will cause them to turn to the direction of an assured holiness. Then recount unto the people the bounty of thy Lord. And if these polytheists object to thee, say: "By God! The Spirit of Holiness hath appeared in a novel holy vesture, and verily the pebbles do at this moment glorify in this sacred, luminous Hand. The Call hath returned in this blessed Tree which hath been raised upon the Mount of Musk, and this is indeed a mighty trial." Say: "This is the Cave wherein took refuge the Youth of Eternity when they said: 'Our Lord! Grant us mercy from Thy presence and dispose our affair aright,' and Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful. We heard their cry and sheltered them therein, and made them a remembrance for all the worlds." Say: "This is the Cave wherein Muhammad, the Apostle of God, was preserved from the hands of the hateful ones." Say: "This is the Ark wherein the Son of Mary ascended in truth, if ye be of them that know." Say: "We have believed in God and in what hath been sent down unto us and what was sent down unto God's Messengers aforetime, and what was sent down unto Ali before Nabil." Say: "He is the Sovereign of the Messengers, and God created by one letter from Him all who are in the heavens and the earth, if ye be of the assured ones." Say: "We were behind seventy thousand veils and We concealed the Face lest anyone of the worlds should behold it. But when the polytheists imprisoned Us, We unveiled the Face and manifested it like the sun from behind thick clouds. When they turned away, We turned against them to spite them and spite those who waxed proud before God and were among the opposing ones."

Know then that We have found the fragrances of love from thy letter and have sent thee this Tablet that thine eyes might be solaced thereby, and the eyes of those who have turned unto God and are of them that return. But beseech God that He cut not off from thee these fragrances sent forth by the Mighty, the Generous, for the bird of sedition hath taken flight from the direction of destiny. Thus hath the matter been decreed from the Pen of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Sovereign, the Subduer, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And thou, preserve this Tablet, then recite it with wondrous melody every day, that God may preserve thee through His grace, for He is the Best Preserver and Helper. And if thou findest pure hearts, cast upon them that which We have cast upon thee of the gems of the Cause, that thereby the hearts of the sincere may rejoice. We have indeed sent thee what hath been revealed in this Prison that thou mayest become aware of the mysteries within the veils of light and be of them that know. Then write it in thy finest hand and send it to near and far places, then spread it before Our servant Ja'far that he may give glad tidings unto the people through the signs of his Lord and be of them that give glad tidings. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who have detached themselves wholly unto God and are of the doers of good. Then convey Our greetings to all who are in thy land, both male and female, that Our grace may be completed upon them from Our presence, and this is indeed a mighty grace.

In the Name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious

The remembrance of God unto the Leaf of Paradise, that she may hear the melodies of the Leaf of Eternity from this Branch which hath been raised up in His Most Glorious Name, that she may be drawn by the breezes of God. O blessed Leaf! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord once again from this most delicate and sweet Voice. By God! Were all things to hear but one note of His melodies with the ear of their inmost nature, they would surely be drawn unto the court of glorified might. Blessed art thou in that thou hast sanctified thyself from all else save God thy Lord and hast taken up thy dwelling beneath the shade of thy Lord's protection in a station that is, in truth, impregnable. Fear God, then remember Him with thy tongue and thy heart, and turn not unto those who have disbelieved and turned away after having believed, and who were far removed from the shore of grace. Guard thy heart from allusions, then taste of the fruits of this blessed, pure and lofty Tree which hath appeared in truth at the midmost heart of the horizons with lights whereby every percipient soul hath been illumined. Be thou assured within thyself that God is with thee and by thee, and He is indeed nigh unto His servants. He will never deprive thee of the breezes of His holiness and will remember thee in truth, and He doth watch over thee. Grieve not for the adversity and hardship that hath touched thee, for God shall soon transform them through His mercy from His presence, and He hath power over all things. Say: O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Beauty which Thou hast manifested and raised up in truth and sent unto all the worlds, and which Thou hast named in the Concourse on High as the Most Great Announcement and among the hosts of creation as Ali, then by His latter manifestation in the Most Glorious Name, that Thou deprive me not of the breezes of the might of Thy mercy, and cast me not far from the shore of the grace of Thy nearness and bounty, for Thou hast ever been the All-Wise over all things. O my Lord! Give me to drink from the Kawthar of Thy favor and the Tasnim of Thy grace and bounty, that it may purify me from all that Thy good-pleasure abhorreth and deliver me from this malady that hath seized me, for Thou hast ever been the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful unto Thy servants. O my Lord! Rend asunder the veils that have come between Thee and me, then heal me with the Kawthar of healing from the fingers of Thy mercy which have preceded all things and encompassed all who dwell in the kingdom. O my Lord! Cast me not into despair of Thy wondrous gifts and beauteous bounty, then grant me what Thou hast of the cups of eternity and make me steadfast in Thy Cause, for Thou hast power over all things.

He is God! God willing, may that divine Leaf be ever mindful of this remembrance that hath been revealed, and be assured of God's tender mercies which have ever encompassed that Leaf and, God willing, will continue to do so. Regarding what you mentioned about the mother of His Holiness the Exalted One (may my soul be sacrificed for all else beside Him) desiring that you should turn in that direction - it would be most welcome should you choose to go; no harm shall come to you. God willing, may you ever repose beneath the divine Tree and dwell within the pavilion of the protection of the Cause. Be not distressed by the tribulations that have befallen you, for trials have ever been and shall ever be the portion of God's chosen ones. How excellent, then, is the state of one who is content and thankful for whatsoever befalleth them, for nothing descendeth upon any soul from God save that which is better for that soul than all that hath been created between the heavens and the earth. Since people are unaware of this mystery and the mystery thereof, they find themselves sorrowful when trials overtake them. God willing, may you ever dwell in the abode of assurance and be nourished by the fruits of understanding, for He is indeed the Best of Providers and the Best of Protectors. And the Spirit and Glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon every penitent servant, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

The Tablet which hath been raised unto God hath been sent down from the heaven of immortality unto him who was named Aqa Baba, that he may read it at eventide and at dawn.

In the Name of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted! Glorified be He Who sendeth down the verses in truth and through them draweth unto Him the hearts of whomsoever He pleaseth. Verily, He hath ever been powerful over whatsoever He willeth. All that is in the heavens and all that is on earth glorify Him, and all are mentioned in His Tablet.

O servant! Consecrate thy heart to the Sacred House, then visit it with manifest humility. When the way to thy Lord was barred, He ordained for the pilgrims to turn their hearts unto the seat of His mighty throne, for the people had blocked the path and prevented the servants from attaining the shore of impregnable glory. Therefore hath God accepted from them their turning toward the direction of the House with pure and luminous hearts.

When thou desirest to make the pilgrimage, perform ablutions as thou wert commanded in the Book, then turn thy face toward the Throne and say: The praise which hath proceeded from Thy Most Exalted Self, and the glory which hath dawned from Thy Most Resplendent Beauty, be upon Thee, O Manifestation of Grandeur, Sovereign of Immortality, and King of all who are in earth and heaven! I testify that through Thee were revealed the sovereignty of God and His power, the majesty of God and His grandeur. Through Thee the Suns of eternity shone forth in the heaven of destiny and the Beauty of the Unseen appeared from the horizon of creation. I testify that through one movement of Thy Pen the command of "Be" was made manifest, and God's hidden secret was disclosed, all created things began to exist, and all manifestations were raised up.

I testify that through Thy beauty the Beauty of the Worshipped One was revealed and through Thy face the Face of the Desired One shone forth. Through a word from Thee was made the distinction among all created things, the faithful ascended unto the heights of glory and the idolaters descended into the lowest depths. I testify that he who hath known Thee hath known God, and he who hath attained unto Thy presence hath attained unto the presence of God. Blessed is he who hath believed in Thee and in Thy signs, who hath humbled himself before Thy sovereignty, who hath been honored with meeting Thee, who hath attained the good pleasure of Thy will, who hath circled round Thee, and who hath presented himself before Thy Throne.

Woe betide him who hath wronged Thee, and denied Thee, and repudiated Thy signs, and gainsaid Thy sovereignty, and risen up against Thee, and waxed proud before Thy face, and hath disputed Thy testimonies, and fled from Thy rule and Thy dominion, and been numbered with the infidels whose names have been inscribed by the fingers of Thy command upon Thy holy Tablets.

O my God and my Beloved! Waft, then, to me from the right hand of Thy mercy and Thy loving-kindness, the holy breaths of Thy favors, that they may draw me away from myself and from the world unto the precincts of Thy nearness and Thy presence. Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou, verily, hast been supreme over all things.

Thus have We commanded thee, O servant! Arise and act as thou hast been bidden. This shall suffice thee above all who dwell on earth. Whosoever visiteth this Wronged One, this Sorrowful One, this Prisoner, and reciteth what the Spirit hath revealed in this Tablet, God shall forgive him and his parents and his kindred who have believed in God, and shall raise him up in every Revelation with a radiant and luminous countenance. He shall shelter him beneath His shadow and cause him to abide near His mercy, and shall sustain him with the holy fruits of Paradise, and shall send down upon him that which shall make him independent of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thus hath it been decreed in the Tablets.

Blessed is he who hath followed the command of his Lord in these days wherein most of the servants have become heedless and have deprived themselves of the wondrous favors of God. As for thee, render thanks unto God for having singled thee out for this bounty and sent unto thee that from which thou wilt find the fragrance of the beloved Glory. Upon thee, and upon thy wife, and upon those who have remained steadfast in the Cause this day, be glory.

He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the Inaccessible, the Exalted!

Glorified be He Who sendeth down verses anew, in a manner that draweth unto Him all them that are nigh unto God, and hath ordained therein the measures of all things in such wise that all who are in the heavens and on earth are powerless before it. Thus hath the matter been inscribed at this hour by the Pen of Glory upon the Tablet of eternity with majesty.

Verily, they who have ascended unto God and turned away from earthly dominion, and have drunk from the ocean of life - these are they who recognize the melodies of Paradise and bear witness that all this is a revelation from the presence of One Who is the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. These are they from whose faces radiance doth shine forth, and from whose hearts the remembrance of God is heard, and who have been enraptured in the atmosphere of the spirit by the melodies of God. They drink deep from the chalice of beauty, and move at the mention of God's name, and partake of the wine that hath descended from the clouds of knowledge.

Thus do We relate unto thee from the chronicles of truth, and cast upon thee the melodies of Paradise, that they may attract thee unto thyself and turn thee toward the shore of eternity in the Most Exalted Pavilion, and raise thee to a station that transcendeth all knowledge.

O beloved! Hear what the deniers say: "We find no spirit in these melodies." Say: "Woe unto you, and to how Satan hath made your deeds seem fair in your own eyes, for verily the spirit of life from this Paradise hath been sent unto all the worlds." Say: "When We found none in the kingdom worthy, We concealed the Beauty of the Divine Identity in camel's hair, lest ye should recognize Me. When ye turned away with the fetters of your hearts, We revealed the Face from behind the pavilion of light, and ordained the matter in a tablet that was hidden from all eyes."

Say: "Cast, then, the ropes of your sorcery and the staves of your idle fancies, that this Serpent might, by God's leave, swallow them up, that the power of God might be witnessed by all the worlds, even as this sun in the midst of heaven." Say: "We had restrained the Pen of Power lest it move across the Tablet, but when We perceived from you the odor of hypocrisy, We moved it less than the beating of a gnat's wing, that ye might witness the surging of this ocean, and perchance the beacons of love might be kindled in your hearts, and ye might become like moths circling round the flame by God's leave."

Say: "O people! Fear God and fabricate not against His servant. Then have mercy upon yourselves and deprive not your souls of the breezes that blow from the right hand of sanctity. This world shall pass away, and all that groweth and is planted therein, and ye shall return to the place wherein the balance of God shall be set up by the hands of power, whereby all deeds of every soul shall be weighed on the day when the sun of justice shall shine forth from the horizon of divine decree, and God shall come with a matter that transcendeth all comprehension."

Hear, O people of the earth, My words, and occupy not yourselves with that which profiteth you not in this vain life, neither grieve for what hath passed you by of earthly ornaments, but soar in the atmosphere of detachment on the wings of submission. And thou, remind the people of what We have cast upon thee, and forget not God's covenant with thee, but hold fast unto His protection, for this is better for thee than all that hath been amassed in the kingdom.

Thus do We teach thee through grace and cast upon thee that which is dearer unto God than all wisdom that hath been mentioned. And peace be upon thee and upon all who are steadfast in their love for their Lord, and upon every grateful servant.

Although no letter was observed from you, nevertheless this servant sent a reply. In any case, he has been striving with the utmost diligence to preserve the Cause of God, lest any new developments that might cause the extinction of the Cause should become manifest. From Iran, someone wrote two brief words about you and Mirza Mihdi. Mirza Aqa Jan is sending a copy of it, but the purpose was not clear and perplexity arose.

He is the Mover

O my God! I praise Thee for having ordained the Fountain of Life in the Garden of Good-Pleasure, wherein Thou didst join together fire and water and unite them through Thy power, such that they shall never be parted throughout the eternity of Thy might and the perpetuity of Thy sovereignty. Thou didst appoint as keeper of this Fountain the serpent of Thy power and the snake of Thy protection, and didst breathe into this keeper from the essence of Thy spirit, such that all things die save it, and all things sleep save it, as if it were made a sign of movement, for within it is passion and rapture and agitation.

Therefore I beseech Thee, O my God, by the agitation in the hearts of the lovers, that Thou grant unto Thy chosen ones what Thou hast ordained in this hidden yet manifest Fountain. Then quicken through its water the hearts of Thy loved ones, and through its fire create warmth in the hearts of Thy faithful ones. Thou art He Who, O my God, hath decreed that the disobedient must enter into Thy fire and abide eternally in Thy flames. And I, though formerly among Thy disobedient ones, do now accept to enter into this fire and to abide in these flames. Though Thy servants flee from the serpent and its venom, I, by Thy glory, long for this serpent and its bite and its poison. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by this serpent that Thou unite the hearts of Thy loved ones and gather them upon a single carpet, even as Thou didst unite this fire and water and gather them in a single place. Verily, Thou art powerful over that.

Glorified art Thou, O my Beloved and my Goal! How can I make mention of the wonders Thou hast created in this dark yet luminous handiwork, and the marvels Thou hast wrought in this most subtle and mighty creation? It is as if Thou didst make it arrows for the hearts of Thy lovers and spears for the breasts of Thy faithful ones. It seemeth, O my Beloved, that Thou didst not create within it any mercy or compassion, for it hath stung the hearts of those who sought Thy nearness and presence, and bitten the hearts of those who turned to Thy reunion and beauty. Therefore, O my Beloved, take the rights and blood of Thy servants from this infidel who hath taken refuge in the Sacred House and sought protection in this Shrine and Station, and made Thy servants forbidden from entering this place. By Thy glory, no hand can reach it save Thy powerful hands, and no soul can attain unto it save Thy conquering sovereignty.

Thou knowest, O my Lord, how many of Thy chosen servants it hath slain, and how many of Thy trusted ones it hath wounded, and how many sacred temples have been cast upon their beds from its wound, and how many pure countenances have fallen upon the dust from its tyranny. Didst Thou not promise, O my Lord and my God, that Thou wouldst cause the doers of good to enter Thy most exalted Paradise and send down the disobedient to the lowest depths? Yet I now witness that this disobedient one hath ascended to the paradise of Thy presence and reunion, and dwelleth in the gardens of Thy face, as if it were the salamander of love disporting itself in the fire of Thy beauty and moving about in the paradise of Thy countenance.

Glorified art Thou, glorified art Thou, for how Thou hast attached the hearts of all created things to this thread and bound the hearts of all beings to this rope! By Thy glory, I am bewildered by the wonders of Thy handiwork in it and upon it, and by the wonders of what it thinketh of itself. It seemeth not to consider itself disobedient even after having shed blood in all religions, but rather knoweth itself to be the creator of goodness and now seeketh from Thy servants recompense for what it hath done to them and against them. It is as if Thou hast ordained for it and decreed upon it that Thou shouldst give, as recompense for its disobedience, every good thing which Thou hast ordained by Thy power and decreed by Thy might. After this, I know not by what way to flee or through what door to escape. Nay, by Thy light, I shall not flee save unto Thee and shall not escape save unto Thee, and I place my trust in Thee in all that. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.

May the beloved spiritual one, his honor Ahmad, upon whom be God's eternal peace, take note:

He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power

In truth this blessed word adorns the preface of the books of love, affection and sincerity. His blessed and exalted Word states: "Be grateful to Me and I shall be grateful to you." It is established by this proof that gratitude is befitting the friends of God, glorified be His majesty - those souls who hold fast to justice and are adorned with fairness. They are the trustees of the earth and its people amongst the servants. And prayers and peace be upon His Beloved, who was the loved one of the hearts of those near to God and the goal of the hearts of the mystics, and upon His family and companions, through whom the trees of success and prosperity were planted in the world and bore the fruits of sciences and arts among the nations - prayers that the events of the world and all within it cannot alter.

Thereafter, the letter of that spiritual beloved arrived. In truth it was a wondrous bounty. Praise be to God, for each pillar there was an effective trace. After its reading and review, we proceeded to the holy court where it was presented before the countenance of the Lord and achieved the honor of His attention. He said: "We beseech God to strengthen him and assist him in what He loves and is pleased with."

Ahmad, your letter arrived and was read before the Wronged One. Praise be to God, the fragrances of love and affection wafted from it and the stations of submission and contentment were evident from it. We beseech God not to withhold His aid from you in all conditions and to grant that which is the cause of the manifestation and appearance of His Word. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and worthy to answer.

This evanescent one testifies that that beloved one has been and is mentioned in the prison, especially by the Branches of the Divine Lote-Tree - may my spirit be a sacrifice for the dust of their footsteps. They repeatedly make mention of that beloved one and seek mention from the Supreme Horizon. In all conditions the rain of providence descends and the lights of the Orb of grace shine forth. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee. And when that beloved one's supplication achieved the honor of being heard in His presence, They repeatedly showed forth kindness, mercy and compassion. This evanescent servant beseeches the Eternal Truth to increase thy station at all times and to grant from the ocean of His grace that which is everlasting and eternal. Verily God is the Powerful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

Regarding what was mentioned about engagement in sciences and arts, after it was presented in His presence, He said: "This matter has been mentioned in most of the Tablets and all are commanded to it. The adornment of man is through perfection. However, in these days, as the affairs of that land are somewhat in turmoil, it is necessary and obligatory upon his honor Ahmad - upon him be my greeting - and others to hold fast to setting affairs aright. At present this matter takes precedence, and afterwards whatever accords with consultation has been and will be implemented. God willing, his honor Ahmad will achieve both."

In every word and utterance a pearl of grace lies concealed and a gem of providence is treasured. Surely these bestowals will have an effect and fruits will appear. It is hoped that this evanescent one too will not be deprived in any state, for he has asked and continues to ask every good thing and every desirable word for the friends of God. I end these words with His exalted saying: "Despair not of the mercy of God." I convey greetings to the friends of that land. Verily He is the Guardian of the doers of good. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Peace and mercy and glory be upon you and upon God's righteous servants.

Verily, the sea of calamity hath surged, and gales have overtaken the Ark of God, the All-Encompassing, the Self-Subsistent. O Mariner! Be not daunted by gales, for He Who is the Breaker of Dawns is with Thee in this darkness which hath enveloped the worlds. Place thy trust in God under all conditions, and fear not the tempests of hatred. Take refuge in God, thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing. He protecteth whomsoever He willeth through His sovereign might. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

In the midst of darkness, the Face was radiant with a light that encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. In that state, We summon all beings unto God, and the gathering of those who disbelieved in God when He came with a wondrous Cause shall not frighten Us. The thief hath stolen what was revealed from the Throne and presented it before those who rule over the servants. Thus did that remote polytheist. Say: Die in thy fury, O ignorant one! Dost thou imagine that thou canst outstrip Us? Nay, by My Name, through which the sweet savors of the Spirit have wafted over all things small and great! We have conveyed the Cause through Our messengers, for verily We are powerful. Then We spread it through the hands of those who turned away. The schemes of the schemers shall not harm it.

The slinking whisperer hath appeared with My letter amongst the people, thinking thereby they would assail the Dayspring of the Cause and thereby diminish God's sovereignty over all else. Thus did his soul entice him, and the word of punishment from the presence of the Mighty, the All-Encompassing, was fulfilled against him. Say: Thereby is His Cause exalted, His verses spread abroad, and this Remembrance elevated, through which every wise matter hath been ordained.

Would that the servants would gather against Us and shed Our blood in this straight Path! We have sacrificed what We possess in God's path. This is attested by the tribulations We endure, and beyond them by the Pen through which God's Cause, the Mighty, the Wise, hath been established. Say: I await the day wherein I shall find Myself among the parties of the oppressors' hosts. By God! Then shall they hear what they have never heard before, and shall witness what no eyes of those gone before have seen. He, verily, is the Ruler over what He willeth, and He is the Strong, the Powerful.

Say: O fly! Canst thou soar with the Dove in this atmosphere wherein no birds of the world have flown? All that befalleth Us is a mercy unto Us - to this testifieth every discerning believer. The atoms weep at Our affliction, yet We are in manifest joy. We have made gladness appear from the horizon of sorrows. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.

O servant who gazeth toward God! Were I to recount for thee what hath befallen Us through the tyranny of the wicked ones and the rancor of the enemies, thou wouldst wail and weep until thy spirit would take flight from thy body. Therefore have We concealed it and shall continue to do so. Thy Lord, verily, is the Concealer, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

We drink the cup of tribulation at all times, yet disclose it to no one, lest the dust of grief should cloud them in this resplendent morn. Grieve not at what We have revealed unto thee. Rejoice in God and His signs, and be thou of the thankful. He calleth thee from this Prison in such a state, purely for the sake of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Generous. My love and remembrance have preceded thee. Rejoice in this remembrance which hath flowed from the mouth of the Will of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Inaccessible. Thus have We sprinkled upon thee a drop from the ocean of Our tribulation, that thou mayest be of those who are informed.

Stand firm in the Cause through God's might and power, and be of the steadfast. Convey My glorification to the faces of My loved ones who have turned to My countenance, spoken in My praise, and arisen to make mention of Me. These are assuredly among the triumphant. Blessed are they and those who love them for the sake of God. They are among the most exalted of creation in the sight of the Truth. Thus hath the matter been decreed in a preserved Tablet.

H.S.A. Jinab-i-Radi'u'r-Ruh, upon them both be the Glory of God

He is the All-Wise Teacher

Your letter was seen and your call was heard. You have ever been and will ever be, God willing, in Our sight. Yes, in the days when the Sun of favor was dawning from the horizon of the Land of Mystery, permission was granted to all to ask whatever they wished from the Divine bounty, and questions of every kind were asked and answers were revealed and sent down from the Dayspring of Knowledge. After arrival in the Most Great Prison, the Most Holy Book was revealed from the sacred Kingdom, wherein We commanded all to ask from the Exalted Truth whatever divine commandments and heavenly ordinances they needed today, for it was observed that most of the sciences, rules and beliefs of people yielded and yield no fruit. For example, today the people of Baha have no need for commentary on previous Books. Today one must strive to understand the ordinances that have been revealed and engage in teaching God's Cause. This has been and will be the greatest bounty, for all need it and it has been and will be the cause of life and preservation of all. During the sojourn in Iraq, many aspects of interpretation were revealed, such that if a discerning knower were to reflect on the Book known as "The Uncle" and likewise on the interpretation of the disconnected letters and other matters, he would comprehend all previous verses and find their meaning. What has been mentioned in this Tablet is in view of the favor shown to you, that you may encourage all people toward what is necessary today. For example, some have asked about numerology, and likewise about the elixir, and likewise about the poetry of poets and sayings of mystics, and the Supreme Pen has mentioned what should be mentioned and answers to all have been revealed. However, today these sciences are not and have not been beloved, for these sciences have been and will be the cause of delay and hindrance. Many who engaged in the elixir and numerology lost their minds from excessive delusion and reflection, and signs of madness appeared in them. Furthermore, consider the mystical knowledge of previous mystics. By My life, all wander in the wilderness of delusions and are immersed in the ocean of idle fancies. For example, today if someone were to study geometry, this would be more beloved in God's sight than memorizing all the books of the mystics, for in the former there is evident fruit and in the latter it is absent - how much more so for sciences more beneficial than that. Knowledge of divine books has been and will be beloved in God's sight, for it is the very Word of Truth revealed aforetime through the tongues of the Messengers. However, since it is now incumbent upon all to become aware of and act upon that which has been revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will, which is the reality and spirit of all books, We therefore commanded you to engage in what is intended today and is the cause of ease and salvation for all. Now the Supreme Pen has revealed specifically for you what It willed, and after that the matter is in His hand. Verily He is the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the Mighty. In the Most Great Prison, divine verses are continuously being revealed and sent to all regions, that perchance the fragrances of the Divine Robe may take hold of all. Soon it will seize all and draw them near unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Convey greetings from the Truth to all the kindred. You are all remembered in the glance of favor and are mentioned before the Throne. Upon you be My glory and My mercy.

He is God

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

Despair not of the Spirit of God, with us art thou familiar and by us art thou perceived.

'Attar traversed love's seven cities,

While we remain in the bend of a single lane.

When thy musk-laden pen remembers us,

It earns the reward of freeing two hundred slaves.

This weak servant and frail countenance knows not by what meaningless and obsolete words to express his thoughts, for whatever is presented before that Presence is mere falsehood, and whatever is mentioned is pure polytheism.

Were people not veiled and dense,

And were throats not constricted and weak,

In thy praise I would render justice to meaning,

And would open lips with speech other than this.

But as the saying of the great ones goes, "That which cannot be fully attained should not be fully abandoned." Therefore, with a dull tongue and ailing body, I venture to express and submit that the sprinkling which descended from the cloud of thy gracious heaven upon the soil of words, and the outpouring which was bestowed from the rain-laden cloud of thy mercy upon the essences of allusions, became a light and entered the hearts of the yearning ones, and became a joy and descended upon the breasts of the sorrowful ones. Indeed, how can the meadow smile until the cloud weeps?

Glory be to God! Was this musk-laden breeze from Paradise that made all we possessed paradisiacal? Or was this the blast of the trumpet from the Tree of Sinai that made us transcend our very souls and join the Beloved? When I heard mention of the Friend, I immediately arose and said:

Whence comes this musician who spoke the Friend's name?

That I might sacrifice my soul and garment for the Friend's message.

The heart comes alive with hope for the beloved's faithfulness,

The soul dances to the melody of the Friend's words.

Not finding the messenger, I sat down and again endeavored to peruse the letter. All the pearls of unity that were hidden in the shell of praise became manifest. Truly it gave fresh spirit to the dejected state and boundless light to the consumed soul, as though the Holy Spirit breathed within it. This is what they meant when they said, "The earth has a share from the cup of the noble ones." It was as if I began life anew and drank the honey-wine of grace from the fountain of the Beloved's mouth.

May thy divine realm be intimate with the human realm,

Blessed be thy hand and arm.

And if the established carpet-spreader were to lay out the carpet of oneness and spread the blessed cushions of love, perhaps the eyes of the yearning ones would be illumined by the rays of the pure light of Beauty, and the eyes of the enraptured ones would be brightened by the fountain of distinction of the Sovereign of Glory. Although these words will not be pleasing to the lofty taste and discriminating mind of your exalted presence, since we have an excuse for expression, surely you will have forgiveness on your tongue, for "The excuse of the noble ones is accepted."

In the degrees of love and stations of affection, these two verses suffice:

O arrow of Thy grief, the lovers' hearts its target,

A world absorbed in Thee, while Thou art absent from their midst.

Sometimes in the monastery confined, sometimes in the mosque residing,

Meaning I seek Thee, house to house.

My purpose in the Ka'bih and the temple is Thou,

Thou art my purpose, the Ka'bih and temple but pretexts.

Alas for this pen, and injustice from this ink and paper that have rendered me helpless! I know not what you will experience upon reading it. Therefore I say: Verily, we are God's, and verily, unto Him do we return.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Lord of grandeur and power

God brought forth the people of the world from utter nothingness into the realm of being specifically for the recognition of His sacred Essence. There is and has been no doubt that recognition of the unknowable and exalted Essence is impossible except through recognition of the Dawning Places of His Revelation and the Daysprings of His Cause, for that sacred Essence has ever been and will forever be sanctified above manifestation, appearance, mention, recognition, description and praise. Since the door of recognition of that Ancient Being was closed, He, out of pure grace, manifested the Dawning Place of verses and the Dayspring of evidences, that all might attain unto His knowledge, which is identical with the knowledge of God. He is the Manifestation of God amidst creation, for His commandments are the commandments of God and His word is the Word of God. He is the Dawning Place of all the most beautiful names and the Manifestation of the most exalted attributes. Whosoever attains unto Him attains unto all good, and whosoever turns away from Him is counted among those who have turned away from God. All creation has hoped and yearned to attain the presence of the Manifestation of Revelation, which is identical with attaining the presence of God. Yet when the divine Morn dawned and the Most Great Light rose above the horizon of the world, all remained veiled and turned away, save whom thy Lord willed. Through one blessed word that shone forth from the Dayspring of the mouth of the All-Merciful, the measure of all people's deeds became clear and evident, and through that same word a distinction was drawn between the righteous and the wicked, and between the people of Paradise and of the Fire. Yet most are unaware and have not yet awakened from the slumber of heedlessness. They remain content with this transient world and are deprived of the everlasting bounty. Blessed art thou, then blessed art thou, for having believed in God when most of creation turned away from Him. Be grateful and say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds. Praise be to God that through the grace of the All-Merciful thou hast drunk from the living waters and turned toward the supreme horizon. Know thou the value of this bounty. All that is in the world shall perish and pass away, while this most exalted and glorious station shall endure for thee eternally. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee. By God! All the treasures of earth cannot equal it. Blessed are they that understand. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O God, Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen! Thou seest me turning toward the horizon of Thy manifestation and clinging to the hem of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee, O Beloved of the worlds and Lord of the nations, by Thy Name through which the spirit of life was breathed into all possibility, to assist me to be steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that the imaginings of the idolaters among Thy creatures shall not hinder me. Then make me to be among them that have arisen to serve Thee and aid Thy Cause, and ordain for me the good of this world and the next through Thy generosity and grace. Verily Thou art He Who hath ever been powerful through Thy will and supreme through Thy purpose. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Thy letter was presented before the Countenance and the fragrance of thy sincerity for the sake of God was inhaled therefrom. The servant present in the Most Great Presence read it with utmost joy and delight, and all the Concourse on High hearkened unto it. Blessed art thou, O thou who gazeth upon the Countenance and speaketh in remembrance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Compassionate. Every word of thy letter is better in the sight of God than what the divines of the age have written throughout their lives regarding what they imagine to be God's laws, for those souls did not attain unto the knowledge of God which is the essential purpose, but rather arose in rejection and opposition. But thy letter found acceptance with God. This is the most great reward that hath flowed from the Pen. Know thou this and be of the thankful ones.

A moon \[departed\] from this city toward another city,

And by its setting and rising two cities were turned upside down.

And Joshua caused the sun to return for part of a day, but when Thou didst journey forth, a sun appeared.

That honored brother's momentous thoughts have been considered. For the destitute dervishes, an appointed place and adorned dwelling hath been established. The blackness of the ink of that letter bore the fragrance of pure musk, and the whiteness of its gardens betokened the tenderness of an illumined heart. Verily, its arranged pearls brought perfect joy, and its scattered gems conveyed health and tranquility to the heart.

Thou art the interpreter of all that is in our hearts,

The helper of all whose feet are stuck in the clay.

Although in these days physical communion hath been suspended, yet the natural, innate fellowship and intimacy remaineth firm. God willing, the draught of reunion, which is mingled and combined with sweet, pure water, shall descend from the clouds of the soul and bestow the gift of life upon the frozen, lifeless earth. Yea:

Today if the cloud would show grace,

Tomorrow when the thirsty one is dead, say not "Arise!"

In these days when the seas of sorrow are surging and the rivers of grief are flowing, when the pivot of the sphere of fate is turning and the center point of decree is planning, when the tree of tyranny hath grown tall and the fruit of oppression like unto Shaddad hath borne fruit, when good deeds are rejected and the works of Nimrod are praised, when thorns sit in the place of beauty and shells occupy the place of pearls in the shell, when serpents rule in the abode of the sovereign and Satan presideth upon Solomon's throne - this is not the first flask that hath been broken in Islam.

With all these circumstances, how can I properly respond to letters and present worthy writings? By thy life, my sorrow is not for the loss of wealth, but for his death and condition, that he was slain with utmost abasement, though he attained the most glorious martyrdom and ascended to the most exalted horizon. "Think not of those who are slain in God's way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance with their Lord, rejoicing."

The enemies are delighted that ownerless property hath fallen to them. Have they not heard the decisive, mighty proclamation which saith: "For him who is slain unjustly, We have given authority to his heir."

Thou laughest while fate biteth its lip,

Death weepeth at thy laughter.

Soon shall the heir claim his inheritance and uproot oppression. "Their appointed time is the morning - is not the morning near?"

O my brother, observe what circumstances are unfolding and what unprecedented matters are being born from this transient world. I who had chosen seclusion and crept into the cave of silence, who had melted in union and in separation had freed myself from all else, must now become renowned throughout the horizons and complain to Iran of the tyranny of Uruman. "Naught shall befall us save what God hath decreed for us. In Him do we trust, and in God let all the faithful trust."

I had chosen one person for companionship and fellowship who was among the righteous and spoke of the pure ones. He was lost in such manner as thou knowest. How excellent was what was said:

Wherever thou seest blood upon the earth,

Know of a certainty it is from our eyes.

Therefore I say: "Verily, we are God's, and verily, unto Him shall we return."

\[In the blessed Tablet, opposite the word "departed" which is marked with brackets and taken from the margin of the book, the word "went forth" is written.\]

Here is a Tablet which hath been revealed for the servant who was named Jamalu'd-Din, that he may be made joyful through the grace of God. He is the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious. This is a Book which speaketh with truth and maketh mention of them that have believed in God and His sovereignty in these days wherein the pillars were shaken and feet did slip, and heedlessness seized all who dwell on earth save them who purified their hearts from all who are in the heavens and on earth and entered beneath the shadow of a mercy that encompasseth all the worlds. By God! They walk in this earthly life with legs of iron upon holy ground, and in the next life they soar with two wings of the Cause unto an atmosphere that hath been raised above the comprehension of the worlds, until they alight upon the thrones of oneness at the right hand of the throne of their Lord, the All-Merciful, and there circle round them the youths of Paradise who were created from the breath of God. Thus doth God single out whom He willeth through His grace, and provide His servants with a bounty that hath been sent down from the heaven of grace. O Jamal! Bear thou witness within thyself that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who hath appeared with the truth is indeed the Primal Manifestation between earth and heaven, and through Him hath appeared the sovereignty of God and His power, then His greatness and His majesty, and through Him hath shone forth the Sun of Justice from a holy and luminous horizon, and through Him was perfected the proof of God and His evidence, and was exalted the Word of God and His glory, and through Him was established the Beauty of the Ancient of Days upon the throne of manifest might. Know thou moreover that thy letter came before Us and We became aware of what was therein of thy love for the direction of nearness, the spot wherein all things proclaim that there is none other God but Him and that He is indeed powerful over all things. However, We withheld the Pen and caused it not to flow with a reply, due to a wisdom that had been inscribed in the Mother Book by the Holy Finger. And when the appointed time arrived, We sent down this Tablet from the heaven of command and dispatched it unto thee as a mercy from Us upon thee, and as guidance and remembrance for them that have taken God as their guardian. We have ordained for thee in the Tablets of destiny a station that was exalted in truth. Beware lest thou deprive thyself of thy portion. Then stand firm in the Cause in such wise that if the idolaters were to gather against thee, thou wouldst not turn unto them, by My sovereignty that encompasseth the worlds. Say: O people! Fear ye God and sever not the hands of the Cause with the swords of turning away, for this is an injustice that hath been grievous before the Throne. By My life! Whoso in this day findeth the fragrance of his Lord from the garment of these words shall abandon what he possesseth, even were it the kingdoms of the heavens and earth, and shall regard the earth and all that is thereon as the most paltry thing in his sight, and shall take unto himself a path unto God. Arise in the Cause of thy Lord, then remind the people with wisdom and utterance, and tarry not for less than a moment. Preserve thou this Tablet, then read it with spirit and fragrance that it may attract thee to a holy and exalted court. Thus have We commanded thee and inspired thee and cast upon thee that thou mayest thank God, thy Lord, and be preserved in an impregnable stronghold. And if thou findest a pure heart, cast upon it what the Spirit hath cast upon thee, and if thou findest one who turneth away, leave him to himself that he may be consumed by his own fire, then turn with a beauteous countenance unto God, thy Lord. Verily He shall suffice thee against all who are in the heavens and on earth, and shall aid thee in the Cause that thou mayest be steadfast on the straight path. O Jamal! Be thou beautiful in the Cause of thy Lord and turn not unto the world and what hath been created therein, then seek from God, thy Lord, a station that was praiseworthy in truth. And glory be upon thee and upon them that have detached themselves from all things and held fast unto the handle that was manifest in truth.

O Abu'-Nur! Hearken unto the Call that hath been raised from the Tree on Sinai: "God, there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting." Thou wert in prison even as We were therein. Be thou thankful and say: "Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having enabled me to achieve this." I bear witness that Thou art the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

O Kamal! Arise to serve the Cause of thy Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, in such wise that neither the veils of glory nor the suggestions of them that have disbelieved in the Beginning and the End shall deter thee. Summon the people with wisdom and utterance. Thus hath thy Lord, the All-Merciful, commanded thee in the Scriptures and Tablets.

O My Kamal! Grieve not for what hath befallen thee in My path. That which hath come upon Us in God's path could not be borne by all creation. Thou wert Our partner in tribulations and afflictions. Thy Lord, the Lord of creation, beareth witness unto this. Blessed art thou for having fulfilled God's Covenant and His Testament, and for having circumambulated the House when the Lord of the House was in the land of Iraq. We were with thee when thou wert in the midst of the idolaters, and We behold what thou art engaged in. Thy Lord is, in truth, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

If thou seest Mahmud say: "Where is thy Beloved?" By My life, this is the Praised Station \[Maqam-i-Mahmud\] whose decree was revealed in the Qur'an. Cast aside the idol and turn unto the Lord of all nations. This behooveth thee and those who have attained unto this Day which God hath made the Dayspring of all days.

O Mahmud! Hearken unto that which thy Lord, the All-Loving, calleth thee from the Divine Lote-Tree which hath been raised above the crimson spot beyond the sea of grandeur: "God, there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving." Cast aside all that thou hast heard, then turn unto the signs of thy Lord. By My life, if thou shouldst taste their sweetness, thou wouldst forsake all creation and turn unto thy Lord, saying: "I believe in Him Who hath sent Thee, O Thou Who art imprisoned in the most desolate of lands!"

Ponder within thyself: Wouldst thou choose to remain silent regarding the Cause of thy Lord after the Most Exalted Pen hath raised its shrill voice between earth and heaven? By My life, were thou to be fair, thou wouldst weep both eventide and dawn. Dost thou imagine that thy belief profiteth Him or thy denial harmeth Him? Nay, by the Revealer of verses! He calleth thee purely for the sake of God while the idolaters surround Him from every side. Cast aside prejudice and hold fast to the cord of the Lord of all creation. This is better for thee than all that hath been created in the earths and heavens. Be not content with illusion, but turn unto thy Lord, the Self-Subsisting, Who hath come with power and authority.

O Kamal! If thou findest in his countenance the freshness of beauty, then recite unto him the verses of thy Lord, the Lord of majesty and glory. Otherwise, turn away from him and turn with thy heart unto God, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning. We have mentioned him in this Tablet by virtue of thy Lord's preceding mercy; else the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Compelling, would not move for his like, unless he repenteth and returneth unto Him through Whom faces were illumined and the Herald proclaimed.

Convey My greetings to the faces of those who have turned towards Me and have been afflicted with hardships in these grievous days, and give them glad-tidings of thy Lord's favors. Then recite unto them what hath been revealed from God, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. We remember them in the prison and have revealed for each one that which shall immortalize their names in the Book of God, the Lord of all lords.

The glory be upon thee and upon thy child and thy family and upon those who have remained steadfast in this Cause whereby the tribes of the world have been shaken. Be thou among the people as thou wert commanded before, that there may be seen in thee that which shall gladden the eyes of the righteous. Thereupon We withhold the Pen, though it desired to flow over the names of My loved ones until the Day that cannot be bounded by mention. Thus have We revealed unto thee the verses as a grace from Us, that thou mayest recite them among the servants who have rent asunder the veils in the name of the Revealer of verses, and who have shattered the idol of fancy through this Remembrance which hath descended from the heaven of might and power.

He is the One dawning from the horizon of the world with the Most Great Name!

O loved ones of God in the Land of Alif! Hearken unto the call of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Verily, there is none other God but Him. His are the greatness and majesty, the power and glory, and the bounties. He hath created the heaven through one of the names, and all else beneath it through a word from His presence. He, verily, is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. Within His grasp is the dominion of Command and Creation. There is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

Rejoice in that the Wronged One remembereth you from His Most Great Prison and commandeth you to draw nigh unto the Sea, each wave of which proclaimeth: "The gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of Names hath come with manifest sovereignty!" Woe betide him who hath cast the Book of God behind his back and followed every ignorant one who hath turned away from the Face when it shone forth from the horizon of the Divine Will with a light that illumined the Concourse on High, the denizens of Paradise, and those who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide. Thus doth the Supreme Pen make mention of you, as a bounty from your Lord, the Munificent, the All-Bountiful.

Act ye according to what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Most Holy Book. It guideth you unto His Straight Path. Let not the affairs of the world sadden you. Soon shall that which hath been spread therein be rolled up. Thus informeth you He with Whom is the knowledge of all things preserved in a guarded Tablet. Aid ye your Lord, the All-Merciful, through wisdom and utterance. He, verily, heareth and seeth; He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.

Take hold of God's ordinances with the power bestowed by Us and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Revealer of the verses and Manifestor of clear signs, for having sent down to us from the heaven of Thy Will that which profiteth us in all the worlds of Thy creation. I beseech Thee to assist us in that which Thou lovest and approvest, and in that which will exalt Thy remembrance amongst Thy creatures and inscribe our names by Thy Most Exalted Pen in Thy Book. O my Lord! Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise. Write down for us that which Thou hast written for Thy chosen ones who have cast away the world and taken hold of that which Thou didst command them. Verily, Thou art the Most Exalted, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful."

O Naw-Ruz! Thy petition hath reached the Most Holy Court on this new day, which in the divine Books is known as the Day of God, and the servant present before the Face hath presented its contents. Sublime and wondrous verses have been revealed specifically for the loved ones of that land. All must hearken unto them and rejoice in God's bounty. Blessed is the soul that hath today attained unto the remembrance of God. This is a station that transcendeth description and utterance. My tongue and those who have believed in this blessed, mighty, and wondrous Day bear witness to this.

Concerning thy question about wisdom: those ordinances which today cause the clamor of the heedless and the outcry of the ignorant must be carried out with the utmost discretion. There are many deeds that, when performed by an individual, none would be aware of them, while there are others that, when manifested, cause the opposition and objection of the heedless parties. Therefore, the Lord of Glory, exalted be His might, hath exempted His servants until such time as the Cause is made manifest through His all-prevailing sovereignty over all who are in the heavens and on earth. After the exaltation of the Cause, it becometh binding and obligatory upon all to act in accordance with whatsoever hath been sent down in the Most Holy Book from the heaven of God's Will and recorded by the Pen of Wisdom. Blessed are they that act accordingly, and blessed are they that attain!

O friends! Let not time slip away. This is a day wherein every good deed performed for God's sake shall have an everlasting effect that will endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Beseech ye God to aid you in that which shall remain and endure. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the Answerer of Prayer. And praise be to God, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Praised.

In the Name of the One All-Knowing God!

O thou who hast turned thy face towards the Countenance! We have guided all servants to the Most Exalted Horizon, and likewise commanded them to aid the Cause of God. Nevertheless, it is observed that some of the friends have failed to comprehend this most exalted and glorious station. Ye must convey and impart to all what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken concerning assistance. By the life of God! The teaching of God's Cause hath been and shall ever be through wisdom and utterance, and whatsoever is besides this springeth from the promptings of self. Say: O servants of the All-Merciful! Ye have been created for the advancement, prosperity, and exaltation of those who dwell on earth. Occupy yourselves with that which befitteth the station of man. Contention, corruption, and destruction befit you not. Say: Fear ye, O My loved ones, the shedding of blood and whatsoever ye have been forbidden in My Most Wise Book. All must associate with the peoples of the world with radiant faces and illumined hearts, that perchance they may hearken from the people of Truth, glorified be His majesty, that which conduceth to maturity, attainment, and guidance. Today, every soul must occupy himself with his own reformation, and manifest pure deeds and praiseworthy, acceptable conduct. Yea, the Most Exalted Pen beareth witness to the oppression and transgression of the ignorant and heedless souls, and commandeth you to patience and forbearance, and to act in accordance with what hath been revealed in the Book. By My life! Their heedlessness, remoteness, denial, and objection to Him Who created them and brought them into being sufficeth them. No punishment hath been or shall be greater than heedlessness. By Him in Whose grasp is the dominion of the heavens and earth! Were they to become aware of their own deeds, they would cut themselves to pieces with all the swords of the world. Leave them to themselves, placing your trust in the All-Powerful, the Almighty. God is awake and aware, powerful and mighty. Be ye assured of the power of your Lord and the might of your Master, the All-Compelling, the Almighty. Hold fast unto what is good in all circumstances, and leave what is reprehensible to its people. One goodly word uttered with sincerity is more beloved in the sight of God than a hundred thousand swords raised in His Name, for in this Revelation the ocean of mercy is surging, the sun of bounty is shining, and all are forbidden from that which causeth injury, fear, and distress. Convey these utterances of the Beloved of all possibility to everyone, that perchance in the days of wakefulness they may not occupy themselves with sleep, and in the days of righteousness they may not busy themselves with building the flimsiest of houses.

O Lion! Thy letter hath come, wherein thou didst commune with God with these words - thy words: "In Thy Name, the All-Forgiving, the Concealer of faults, the Kind, the Merciful! Verily, he who hath committed every transgression in all Thy worlds and hath turned towards the ocean of Thy forgiveness, O my Beloved! Wilt Thou forgive him in all the worlds or punish him with all Thy punishment?" We have heard thy call, thy cry, and thy lamentation, and He saith: Yea, by My Self! We have forgiven thee, guided thee, drawn thee nigh, caused thee to speak, and acquainted thee with My straight and manifest path. Yea, by My Self! He is the Concealer of faults, the All-Forgiving, the Helper, the Succourer, the Mighty, the August, the All-Wise. The breezes of My loving-kindness seized thee in such wise that thou didst enter into My love, attain unto the presence of the Face, and drink the choice wine of reunion from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, and didst hear the call of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Well is it with thee, and pleasant it is with thee, and with those who have attained unto that which hath been decreed in My Manifest Book. Strive to unite hearts and bring them together; thus doth command thee the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing. The Tree of My loving-kindness hath stirred, the ocean of My bounty hath surged, and My Pen hath spoken, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Invincible. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have followed God's command and observed the rights of His chosen ones, at whose mention His wondrous and swift Pen hath moved.

He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed

O Sad! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of creation. Thy letter which thou didst send to the Name of Bounty after Asad - upon both of them be the Glory of God, the One, the Self-Subsisting - hath been received, and one of My Branches who was named the Light in My perspicuous Book presented it. We have answered thee with a Tablet from whose horizon hath shone the Sun of bounty from God, the Lord of all beings, that thou mayest read it and thank thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Powerful. Grieve not over anything, for He is with thee and will aid thee through His grace, and He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. We have previously sent down that which diffused the fragrance of the All-Merciful throughout creation, and at this time that which hath spread abroad the sweet scent of thy Lord's garment, the One Who dominates over all, whether small or great. Behold, then remember those days when thou wert present before the Wronged One and didst hear His call with thine own ears, and didst drink the choice wine of revelation and attainment from the cup of God's bounty, the Lord of those near unto Him. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee in that which befitteth His days and to exalt thee among His servants. He is the Guardian of those who turn unto Him.

Hear thou the divine call in the Persian tongue. Convey My greetings to all the family members from the Wronged One and give them the glad-tidings of God's favors. They have always been and continue to be in My sight. By the life of God, that hath been ordained for them which no hearts have comprehended and no eyes have witnessed the like thereof. Concerning what thou didst mention about his honor Muzaffar, upon him be My glory, a most mighty and holy Tablet hath been revealed and sent specifically for him. Should he read it, the doors of grace and favor shall be opened before his face. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. His honor Nasr hath been and continues to be remembered before the Face. We have previously revealed for him that whereby his name and mention shall endure as long as God's kingdom endureth. He verily witnesseth and seeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Convey My greetings to him from the Wronged One and give him the glad-tidings of God's grace and favor. Say: Hold fast unto wisdom, then guide the people through utterance to the horizon of the All-Merciful. This is what My Most Exalted Pen hath pronounced in this lofty station. Say: We have counseled all to act with kindness. Among the people are those who have acted upon Our counsel and those who have followed evil and taken vain imaginings as their lord without any proof. Thus have their fancies seduced them. How far is he from the announcement of God, the Mighty, the Wise! We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to attract him through His verses and to aid him with the standards of His clear proofs and to strengthen him with the hosts of His knowledge. He verily hath power over all things.

And as for what was mentioned concerning him who was named Muhammad Javad, We have previously remembered him and sent him that which hath diffused the fragrances of utterance throughout creation. We beseech God, exalted be He, to strengthen him with His hosts and to open before his face the gates of utterance and to draw near all who are in creation to His glory's court and His holy carpet. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We have remembered him before and this is yet another time, that the fragrance of remembrance might attract him to a station wherein he will soar on wings of longing in this atmosphere from whose rushing winds can be heard "The Promise hath come and the Promised One calleth out before the faces of kings and subjects: He Who was hidden in knowledge and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in God's Books, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection, hath come!" The Glory from Us be upon him and upon those whom neither the doubts of the people in the past have caused to slip nor will they be caused to slip by what shall occur in the future. He verily is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. We counsel all to fear God and to that whereby their stations shall be elevated among the parties. Verily thy Lord guideth whom He willeth unto His extended path. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of grace and bounty be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who love thee for the sake of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.

O Abbas! The Wronged One makes mention of thee with a remembrance by which those near unto God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting, are moved. The Hour has come, the Call has been raised, the Cry has appeared, the mountains have passed away, yet the people are heedless. The world has been overturned, the Throne established, and upon it sits the Lord of the Manifestation and the Speaker on Sinai, yet most people do not understand. The Mother Book has appeared and calls out between earth and heaven, summoning all to the Praiseworthy Station. Among the people are those who deny, those who turn away, those who dispute the signs of God, Lord of what was and what shall be, and those who break God's Covenant and His pledge with such tyranny that the dwellers of the cities of names and the inhabitants of the Kingdom lament. When We observed carefully, We discovered that Our enemies are, for the most part, the divines. Thus does the Most Glorious Tongue recount unto thee from the Supreme Horizon. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.

We manifested knowledge for the recognition of the Known One. Yet when the horizon of Manifestation shone forth and the Known One came, the divines denied Him at first, save whom God, the Lord of existence, willed. Say: O concourse of divines! Cast aside what ye possess. By God! The Most Exalted Pen has been raised and announces to all the appearance of the Known One, to Whom ye turned morning and evening. Say: Why do I see you, O heedless ones, approaching the House while turning away from Him Who raised it by His command? Fear God and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who has come to you with a manifest Book, before which, were ye to be fair, all the books of the world would bow down. Be not of those who denied the Witness and the Witnessed. This is the Day promised to you in God's scrolls and books, and this is a Cause whose pledge was taken by Him Who knows what was and what shall be.

Say: O company of oppressors! Ye have wrought that which has caused the Concourse on High to wail, the denizens of Paradise to lament, and the sighs of the Supreme Paradise and the tears of the angels and the Spirit to descend. Say: If ye possess anything greater than what has come from the heaven of divine Will, then produce it. Follow not every ignorant rejected one. Say: Come, that I may show you what ye have neglected on this Day which has been attributed to God, the Mighty, the Loving. This is a Day wherein the fragrance of the All-Merciful has wafted, the breezes of Revelation have blown, and the Nightingale of the Cause has sung upon the branches: "The Kingdom belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds."

O Abbas! Arise to serve the Cause in the name of thy Lord, the Lord of eternity. Remind the people of this Most Great Announcement, at whose appearance the limbs of vain imaginings and idle fancies trembled. Beware lest the power of princes and the doubts of divines hold thee back from the Lord of Names. Be as an immovable mountain in this ordained Cause. Say: He has come with the truth and pays no heed to your acceptance or rejection. He has appeared and manifested what He willed, despite you, did ye but know. He it is Who speaks in every condition: "There is no God but Me, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Beloved."

Thus have We opened before thy face the door of grace with the key of justice. When thou attainest unto it, say: "Praise be to Thee, O God of the seen and unseen! I testify that Thou hast forsaken rest for the elevation of the nations, accepted abasement for the glory of the world, and chosen exile that servants might reach the Supreme Homeland, the station which God has sanctified beyond the comprehension of minds."

O thou who hast turned to the Countenance! Take the Sealed Wine in the name of the Wronged One, then drink thereof with this remembrance whereby souls and hearts have been attracted. We have written for thee the reward of attainment in My Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Tablet. Rejoice, then give thanks to the Lord of the Frequented Fane. We have accepted thy turning, thy devotion, and thy work in God's path. Blessed art thou in that thy deeds have been adorned with the ornament of acceptance.

O Kazim! Hear the call from the realm of eternity through the Most Exalted Pen. Verily, He hath made mention of thee in such wise as nothing in the world can equal. To this beareth witness the Mother Book which is with Him. Thou hast attained unto the traces of My Pen and My care which hath encompassed all regions.

O Muhammad-Qabl-Hasan! Mention hath been made of thee by Him Who soareth in Mine atmosphere. We make mention of thee in such wise as will draw thee nigh unto Mine horizon, that thou mayest witness that which My Pen hath testified: that there is none other God but Me, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thou hast attained unto My mention and that which My glorious and wondrous tongue hath uttered. Nothing in the world shall profit thee today save this Cause, before which, when it was manifested, every discerning and perceiving one hath bowed down. We have revealed the Cause and sent down the verses, yet the people are in evident doubt. They have denied the right of God and His signs, and followed every sinful denier. Give thanks unto God for this most great favor and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of them that have recognized Thee!

O Sword of God! The law of the sword hath been abolished and the law of the Utterance hath been revealed. Verily it is sharper than the sword. To this beareth witness the tongue of My grandeur in this exalted station. We have ordained victory and triumph through the fear of God, through deeds and through goodly conduct. To this testifieth he who hath attained the presence of the Countenance and heard the call of God, the Lord of all worlds. Beware lest ye spread corruption in the earth after it hath been set in order, and beware lest ye oppose those who have opposed you. Leave them to themselves, turning unto God, your Lord, the Ordainer, the All-Wise. We have enjoined upon you love and unity. Blessed is he who acteth in accordance with that which hath been ordained in the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

O Haydar-'Ali! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. We have seen in thy letter mention of him who was named Kazim in the Book of Names. We have made mention of him in such wise as hath caused the mountains to soar, how much more the spirits. And I am, verily, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.

O Kazim! Hear the call of the Wronged One, then make mention of the time when the Qa'im came with a clear Book. The people denied Him, turned away from Him, disputed His verses, His proof and His testimony, until they pronounced judgment against Him with such tyranny as caused the Most Exalted Pen to lament and the Lord of creation to weep. Thus was the matter decreed, and I am the All-Knowing Witness.

O Kazim! Arise to serve My Cause with wisdom and utterance, and remind My servants of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of Mine utterance, and give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.

Say: Deprive not yourselves of the bounties of My days, nor your ears from hearkening to My verses, nor your hearts from My love, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Say: This is the Day of proof, did ye but know it, and this is the Day whereon the tongue of grandeur speaketh, did ye but hear it. By God! The Treasure hath appeared and the Hidden One hath come with evident sovereignty.

Say: O people of the Bayan! Come ye, come ye! By what proof did ye believe in the Point of the Bayan? Bring it forth, then read what hath been sent down from the presence of the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. If ye deny the appearance of God and His Cause and the effects and influence of the Most Exalted Pen, by what proof can that which ye possess be established? Be fair, and be not of the wrongdoers.

Thus have We manifested unto thee the ocean of utterance and its waves, and the sun of proof and its lights, that thou mayest be of the thankful ones. If thou hast drunk the choice wine of revelation from the cup of My bounty and hast attained unto the lights of Mine utterance, say: My God, my God! Through Thy most sweet call my heart hath taken flight, and through the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen my limbs have trembled, and through the lights of Thy Most Great Throne and Thy mighty announcement my senses have been transformed, and mine outer and inner eyes have shed tears. I beseech Thee by the blood of Thy lovers and the sighing of them that long for Thee, and by the cry of those who have sought the supreme height and the ultimate goal but have not attained it, to assist Thy servants to turn unto Thee and to behold that which Thou hast manifested through Thy power and Thy might. Then write down for them, O God of the world and Creator of the nations, that which shall profit them in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful.

Among the branches of this Divine Lote-Tree is His honor Aqa Siyyid Ja'far, upon him be the Glory of God. In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious! Is this a glorious Book, or the temple of man wherein hath been inscribed by the Pen of the All-Merciful the knowledge of what hath been and what is to come? Blessed be God, the Most Excellent of Creators! Or is it the Water of Life for the quickening of all the worlds? Doth the Book walk, nay, We behold it soaring. Glorified be He Who hath moved it, causing all who are in the heavens and on earth to move. Or is it a clock, for by it have the tribes of the earth lamented and the Great Terror appeared? Say: Glory be unto Him! Glory be unto Him! It was created by His command, and was seized with such wonderment that it forgot itself, and inquireth about itself, asking "Hath it come?" Say: Nay, it hath passed, and this is the manifest Beauty.

If this be a Book, by My life, it is verily the King of Books. If thou sayest it is man, by My beauty, it is the apple of the All-Merciful's eye, made manifest in creation. Exalted be this wondrous grace! If We declare it to be water, We behold the hearts of men consumed by it, and if We say it is fire, it hath illumined all lands with its radiant and gleaming light. Can anyone truly know it as it deserveth to be known? Nay, by the Beauty of the All-Glorious! Exalted, exalted, then more exalted, far exalted is it above the flight of the birds of the hearts of the monotheists to the atmosphere of its knowledge.

Blessed is he whom the breath of God hath awakened, who hath turned to the sanctuary of the Messengers with a pure and luminous heart. The Beloved proclaimeth that which hath appeared, and Moses glorieth in what he hath beheld, and Abraham hath turned to the Most Great Scene, and He Who hath come speaketh, saying: "Blessed is he who hath attained unto this Day wherein the veil hath been rent asunder and the All-Bountiful hath come upon the clouds with manifest sovereignty."

O Ancient Pen! Didst Thou desire to rend asunder the greatest veil? Be patient, for the ears of the polytheists are stretched toward Thee that they might hear that whereby they can object to God, the Mighty, the Wise. He saith: "O my Merciful Lord! Since Thy gaze is fixed upon him who hath loved Thee, grant me leave to sing what Thou hast inspired me through Thy bounty which hath encompassed all created things. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. Blessed is he whom Thou rememberest in the prison with that which shall establish his remembrance for the duration of Thy Self. Blessed is he who hath turned to Thee after most of the servants turned away. Blessed is he whom Thou hast chosen for Thy service and whom nothing hath prevented from turning to his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

O thou who art yearning! Blessed art thou, for thy face hath been illumined by the light that hath shone forth from the Day-Star of the horizons on this Day of the Covenant, and thou hast turned to the Qiblih of the worlds. We have found the fragrance of thy love and have sent thee from the precincts of the Prison that which will cause thee to inhale the sweet savors of thy Lord's garment in this time wherein the Sun of Revelation hath shone forth from the horizon of might with a magnificent command. Blessed art thou for having honored him who came to thee from thy Lord, for having found solace in him, and for being among those who have turned unto Him. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, verily thy Lord is with thee and will aid thee with a sovereignty from His presence. He is, in truth, the Forgiving, the Generous.

Remember Him in all conditions and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Beloved of the mystics, for having remembered me after I was in the hands of the polytheists." Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou beholdest my dwelling place and my tribulation, and Thou knowest that in this Tablet I have desired naught save one of Thy loved ones who hath turned to the court of Thy favor, that the breathings of Thy revelation might attract him in Thy days, and that the rapture of reunion might seize him in such wise as to cause him to arise to serve Thee amidst Thy creatures. O Lord! Accept from him that which hath proceeded from him in Thy path, then enable him to do what Thou lovest and approvest. O Lord! Write down for him what Thou hast written for Thy chosen ones, then make him to circle round Thee in all Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou pleasest, and the Sovereign over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Generous.

He attains the presence of His Holiness, the Beloved of my heart, Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be all glory most glorious. He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power! Praise be to God Who has made correspondence the interpreter between His loved ones who have inhaled the fragrances of His verses, turned to His sovereignty, and cast aside what they possessed in hope of what He possesses. He is indeed the Single One, the Witness, the All-Seeing. And prayers and peace be upon His Prophets, His chosen ones, and His pure ones who spoke His praise, spread His traces, and commanded people to act according to what was revealed in His mighty, great Book. May my spirit be a sacrifice for your steadfastness! The servant has gathered from the trees of your utterance the fruits of your knowledge, and thereby his breast was dilated and his heart rejoiced. When I learned of this I sought the ultimate goal and presented it before His Countenance. He spoke, and His sweetest utterance was: "We rejoice in what comes from him. We beseech the Exalted One to strengthen him, enable him to remember and praise Him, and draw him nigh unto Him outwardly and inwardly. He is indeed the True Speaker, the Trustworthy." O thou who gazest toward the Most Exalted Horizon! There was presented before His Countenance what was composed by him who was named Ahmad in the Kingdom of Names, and the servant present at the gate recited it. We beseech the Exalted One to strengthen him in that whereby his mention shall endure through the eternity of His most beautiful names in the kingdom of creation. He is the Lord of the Throne and earth, and the Master of the hereafter and the former times. There is no God but He, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The servant read his verse and found it a brilliant star in the heaven of eloquence and rhetoric, and I beseech the Intended One to cause him to speak that whereby hearts and minds are attracted. I hope that you will convey greetings to him on behalf of this servant who holds fast to the cord of his Lord's tender mercy, the Powerful. And what you wrote previously regarding Mulla Yusuf, upon him be the Glory of God - I presented what he composed before His Countenance. The Master smiled and said: "Praise be to God Who enabled him to turn to that from which most of creation turned away. I beseech the Exalted One to grant him a goodly reward from His presence. He is indeed the Guardian of those who remember and the Companion of the unitarians. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds." And regarding what you wrote that the physician, upon him be the Glory of God, was irritated by the word wisdom - when I presented this, the Master said: "He should rejoice in wisdom and keep it before his eyes." And concerning what you mentioned about the Prisoner, upon him be the Glory of God - when I presented it before His Countenance, the Beloved said: "We have mentioned the Prisoner before and after with such mention that those who turn to God find from it the fragrance of sincerity to God, the One, the Single, the Unique, the All-Informed. O Prisoner! Hearken to the call of the Wronged One. He remembers you and commands you to what is right in all conditions, and counsels you to wisdom, for through it man's station becomes manifest among the people of possibility. O Prisoner! We send Our prayers upon you from this station, and upon those who associate with the servants with spirit and fragrance, and with the wisdom which God has sent down in the Book." I hope that you will convey greetings and glorification on behalf of the servant to the sisters. God knows that the servant remembers them most of the time. Peace and glory be upon you and the people of the household and upon those who follow God's decree in all conditions. And regarding what you mentioned about the Khan, upon him be the Glory of God, the Beloved said: "Neither he nor those with him should turn toward this direction. He must hear what We command him. By the life of the Beloved, if he does what he desires, We shall neither face him nor associate with him until God wills." The servant, on 8 Jumada II 1298.

In the name of God, exalted be His glory, His greatness and His power!

Praise be to God Who sealed the Messengers with the Seal and the Books with the Furqan, whereby He distinguished between truth and falsehood until the Day of Reckoning. Upon Him be the blessings of God, His peace, His mercy and His favors, and upon His family and companions who aided His Cause with true aid and strove in His path with true striving.

The letter of that spiritual friend arrived. Praise be to God, it was adorned with the mention and praise of God and spoke of your health and well-being. After its perusal and consideration it was presented before the face of the Lord. He said: "We beseech God, the Lord of creation and the Protector of servants and lands, to open before their faces the gates of goodly things, to rain down upon them from the heaven of His generosity the showers of His mercy and blessing, and to ordain for them the good of the latter and former worlds and whatsoever draweth them nigh unto Him in all conditions."

O 'Ali, this Wronged One hath made mention of thee and continueth to do so, and seeketh from God whatsoever is best for thee and His loved ones, for none but God, exalted be His glory, knoweth what harmeth and profiteth. Verily He knoweth and seeth and heareth, and He is the Hearing, the Answering. We beseech Him to aid you outwardly and inwardly, to set right your affairs, and to ordain for you that which shall gladden your eyes and rejoice your hearts. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. From this spot We send greetings to the friends of God and His loved ones whom He hath enabled to acknowledge the oneness of His Being and the sanctity of His Self from all likeness and comparison. He is verily the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

Praise be to God, you have been and continue to be remembered. The hearts and souls of the friends in all lands and regions are turned toward you, and all make mention of your love, unity and accord. In truth, repeated mention of you has arrived from the cities and regions of Iran. This evanescent servant beseeches the eternal Truth, exalted be His glory, and hopes that He will adorn all matters with the ornament of rectification and manifest whatsoever is best for all. His grace encompasseth all and the gate of His bounty is open. Soon He will transform hardship into ease, severity into comfort, and loss into profit. He is verily powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Be not grieved in any way. The divine favors are countless and His grace all-encompassing. We hope that He will manifest that which containeth the good of this world and the next. O spiritual friend! His honor Aqa Mirza Husayn arrived in those parts. As it happened, no opportunity arose to present a reply to the letter of that spiritual friend. You have been and continue to be remembered. In perfect joy, gladness and delight, hold fast unitedly and in harmony to whatever remedies are devised and implemented. The intent is that no negligence or laxity in affairs should come from the friends, and they must make every possible effort at rectification. The rest of the matters are in the grasp of God's power, exalted be His glory. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

I convey greetings to the loved ones and friends of that land. God is witness and aware that I am gladdened by their gladness and saddened by their sadness. However, God saith: "Whoso placeth his reliance on God, He is sufficient unto him." Therefore I remain patient, calm, silent and assured. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon thee and upon God's righteous servants. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

The servant has received your letter and drunk from the choice wine of your remembrance and utterance, and beseeches God his Lord to grant you success and confirmation and bestow upon you His presence once again, for verily He is the Lord of all beings and the All-Powerful over whatsoever He willeth.

\[The rest of this lengthy letter continues with various instructions, acknowledgments and spiritual counsel to individuals. It includes guidance about teaching with wisdom, proper conduct of children, importance of unity, sending greetings to various believers, and discussions of religious matters. The letter ends with prayers and closing salutations.\]

God's glory is most great.

Praise be to God Who hath raised His House to such a station that the Concourse on High and the denizens of the Kingdom of Names have circumambulated it, and hath made it the point of adoration for the world and the sanctuary round which the peoples circle. Glorified is He Who hath, through the Word of His command, so attracted His servants that they hastened from every region, district and land, and neither the yellow wind nor crimson death prevented them from reaching the Most Great House of God. These are servants who have remained faithful to God's Covenant and His Testament, and have acted in accordance with what was enjoined upon them in His Book. And I pray and send greetings upon the Sovereign of existence and Lord of all that is seen, through Whom the horizon of the world was illumined and knowledge and wisdom were made manifest, and upon His family and companions who moved not except by His command and His will, and spoke not until after His leave.

And furthermore, for some time this evanescent servant hath desired to make mention of you and send an expression of sincere regard, even if by pen, since no other messenger is now available. Therefore he hath troubled you with these few words. God willing, may you be ever speaking in remembrance of God and standing firm in your love for the Prophets, the chosen ones, and the pure ones. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to assist you and make you a recipient of His outpourings and blessings. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth.

His honor Aqa Muhammad-'Ali always maketh mention of you. A few days ago what you had sent for the blessed garment arrived. Surely his honor himself will write the details to you. They have also written a letter to this evanescent one from the Green Land. God willing, a response will be sent next time for you to deliver. The purpose of what hath been and is mentioned is that through the key of utterance the doors of hearts may be unlocked and the life-giving breeze may waft from the direction of God's loving-kindness, exalted be His glory, that hearts and spirits may be refreshed by that sweet spiritual breath. God, exalted be His glory, hath made the pen a translator in such wise that it may express and convey the love that dwelleth in the hearts and souls of the friends. In truth it is a great sign, if properly considered. The connection of the world dependeth upon it. It is the harbinger, the herald, the interpreter, and the one who maketh known. If they deny it not, it may be said that he who possesseth hearing perceiveth its lamentation and cry. It is the cup-bearer of the wine of love and the manifestation of affection and fellowship. The divine Books have appeared through it and their mysteries are inscribed by it. Exalted is He Who hath favored it with that which the writer and His creation are powerless to describe, and taught it and made known to it what He desired. Verily He is the One Who is sought in the beginning and in the end. There is none other God but Him, the Lord of all creation.

Praise be to God that mention of you hath been and is before the Friend, and this sufficeth you. And the Lord of humanity, the Lord of the throne and earth, and the Lord of the hereafter and this world requesteth that you convey greetings and praise from this evanescent one to the friends - may the Glory of God rest upon them. God willing, may they at all times drink from the fountain of remembrance and receive their portion from the ocean of utterance. This is that which profiteth and forsaketh not its companion. That which cometh after is different, and tomorrow is another day. The Friend saith:

Dead are they in this gathering on the path of the Friend,

O Messiah of the age, breathe forth then a warming breath!

Peace, praise and glory be upon you and upon those whom this world hath not prevented from the remembrance of God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the name of God, exalted be His glory, to Whom belong greatness and power! Praise be to God Who, should He decree "nay" for anyone, it would be sweeter than possessing the kingdom of earth and heaven, and should He decree "yea," one would choose it over the dominion of the first and the last. He is the Almighty Whom no decree of negation can frustrate and no command of affirmation can exalt. Exalted is the Lord of names and attributes, the Manifestor of clear proofs and the Revealer of verses, Who has made His Book a lamp for all creation and a guide for His servants. He is the One Who calls to goodness and commands His servants to observe it, Who has made evil manifest and forbidden people from it. Glory be unto Him! He has revealed the ordinance of religion and made His Cause manifest to those who are firm and assured, who shall fear no grief or sorrow. May the peace that shines from the horizon of the Abode of Peace be upon the Pride of all beings and the Treasure of all existence, through whose Book the pages and tablets have been adorned, and to whose name the Prophets and Messengers have bowed down, and upon his family and companions who cast aside vain imaginings through His power and embraced certitude through His command and will.

O thou who art mentioned in the heart of this servant, O my beloved and my cherished one! This evanescent one has received your letter and presented it before His countenance, and the Beloved spoke that which I am unable to relate to you. However, when news of your arrival came like an electric current, a reply was immediately sent stating that if you desire to attain His presence, permission has been granted both before and after. This servant was assured by this reply and did not venture to send another letter. After some time, another missive arrived from that beloved one requesting a response, which caused much surprise since there had been no delay in replying and after that telegram there was nothing further requiring response. In any case, I again engaged in electrical communication and sent the final telegram. Today, which is the thirteenth day of the blessed month of Ramadan, while I was at the farm just after arising from writing and returning to my quarters, a letter arrived from Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be the glory of God, which included your missive as well. After it was read and presented, this reply was sent. God willing, may you ever be blessed with special favors and occupied with that which God has willed. Given the telegram, no further mention was needed or needs to be made. His honor the beloved Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be the glory of God, intended to fulfill what you had requested, but permission has not yet been granted since it is Ramadan and the matter of fasting has somewhat delayed social interactions. However, it is hoped that permission will be granted afterwards. In brief, permission has been granted for that beloved one to attain the honor of His presence - whenever you decide, you may proceed. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that that beloved one may ever be confirmed and assisted. I convey greetings to the true friends with mention and praise of God, especially to His Holiness Ismu'llah Zayn, upon him be all the most glorious glory, and those with him, and likewise to Aqa Mirza Muhammad and Aqa Mirza Abdullah and Aqa Muhammad Sadiq, upon them be the glory of God, and their brothers, and to Ustad Ali Akbar and Aqa Muhammad Hasan, as well as some of the friends residing in that land who have attained the presence of God. The intention is to convey greetings and salutations to the saints and loved ones of God residing in that land, both men and women.

In the Name of Our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious

O Muhammad-Taqi, upon thee be the Glory of God! Praise be to God that the Sun of Divine Wisdom is engaged in the education of the peoples of the world, and the Ocean of Divine Knowledge is manifestly outpouring its bounties in abundance. The leader of the hosts of truth in this day is the Universal Divine Intellect, and its armies are goodly deeds and virtuous human qualities. The weapons of this host are sharper than swords and spears - without strife or conflict they conquer the citadels of hearts. Exalted is He Who holds all authority in His grasp and causes His Will to prevail.

The penetrating power of the Divine Word has been and ever shall be beyond reckoning. This influence emanates from its sincerity. A word that proceeds from the mine of righteousness and sincerity for God's sake is indeed all-powerful and all-encompassing. When such a word is cast upon a people or an army, they become so enthralled that neither worldly conditions nor all that the nations possess can deter them from the Straight Path and the Momentous News. These are they of whom the All-Merciful hath spoken in the Qur'an: "Men whom neither merchandise nor traffic beguile from the remembrance of God." The life of such souls has been and shall ever be the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory. The joy and gladness of the world doth not distract them from true joy. They drink of the spiritual wine that floweth from the Pen of bounty in remembrance of their Friend, and repose beneath the shade of the Tree of Trust.

At all times their purpose hath been and shall be the exaltation of God's Cause and the spiritual advancement of His servants. Blessed are they who protect the standards of God's Cause with the hosts of consultation and who spread His ordinances with wisdom. And blessed are the men who establish the King of unity upon his throne with the armies of counsel, admonition, knowledge and utterance, that the world and its peoples may be illumined and find rest in the light of unity. How excellent is the soul that rendereth such service and is preserved from the devils of discord!

The cause and source of delay, impediment, weakness, poverty and laxity hath been and continues to be discord. This evanescent servant beseecheth God and imploreth Him to create and manifest servants through the light of wisdom and utterance who will protect the station of the King without armies. His is the command, and He is the Commander, the Sovereign, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Wise.

Furthermore, the letter of that spiritual friend adorned this transient form with the ornament of praise and glorification of the Eternal Beloved. God willing, may this cup not be forbidden and this chalice not be deprived of the pure water of love. After perusal, proceeding to the nearest station, and upon receiving permission, it was presented before the countenance of the Lord of all beings. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, exalted be His glory:

In My Name that encompasseth all that are on earth and in heaven

At all times the Pen of the All-Merciful hath commanded all who dwell within the realm of existence to turn unto the ocean of unity, which is the source of the life of the world, and likewise unto the tree of oneness, which is the cause of the exaltation of all peoples. From the Dawning-Place of the Divine Pen, within numbered years, the suns of commandments and ordinances have shone forth and been made manifest in this station, yet rare are the places capable of accepting this manifestation. Today the friends of God must be as pearls among pebbles amidst humanity, and throughout the nights and days arise to manifest this most exalted and most glorious station which is, in truth, the source of tranquility and repose for the world. They must strive with the utmost endeavor to accomplish that which God hath willed. O Muhammad! Remind the people in the Days of God of that which will preserve them from whatsoever is unworthy of their relationship with thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We counsel all with that whereby the Cause of God may be exalted throughout creation and which will draw them nigh unto Him. He, verily, is the Compassionate, the Merciful. They must speak that which would soften the most unyielding rock, and act in such wise as would establish the sanctity of His mighty and wondrous Cause. Arise to serve My Cause, that there may appear from thee that which God, the Lord of the worlds, hath desired. He hath desired the unity and concord of His loved ones, as attested by God's Scriptures, His Books, His Tablets and My Preserved Tablet. Arise with thy whole being to manifest this glorious station. Today must every soul turn from that which he possesseth unto that which God possesseth; that is, he must not expend his life in service to himself and his desires, but rather in that which will exalt the Cause of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. If any soul attaineth unto this station, he shall be remembered among the most exalted of beings, and God shall, in truth, exalt him among His servants. He, verily, hath power over all things. Convey My greetings to the friends of God. God willing, may they all attain unto that which is the cause of the elevation and exaltation of man's station. Say: Move for a few days according to God's will and arise for the sake of God to reform mankind. By the life of God! Then shall ye behold the suns of the favors of your Lord, the Generous. Whosoever is occupied today with reforming himself according to that which God hath commanded in the Book, he is in truth engaged in reforming the world. Consider this, O ye who are endued with understanding! Consider this, O ye who are possessed of insight! O thou who art inscribed in My Book and mentioned before My Throne! Be unto the servants a trusted counselor, then recite unto them that which God hath sent down in the Book, that perchance they may abandon the world of sorrows, troubles and differences, and with illumined hearts, radiant faces, attentive ears and penetrating vision, hold fast unto and turn towards that which God hath commanded. By the life of God! Then shall they find themselves upon an exalted station. The glory be upon thee and upon them and upon whosoever hath arisen to perform that deed whereby the fragrance of My good-pleasure is diffused and concerning which the Nightingale hath warbled upon the branch. The sincere ones have attained unto that which God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, hath willed.

This evanescent one confesses and acknowledges all that your honor has stated. Embarrassment has reached such a degree that even its mention causes further embarrassment and ultimate sorrow. The Exalted Truth bears witness that this servant has always considered and continues to consider the good pleasure of God's chosen ones. However, the multitude of occupations has prevented him from expressing his condition and from attending to necessary matters. The loved ones and chosen ones themselves witness that if anything necessary was left undone, it was due to more pressing matters. That spiritual beloved has been and is aware of the revelation of verses and their inscription in his presence. Therefore, this excuse is acceptable, nay beloved, in your honor's presence. God is my witness that at all times I seek assistance from Truth and His chosen ones, that He may enable this evanescent one to render the service entrusted to him. Verily, He is near and responsive.

Regarding what you wrote about numerous petitions and communications being sent - whatever reached this evanescent one was answered and sent. From the direction of the Divine Throne, supreme favors were also bestowed without petition. When his honor Darvish Ghulamhusayn, upon him be the Glory of God, returned, one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed for your honor and sent with him. From the Tablet itself, the fragrances of the favors of the Desired One of all worlds were manifest, evident and diffused. Whatever has reached this servant has been presented before His presence and continues to be presented, and answers have been given one after another in such manner that not a single letter has been omitted. If at any time something appears that becomes an obstacle or barrier, this pertains to God's ordained decrees, with which we are all content, nay grateful. In His grasp is the reins of all affairs. He does what He wills and ordains, and He is the Commander, the All-Knowing.

Regarding what you wrote about sincerely and willingly undertaking not to dare send petitions before the issuance of commands and tablets from the Prison - this matter, after being presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, was not accepted. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke: "You are under the glances of My favor. Blessed art thou and thy father, from whom the Concourse on High has found the fragrance of My mercy and My favor, and thy mother, whom We have mentioned in such wise that the sincere ones make mention of her. Be steadfast in the service of My Cause, firm and determined in such wise that nothing shall prevent thee from the remembrance of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting."

In all conditions, your honor must gaze toward the Supreme Horizon and send petitions, even if no answer is heard throughout the duration of the kingdom and the heavenly kingdom. However, My Most Exalted Pen bears witness that We have mentioned thee and thy father before your mention, and We turned toward you before your turning, your recognition, your humility, your submissiveness and your acceptance. Therefore, thank thy Lord for this Most Great Favor and say: "Thine is the giving, O Lord of Names, and from Thee proceed bounty and generosity, O Sovereign of existence."

Mention was made of his honor Rida-Quli Khan, upon him be the Glory of God. Some time ago, the beloved of hearts, His Holiness 'Ali-before-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of Power, made mention of him, and the Sun of favor has risen and shone in relation to him. On behalf of this evanescent one, convey greetings and praise to him. I beseech the Most High to assist him in that which shall endure through the duration of His names and attributes.

As to your mention of Aqa Muhammad-Kazim, it has been submitted. His words, blessed and exalted be He: "Convey My greetings unto him and mention to him that which befitteth these days, and give him the glad-tidings of My grace and bounty. Let him be content with that which hath been ordained for him by God, the Lord of all beings, and let him fix his gaze upon My most exalted horizon. The Glory be upon him."

As to what you wrote concerning Aqa Haydar-'Ali and Ustad Muhammad-Quli the tailor and what they have wrought for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds - praise be to God that their deeds have been adorned with the ornament of acceptance and honored with divine verses. This lowly one has, in accordance with their wish, accomplished that which was intended, and this is a deed that nothing in the world can equal. Well is it with them and blessed are they.

As to what was mentioned regarding Aqa Mirza 'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, son of His beloved Mirza ?-S, upon him be the Glory of God and His favor - it was submitted before the countenance of the Lord of Destiny. This is what the Tongue of the All-Merciful hath spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance, exalted and mighty be His words:

In My Name, the All-Loving, the Generous

O 'Ali! Thou hast been mentioned before the Throne and hast attained unto the grace of God, the Lord of the worlds. Thou hast been beneath the glances of divine favor, and the gaze of God hath been directed towards thee from this glorious station. Be thou steadfast in My Cause. By the life of God! Soon shall the recompense of deeds be made manifest in such wise that every tongue shall exclaim: "Blessed be God, the Rewarder, the Bestower, the All-Loving, the All-Wise." We counsel thee to preserve this station and that whereby thy rank in this mighty Cause may be elevated. Convey My greetings unto thy father and thy brother, and unto those who are with him. Soon shall a Tablet be revealed for him that shall testify that there is none other God but Me, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

This lowly one also conveys greetings and salutations to your spiritual beloved, Mirza, and those who are with him. God is my witness that their mention has been and continues to be upon my heart and tongue.

As to what you wrote concerning Aqa Mirza Ghulam-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, son of His Holiness the elevated and martyred Dhabi?, upon him be the Glory of God and His favor - two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets were revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will specifically for him and his brother Aqa Muhammad-Rida. Due to the upheavals in these lands, their dispatch was delayed for some time until these days when the fragrance of peace and security wafted. They have now been sent. God willing, they will attain unto them.

And as to your mention that some have brought harm upon the family of His Holiness the elevated Dhabi?, upon him be the Glory of God, it was submitted. His words, blessed and exalted be He: This matter has certainly not been and is not acceptable before the Divine Presence. It is incumbent upon all to have regard for them and to deal with them with the utmost kindness. Their protection is binding upon the Truth. Verily, He sufficeth them in truth, if they be of those who are assured, steadfast and firmly rooted.

O son of him who loved Me! Hear thou the call of the Wronged One. Verily, the people are in manifest doubt. Nothing whatsoever escapeth the knowledge of thy Lord - He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. In the early days when Muhammad-Rida turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon, he was so aflame with the fire of My love that all things bore witness to it, and the earth related what was upon it, and beyond it is the knowledge of thy Lord, the All-Informed. On certain nights, despite his father's hatred and opposition, he remained heedless and remembered the Truth in his inmost heart. O son of him who sacrificed himself for My Cause and testified to that which My tongue hath spoken and confirmed whatsoever hath proceeded from Me! Were his degrees of longing and attraction in those days to be mentioned, all would testify to that which was manifested. We conceal most matters as a token of Our grace, for verily We are the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.

This Day is known as the Day of God, and the fragrance of bounty wafteth from all directions, and the pavilion of grace hath been raised upon the highest standards, and the banners of "Verily I am God" are manifest in all regions. The ocean of generosity is surging and the sun of loving-kindness is shining, and the eye of God is fixed upon him who hath turned unto Him, and the ear of God is inclined toward him who hath testified to Him. The purpose is that in this day whosoever is illumined with the lights of faith and steadfastness receiveth and will continue to receive manifestations of favor from the Dayspring of the Cause, so long as this station endureth; this attribute remaineth firm. Otherwise, the matter is in His hands.

In view of this Most Great Revelation and the manifestations of grace and generosity, there hath been revealed that which indicateth the greatness of the Day of God. Nevertheless, should anyone commit oppression against the one who was sacrificed, upon him be My glory, or against those related to him, he most certainly hath been and will be punished by God. Say: Verily, the most exalted among you are those who were the first to believe. Just as mention, acceptance and obedience are acceptable, praiseworthy and commendable before God, likewise unseemly deeds are rejected and unacceptable. How many matters have occurred which God hath concealed, yet assuredly this concealment will be followed by an unveiling and recompense. Blessed are they that understand, blessed are they that have attained!

One single believer who hath caused his own desires to be extinguished in the desires of God is better and more pleasing before God than all who dwell on earth. By the life of Him Who speaketh the truth in this Most Great Prison! Were less than a needle's eye of the stations of sanctity and detachment to be revealed unto the peoples of the world, all would become freed and detached from whatsoever they possess and would hold fast unto that which God hath ordained and commanded. The suns of proof, evidence and demonstration are shining and manifest from all directions, yet the people remain heedless and veiled. The intoxication of vain desires hath seized them and debarred them from God, the Lord of all men. Thus hath spoken the Lord of the worlds while in this mighty Prison. Say: O peoples of the earth! Abandon that which ye possess, then turn toward the horizon wherefrom hath shone the sun of the loving-kindness of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

And concerning what thou didst write about Mirza Habibullah, the other son of His Holiness the Martyr, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, it was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This blessed Tablet was specifically revealed for him from the heaven of favor. He saith, exalted be His majesty:

In My Name, the Witness, the All-Hearing

O Son of Dhabih! Ye are all under the sheltering gaze of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Know ye the station of this mighty, this exalted Cause. O beloved one! Reflect upon Dhabih--upon him rest My Baha--and that which hath proceeded from him. After hearing the Call, he tarried not for less than a moment but turned his face toward the realm of oneness. This occurred in days when the people of the Bayan were heedless of and veiled from the root of the Cause, for divine wisdom required concealment. God willing, may ye be occupied, in utmost sanctity and detachment, with the mention of the Truth, exalted be His glory, and be focused on the horizon of His Will. We have made mention of Dhabih and those related to him in the hidden and treasured Tablet, which in one place is referred to as the Crimson Tablet. In the beginning, the Truth, exalted be His glory, regarded only pure-hearted acceptance, for before the revelation of commandments and ordinances, He manifested Himself and uttered the Word. Whosoever accepted without hesitation attained unto all good. After the heaven of divine decree was raised up and the sun of the Cause shone forth, it became binding and obligatory upon all to hold fast unto it and act according to it. The Command is in His hands; He doeth and decreeth as He pleaseth and willeth. He is verily the Commander, the Possessor, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The glory be upon thee and upon him who attained the presence of God in the Most Great Prison, and upon those who have testified to that which God hath testified: that there is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

The praise be to God! The gaze of God's loving-kindness hath ever been and still is directed towards the honored Dhabih--upon him be the glory of God and His loving-kindness--and his relatives, upon them be the glory of God. And Muhammad-Rida--upon him be the glory of God--showed perfect sincerity in service to the honored one in the early days. Now too should the fragrance of unity and love be diffused between them. The good-pleasure of God lieth in the relatives of the honored one being pleased with him. The station of God's loved ones hath ever been and shall ever remain in view. God hath preferred some above others. He, verily, is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth, and in His grasp is the kingdom of command. There is none other God but Him, the Strong, the Dominant, the Mighty.

As to what was written about some being somewhat saddened by the Tablet that was specifically revealed for Muhammad-Rida, this is not and was never permissible, for no one is aware of the reality of matters. For were they to become aware, they would testify that whatsoever hath appeared and shall appear is the truth in which there is no doubt. The Primal Point--may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake--hath said regarding this most great Revelation that if He should apply to the heaven the law of earth and to the earth the law of heaven, and should anyone entertain in his heart the slightest objection or protest, he is devoid of belief and acceptance. For if one truly recognizes and attains unto the station of absolute certainty, he will know with clear conviction that whatsoever appeareth from the holy Presence and proceedeth from the Source of Command is truth itself, sanctified, exalted and freed from all doubt, uncertainty and misgiving.

Concerning what thou didst mention of the honored wife of His Holiness the Martyr, upon them both be the Glory of God, God is verily Witness that this servant hath, at special times, made mention of her and the kinsmen of His Holiness the Exalted One in the Most Holy Court. Now, since the evidences of divine favor are not outwardly manifest in the material realm, the rays of the Sun of Grace remain hidden from sight. Were the fruits and effects of but one word revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning the loved ones to become manifest and appear in the world, all would proclaim the blessed words "verily this is from none other than God, the Exalted, the Great." It is requested that thou convey greetings on behalf of this servant to that honored lady, upon her be the Glory of God. God willing, may she be mindful of and speak that which befitteth her and the days of her Lord, and act accordingly.

As to what thou didst write concerning Aqa Muhammad-Karim-i-'Attar, upon him be the Glory of God, his deeds are remembered in the presence of God and have attained the ornament of divine acceptance. Blessed is he, again blessed is he! Soon will the station and rank of those who are today engaged in serving the Cause become manifest and evident amidst the peoples of the world like unto the sun. Today most people are heedless, knowing not what Cause hath appeared in the world and what tidings have come. They are occupied with their own idle fancies until such time as they shall find themselves in another state and cling to the words "Is there any way to return?" or utter "Would that I were dust!" Particularly in these days this servant sent them a letter adorned with the effulgent rays of the Sun of Grace of our Lord and your Lord, our Goal and your Goal, and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth. God willing, may it reach them and may they attain to the manifest, resplendent favors of the True One, exalted be His glory. This evanescent servant, in all conditions, beseecheth God for their protection and that of their kinsmen upon the divine path.

O beloved of my heart! The Cause is mighty, mighty indeed. His honor Muhammad-Qarim, upon him be the Glory of God, praise be to God, hath been assisted to serve the Truth. Blessed is he and blessed is he who hath attained unto deputyship in teaching the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. He is the first to have attained this station and to be mentioned in the presence of God for this service. God willing, may he in all conditions fix his gaze upon the Truth and act according to His good-pleasure.

Another glad tiding is that your portrait was repeatedly presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, as were the portraits of many of the friends of God, and this deed of Jahangir was accepted. One day these blessed words were revealed from the Divine Tongue, blessed and exalted be His utterance: "O servant in attendance! Jahangir has succeeded in serving the Cause and this service of his is acceptable before the Wronged One. He must give thanks to God by night and day. Were he to become aware of the fruits of the tree of his service, such joy and gladness would seize him that none save God could reckon it. Blessed is he and blessed is he who encouraged him and enabled him to achieve that which proceeded from him." The Primal Point - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - addressing the Letter of the Living, says, exalted and glorified be His words: "By Him Who causeth the seed to split and Who breatheth the spirit, if I were certain that on the Day of His Revelation thou wouldst deny Him, I would unhesitatingly deny thee and repudiate thy faith in this Revelation, for thou wert created but for Him. And if I knew that an infidel would believe in Him, I would make him the apple of Mine eye and would deem his faith in that Revelation as valid without requiring any evidence from him..." Now observe and ponder how great is the Cause. God, the All-Informed, knows that in His utterance flow the oceans of grandeur. All the good of the world belongs to one who ponders and becomes aware of the greatness of the Day of Divine Manifestation and arises to serve the Cause. If all the people of the Bayan were to ponder on this one point, they would become aware of the oceans of their heedlessness. In truth, they have been observed to be lower than all the peoples of the world. The servant beseeches God, his Lord, and clings to the hem of His robe that He may enable all to do that which He loves and with which He is well-pleased. Verily, He is the Lord of the throne and earth, the One manifest from the highest horizon. Let them ponder this exalted Word which hath been revealed by the Pen of the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake. To the Letter of the Living, in whose praise He says that they were and are the most exalted, the most distinguished, the most elevated and the greatest of all creation in the sight of God - even to such a Letter of the Living who is adorned with these attributes He says that if He knew that that soul would be veiled in that Revelation, He would today pronounce the decree of negation concerning him. And this is specific to this most wondrous and most exalted Revelation. A hundred thousand blessings be upon the soul who navigates and becomes immersed in the oceans of inner meanings until with clear certitude they discover that of which all are today heedless and deprived, save whom God willeth - our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of our forebears. And regarding what you wrote about Karbalai Muttalib of Z - upon him be the Glory of God - it was presented before the Divine Presence. This is what was revealed for him from the heaven of power, might and authority, exalted be His majesty:

In My Name, the All-Knowing

O Muhammad-Qabli-Taqi! Upon thee be My Glory. Hearken unto My call from the precincts of the Prison, and give glad tidings to My loved ones from whom the fragrance of sincerity unto God, the True One, is diffused. Then make mention of him who is named Muttalib and give him the glad tidings of My manifest grace. We have remembered him and revealed for him verses by which the tongues of nations throughout the world shall speak. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Remember when the ignorant ones arose in the land of Za and opposed the friends of God, the Lord of Names. Among them were those who issued decrees against them, those who commanded their plunder, and those who uttered that which caused the dwellers of Paradise to lament. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, the All-Aware. They committed that which none before them had committed, whereunto testifieth the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. We have made mention of every servant who hath borne tribulations in the path of God and of every oppressor who hath disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.

O thou who gazest toward My direction! The clamor of the oppressors and the lamentation of the oppressed are raised from the direction of Za. Soon shall the standards of the polytheists and hypocrites--namely the divines of that land--be destroyed, and the banners of God's Cause shall be raised in the name of His chosen ones and pure ones. Reflect upon the divines of the Gospel and the divines of idols, and likewise upon the Jewish divines. They inflicted upon the Daysprings of Divine Revelation that which caused every seeing one to weep and every possessor of understanding to lament. In every Dispensation, the enemies of truth have been the divines of the earth, save whom God hath willed. Make mention of My loved ones in the land of Za and give them the glad tidings of My acceptance of them, My attention, My care, My kindness and My mercy. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. The Glory be upon thee and upon them from the presence of One mighty and powerful.

As to what thou didst write concerning the honored mother, upon her be the Glory of God, she is among those women to whom the Supreme Pen hath testified their acceptance, their turning unto God, and their acknowledgment of that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken. Verily, there is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

God, exalted be His glory, will assist His Cause through men whose faces are illumined with the light of certitude, whose temples are adorned with the ornament of wisdom, whose hearts are set ablaze with the fire of love, and whose heads are crowned with the diadems of trust. Soon shall the doors of outward bounties be opened before the faces of the friends. Reflect upon early Islam, when the companions subsisted on dates and slept on pebbles. Yet eventually princes, the wealthy and chiefs turned toward them and sought help from them. The Command is in God's hands; He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. All must first hold fast with utmost determination to the cord of unity, and through complete consultation bring forth this station's countenance from behind the veils. After this countenance--namely the countenance of unity--is established in its station, they should consult about promoting the Cause and act according to what the friends of God, exalted be His glory, approve. Praise be to God that your honor is arising to serve the Cause and is occupied with teaching. The servant beseecheth his Lord to strengthen your honor in all conditions and to manifest through you that which is befitting. Verily, He is the Protector of those who do good and the Answerer of those who supplicate.

As to what you wrote concerning transactions and affairs, there is no doubt therein. One day, when five hours and fifteen minutes had passed since morning, in a palace situated in the land of Bahji, they attained the presence of the Lord of existence. He said: "O servant present! The tree of the earth hath appeared in the name of Truth and hath been raised up through His grace. In outward life its worth and station remain concealed. Blessed is it and blessed is he who recognizeth it and who pondereth on what God hath revealed unto it. God willing, the fruit of that tree shall be blessed with the outpourings of the All-Bountiful Lord and shall receive what hath been ordained for it." Furthermore, utterances were heard from the Tongue of Grandeur indicating grace and favor toward you. Soon it shall be made manifest, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed Speaker. What you wrote regarding these matters was, in truth, for God's sake and adorned with the ornament of truthfulness, for the Purpose of the world Himself beareth witness that no affair remaineth concealed, yet the people are in a strange sleep.

Concerning what you wrote about the details of the affairs of Aqa Siyyid Nasru'llah, upon him be the Glory of God, and the passing of his wife, upon her be the Glory of God - this servant wrote and sent their reply, and their duties were made clear and evident in that letter according to His command. God willing, may they be enabled to act according to what God hath willed. A Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was also revealed specifically for them from the heaven of grace, which is being sent with this letter. You should deliver it. God willing, may they receive their portion from the ocean of mercy which surgeth within it and act according to its commandments. Convey greetings from this evanescent one to all the friends in that land. God willing, may they all arise to serve and hold fast to the cord of wisdom. Verily, He aideth whosoever speaketh His mention and ariseth to serve His Cause. Verily, He hath power over all things.

Regarding what you asked about the blessed passage revealed at the end of the Tablet of Salman, upon him be the Glory of God, this is what the Tongue of God spoke: "O son of Abhar! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Due to the veils of the people on earth and the remoteness of the servants, many matters have remained concealed and the utterance of the All-Merciful imprisoned in the treasuries of knowledge. As thou observest, He Himself is imprisoned in this land. There hath befallen Us, from before and after, that which none knoweth save Him Who speaketh and uttereth the truth. However, in consideration of the weakness of the people, outwardly the Truth, exalted be His glory, hath transformed the prison-land into the most exalted Paradise, despite the oppressors. This is evident outwardly, but in its inmost mystery the signs and conditions of imprisonment are manifest and known. He it is Who hath manifested what was previously revealed in the Tablet, and He shall manifest what remaineth, even as He manifested it in the previous year. Verily, He hath power over all things and encompasseth all things."

Hear what the Wronged One hath proclaimed! The Tablet of thy spouse, Muhammad the Emigrant, upon him be the Glory of God, was presented and read before the Most Holy Presence. This is what God hath revealed in reply, exalted be His grandeur:

O handmaiden of God! The Wronged One of the horizons hath ever remembered and continueth to remember His servants and handmaidens, and hath enjoined upon all such deeds as would ensure their preservation, exaltation and deliverance in all the divine worlds. Blessed is the soul that hath drunk from the ocean of the All-Merciful's utterance and discovered its sweetness. By My life! Its effects shall never depart from his palate, by the perpetuity of My dominion and the endurance of My Name. Hearken thou unto the call of the Wronged One, commit all affairs unto Him, and place thy trust in Him. Whosoever hath today attained unto a word from Him hath attained unto all good, provided he remaineth steadfast in preserving it.

Reflect upon the words of Abdullah Ansari, who was among the saints. He saith: "O my God! If Thou shouldst but once say 'My servant', my laughter would exceed the Throne." How many saints have sacrificed their lives in their yearning for this station! And now the acceptable handmaidens have each heard, outwardly and inwardly, from the Tongue of Grandeur either "O My handmaiden" or "O My leaf", though it is not known whether they are aware of it or not. Do My servants recognize Who speaketh unto them, and do My handmaidens know Who addresseth them? Were the handmaidens of the earth to become conscious of this single truth and recognize the glory of this station, they would find themselves freed from all abasement and sorrows of the world. God hath forgiven those who sought forgiveness from the ocean of His grace, the billows of His bounty, and the depths of His generosity. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord for this great favor.

Verily We make mention of My servant Muhammad and give him glad tidings of My mercy, and I am the All-Knowing Giver of Glad Tidings. We remember those among My servants and handmaidens who have been mentioned before the Throne, and I am the All-Wise Rememberer. O Muhammad! Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord's loving-kindness and cleave unto that which shall cause thy remembrance to endure through the perpetuity of My most beautiful Names, and I am the Kind, Compassionate, and Generous Counsellor. The Glory be upon thee, upon thy spouse, and upon them that have held fast unto this firm and impregnable Cause.

And at the end of the Tablet, We make mention of My handmaiden once again, and We make mention of what God hath manifested through her of both male and female offspring, and We give them glad tidings of My mercy which hath preceded existence. Praise be to God, the Lord of the seen and unseen.

The Herald of Grace proclaimeth through these perfect words, which have shone forth from the Dayspring of Grace of the King of Names and Attributes, and giveth glad tidings unto all of His bounty, mercy and loving-kindness. Blessed are they that hear and arise, and woe unto the heedless and the slumberers.

And the petition of Aqa Siyyid Abdul-Hadi, upon him be the Glory of God, was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken, exalted be His majesty:

In My Name, the All-Seeing, the All-Informed

O Hadi! Upon thee be My Glory! Steadfast and upright souls who gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon and are detached from all else but God must observe all things with penetrating vision. Thou didst send the verses of God to one who is cunning. Thou must seek forgiveness from God, thy Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne. It is evident and manifest that such souls are deprived of divine love and barred from the Tree of Grace. Thou hast entrusted the divine trust to a thief and delivered it to a traitor. Thou hast deposited pure truth with absolute falsehood. By My life, this is a grave matter, grave indeed. Be vigilant! Distinguish friend from foe. Shun those who associate with such souls, let alone the great loss and supreme calamity. In several instances these words have flowed from the Most Exalted Pen: Display not the pearls of divine knowledge to every traitor, and entrust not the mysteries of heavenly wisdom to thieves. Thou art a believer - the Most Exalted Pen hath testified to thy faith - and a believer seeth with the light of God, both now and always. What hath befallen thee that thou hast fallen into this error? Take counsel in all matters. Hast thou not heard the decree of the Book? All are commanded to consult today. Hold fast unto that which I have commanded thee in My Perspicuous Book and inform all, that they may be aware. The hosts of Satan appear with utmost deception and guile. Some of the handmaidens outwardly maintain relations, and the idolatrous souls show the utmost consideration - their purpose is to discover affairs, that they may learn of a matter and spread it abroad. O My loved ones! Fear God, then conceal God's Cause from those who have denied Him and from those women whose hypocrisy, hatred and rejection every atom doth attest. Thus doth My Most Exalted Pen counsel you as the Beauty of the Ancient of Days walketh in this exalted station. O Hadi! Repent unto God Who created thee, strengthened thee, caused thee to know Him, and revealed unto thee that which no earthly thing bearing any name can equal. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Hold fast unto pure godliness in thy Lord's Cause and shun every heedless doubter. We have commanded all to righteous deeds and conduct, and to preserve whatsoever cometh unto them from God, the Lord of all worlds. The True One, exalted be His glory, hath in this Revelation forbidden through explicit and clear verses all that might cause the slightest vexation, and hath enjoined upon all goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. Every fair-minded one hath testified and doth testify that this Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Cause hath been and is sanctified from the promptings of self and passion. Were the discerning and the wise to observe God's verses, they would perceive that whatsoever is recorded therein is the cause and means of unity, tranquility and the reformation of the world. However, should these fall into the hands of the malevolent, they would append certain words thereto and spread them among the helpless servants, or attribute some verses to themselves, as hath occurred in these parts. All the friends must firmly hold to concealment and discretion in this matter and act according to what God hath willed. Disclosure is beloved for its people, but concealment is more preferable for those who are unworthy. Fix your gaze upon the horizon of justice, which is to give every possessor of a right his right. The utterances of Abraham profited not Nimrod.

He bestoweth upon every possessor of a right his due. The words of the Friend profited not Nimrod, nor did the counsel of the Spirit benefit the Jews. Hold fast to the admonitions of God and the effects of His Pen, and be not of the heedless. The arch-deceiver, beguiled by the outward adornments of this world and, with the utmost cunning and guile, engageth in searching out matters. Verily thy Lord doth witness and see, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. There is none other God but Him, the Ruler, the Commander, the All-Knowing, the Single, the One, the All-Informed.

All the friends of God must conceal the sending of Tablets and correspondence from most people, both within and without. Whosoever associateth with heedless, deceitful souls will surely, through such association and meeting, disclose certain matters. The divine Tablets and heavenly Books must be kept in a most secure and protected place, and at the time of need be recited for souls who are steadfast, assured, upright and clear-sighted, and thereafter be safeguarded. In some homes, whenever the polytheists have entered, the first things they have found have been the writings, as if no thought had been given to protecting them, whereas this matter is necessary, nay rather, most essential.

His honor "The Name", upon him be the Glory of God, must act with the utmost wisdom and completely conceal all matters from those heedless souls, for they associate with the arch-deceiver, and all these deceptions and corruptions emanate from her. God protect us and you from her evil and her fire.

As commanded, you must recite for Aqa Siyyid 'Abdu'l-Hadi whatever pertaineth to him, but do not give him the text of the words, for he is most sincere, while the arch-deceiver is most cunning and by whatever means possible will accomplish her purpose through his associates. Hers is the cunning in all conditions, and his is the faithfulness and obedience, and God our Lord encompasseth the beginning and the end.

Mention was made of his honor Aqa Mu'min of Ishtihird, upon him be the Glory of God, in the petition of his honor Aqa Siyyid 'Abdu'l-Hadi, upon him be the Glory of God. It was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and these sublime words were revealed from the Dayspring of Will. His exalted Word:

He is the Proof and the Evidence

O Mu'min! God willing, may you and the friends of God from the land of Alif and Shin be illumined by the lights of His countenance and arise to serve His Cause. He hath seen and seeth every deed, and hath heard and heareth every call. He is a Watcher that is near, and a Near One that is far. Praise the Intended One of the world that thou wert mentioned in His presence and didst attain unto His remembrance. Praise Him and say:

Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who didst remember me in Thy prison and didst strengthen me to recognize Thee when I was heedless, and didst show me the lights of Thy grace when I was blind. I beseech Thee by the standards of Thy guidance and the banners of Thy victory to aid me and Thy loved ones to be steadfast in Thy Cause and patient in Thy days. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and verily Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O Muhammad! Thou hast previously attained unto My mention, as My all-encompassing knowledge doth testify. We make mention of thee, as a token of Our grace, with My gracious remembrance. Know thou the station of My remembrance of thee and My attention towards thee from the direction of My mighty prison. Let not circumstances sadden thee and turn thee from the Source of verses. Be thankful unto thy Lord and remain in manifest joy. The glory of God rest upon thee and thy wife, from God, the Lord of all worlds.

And regarding what was mentioned in the petition of Haydar-'Ali Bey, this is what was revealed for him from the tongue of our Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. He, exalted and mighty be He, saith:

He is the Ever-Present, the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him. They who have turned to the Most Sublime Horizon are men whom the ornaments of the world have not kept back from God, the Lord of all beings, nor have they been frightened by the power of the divines and their clamor regarding this Most Great News. These are servants who have arisen and declared: "God is our Lord and the Lord of all who are in earth and heaven," and we bear witness to that which God hath testified, that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

O Haydar-'Ali! We have turned toward thee and made mention of thee as a token of Our grace, that thou mayest rejoice and be of the thankful ones. This is a Day wherein all the friends of God must fix their gaze upon the horizon of unity, and speak and act in a manner befitting the Cause of God - that which is the cause of its glory. Blessed is the soul that hath found the fragrance of its Lord's utterance, and woe unto every heedless and remote one. The divines of the earth, in their nights and days, are occupied with the mention of the Lord of all beings. As thou canst observe, they speak His praise from pulpits and mosques, acknowledging His greatness and His Manifestation. Yet when the Day of God appeared and the lights of His countenance shone forth from the horizon of His Will, all remained veiled save whom God wished. Praise the Intended One of the worlds, Who enabled thee to recognize this mighty Cause. At all times, beseech Him to protect thee and keep thee steadfast on this Path whereon feet have slipped. With utmost joy and fragrance, occupy thyself with the remembrance of the Beloved and fix thy gaze upon His horizon, and say:

O Thou Intended One of the world and Beloved of the nations! I have cast aside all I possess before Thy face, hoping for that which is with Thee. I beseech Thee by Thy bounty and grace not to disappoint me, and to ordain for me by Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. O my Lord! Enable me and my wife and daughter to do that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily Thou art the Lord of the Last and the First, and the Sovereign of the throne on high and of earth below. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

As for the ascension of the leaf \[woman\] upon her be the Glory of God, mention of her was heard from the tongue of Truth, exalted be His glory, some time ago. Indeed, this servant has repeatedly observed her mention in some divine Tablets. God willing, Aqa Siyyid 'Abdu'l-Hadi has been and will be blessed to observe this. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Compassionate, the Giving, the Forgiving, the Merciful. This servant conveys greetings and salutations to them. God willing, henceforth they will make earnest effort in safeguarding affairs lest that which would harm the Divine Lote-Tree should appear. I beseech the Truth, exalted be His glory, for confirmation and assistance for them and for others.

In the Name of Him Who ruleth over the world

Blessed is the countenance that hath turned toward the Face of God, and blessed is the herald who hath raised his voice among the servants with this Name, whereby the backs of the wicked were broken and the faces of the righteous were illumined - they who cast away whatsoever was with the people, turning unto God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting.

O Farajullah! By God, the Lord of all beings maketh mention of thee from the Most Exalted Horizon, and counseleth thee with that which shall profit thee in this world and the next. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Loving. Hold fast unto the fear of God and unto that which hath been revealed in the Book, as a command from His presence - and He is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.

Say: Verily trustworthiness is the sun in the heaven of My commandments, truthfulness is its moon, and virtuous character its stars - yet most of the people understand not. Hold fast unto the Book of God and what hath been sent down therein. Verily it is a lamp unto the faithful and a sign of the Ancient of Days amongst the nations. Blessed is he who hath recognized and attained - verily he is of the people of Baha, inscribed in the Preserved Tablet.

We make mention of thee, that thou mayest in this hour give thanks unto thy Lord, the Possessor of all being. And We make mention of My handmaiden who hath turned toward My horizon, attained unto My days, and acknowledged that which My Tongue hath uttered. Blessed is she, and blessed are My handmaidens who have believed in God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen.

Thy letter hath come before Us and We have heard thy call. We answer thee with this Preserved Tablet which was hidden in the knowledge of God and made manifest in His praiseworthy station. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken and the Dove of Utterance cooed upon the branches. Verily there is no God but He, the Dominator over what was and what shall be.

May the souls mentioned come to know the station of Divine remembrance and strive diligently to preserve it. This ephemeral one ceaselessly beseecheth the Eternal Lord to aid His loved ones in that which is the cause of salvation and deliverance for all. Verily He hath power over all things.

Glorified art Thou, O my God and the One remembered in my heart! I beseech Thee by the pavilion of Thy glory which hath encompassed the world, and by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the nations, and by the ocean of Thy grace and the river of Thy generosity and the sun of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy bestowal, to send down upon Thy loved ones that which shall preserve them from the oppressors among Thy creatures and draw them nigh unto Thee in such wise that neither the swords of the wicked nor the arrows of the ungodly shall prevent them from turning unto Thee and advancing toward Thy horizon.

O Lord! This is Thy Day, the mention of which Thou hast sent down in Thy Scriptures, Books, Scrolls and Tablets, and which Thou didst announce through the tongues of Thy Messengers, Thy chosen ones and Thy Prophets. I beseech Thee to send down in it upon Thy servants that which beseemeth Thy Self. O Lord! This is the Day wherein all created things have been perfumed by the fragrance of Thy raiment and all contingent beings have been attracted by the sweetness of Thy call and Thy utterance. I beseech Thee by the arks upon the seas of Thy commandments and the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge, to send down from the heaven of Thy power and the clouds of Thy might that which shall exalt the Cause of Thy friends and loved ones in such wise that the necks of the proud among Thy creatures shall be humbled before them. Verily Thou art He Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate and no matter can hinder. Thou doest what Thou willest by Thy sovereignty and ordainest what Thou pleasest by Thy command. Verily Thou art the Strong, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

We are indeed the Witness and the Witnessed. O Mahdi! Thy petition was presented before the Most Holy Court, and its answer was sent down from the heaven of divine will. Blessed art thou for having acknowledged and sought the ocean of forgiveness of thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Man must at all times fix his gaze upon truth and act in accordance with that which is befitting. Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto the outpourings of the All-Bountiful and hast partaken of the choice wine of divine love. Verily He hath forgiven thy sins and hath sent down for thee that from which the sincere ones perceive the fragrance of God's bounty, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Hold thou fast unto the cord of His grace and say: I beseech Thee to assist me in serving Thee and to aid me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Answerer of those who call upon Thee. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.

Mention was also made of Aqa Shir-'Ali, and the mother and spouse and spouse of Karbila'i Mahdi, and daughter and several other handmaidens. All their names were presented at the Throne, and all were blessed with the favors of God, and for each one wondrous and sublime verses dawned forth from the horizon of divine grace in such wise that the worlds of the seen and the unseen were illumined thereby. Blessed is the ear that hath heard and the eye that hath seen, and woe unto every heedless and doubtful denier. The glory shining forth from the heaven of the bounty of our Lord, the Gracious, be upon you and upon those with you and upon them who have testified to that whereunto God testified before the creation of the heavens and the earths. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

At this moment, by command We turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon, and after arising in the presence of the Tongue of Grandeur spoke this most sublime word: O thou who art present! Today the Cause of unity and concord is most mighty, and in truth it is the means of the elevation and advancement of the Cause. May the One True God, exalted be His glory, raise up souls who shall arise to render this service, for verily He is powerful over all things.

In like manner did they say: Mention Ali Pasha Khan, upon him be the Glory of God, and convey to him greetings from before the Truth that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones. Say: O Ali, grieve not over anything, for in all that appeareth from Him there is a wisdom which none knoweth save He. Submit thyself unto God that the winds of His Will may turn thee as they please and move thee as they desire. Praise be to God, thou art mentioned before the Truth. Soon shall the station of the believers and the successful ones be made manifest in the earth. All must preserve their station through His Most Exalted Name. The Glory be upon thee and upon those with thee who have drunk of My Choice Wine sealed with My Self-Subsisting Name.

This servant conveyeth greetings and salutations. Some time ago a letter was sent to his presence. It is hoped that in all conditions he will gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon and act according to what God hath willed. Verily, He is the Protector of the doers of good and the beneficent ones.

To the beloved of the heart, his honor Mirza Kh., upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of Names, greetings are conveyed. Afterwards, numerous letters arrived from various directions and their details were submitted to the Most Holy Court, and answers descended from the heaven of favor and were dispatched. From the land of Sh., a letter arrived from his honor Aqa Mirza Ahmad, upon him be the Glory of God, wherein were mentioned certain names, for each of whom was revealed and sent a most wondrous and impregnable Tablet. The ocean of bounty is surging and the sun of grace is shining. Blessed are they that attain, both men and women.

From the verdant land also, petitions arrived repeatedly, adorned with mention of his honor Mirza. Praise and glory be to God that between some the fragrance of love is diffused. God willing, this fragrance will waft in all directions and spread until in every city of the cities its sweet scent is diffused and emanating. Verily He is powerful over all things and wise in all things. There is no God but He, the All-Hearing, the Answering One.

After completing the reply to your previous letter, another letter dated the nineteenth of Muharram al-Haram arrived which, like lamp oil, gave light to the lamp of love and sustained it. God willing, may you ever be adorned and embellished with the Kawthar of grace and the glances of favor, and remain fresh and joyous. The honored gentleman, His Holiness the Name of God M., upon him be the most glorious of all glory, hath written mention of you and hath spoken with perfect love and sincerity, even concerning your debts and likewise the sale of property, and an answer was written and sent to His Holiness as commanded. Whatever was deemed expedient was accepted. God willing, the recompense of all hath been and is with God, exalted be His glory. Verily He is our Protector and your Protector in the Hereafter and in this world, and He is the All-Hearing, the Answering One.

As for the mention that was made of his honor Zayn from the people of K., upon him be the Glory of God, it was submitted. This is what the Tongue of the All-Bountiful spoke in reply, exalted be His majesty:

In My Name, the Concealer, the All-Knowing

O Zayn! Thou hast attained unto that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen and reached a station which God hath made the rallying point of them that are nigh unto Him. Hold fast unto that which We have counseled thee aforetime and that which We have revealed in the Book. Verily, it will draw thee nigh unto Him and strengthen thee in all His worlds. Thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Be vigilant in the Cause, silent when prudence demandeth, and eloquent in this Name through which, when it appeared, the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimed: "The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all worlds!" O Zayn! We counsel thee to unity and to that which befitteth this momentous Announcement. Exert your utmost effort in unifying the friends. This is a Day whereon none should regard himself or that which profiteth him, but rather that whereby the Cause of God may be exalted. This is My bidding unto thee and unto those who have turned towards My horizon and have held fast unto My perspicuous Book. That which appeareth for God's sake shall not, I swear by My life, be lost, nor ever will be lost. Say: O My loved ones! Cast away your differences and hold fast unto the cord of the Cause, by the command of your Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. Confine thy affairs to that which We have commanded thee. Verily, it shall profit thee, by My Self that domineth all who are in the heavens and the earth. God willing, be mindful of this matter in all conditions and hold fast unto it, for through the light of unity shall all regions, nay, all corners of the earth be illumined. Remember thou the days of attaining My presence when thou wert in the company of the Wronged One and didst hear with thine own ears that which the Interlocutor of the Mount uttered in His mighty and impregnable Prison. We, from this station, send Our glorification upon thee and upon My loved ones who have held fast unto justice and equity and have turned unto My straight Path.

Indeed, this service is the greatest of all services, for through discord matters arise which God, exalted be His glory, hath forever forbidden. Discord hath ever been the cause of dispersion, instability, and the loss of rank and station. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist the assured souls to turn unto this station. This evanescent servant testifieth that whosoever ariseth to render this service shall be accounted among the most exalted, most ancient, most upright, and most honored of servants in the sight of God and shall be recorded thus in His Book. Blessed is he who attaineth unto this mighty station.

Concerning what was written about Sheikh Yahya, upon him be the glory of God, the honored Ismu'llah Jamal, upon him be all the most glorious glory, hath repeatedly mentioned him. He is blessed with the favors of God, exalted be His glory. The Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet shall also be specifically revealed for him, God willing. Greetings be conveyed to the honored Mirza and Sheikh, upon them both be the glory of God, and divine confirmation and assistance are besought for them from God, exalted be His station.

As for the mention of Aqa Mirza Buzurg, upon him be the glory of God, praise be to God that he hath attained, both before and after, unto the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory, and unto wondrous and sublime Tablets. His petition was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence on a certain night. This is what was revealed for him from the Kingdom of our Lord's will, the Lord of earth and heaven. His words, exalted be His glory:

In My Name, the Hearer, the Answerer

A mention from before the Wronged One to him whose sighs ascended in the love of God, the Lord of the worlds, and to whom the Supreme Pen hath testified concerning his turning to the most exalted Summit when the people were in evident doubt. Blessed art thou for having drunk the choice wine of certitude from the hands of bounty and for having turned toward the Countenance when every remote scholar turned away from it. Give thanks unto God for having turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison and accepted what came upon thee in His straight Path. Behold, then call to mind what befell God's Messengers and His Emissaries aforetime at the hands of the wrongdoers. Woe unto every shepherd who betrayed God's flock, and blessed is the maidservant who heard, turned toward and responded to her Ancient Lord. Say: Woe unto you, O company of the ignorant! Ye have been heedless of Him Whom ye invoke and have turned away from the Face towards which turn the near ones since time immemorial and around which circle all who are endowed with insight. Say: How long will ye follow vain desires? Cast aside what ye possess of idle fancies and vain imaginings and take what hath been given you from your Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto God's Cause in His wondrous Day. Grieve not for what hath befallen thee. By My life! God hath ordained for thee that which shall solace the eyes of the sincere ones. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

And concerning the mention of Karbila'i Mu??alib, upon him be the Glory of God, after presenting this Most Exalted Word, these words specifically for him were revealed from the Supreme Pen. His mighty mention and praise saith:

In My Name, the Wronged One, the Stranger

O Muttalib! Thy mention flowed from the pen of one of God's friends who speaketh of Him and standeth firm in service to His Cause. Therefore the Sun of loving-kindness hath once again shone forth from the horizon of grace, and hath mentioned thee with most wondrous praise. If thou wert to become aware of the ocean of divine mention, thou wouldst utter "Thine is the praise, O God of the worlds" throughout the nights and days. Strive that there may be manifested from thee that from which the fragrance of eternity may be inhaled. In these days, if a soul attaineth unto but a single word from the Lord of Oneness, he is mentioned among the sincere ones in the Manifest Book. The divine Word cannot be effaced by water, nor can the vicissitudes of time alter it. It appeareth by God's will, is known by His Name, and is adorned with the ornament of perpetuity. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto it and preserved it through the Name of its Lord, the Almighty, the Protecting, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Rejoice thou in My mention of thee, then give thanks to thy Lord, the Generous. Blessed are they who have heard and turned toward Him, and woe unto those who turn away.

Since mention of Karbila'i Muttalib appeared in two of your letters, therefore two mentions of him were sent down from the heaven of God's Will. It behooveth us to observe and reflect upon the ocean of our Lord's grace - the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earth. By the life of the Desired One! Every scribe, every reckoner, every speaker, every learned one, and every person of insight is powerless to reckon His bounties. The divine favor hath reached such a degree that, God forbid, there is fear it might remain hidden due to its abundant worth and station. We beseech and implore His wondrous grace and favor that He may make His servants aware and assist them to attain the sweetness of the All-Merciful's utterance. Whosoever findeth it would sacrifice his spirit for a single letter of His verses. Every fair-minded and knowing one beareth witness to this.

O thou who art steadfast in the Covenant! The manifold adversities and afflictions and the successive trials and hardships have served to adorn thy brow with the crown of steadfastness and have caused thee to quaff from the chalice of fidelity. Thou hast been subjected to every test and trial and hast emerged therefrom radiant and victorious. Gracious God! How strange that every calamity and tribulation, rather than causing one to languish, hath instead imparted strength and vitality, and every affliction, far from weakening and debilitating, hath granted fresh capacity and renewed vigor. This is among the mysteries of God and a token of His consummate wisdom.

In the Name of our Lord, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing! My God, my God! Thou seest mine eyes fixed upon the horizon of Thy grace and the hands of this poor one raised to the heaven of Thy bounty. Whenever I contemplate Thy justice, O my God, my limbs tremble, my heart is agitated, my joints quiver, my sighs ascend and my tears fall. Yet whenever I contemplate Thy grace and Thy dealings with Thy loved ones, my spirit soars, my heart is assured and my soul finds rest. By Thy glory, O God of Names and Creator of heaven! My heart has melted from shame and my being is aflame with the fire of my sorrow. In my days I have done that which Thou didst forbid in Thy Books and through the tongues of Thy Messengers. I confess, O my God, to having wronged my soul. I have forsaken what was meet and proper and have committed that which hath caused the dwellers of the cities of Thy justice to lament.

My God, my God! My transgressions have prevented me from turning to the lights of the Orb of Thy grace, and my trespasses have come between me and the revelations of Thy names and attributes. O Lord! Thou seest the sinner yearning for the ocean of Thy forgiveness, and him that is far removed longing for the court of Thy nearness. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty and the effulgences of the Day-Star of Thy bestowal, and by Thy Prophets and Messengers whom Thou hast made the lamps of guidance among Thy creatures and the dawning-places of piety amidst Thy creation, to aid me in Thy remembrance and praise and in that which Thou hast commanded in Thy Book. I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned to Thee, detached from all else but Thee, acknowledging Thy unity and Thy singleness, and assured of Thy grandeur and Thy sovereignty, Thy might and Thy power.

Alas, alas! My heedlessness hath destroyed me and my disobedience hath weakened me. I know not, O my Purpose and my Adored One, with what countenance to turn toward Thee, with what heart to approach Thy most exalted horizon and supreme height, and with what tongue to offer excuses before the manifestations of Thy justice, O Lord of all being! My sin hath kept me back from drawing nigh unto Thee, and my deeds have intervened between me and Thy bounty and generosity. I have done what Thou didst forbid and have neglected what Thou didst command. Therefore, alas, alas! I am he who cast aside the ordinances of Thy Book and took the book of my own self, and committed that which hath deprived me of the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and barred me from the sweet waters of Thy mercy and Thy bounty.

Behold, O my God, my evil plight, my agitation and my confusion! My God, my God! My hope is in Thy grace and my desire is Thy generosity. The ocean of rebellion hath turned toward the ocean of Thy forgiveness, and the mountain of error toward the heaven of Thy bounty. Should Thou cast me far, who will draw me nigh, and should Thou deny me, who will call me unto Thee? By Thy power, O King of the visible and invisible realms, and Sovereign of grandeur and might! I find for myself no helper save Thee, no protector besides Thee, and no one merciful other than Thee. The fire of heedlessness and passion hath consumed me - where is the water of Thy mercy, O Purpose of them that have recognized Thee? The hosts of idle fancies and vain imaginings have removed me far from Thee - where is the light of Thy nearness, O God of the heavens and the earths? The thirst of disobedience hath destroyed me - where is the ocean of Thy forgiveness, O Thou in Whose remembrance the hearts of them that are nigh unto Thee delight?

I beseech Thee, O God of earth and heaven, by the Ark that hath sailed at Thy bidding, and by Him through Whom the sweet savors of Thy Revelation were wafted and the celestial spheres of Thy heaven were honored by His advent, and by them through whom Thy traces were spread abroad, Thy standards were raised up, Thy commandments and laws were revealed, and the horizons of Thy realm were illumined, not to disappoint me of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones. O Lord! Thou seest the feeble one seeking the kingdom of Thy utterance, him that is far removed yearning for the precincts of Thy mercy, and the sinful one desiring the ocean of Thy bounty and forgiveness. Thou art God, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O God! Send down Thy blessings upon Thy Messengers and Thy chosen ones, and upon Thy loved ones who have championed Thy Cause, raised the banners of Thy Faith and the ordinances of Thy Book, and strove until they laid down their lives in Thy path. Verily, Thou art powerful to do as Thou pleasest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful! O my Lord, my Master, my Support, my Goal, the Ultimate Object of my hope and the End of my desire! My outer and inner tongue bear witness to Thy oneness and singleness, and that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Thou hast ever been powerful, mighty, self-subsisting and eternal, and wilt ever remain as Thou hast been from time immemorial. Neither the might of princes, nor the doubts of divines, nor the hosts of tyrants, nor the ranks of pharaohs can prevent Thee from that which Thou desirest. Through Thy name was raised the standard of "He doeth whatsoever He willeth" and the banner of "He ordaineth what He pleaseth." Thou art He Whose power hath triumphed, Whose sovereignty hath appeared, Whose mercy hath preceded, Whose proof hath been perfected, and Whose evidence hath been completed. There is no God but Thee. May the essence perish of whatsoever hath not acknowledged Thy oneness and singleness, and may the reality be lost of whatsoever hath not confessed Thy greatness and power, Thy favors and loving-kindness. I beseech Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued all names, and by Thy power which hath encompassed all things, and by the pearls of Thy knowledge and the stars of the heaven of Thy wisdom, to protect me from the oppression of Thine enemies who have violated Thy Covenant and Testament, who have denied Thy signs, who have disputed Thy proof, and who have rejected what Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy Will and the atmosphere of Thy Purpose. O Lord! Withhold me not from that which Thou hast ordained for Thy trusted ones and chosen ones, and disappoint me not of that which Thou hast written for Thy loved ones whom neither the might of kings could turn away from turning to Thee, nor the clamor of the peoples could prevent from facing Thy court. O Lord! Thou seest the weak one clinging to the cord of Thy Name, the Strong, and the poor one turning to the ocean of Thy riches. I beseech Thee, O God of the seen and unseen, by the lights of Thy Throne and by Thy Prophets and chosen ones through whom the Sun of Thy commandments shone forth in Thy kingdom and Thy traces were spread throughout Thy lands, and through whom the servants acknowledged Thy oneness, to make me in all conditions one who speaks Thy praise and glorification and who is content with what Thou hast ordained for me through Thy Will. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds and King of eternity, by the Most Great Name, to ordain for this servant the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily Thou art the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust below. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Lord! Thou seest the hands of hope raised to the heaven of Thy bounty and the hearts turned toward the horizon of Thy giving. I beseech Thee by Thy greatest signs and by the Daysprings of Thy Cause and the Manifestations of Thy Self and the Recipients of Thy knowledge and the Mines of Thy wisdom and the Treasuries of Thy utterance and the Sources of Thy commandments and ordinances to aid me in all conditions to act according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the Light which shone forth from the horizon of Hijaz and whereby the standard of Truth was raised and the banner of metaphor was lowered, to make me content with what Thou hast ordained for me. Then forgive me, O my God, through Thy bounty and generosity and grace and favor. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful. O my God! Send Thy blessings upon Thy loved ones and trusted ones and friends through whom were raised the standards of Thy victory and the banners of Thy power, and through whom Thy signs were spread abroad and Thy proof was made manifest and Thy evidence became all-encompassing - those whom nothing whatsoever prevented from drawing nigh unto Thee, who strove in Thy path with true striving and aided Thy Cause with true aid, and through whom the limbs of those who denied Thee and Thy signs trembled and the hearts of the deniers among Thy servants were confounded. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence, by them and by the blood that was shed in Thy path and the heads that were severed for the manifestation of Thy Cause, to assist Thy servants to return unto Thee and to turn repentant to the door of Thy grace. Verily Thou art the Generous, the Lord of abundant grace. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O thou who art attracted to the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Great, Most Noble Beauty! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of Names, which hath been raised betwixt earth and heaven. Verily, there is none other God besides Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. Through your mention, the Most Great Remembrance hath rejoiced, and through your letter the Ancient Beauty, Who hath come from the heaven of certitude with proof and evidence, hath been gladdened. We testify that ye drink, in remoteness, the wine of nearness, and in separation, the water of reunion, and We perceive from you the fragrance of faithfulness. This is a station none hath attained save he who hath shattered the idol of associating partners with God through power and dominion. Grieve not at separation, for verily it is a sign of reunion. Your Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted, beareth witness to this. This is a station We have ordained for you as a bounty from Our presence, and I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

We oft-times remember those moments when ye were present before the Throne, and these days when the veils of the people of error have come between us. At times We recall the days of reunion and their sweetness, and at other times the days of separation and their burning pain. Thus doth God remember those who have chosen Him over all else. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Choosing.

O 'Ali! The Ancient Beauty hath turned toward thee from this Most Great Prison, and remembereth thee with that which nothing in all creation can equal. That which ye sent to Our name, the Mahdi, hath been read before Our face, and the Dawning-Place of sorrows hath been gladdened thereby. We remember the All-Merciful at all times in such wise that neither the tyranny of them that are on earth nor the swords of the contentious can hinder Us. We have been afflicted among the people of Syria in whose hearts is concealed hatred for God, thy Lord, the Lord of all mankind. We hear from its very pebbles "The kingdom belongeth to the Revealer of verses," yet its people are in strange doubt. The peoples were promised the Lord of the Day of Remedy, but when He came with the truth, they turned away from the face of Beauty. The land of Syria was given glad tidings of the land of God, but when He came, they turned away from Him and arose in such hypocrisy as the eye of creation hath not seen. They hear the verses of God and deny them. They are indeed the people of hellfire.

O 'Ali! Inhale the fragrance of My love from the breezes of My verses which We have sent unto thee from this quarter which God, the Lord of all quarters, hath ordained. Convey My glorification unto the faces of those who have believed in God and have detached themselves from every doubting polytheist. They who have been faithful to God's Covenant are among the choicest of creation. Upon them be the glory of God and His mercy, and the light of God and His praise. We testify that they are among those endued with understanding. And they who have broken God's covenant have no portion of this bounty which hath encompassed all regions. He hath prospered who hath remained steadfast, and hath lost who hath turned away from God, the Lord of all men. Soon shall come a day wherein God will exalt those who have held fast to the cord of His Cause and have attained unto the Dayspring of lights.

Then do We make mention of Ha' before Sin from this manifest horizon - he who was afflicted with separation from Me after having drunk the water of reunion. Blessed art thou for having remained steadfast in the Cause and for having won the remembrance of God in My days and for having kept the Covenant. We beseech God to confirm thee in that whereunto thou hast attained and to draw thee near at all times. Were We to remember you throughout the duration of the kingdom and the heavenly dominion, the love of My heart would not be exhausted, for We have found from you the fragrance of the love of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.

God willing, may ye ever be gladdened by the glad-tidings of the Lord of Names and Attributes. Ye have always been and will continue to be beneath the glances of the favors of the Lord of Names. Never have ye been absent from Our sight. Every soul who hath today attained unto the most great steadfastness is accounted as human in the presence of the All-Merciful; without it, he is more abject than animals. The Most Exalted Pen is ever engaged in the remembrance of the friends - this is a bounty that hath had and hath no peer or likeness. God willing, may ye be gladdened by the remembrance of Truth and remain steadfast in His Cause. The glory from God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling, be upon you.

We, verily have not fallen short of Our duty to exhort men, and to deliver that whereunto I was bidden by God, the Almighty, the All-Praised. To His Eminence Aqa Siyyid Baqir in the Land of Ya, He is the Most Wondrous, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted.

O servant! Arise and call out among the people with wisdom and exhortation. Say: O people! After the manifestation of God and His sovereignty, does it befit anyone to cling to anything among all that has been created in the heavens and earth? No, by the radiant and luminous Beauty of God! And after the sun has risen and reached its zenith, does it befit anyone to speak of mirrors, even if they be true mirrors? No, by the Self of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!

Say: The mirror's glory lies in the sun's rays being reflected in it, and this reflection exists within it and appears from it so long as no veils of self and desire intervene between it and its illuminator. Thus is the matter, if you be of those who perceive. After becoming veiled, it can never tell of the sun's sovereignty, and God's lights, grace, providence and bounty are cut off from it. This comes from itself, for it has placed between itself and the sun that which has deprived it of the lights of God, the Mighty, the Merciful.

Say: If today all the mirrors of creation were to face this Sun that has dawned from the holy horizon, the revelation of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Powerful would be reflected in them all. This reflection remains as long as they face the Sun, but after turning away, the light returns to its source and creation reverts to its original form and likeness, if you be of those who know.

Say: God created mirrors as He created all things, and creates as He wishes by His command. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. He has ordained measures for every name in the kingdom of names - He raises and lowers them, and thus does God erase what He wishes and confirm what He wishes, and with Him is the knowledge of all things in preserved and mighty tablets.

Say: The existence of all things is through God, while His existence is through His own Self, if you be of those who understand. The light of all things is through the Sun's light, while its light is through itself, if you be of those who are certain.

Say: The glory of every name is through its Creator, while His glory is through His own Self, the Supreme, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O people! Associate not partners with God, nor take lords besides Him. Fear God, O people, and transgress not in God's Cause, and be not of the wrongdoers.

Say: Today all things stand equal, such that distinctions between created things have been removed. Whoever turns to God is among the most exalted of creation, and whoever turns away has no mention with God, the Sovereign, the Beautiful. The mirror today is he who has detached himself from self and desire and has turned to the holy court, this radiant and luminous scene. Without this, the decree of existence in the heaven of eternity cannot apply to it, let alone this station, if you be of those who know.

Say: O people! Observe the visible mirrors - if they face the sun, you will see its form within them, but after they turn away, you will find no trace of the sun in them. Thus does the Pen of Command teach you lest your feet slip from the path. This is from My grace upon you, and I am the Ancient Bestower of Grace. Likewise observe the mirrors of names, that you may be among the firmly grounded.

Though a mirror might claim for itself the station and rank of the sun, the sun knows it lies about itself, as has been decreed before, if you be of those who witness. Creation has various ranks with God, and among them are those whom God raises in the kingdom of names \[...\]

Among them are those whom God raises up in the Kingdom of Names, whose name becomes renowned among the peoples of the world. Such a one has his station with his Lord according to his measure, if he transgresses not his bounds and remains steadfast beneath the shadow of affirmation. But should his foot slip, he will instantly return to the nethermost depths. Those whose names thou hearest from every soul, yet findest not in them that whereby the hearts of the believers might find repose, and from whom no signs of God, the Creator, the Fashioner, the Ancient of Days, are made manifest - these are they whose names have been raised up without their realities, and in this there is wisdom which no ignorant one far removed can comprehend. And among them are those whose realities God raises up without names, as thou witnessest in those whose faces are illumined and from whom waft the sweet savors of holiness, yet none recognize them save those of keen insight. They walk among the people as one of them, while in their hearts the dove of remembrance warbles in their longing for God and their yearning for His holy and exalted habitation. Moses aforetime made known to us one of these, whereupon he was confounded within himself and became of the perplexed. With Us are sciences which were We to divulge but a single letter thereof, the hearts of the unitarians would be thrown into confusion. And among them are those whom God raises up in both name and reality and in all that pertains to them. Thus have We detailed the matter for thee that thou mayest know every soul according to its measure and station, and be of them that are endowed with insight. Were We to explain the stations of being raised up and its degrees according to what We have ordained, thou wouldst become aware of all mysteries, but for every mention there is an appointed time with thy Lord, and when the promise cometh, it shall descend from a holy and exalted dominion. Say: O Manifestations of Names! Let not the world delude you with its vanities, nor names with their loftiness. Fear ye God and wax not proud before Him Who created you through His decisive and wondrous Word. Open your eyes that ye may know your station and Him Who created you from a drop of water. Fear ye God and forge not lies against God your Creator, nor commit unseemly acts against yourselves lest ye deprive your souls of that which hath been ordained for you by One mighty and all-knowing. Observe thou the people of the Bayan and their veils, and that to which they have clung after We commanded them to cling to naught of all that hath been created between the heavens and the earth at the time of the Manifestation. Say: If ye deny this Cause, what is your proof for believing in My previous Manifestation, Who was named 'Ali before Nabil? Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of Him by Whose command the verses were sent down in every age and through Whom God's power was manifested and His mercy encompassed the worlds. Fear God, then look with God's eye to the root of the Cause and that whereby every wise command is established. Formerly ye adduced proofs for your cause through God's verses, the Mighty, the Gracious. By God! In these days there hath been sent down the equivalent of what was sent down aforetime to the Messengers. If ye deny these, what is the difference between you and the former peoples who denied God on the day the clouds were cleft asunder and God came with His authority, and the matter was decreed by One mighty and powerful. O people! Have mercy upon yourselves and reject not the truth through what ye possess, for this indeed is a grievous wrong. Rend asunder the veils of glory through the power of My Name, the All-Conquering, the All-Encompassing. Would that ye were cognizant of the root of the Cause! By God! All that ye have heard regarding any other than Me is from Me, and none is aware of this save My all-knowing and informed Self.

And none has knowledge of this save My All-Knowing, All-Informed Self. Were ye to behold the Cause with pure and illumined eyes, ye would recognize that which ye have not known before, and would find yourselves upon a mighty steadfastness. And thou, O servant, cast aside the veils that lie behind thee, then make mention of this Cause amongst the people and fear no one. Place thy trust in God, the Mighty, the Beauteous. Arise to serve the Cause, then proclaim it among the servants, and be not of them that are patient. This is better for thee than all whereto the name of any thing can be applied, and to this doth every thing bear witness, if thou be of them that bear witness. O my God, my Lord and my Beloved! Thou knowest that I have not fallen short in propagating Thy Cause, and have revealed unto Thy servants the greatest of what they possess - a Command from Thy presence. And verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Willing. Therefore, O my God, open Thou their eyes and purify their hearts that they may recognize Thy Self and detach themselves from all else besides Thee. Verily Thou art the Lord of surpassing bounty.

To the handmaid of God, My handmaid, My handmaid! These are words at whose revelation the most distinguished among women and the most exalted among maidens would be consumed with longing. Behold the grace of God, that He should address thee with such blessed and goodly words from His Most Holy and Most Exalted Tongue. The attraction of illumined hearts and the enkindlement of sanctified souls have ever been and shall ever be from the Divine Word. This is that same Word which Moses, son of 'Imran, heard from the Divine Lote-Tree, and which the Beloved of the world hearkened unto in His night-journey, and now the Dawning-Place of utterance and the Dayspring of verses hath addressed thee in His own tongue and honored thee with these blessed words. Glory thou in the bounty and mercy of God, and say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of all worlds!

The leaf thou didst send through Mihdi - upon him be the glory of God - reached the Most Holy Court, and the glance of favor was directed towards it. Blessed art thou, for thy letter hath attained unto this glorious Presence. That which was mentioned was observed before the Throne. God willing, thou shalt at all times be enkindled with the fire of His Word and be occupied with His remembrance. However, in these days the waters of divine favor must be bestowed with wisdom upon oneself and others. This is among the divine counsels that have flowed from the Pen of Him Who causeth the dawn to break. Act thou accordingly and render thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.

This is a Day wherein all relationships are severed save for those who have turned unto the Truth and have partaken of the pure wine. Blessed is he who hath attained unto this Day, for his shall be a goodly end. Observe how many among the divines, the learned, the eloquent, and likewise among the women, remained deprived of the ocean of attainment which they sought with their very souls, while thou didst attain unto it and became vocal in the praise of the Truth. This is why it hath been revealed in the Tablets: "How many a servant hath been deprived of the Salsabil of life, and how many a handmaid hath drunk thereof and said: 'Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all beings!'"

Consider the time of the Apostle of God: at the first dawning of the Sun of Batha, all the learned ones remained deprived, and the men of letters were forbidden, while some from among the craftsmen, including shepherds and others, attained unto the recognition of that Luminary of the All-Merciful. This is the station wherein it is said: "He maketh their highest to be their lowest, and their lowest to be their highest." The cause of the deprivation of most of the servants hath been the embodiments of learning - that is, those who were known for their knowledge. Otherwise, that which such souls regarded as knowledge is, in the sight of the Hidden Name, but evident fancy and conjecture.

The essence of knowledge is the knowledge of God. Whosoever attaineth unto this is accounted among the learned in the presence of the Truth, and whosoever remaineth deprived thereof is reckoned among the most ignorant of people, even though he might be the repository of all knowledge. It hath been observed that a person who spent numbered years acquiring outward knowledge, upon hearing the Divine Word, fled as "asses fleeing from a lion," for it is indeed difficult for him to lay down his burden. However, God willing, this greatest veil hath been and shall be rent asunder by the finger of power.

Know thou the value of that which God hath bestowed upon thee, and be assured that it hath, in the presence of thy Lord, a station whereon We pronounce blessing from this glorious and mighty station. All those souls, both female and male, whom thou didst mention in thy letter, have attained unto the outpourings of the ocean of the All-Merciful's utterance. Convey to each one of them, on behalf of the Truth, greetings and glad-tidings, for they were mentioned in the Most Holy Presence and have attained unto divine favors. God willing, may ye be confirmed through divine confirmations, be vocal in His praise, and remain steadfast in His Cause. And the glory be upon thee and upon them.

In the Name of the One God

O Mahdi! God willing, thou wilt observe with divine vision the world and all that hath come to pass therein. In this Most Great Revelation there hath occurred that which hath never occurred in the world. It behooveth thee to read the blessed Surih of Ra'is, as well as the Tablets to the Kings, and what befell the Chief of Paris. The hand of divine power was manifested and seized whomsoever He willed. Nearly twenty million souls perished, and in most regions of those parts blood flowed like rivers. Do not consider the world to be limited to one tract of land. Observe what hath befallen the servants in the vast renowned lands mentioned in the Books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Whatsoever hath appeared in the earth was revealed beforehand by the Most Exalted Pen, although this Most Great Revelation hath appeared with supreme grace and mighty loving-kindness. There befell mankind that which befell them. Verily, were He to desire it, He would seize the world through a single word from His presence. He is, in truth, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

If in certain instances there be delay in the manifestation of the divine Cause, this hath been and will be due to consummate wisdom, and none hath ever comprehended divine knowledge or become aware of the consummate wisdom. He is, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

It is most strange that your honor hath not seen the divine Tablets, for had you observed them, you would have become aware of the power and might of God and would have spoken words that would convince that person and his like. Whatsoever hath occurred and shall occur in the earth hath been revealed clearly and manifestly in the divine Tablets without any interpretation. From that person's words it is evident that he hath no knowledge of the mysteries of the Cause and hath not turned to the divine Books. God willing, your honor will assist that person to refer to the divine Books, that he may not remain deprived of the ocean of divine knowledge and be not prevented from the sealed wine which hath been unsealed by the finger of the Name of the Self-Subsisting. Convey greetings from this Wronged One to him and say: Look, then mention what proofs and evidences of God thou and the people of the world possess, and what hath appeared in this Most Great Revelation from God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Is there anyone with vision to behold the signs of God in the earth? Is there anyone with power to shatter the idols of vain imaginings in the name of his Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful? The verses have been sent down and the evidences have appeared and the proof hath encompassed all who are in the realm of possibility, yet the people are in evident doubt. Say: If ye deny this Most Great Grace, by what proof can ye establish what ye possess? Be fair in God's cause and be not of those who recognized, then turned away and denied this resplendent, shining Light.

Say: Despite the power of kings and sovereigns, the arrayed ranks, the assembled armies, the continuous reports, and the fire-ships, God alone calleth out with the most exalted call and summoneth all to the supreme horizon. If any soul would reflect upon this Revelation and what hath appeared therefrom, he would assuredly speak forth and utter that which God loveth. God willing, may they be assisted and reflect upon what caused the denial of the deniers of old and what was its reason. By the life of God! Then would he behold the Path and the Balance and the appearance of the All-Merciful in the realm of possibility, and would say: Praise be unto Thee for having guided me and made me aware. I testify that Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest and in Thy grasp is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful!

The verses of creation have prevented the Pen from mentioning the verses of revelation. This is not a mere wind that bloweth, but rather the Lion of winds. Glory be to God! From every created thing are manifest and evident the signs of power. Exalted be His dominion and magnificent His might! Each of His creative works and each manifestation of His power hath been and is without equal, peer, similitude or likeness - how much more so His attributes and names, how much more His Essence! Blessed and exalted is He. True unity befitteth His threshold alone, but only if the Kingdom of His own utterance be made manifest; otherwise, God forbid that one such as I should attempt description or praise.

After offering praise and gratitude to God, exalted be His glory, and to His Prophets and chosen ones - may my spirit be a sacrifice for your presence - the elevated letter of this evanescent servant bestowed a new spirit, as the ancients have said: "He did unto me as the rain unto the meadow."

After reading and becoming acquainted with its contents, it was submitted. They stated that what was written is true and approved. We have fulfilled some obligations and, God willing, through His bounty and grace we shall fulfill the others. We beseech God, exalted be He, to strengthen, assist and support him that they may not cease in their quest and that the friends of God may attain their answer. The Light of Beauty shed its radiance, love became manifest, and from that mention it entered the arena, and from that enkindled realm came the verse "Thou shalt not know." It is He Who sent His loved ones to the place of sacrifice, and He is the Cause of the world's attraction and unity. We beseech God to confirm all, that they may be set ablaze by the fire of love kindled by the Word of God. Verily, He is powerful over all things.

Indeed, any mention that appeareth from the Dayspring of utterance will cause the elevation, exaltation and enkindlement of that soul. Therefore, we beseech God to send forth at all times that which giveth life. As for the countenance of God, He is generous - it shall be properly arranged. The remaining Tablets of Baku, along with two letters addressed to his honor, were sent and will reach the blessed presence. The answer to the mentioned letter hath been revealed, but will be sent later to be forwarded subsequently, for some of the handmaidens of God, such as the wife of the elevated and late Aqa Siyyid Abu-Talib - upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God - have submitted petitions. If her answer is not sent, she will surely be saddened, therefore that too shall be dispatched.

To his honor, my namesake - upon him be God's peace - I convey greetings and praise. May he be preserved, God willing. He too must act with wisdom, for some people are corrupt and have neither recognized nor understood the value of generosity, love, and true manliness. In all cases, one must hold fast to wisdom. Verily, He is the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful.

As for the mention of Aqa Mirza Safar 'Ali-Akbar from Tuyserkan, this servant conveys greetings to him. I beseech God to protect him and grant him sustenance from the purest fountain. Devils and demons lie in wait at their ambush points. I beseech and implore God not to deprive the seekers from their ultimate goal and highest purpose, nor prevent the pursuers from the effulgent lights of the Sun of inner meanings. Glorious is this day, and mighty is this Cause, yet the poor people remain heedless and unaware. We hope that the True Bestower will not withhold His grace and will grant that which befitteth His generosity. Verily, He is the Munificent, the All-Bountiful.

He is God, the Luminous, the All-Glorious!

These are the verses of the Book which have been sent down in the most melodious tones, and they in themselves shall be a proof unto all who dwell in the heavens and on earth. Through them hath been created the kingdom of names and attributes, and for each letter thereof hath been ordained a tongue that speaketh between earth and heaven that this is verily the Beloved amidst the Concourse on High, and the Desired One amidst the company of creation, and the Hidden One concealed in the essence of Glory in the most wondrous heights. Whoso hath known his Lord and believed in Him hath attained unto the knowledge and presence of God, and whoso hath denied Him hath descended to the lowest depths. Say: The path of justice hath been established, and none shall pass thereon save they who have ascended to the ultimate goal, while the idolaters on that Day shall be in the abyss of wrath, wailing in the nethermost depths.

Say: The heaven of names hath been rent asunder by the clouds of destiny, and from its horizon hath shone forth the Sun of eternity in the form of glory, illumining with such brilliance as no veils can obscure. O people! By the True God! The Beauty of the All-Merciful calleth out from the Sacred Kingdom unto the company of the Bayan in the most wondrous melodies, saying: O people! Do ye deny My Beauty after I have changed My garment and come unto you from the treasury of the unseen with the most perfect words? O people! It is as though I had never departed from among you, but rather journeyed for days and returned unto you with My Beauty, whose sovereignty every atom doth testify, yet ye knew Me not and denied My Cause, though by it were ye and all contingent beings created. Thereby it hath become evident that in Our former Manifestation ye knew not My Beauty, but only My garment and My robe amidst the earths and heavens. Had ye known My former Beauty, ye would have recognized it in this latter Manifestation when I revealed Myself from behind the veils. Open your eyes, then know your Lord, the All-Merciful, by His bountiful Self, and abandon names and their kingdom, for they are but garments of Our Cause which We change as We please, and We are in truth the Sovereign Who sendeth down from the heaven of grace wondrous verses. O people! Fear God and render not your works vain through the promptings of your selves and your desires. Fear the Day whereon all who dwell in the earths and heavens shall be sorely shaken. Doth it befit anyone to seek illumination from a lamp, however brilliant it may be in itself, after the rising of the Sun? Nay, by Him in Whose grasp is the reins of all things!

Follow, O people, the Manifestation of God's Self, then detach yourselves from those who have denied God and rejected His signs and were among such as followed their lusts. Say: The Ancient Beauty hath appeared and taken His seat upon the throne, and round about Him circle the dwellers of the heaven of eternity and the realities of pre-existence. Say: All names stand at the entrance of this Paradise that the breezes of the spirit might waft over them from the direction of immortality. O people! Do ye doubt God, the Creator of the heavens and earth and all that lieth between them? Do ye deny Him in Whom ye believed on the Day when the heavens were cloven asunder, and the earth was rent, and the suckling babes were separated from their mothers? And thou, O servant, keep thyself aloof from those who have denied God and His sovereignty after conclusive proofs have been sent down unto them. Arise to promote the Cause with an authority from Us and a steadfastness from Our presence, and fear not those who have strayed from the path of the Cause and were among the people of the veils. Leave all contingent things behind thee, then ascend by the power of faith unto the paradise of the All-Merciful, that thou mayest hear the call of the All-Glorious from the fire kindled in the Tree. Thus doth the Spirit teach thee at a time when He is encompassed by the wolves of polytheism from every side.

Leave the contingent world behind thee, and ascend through the power of faith unto the paradise of the All-Merciful, that thou mayest hear the call of the All-Glorious from the Fire kindled in the sacred Tree. Thus doth the Spirit teach thee at a time when the wolves of polytheism have surrounded Him from all sides. And the Glory be upon thee and upon them who are steadfast in the Cause, and upon those women who have believed in God and are of the devout.

He is God, the Ever-Living, the Most Exalted!

Move, O servant, this radiant Pen across this lustrous, snow-white Tablet, that it may recount that which the Spirit warbleth in thy heart of the melodies of the Divine Essence in this wondrous Paradise, upon this Tree of Eternity, that thereby may rejoice those honored servants in whom hath been planted the divine Tree, and upon whom hath shone the Sun of eternity, the heavenly Light, and the Ancient Manifestation. Through them have gushed forth the springs of divinity, and the Lote-Tree of concealment hath put forth leaves, and the camphor-like leaf hath yielded fruit. Through them hath the Essence of divinity been established upon the throne of eternity, and the Dove hath warbled in the sanctified Temple, and the lights of morn have dawned from the Sun of the Divine Essence in glorified form. Through them have all created things appeared and unto them do they return; through them have all contingent beings emerged and unto them do they revert. Through them hath the temple of evanescence donned the robe of immortality, and the essence of poverty been clothed in the raiment of wealth, and the epitome of lowliness in the vesture of glory.

Glorified art Thou, O my God! I know not by what means I should commemorate Thee at this moment - whether by that which speaketh within my breast, or by that which Thou inspirest in my heart, or by mentioning how Thou hast fulfilled Thy covenant concerning me and Thy servants, as Thou didst promise aforetime in Thy perspicuous Book and Thy established verses. Thou didst say - and Thy word is the sweetest, and Thy promise is the truth in the most exalted Kingdom - "God will make each of sufficient means." I testify at this moment before Thee that Thou hast fulfilled all that Thou didst promise, and performed all that Thou didst ordain, and accomplished all that Thou didst clarify, such that Thou hast made all things repositories of Thy riches and treasuries of Thy bounties, in that Thou hast acquainted them with the pathways of Thy Cause, the ways of Thy commandments, the gems of Thy wisdom, the essence of Thy knowledge, and the meanings of Thy verses. Thou hast unveiled Thy countenance from behind the veils of glory, that all might witness the lights of Beauty in the temple of Thy remembrance, in the vesture of Thy might, in the essence of Thy knowledge, in the treasury of Thy revelation, in the mine of Thy Cause, and in the repository of Thy light, whereby Thou hast made them independent of all else, sufficient beyond all else, and free from all that is in the heavens and earth, such that all servants seek Thy nearness and Thy presence, to circle round the Kaaba of Thy Being and to enter the sanctuary of Thy presence.

Yet, by Thy glory, I have not known separation from Thee that I should seek nearness and reunion with Thee, nor have I witnessed separation from Thee that I should desire union and meeting with Thee. What then can be my thought of Thee, O my God, and what can be the concern of Thy servants toward Thee, O my Beloved, for Thou art established above all things and abiding over all things? I beseech Thee, therefore, by the Sun of Thine eternity and the holy lights of Thy divine Lordship's might, to make these ones among the signs of Thy sovereign might, the fruits of the tree of Thy oneness, and the leaves of the Lote-Tree of Thy Being. Then kindle, O my God, within their hearts the lamp of Thy love, the niche of Thy favor, and the light of Thy providence, that their very hearts may be consumed with longing for Thy meeting, with love for reunion with Thee, and with desire to gaze upon Thy beauty, for no station in all creation is greater than this. May the breezes of holiness move them from the left hand of limitation to the right hand of unity, that they may be enabled to ascend unto the highest horizon beyond the pavilions of glory in the Kingdom of light and the realm of eternity, in the most great garden near the Most Exalted Vesture in the Most High Temple.

Then establish them, O my God, in the station for which Thou didst create them through themselves. Then clothe them in the robes of Thy guidance and the vesture which Thou hast woven with the hands of Thy power and the fingers of Thy might. Then inscribe, O my God, upon the tablets of their hearts with the Pen of accomplishment that which behooveth the people of divine decree. Verily, Thou doest what Thou willest, and Thou art, in truth, powerful over all things.

He is God, exalted be His glory in bounty and bestowal!

Praise be to the Ancient King Who, through the key of His Most Great Name, hath opened and taken possession of the prepared hearts of the peoples. None can resist His sovereignty, and none can prevent the manifestation of His power and might. He hath sent down the verses and made them the gate of knowledge throughout creation. Exalted be His dominion, exalted be His proof, and exalted be His testimony which hath encompassed existence, both seen and unseen. And peace and blessings be upon the Hands of His Cause, who have taken hold of the Book through His power and aided His Cause among His servants. We beseech God to strengthen them in all conditions to remain steadfast in a manner that hath caused the hearts of the heedless to tremble.

O my leaf and she who gazeth toward the horizon of My manifestation! Thy petition hath reached the Most Holy Court and attained unto His presence and meeting. We beseech God, exalted be He, to make thee so firm in holding fast to the Tree that neither winds shall move thee nor worldly events cause thee to fall, and to give thee to drink from the Kawthar of His utterance by His bounteous hand, and to ordain for thee that whereby thy mention and thy name shall endure in His Perspicuous Book. Command and judgment belong to God, the Lord of the worlds.

O my leaf! Hearken unto what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an. His exalted Word states: "Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of this world. But the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better in respect of hope." This blessed verse was revealed when the sons of the Prophet ascended to the Most Exalted Station and the All-Glorious Companion. The idolaters arose in derision and spoke words unfitting to their base desires. Thereafter, the aforementioned verse was revealed, meaning that good and righteous deeds are better and more beloved in God's sight. They failed to understand that the enduring good deeds are the verses revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance upon his heart, which shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. The idolaters supposed that since the Prophet was without heir, His Cause and His decree would perish and vanish. They were heedless that all that appeared from Him was adorned with the ornament of perpetuity and imperishable glory. And to spite the idolaters, the Surih of Kawthar was revealed, meaning that the idolaters are the ones cut off and heirless. He saith: "For he who hateth thee, he will be cut off."

God willing, that leaf shall enter and swim in the depths of the sea of oneness and detachment. This station is mighty, and thus He saith: "So patience is most fitting. And it is God Whose help is sought against that which ye assert." The highest fruit of the tree of detachment hath ever been and shall ever be patience. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto and recognized its station. I say in truth that there hath never been and shall never be any barrier against the decreed hour. Thus He saith that death shall overtake every soul, even if they be in lofty, impregnable towers. But that which is not decreed may be lifted through God's absolute Will and His pervading divine Purpose. Blessed is he who readeth what hath been sent down from the tongue of My grandeur at this moment, as a command from Me, and I am the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.

Say: O my God, my God! Thou seest one of Thy handmaidens who hath turned to the horizon of Thy manifestation, and a leaf among Thy leaves who hath held fast to the Tree of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds, by Thy Most Great Name, whereby the limbs of the nations who broke Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, who disputed Thy verses and contended with the Daysprings of Thy Cause and the Dawning-Places of Thy Revelation, were made to tremble, to change my sorrow into gladness from Thy presence and my grief into joy from Thy direction. I testify that Thou knowest what profiteth and harmeth me, and I know not what is with Thee. Ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and benefit me in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the All-Bountiful. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Most Generous.

In the Name of Him Who calls out in the midmost heart of contingent being! Praise befits the Lord of existence and the Sovereign of the invisible and visible realms, Who with the banner of "He doeth whatsoever He willeth" shone forth and appeared from the horizon of the blessed word "except." Through His word of affirmation, effacement found no way, and the darkness of the world did not prevent His Command's light from shining. With one pen He struck the ranks of the world. Neither the might of princes nor the clamor of divines prevented Him from His purpose, and He commanded all at the most great call to that which the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur'an: "Say: God! Then leave them to their vain discourses." This is that Word to which they who are immersed in the depths of oneness clung at the first turning. Blessed are they and joy be unto them. We testify that they are of the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark, from God, the Cleaver of daybreak and the Sender of winds.

O Muhammad, upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Thy letters, each one before being written and after being written, before appearing and after appearing, have attained the honor of being seen by the King of the Kingdom of Names and heard by the Lord of all humanity. We have read what was inscribed on the tablet of thy heart by the pen of love in remembrance of God, the Lord of creation. He is with thee at all times, hearing and seeing, and He is the Mighty, the All-Seeing.

O Muhammad, the sorrows of the world have encompassed from all directions. Thou hast been and art aware of the power and influence of the Supreme Pen. Without veil or covering, on the Day of Return He summoned all to the horizon of manifestation and mentioned in most eloquent utterance the cause of salvation for all creation. Neither might nor wrath nor injustice nor oppression prevented Him from His purpose or held Him back from proclaiming the Most Exalted Word. And when the light of the Cause shone forth from the horizons of hearts and the call was raised from every direction, Hadi and his like emerged like wolves from behind the veil with swords of hatred and committed that which no oppressor had ever committed. This is the Day which the Desired One of all worlds mentioned in the Surih of Luqman: "O my son! If it be but the weight of a mustard-seed and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth. Verily, God is subtle, aware."

Those souls who transformed righteousness and piety into tyranny and transgression We expelled from this city merely to protect them. In the great city they united with certain atheistic, opposing, idolatrous souls and committed that which caused the City of God to weep and the pebbles of the desert to lament. When they observed the Wronged One outwardly without helper or assistant, they therefore committed that which caused pen and tablet to pause from recording and bearing mention. In brief, the signs of the Hour have become evident and the mysteries of the Resurrection apparent. The hidden thoughts of breasts and the treachery of eyes are witnessed. Blessed is he whom neither the events of the world nor the calumnies of those who denied the Day of Judgment caused to slip.

Say: My God, my God! Thou seest those who turned away from Thee and objected to Thee without any proof from Thee or evidence from Thy presence. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance and by the splendors of the Day-Star of Thy grace and bounty to aid Thy servants to return unto Thee and to repent at the door of Thy generosity. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest through Thy word "Be" and it is.

The mentioned names have all attained unto the verses of God, and two Tablets were also revealed and sent specifically for two persons whom that person requested. If wisdom requires, bestow them, otherwise patience is preferable. Verily God is with the patient ones.

He is the One Who has dominion over all who are on earth and in heaven

Praise be sanctified beyond the comprehension and minds of all, befitting the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence of the Intended One Who, in days when darkness had encompassed the world, kindled the fire of His Cause and adorned the pavilion of His glory with the lights of His countenance. He protected the lamp of His power from the diverse winds of the world, and no clouds or veils could conceal the Sun of His Manifestation. At all times He speaks forth "The Kingdom is God's" and at the heart of contingent being He proclaims "The Sovereign has come." The events of the age and the opposition of the people of Iran did not prevent Him from His purpose nor hold Him back from His will. On His right the banner of "He doeth what He willeth" is raised, and on His left the standard of "He ordaineth what He pleaseth" is unfurled. Glorified be His greatness, exalted be His sovereignty, and triumphant be His power. There is no God but Him.

O My Afnan, O Abu'l-Hasan! Upon thee be My glory! Hearken unto the voice of the Wronged One and purify thy heart from the dust of sorrows that have befallen thee with the water of God's remembrance. Though the tribulation that has occurred is grievous, yet patience and forbearance are greater in the sight of God. He is indeed the All-Patient and has commanded His servants to observe gracious patience. We make mention of the Afnan who has ascended unto God, for whom the ocean of forgiveness surged and the rain of thy Lord's mercy, the Forgiving, the Generous, poured forth. At his ascension God adorned him with the ornament of forgiveness, as a grace from His presence - and He is the Ancient Bestower of Grace. Convey My mention to all the kindred and counsel them to patience and forbearance. Today is the day of remembrance, praise and service to the Cause. The loved ones, especially the Afnan, must occupy themselves with teaching God's Cause and exalting His Word. That which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning the Afnan shall endure as long as God's names and attributes endure. You must preserve this most exalted station, for heedless souls lie in wait in various ways to utter words that would cause people to deviate from the Straight Path and the Great Announcement. If only they knew the foundation of the Cause! Verily thy Lord knoweth and concealeth - He is the Concealer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

The world is a manifest Book which in every moment mentions and reveals its mysteries. Therefore its events do not hold back the people of insight and the companions of the Most Great Vision from what God hath willed. You must arise with the utmost joy and fragrance as befitteth. None knoweth what shall come to pass hereafter. Soon there shall appear that which will gladden thee, draw thee near, and acquaint thee with what was hidden from sight. In outward matters, the command to consult hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen; thereafter, placing thy trust in God, hold fast to it and proceed accordingly.

When thou receivest My letter and findest from it the fragrance of My loving-kindness, say: "My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me unto Thy straight path, and mention of me in Thy Most Great Prison before the faces of the world, and glory be to Thee for having revealed unto me what Thou hadst concealed from most of Thy creation. I beseech Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, by the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty and the lights of the Sun of Thy Manifestation, to ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and purify me from what beseemeth not Thy days. Then forgive me through Thy grace and generosity. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and holding fast to the cord of Thy loving-kindness. I beseech Thee to open before my face the doors of Thy mercy and blessing, and to ordain for me the good of this world and the next. Verily Thou art the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful."

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful

Praise, sanctified from the descriptions of nations, befitteth Him Who is the Ancient King, Who hath caused copper to appear from mines and mountain quarries, and through it hath provided sustenance for a multitude of creatures. Great is the power of that Sovereign Who bringeth forth wheat from rock and causeth the supreme bounty to spring forth from the earth. These things have appeared and continue to appear through the wondrous grace of His favor. For every soul a portion hath been ordained - some sow and eat, while others reap and eat without having sown. For all there is a share in the Book of our Lord. And blessings and peace be upon the Lord of nations and their Sovereign, and upon the pillars of the House and its foundation, and upon His family and companions through whom the edifice of knowledge was raised up in the contingent world and the power of God was made manifest among religions - blessings enduring forever.

Thereafter, the letters of your honor were seen, read, studied, and reviewed again. The heart was gladdened by them yet sorrowful, and the joyful eye wept, for the fragrances of grief wafted from them. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to bestow His grace, to untie the knot, to open the door of bounty, and to show the path of success and prosperity. Be not grieved. The host of the servant is resignation and prayer.

In all conditions, I beseech and implore the Blessed and Exalted Lord to refresh your honor with the rain of His mercy and grace, and to ordain for you the good of this world and the next. This matter was discussed with Aqa 'Abdu's-Samad, upon him be God's peace. He mentioned that he thought they were not in debt, but later it became known they owed considerable sums. Therefore I did not dare, for it is not my money but the people's money, and indeed he speaks truly. If Haji Muhammad's funds do not arrive, that land will lose all credibility with foreigners, just as this land has. The greatest of all things is trustworthiness and religiosity. These two have been and continue to be the cause of the trust and confidence of the servants.

In a Tablet from a few days ago, these exalted words were recorded: "Verily We came upon a verdant isle whose rivers were flowing and whose trees were intertwined. I turned to the right and beheld a countenance from among the countenances of the most exalted Paradise, standing upon a pillar of light, crying out with the most elevated call: 'I am Trustworthiness and its beauty, and the adornment of lands and their light. Blessed is he who holdeth fast unto it and recognizeth its station. Through it wealth appeareth and blessings descend.'"

What was in mind has been mentioned. Some phrases may be out of order. In any case, the purpose was that trustworthiness not be lost before others. Aqa 'Abdu's-Samad was urged, after the passing of the departed one, upon him be God's forgiveness, to send Haji Muhammad's funds. This matter too was mentioned purely for the good of all, otherwise the law of consultation is binding and all must hold fast to it and act upon it. It would also be beloved if your honor were to meet with some and consult regarding your affairs. In truth, the greatest pillar to which this servant holds fast has been and continues to be supplication to God, exalted be He. Your honor has passed many years, and now too, God willing, there is hope that the door of hope will open and that spiritual beloved will be gladdened.

I convey greetings and praise to the presence of the friends, upon them be God's peace and care, and I beseech the grace of God, exalted be His glory, for all. I send greetings to Qurratu'l-'Ayn 'Inayatu'llah and his mother. Peace, spirit and mercy be upon you and upon God's sincere servants.

In the Name of Him Who shineth forth from the Horizon of the Most Glorious!

Praise be unto the Desired One of all worlds, Who, despite the opposition of the divines, the disregard of the jurists, the might of princes, and the clamor of the men of learning, hath caused the Supreme Pen to move and, through that essential motion which hath proceeded from His prevailing and compelling Will, hath never ceased to summon all the peoples of the earth unto the court of the Lord of eternity, throughout the days and nights. He is the Omnipotent One Whom neither intimations nor doubts, neither tribulations nor hardships, have ever constrained. Before the faces of all the world He hath uttered that which hath been and will be the cause of universal salvation, and whatsoever hath befallen His loved ones hath been and shall remain the cause of the exaltation of God's Word, despite every dubious disbeliever and every remote ignorant one.

Glory be to God! Although naught hath proceeded from the Most Holy and Exalted Court save the mention of God, the spreading of His verses, the manifestation of His proofs, compassionate counsels and goodly exhortations, yet such accusations have been made. The ignorant ones of the earth have each day clung to a cord and held fast to the hem of a vain imagination, uttering that which the idolaters of old had never spoken, and perpetrating that which hath caused the Tablet and the Pen, nay the Lord of eternity Himself, to weep. Through these two ephemeral and impermanent days, they have deprived themselves of the kingdom of divine favor and the heaven of divine compassion. By God! They and all they possess are less than the wing of a gnat in the sight of God, were they but to comprehend.

The Shi'ih sect doth each day reveal its unbelief and hypocrisy before all the peoples of the earth, that the loss of those new souls who have lately arisen to revive this sect might become evident unto all the world. All the sects of the world have sought refuge and continue to seek refuge with God from this party. Were they to reflect but briefly upon the deeds and words of the idolaters of old, they would recognize themselves; however, the recompense of their deeds and the wrath of God, exalted be His glory, have deprived this group of every good thing. Say: O manifestations of vain imaginations! Those souls who are enkindled with the fire of divine love and have partaken of the living waters of immortality are detached from all else but Him. In all conditions and circumstances they behold themselves dwelling in the most exalted Paradise. These are they who have attained unto the hearing of the Call; neither did the clamor of the people of hypocrisy become a barrier nor an obstacle. With the finger of certitude they have rent asunder the veils of idle fancies.

It is clear and evident to every discerning and informed one that the company of the ignorant - meaning the divines of Persia - have each opened a shop, and love for this shop hath deprived them of both worlds. Soon shall they reach the recompense of their deeds. Among other things, their own children shall, after their fathers, curse them and seek to dissociate themselves from them. Were mention to be made of what hath been ordained as the recompense of their deeds in the presence of God, all would be overwhelmed with trepidation. Verily, He is the Concealer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

The letter from him who is denoted by H and S, son of S, upon him be the glory of God, which he wrote to thee was read before the Wronged One. Praise be to God that from him wafted the fragrance of love for the Desired One of all worlds, and from the horizon of his heart radiated the light of love. Blessed is he and joy be unto him! Whatsoever matter appeareth from God, exalted be His glory, hath been and shall forever be enduring, and the tongues of the idolaters themselves strive to exalt its mention, though they perceive it not. Consider, for instance, the robe that was bestowed - though but a short time hath elapsed, its mention hath spread abroad. And this mention is a gateway to the enduring and everlasting mention, despite every idolater who hath denied God, the Lord of all worlds, disputed His verses and rejected His proof. Say: O ignorant ones! If Pharaoh was powerless to extinguish the divine light, ye too shall be powerless. Do ye imagine that ye can prevent the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree or extinguish the flame with your breath? By God! This flame shall never be extinguished, nor shall this light ever be concealed.

O My Name! Although H and S have been afflicted with trials and the taunts of enemies in the path of the Lord of Names, yet praise be to the Beloved of all worlds that He enabled them to pen two lines of prayer whose sweetness in the estimation of the lovers and the people of the cities of rapture and longing cannot be equaled by the pleasures and riches of the world. All things testify to the transience of what they possess and the permanence of that which hath been ordained for it by the Supreme Pen.

O H before S! That which befell you in God's path hath been mentioned before the Divine Presence. Verily, He was with thee in all conditions, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. The cause and reason for the contention, disputation, denial and idolatry of the party known by the first of names was names itself, and from names was kindled the fire of hatred. Glory be to God! The most loss-laden parties in the world considered themselves the most profitable, superior and exalted of all peoples. The fruits of their deeds have become manifest, yet they understand not, and their own loss, yet they perceive not. Strange that now some of the atheists and deniers are busy forming a party similar to that party. At all times God, exalted be His glory, makes manifest the loss and hardheartedness of that party so that all may observe and discover that which befitteth true unity. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the friends in that land. We beseech God to aid them all in that which will cause the exaltation of the Word of God. Through one pure deed the world is transformed. The story of Hanzala, upon him be My glory, is well-known. The servants and handmaidens in that land must be aflame with the love of God, illumined with the light of His Cause, manifest in His sanctity, and detached from all that is unworthy.

Thou didst mention Master Hassan, upon him be the glory of God. We beseech God to aid him. Verily, We mentioned him before and mention him at this time, and We counsel him with that which beseemeth this Day and the Announcement of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. O Hassan! Give thanks unto God for having aided thee and mentioned thee in the Most Great Prison when He was in the hands of the heedless.

O Khadijih! Convey My greetings to the handmaidens of that land. We beseech God to adorn all with the ornament of the Most Great Chastity and Supreme Virtue, that the fragrance of sanctity and purity may be inhaled by the people of the cities of the earth from the handmaidens of God, and that they may cleave unto it. God, exalted be His glory, hath counseled all with perfect kindliness, mercy and compassion, and hath commanded that which beseemeth existence. Every person of insight is aware and every hearing ear doth testify. O Khadijih! Diligent effort is required for the education of women. This Wronged One commandeth that which will draw them nigh unto God. Verily, He desireth for His servants and handmaidens the good of this world and the next. He is the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below, the Lord of the seen and the unseen. The Glory rest upon thee and upon those who are with thee and My handmaidens who have turned towards the Supreme Horizon and believed in God, the Lord of the worlds.

O believer! Thy mention hath come before the Wronged One. He maketh mention of thee with this manifest remembrance. We beseech God to aid all to that which promoteth His Cause amongst His servants. Praise be to the Ancient Lord that thou hast attained unto that whereof the divines of that land remain heedless and veiled. However, preserve this most exalted station. Man must at all times reflect upon things, their agitation and stillness, their change and transformation, and their evanescence. This reflection is the cause of remembrance and preserveth him. Were the station of the souls that are steadfast, accepted and assured to be revealed unto the people of the earth, all would turn from what they possess unto what God possesseth. Perfect wisdom hath concealed it that there might be revealed that which is hidden and treasured. We make mention of thy wife. Verily she hath attained, heard and responded. We beseech God to protect her and adorn her with that which will draw her nigh unto Him, and to ordain for her that which will comfort her eyes. Verily, He is powerful over all things.

O Muhammad-Qabli! Thy name was present in the prison, therefore thou hast been honored with the mention of God. Strive that there may appear from thee and the friends of God that which shall endure throughout the kingdoms of earth and heaven. The barkers are many. Guard yourselves in the name of God, exalted be His glory. He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informing, the Omniscient, the Teacher. We beseech God to assist thee with means which will draw thee nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.

O H and S! Upon thee be My Glory! Say to those who desire to attain My presence and to enter the precincts of My might and to stand before the gate of My grandeur and to turn towards My horizon: Verily, We desired the presence of every soul who hath turned towards God, but the heedless ones prevent people from My straight and manifest path. All the mentioned souls have been honored with the favors of the Most Exalted Pen. Beseech God that He may enable all to that wherein lieth His good-pleasure. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness rest upon thee and upon those who have beheld the waves of the ocean of My utterance and the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of My wisdom, and who have attained My presence, the Mighty, the Wondrous.

O thou who hast drawn nigh! We desire to conclude the Book with mention of His Majesty the Sultan. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid him, strengthen him, and protect him from the evil of the ignorant divines who act according to their own desires and judge among people by that which God hath not ordained. Observe what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an: "Whoso judgeth not by what God hath revealed - such are the infidels." Mention was made of His Majesty the Sultan, that he hath judged with justice and hath decreed the banishment of certain evil-doers. Would that his command had been carried out! Now consider the heart of His Majesty the Sultan and the hearts of the heedless divines. The former manifesteth the utmost compassion, while these souls show forth the height of wretchedness. Were but one of those wretched ones to be seated upon the throne of judgment, what would he not do? God protect us and you from their evil, their heedlessness, their error and their wretchedness. They judge by other than what God hath revealed and perceive it not; they speak according to their desires and know it not; they utter that which causeth the denizens of earth and heaven to curse them, and yet they understand not. In any case, it is incumbent upon all to pray for His Majesty the Sultan, even though great disrespect hath been shown him by certain ignorant ones. At times perfect kindness and compassion have been manifested by him. In truth, His Majesty protected the people of Kaf from the wickedness of malicious souls. All this was ordained by One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. The heart hath ever been between two fingers of the Lord. We beseech Him to manifest through His Majesty that which shall endure throughout the kingdoms of earth and heaven. The Command is in God's hands. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. And He is the Mighty, the All-Praised.

He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!

Praise be to the One Who is worthy and deserving, Who has sanctified the world through the word "No" and guided it to the city of "Except," Who has adorned the foreheads of the believers with the seal of the blessed words "There is no God but God." This seal is inscribed in the Mother Book yet hidden from eyes and sight. The Manifestation of this divine treasure and heavenly secret was the King of Prophets and Goal of the saints - He through whom the idols of desire were shattered and traces of polytheism and transgression were erased, and through whom the light of unity shone forth among all peoples. Upon Him be the blessings of God, the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven, and upon His family and companions through whom the gate of piety was opened to all created things, through whom the throne of manifestation was established and the Dove of Utterance warbled upon the Mount: "Verily there is no God but Him, the Kind, the Forgiving."

Thereafter, the letter of that honored friend arrived. Praise be to God, the fragrance of love for the Beloved of the worlds emanated from it and the light of recognition shone from its horizon. Praise be to God that you are adorned with the ornament of health and occupied with the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory. This evanescent servant beseeches God that He may assist and enable you to serve Him. Verily He is the Hearing, the Responding One.

After being presented before Him, the Tongue of Utterance spoke thus: "Praise be to God, you have attained to that which was mentioned and recorded in the divine Books. We beseech God to assist you in preserving it. You have been and are remembered before the Wronged One. Your call was heard and your letter was seen. God willing, you will ever be assisted in that which is acceptable unto God. We have mentioned you before with a mention through which the fragrance of My loving-kindness was diffused. Give thanks unto God, your Lord and the Lord of the worlds. We beseech Him to send down upon you a blessing from His presence and to protect and guard you. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty."

The bounty of His grace is present and the table of His loving-kindness is visible. His glances of mercy and grace have ever been and continue to be directed towards His friends and those who circle round His Cause.

The honored Afnans - upon them be God's peace - have arrived and attained His presence. They mentioned what they deemed advisable regarding your affairs, and the beloved and honored Haji - upon him be God's peace - submitted a detailed account which was approved. Consultation in matters is most beloved, and acting upon it after a decision emerges has ever been and continues to be the cause of blessing and good. That spiritual friend has also been and continues to be mentioned in the presence of the Afnans - upon them be God's peace. Praise be to God, the horizons are illumined with the light of love and adorned with the light of unity and harmony, and all are resting and dwelling beneath the Lote-Tree of grace. These manifest bounties surely attract all the good things and blessings of the world.

Today, being Saturday, they sent the letter that was sent to his honor Afnan - upon him be God's peace. It was presented and He said to act according to what was deemed advisable. We beseech God to grant them good and blessing. Verily He is the Bountiful, the Generous. However, in all matters they must observe wisdom and not accept claims from any soul merely on the basis of assertion. With perfect joy and fragrance, trusting in God and committing all to Him, they should proceed.

This lowly one also beseeches blessing and bounty for you. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Giver, the Bestower, the Forgiving, the Compassionate. Peace be upon you and God's mercy and blessings.

28 Sha'ban Year of His Name, His Holiness M.H., upon Him be 9 66 \[Baha'u'llah\]

The All-Glorious

He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power

Glorified be God! With what tongue can man describe and praise the Sun of Truth? Through a single manifestation He adorned sheer nothingness with the ornament of existence and arrayed pure nonexistence with the garment of being. Glory be unto Him! Glory be unto Him! Great is His glory and all-encompassing His bounty. There is no God but Him. And peace and blessings be upon Him through Whom God's decree appeared on earth and His Cause among creation, through Whom the traces of the polytheists were effaced and the qualities of the unitarians were established, and upon the rivers that branched forth from the ocean of His utterance, namely His family and companions, through whom the sea of certitude surged amidst all possibility, and the banners of those who denied the All-Merciful were brought low, and through whom God's Cause and His decree, His remembrance and His praise were established.

Thereafter, the handwriting of that Beloved of soul and spirit was a treasure of joy and a book of gladness and mercy. Praise be to God, immediately upon its arrival the effulgence of the Name "the Loving" became manifest. In truth, the carpet of love was spread and the cushions of affection were adorned, for it was redolent with divine remembrance and indicative of the oneness of His Essence. God, exalted be His glory, and all things bear witness that mention of that Beloved hath another influence and another penetrating power. After its reading, observation and hearing, we proceeded to the Most Great Shrine where it was presented before His presence.

They said: "We beseech God for whatsoever is worthy of His grace and favor." They said: "Write: O Muhammad and those with thee! Ye are all remembered in the presence of the Wronged One. In all conditions ye must be engaged in your affairs with the utmost joy and fragrance and assurance. Relief is from God and victory is from God and their restoration is from Him. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Almighty over those in the heavens and earths. Beware lest anything among things or any matter among matters sadden you. Convey My greetings to each one. They have ever been and continue to be remembered. Verily He is the Answerer of the suppliants and the Fulfiller of the needs of the sincere ones. Praise be to God, for He is the Goal of the mystics." End quote.

Praise be to God, they have been and continue to be confirmed, and we beseech and implore the rain of His bounty from the clouds of His mercy. Verily the supplicant hath never been and shall never be deprived, for His mercy is beyond reckoning and His grace is limitless. We beseech Him to adorn this dispersion with the ornament of unity and to transform this apparent separation and remoteness into nearness and presence. With clear certainty we know He is able to do whatsoever He willeth and powerful over whatsoever He desireth. Regarding the matters about which you wrote to the beloved of the heart, His Honor Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be the Glory of God - that letter was given to this servant and was read, but in consultation certain considerations arose and were presented before His presence. Surely His Honor himself has written and will write to that beloved one. We shall see what else will appear hereafter. This servant beseecheth God, detached from all else but Him, to ordain what is best for us. Verily He hath power over what He willeth. I convey greetings to the friends of that land and the beloved ones of that region, one and all, and I beseech God, exalted be His station, for victory, blessing, loftiness and elevation for all. Verily our Lord is the Almighty, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.

Suriy-i-Hajr

(Surih of Separation)

This is the Surih of Separation. We have revealed it in truth that thereby

My affliction between earth and heaven may be made manifest.

He is the Everlasting through My name in the Kingdom of the Most High!

1\. Glorified be He Who hath torn asunder the veils of all things through His sovereignty, created the heavens through His command, poured down from the clouds of holiness the rain of fellowship, and sent forth from the realm of lights verses which cause the skin of the infidels to creep. Say: In the revelation of verses and the establishment of this Youth upon the Throne of names and attributes there are clear signs for those who testify to His unity.

2\. Say: O people! This is the Ancient Beauty and He is standing between heaven and earth weeping and crying out. If ye will not assist Him, O concourse of the earth, at least do not slay Him with the swords of misbelief, and commit not that which tarnisheth the divine Beauty. Fear God and be not sowers of dissention amongst men.

3\. Say: He, in truth, purposeth to withdraw from amongst you alone and unaccompanied by anyone save Himself. Thus hath He been from the beginning which hath no beginning until the end whose end no one in heaven and earth can reckon. Say: The Ancient Being purposeth to withdraw from both His enemies and His loved ones, whereby the infidels will rejoice and the hearts of them that have hastened unto the Repositories of sanctity will be lacerated. Say: Even though He withdraweth alone, yet the hosts of glory accompany Him, the denizens of the immortal realm and the unseen kingdom, and those who have sought refuge behind the tabernacle of nearness, the Seat of this blessed Name through which the heaven of denial hath been cleft, the earth of unbelief split open, and the clouds of bounty raised up, could ye but perceive it.

4\. Say: His helper is the sighs He uttereth, and His succorer the tears he sheddeth. My food is the fragments of My broken heart, and My drink the droplets of My blood. My companion is My fingernails, Mine associate My pen, and My mainstay reliance upon God, My Lord and the Lord all things, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. My cohorts are My wondrous accents, My consort My sweet melodies, and My mirror the radiance of My beauty, could ye but perceive it. Thereby the hearts of men have cried out, the pillars of the Throne have buckled, and the clouds of holiness have wept tears of crimson.

5\. Say: O people! Fear God, repudiate not My beauty, and be not silent. We, in truth, are self-sufficient above all who are in heaven and on earth. Unto this beareth witness My standing alone upon the earth before its kings and rulers. Thus have We issued the decree and set forth the verses that haply the people may awaken and be heedful.

6\. O Husayn! Hearken unto the call of thy Namesake, Who is sore tried upon the earth by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. He hath fallen under the spears and the swords of these malicious ones. Thereby the eyes of grandeur have wept within the tabernacle of God and the eyes of sanctity in the pavilion on high, and the eyes of reunion in the sanctuary of the Kingdom and the eyes of the denizens of heaven and earth. Thou shouldst give thanks to God for having named thee with this blessed, esteemed, and noble name. Beware lest thou allow anything to distress thee. Rather be patient and forbearing in the face of whatsoever may befall thee that thine actions may be consonant with thy name and thou mayest be of those who follow My commandments.

7\. Know that God hath accepted from thee thine obedience, and at this moment hath raised thee up in truth before Him that thou mayest gaze upon His supreme Self in His latter Beauty and be of them that have attained the presence of the All-Merciful upon the Throne of Paradise and rejoiced therein. Wherefore, We testify that thou hast beheld the Ancient Beauty and attained His presence. Through this a station in Paradise is ordained for thee which none but those who are nigh unto Him understand. Thus have We bestowed Our favor upon thee a second time that thou mayest be thankful to thy Lord and recognize the station of thy brother, who is separating with God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, whom We have singled out at Our behest. Ere long thou wilt be informed, if thou art patient.

He is the Mighty! Glorified be He Who hath sent down the verses in a holy, all-knowing tongue, and Who ruleth over all created things as He pleaseth by His command. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise. His is the bounty and grace; He loveth for whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He willeth, and verily He is powerful over all things. Verily He ruleth His creation as He pleaseth, and He is the Mighty, the Beautiful. His is the creation and the command, and unto Him return the deeds of all created things. Say: In the revelation of verses are clear proofs for those who are illumined by the lights of the Spirit. Say: He it is Who hath sent the Messengers from a beginning that hath no beginning - and this was ordained in the preserved tablets of might - and He will continue to send them unto an end that hath no end. There is none other God but Him, the Bestower, the All-Knowing. And He sent down with them decisive proofs and clear evidences, that they might command the people in the days of God with that which would guide them to the paths of holy radiance. And when their Messengers came unto them with clear proofs, among the people were those who turned away and denied the signs of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-Informed. And among them were those who remembered the remembrance of God and were of those who hastened along the paths of guidance - until the Cause reached a station whereat the minds of the wise were confounded and the feet of the mystics did slip. And 'Ali came with the truth, and with Him were clear signs, a single letter of which would suffice all who are in the heavens and the earth. He said: "O people! I am in truth the son of Muhammad, and I have come unto you from the Saba of holiness, from the direction of immortality, with a momentous announcement that was truly mighty." And He said: "O people! This is the proof of God, and this is the countenance that shall endure in truth through the eternity of God, the King, the Mighty, the Generous." And: "O people! Soon shall the earth and all that is thereon perish, and ye shall return to the court of manifest might and shall be questioned concerning what ye did to God's Messengers, and shall be requited for what ye have earned or will earn." He said: "O people! By God! Ye were created for naught else but the recognition of God's Self, the Supreme, the Mighty, and this is the purpose of your creation, were ye of those who know. And this is what God desired for His servants, and by this did He take from them their covenant in the immortal dust, were ye of those who are aware. For by God! If ye attain not unto this, nothing in all existence shall profit you, and this is a mighty truth with God." And this was inscribed in all the tablets in the time of every Prophet, and thus doth the Pen of the Command testify, and God was witness unto this. And ye recognized not the worth of those days, and ye knew not God, your Creator, in His days, and were an evil, most lost people. And ye were not content with your heedlessness of His beauty, but grew proud against Him, and were not satisfied even with that, until ye gathered against Him with the talons of hatred and suspended Him in the air and fired upon His body the bullets of mighty unbelief. And for this were ye cursed in this world and the next, and became companions of the fire. Nay! The curse of God be upon those who wronged Him without clear proof or illumined Book! Until the Cause reached these days wherein these servants expelled Us from that land which had become the refuge of the oppressors. And some among them rejoiced at this and were of those who were glad. Say: O people of the earth! Rejoice not at this, for soon shall come upon you the punishment of a barren day, and the effects of wrath shall seize you from every direction, and this shall be grievous for the unbelievers. And ye shall hear the melodies of the Dove when She soareth above you from the presence of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Then shall nothing profit you, and naught shall accompany you save God, the Mighty, the Generous. And the Spirit be upon you and upon the sincere servants.

In the Name of our Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High!

Consider the mention of thy Lord's mercy unto His servant in this Tablet. This is a Book that speaketh the truth and maketh mention of the tidings of eternity, and therein have been ordained the measures of all things which were inscribed in the Mother Book.

O servant! Bear thou witness within thyself that there is none other God but Him. He hath created creation through His bounty and grace, and hath sent the Messengers that they might summon mankind unto the shore of holiness and cause them to enter pavilions which were raised through God's power behind the canopy of the Spirit. Then did He send down the Books and ordain therein the laws, and set forth therein the pathways of truth - all this from His grace which hath ever preceded all creation - that all might traverse the paths of guidance and hasten unto the eternal paradise and occupy a seat of holiness well-pleasing unto Him.

Say: O people! Follow not those who have denied God and His signs, and who, when the verses of their Lord are recited unto them, bow their heads and turn upon their heels, mocking God and His Manifestations, remaining veiled behind the veils of their own selves. These are they upon whose hearts God hath set veils of fire, and upon whose eyes He hath placed coverings of unbelief, and upon whose hearts He hath cast barriers which were created through God's irresistible power.

Say: O people! By God, this servant hath counseled you in this Tablet, as in all that We have previously uttered. Therefore take ye counsel and be not of them who have deprived themselves of the bounty of this Day. All that ye do and perform and say shall pass away, and ye shall return unto an abode which hath been inscribed by the fingers of holiness upon tablets of ruby. And ye shall find all your deeds recorded in a Book from which not so much as a grain of mustard seed can escape - this being among the decrees which God hath ordained.

Know thou that We have read thy letter and have answered thee aforetime with an answer at which the hearts of the mystics would marvel if gathered together. And now do We answer thee with this response, that thou mayest know Our love for thee and be of them who, by God's leave, are made to pause upon the path of love at the scene of eternity. Then convey unto the people the words of thy Lord and remind them of a station which hath been outspread before God, that all might hasten with their hearts unto the shore of the Spirit and through their love render victorious the Cause of God, that they might be made triumphant through God's assistance in the land of divine knowledge. This is the word of truth, and after truth there is naught save error which hath been kindled in the hearts of the calumniators.

Know thou further that they who have uttered in thy land what they have uttered - this proceeded only from their lying tongues. We have sought no helper save God, and to this do bear witness the angels nigh unto Him in chambers of praised glory. Convey the word unto them that have believed, then teach them of that victory which is well-pleasing in God's sight - namely, their severance from all who dwell on earth and from all that can be witnessed in the realm. This is God's victory, and through it the breezes of love waft over all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thus do We impart unto thee that from which mankind hath been debarred.

Say: O concourse of earth! Aid ye God through your hearts and deeds, that God may aid you in an atmosphere wherein the breaths of the Spirit have been wafted. Know ye that God's victory is your own victory over self, whereby ye become distinguished from all else in the realm through that which proceedeth from you - this being a victory which hath been set forth in detail in the Tablet. Thereby doth tranquility descend upon you from His grace, and ye attain unto a mercy which hath been sent down from the clouds of holiness. And upon thee and upon them who circle round the Lamp, soaring on wings of victory, be glory.

O Haji Muhammad Mahdi, who hath attained Our presence and gained victory - He is the Hearer, the Answerer - this is a Book which the Wronged One hath sent down to him who hath believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, that He might transform his sorrow into joy and acquaint him with that which beseemeth him in the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. Grieve not over what hath befallen thee. There hath befallen Us that which hath caused all things to lament, as attesteth He with Whom is the perspicuous Book. I bear witness that thou hast migrated unto God and hast attained unto that which was recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We desire to console thee and comfort thee in what hath befallen thee, that thou mayest be content with what hath appeared from God's decree and destiny, and be of the patient ones. Verily thy Lord is the Concealer - all are commanded by Him - and He is the All-Patient - all are bidden to manifest beautiful patience.

In the Persian tongue, hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He, verily, will aid thee to be patient and forbearing, and will open before thy face the gates of submission and contentment. The vicissitudes of the world, its changes, and the evanescence of all things are each a manifest counselor for them that possess sight and gaze toward the Most Sublime Vision. Where are the Pharaohs of the earth and its mighty ones? Where are the tyrants of the lands and their men? Where are they who confined all matters to harming the servants? Where are they through whose tyranny the standard of justice was reversed and the people of the cities of virtue and unity did lament? Where are their current commands and their operative decrees? Where are the treasures amassed through greed and passion, in which the people of iniquity and lewdness rejoiced? God hath turned their hopes into affliction and their wealth into punishment. Where are their lofty palaces and their elevated, adorned houses? Where are they whom wealth and children occupied, keeping them from a goodly end and final outcome? God hath brought them down from palaces to graves. Take heed, O ye who possess vision!

Reflect upon the Seal of the Prophets - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake. He had five male children who ascended, whereupon the idolaters began to gloat. And when He remained without issue, they called Him - God forbid - "abtar" (cut off). Then this verse was revealed: "Verily, it is thy enemy who is cut off." At that same time this blessed verse was revealed: "Wealth and children are an adornment of the life of this world, but the things that endure, good deeds, are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better for hope." Today, whosoever hath attained unto a single word from the words of the Most Exalted Pen is independent of all that hath been limited by names. The love of children is for the sake of perpetuating one's name and mention, and this is contingent upon their being righteous, not wicked. And a good end is unknown and uncertain, and even that, according to outward appearances, hath not been and is not lasting, by virtue of the blessed words "Verily we are God's, and to Him shall we return." However, divine verses revealed in the name of any soul are immortalized in the Book - they do not change or alter, they have been and ever shall be eternal and everlasting. Praise be to God, thou hast repeatedly attained unto verses and been honored by the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me and illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee, O God of Names, by Thy Will that hath encompassed all existence both seen and unseen, and by Thy Name whereby Thou hast subdued hearts and minds, and by the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty and the splendors of the Day-Star of Thy grace, to make me content with what is with Thee, nay rather, grateful for what hath been sent down from Thy decree. By Thy might, O God of the world and Goal of the nations! I love naught but what Thou lovest and desire naught but what Thou desirest. Ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of the world to come and of this world. There is no God but Thee, the Most Mighty, the Most High.

He is the Most Holy, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise

Praise be unto Thee, O my God and the God of the throne and earth, my Sovereign and the Sovereign of the hereafter and this world, for having awakened me when I was asleep, and raised me up when I was seated, and caused me to speak when I was silent, and taught me when I was ignorant, and made me aware when I was heedless. Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of Eternity, and praise be unto Thee, O King of earth and heaven, for having shown me Thy horizon, honored me with Thy days, caused me to hear Thy verses, illumined my heart with the light of Thy love, and adorned my head with the crown of Thy knowledge. Thou art He Who, O my God, removed the veil from my face and made me know the dawning-place of Thy revelation and the treasury of the pearls of Thy knowledge, and guided me to the horizon from which shone forth the Sun of Thy beauty and appeared the Manifestation of Thy Cause and wisdom - He Whose name was inscribed by Thy Most Exalted Pen in Thy Books and Thy Scriptures and Thy Scrolls and Thy Tablets. O Lord! Thou seest me clinging to the hem of Thy bounty and holding fast to the cord of Thy generosity. I am the needy one who hastened to the ocean of Thy riches, the poor one who drew near to the horizon of Thy gifts, the stranger who sought his supreme home in the precincts of Thy most great mercy. O Lord! Withhold not from him the effulgences of the lights of the sun of Thy grace, and deprive him not of the outpourings of the clouds of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy gifts. O Lord! Thou seest that mine eyes have been awaiting the wonders of Thy generosity and my hands have been raised toward the heaven of Thy favors. I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of the kingdoms of names and Ruler of the kingdom of decree, to confirm me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with, and ordain for me that whereby my remembrance may endure throughout the eternity of Thy most exalted kingdom and Thy most sublime dominion. By Thy glory, O Lord of the world and Beloved of nations and the Manifest One with the Most Great Name! If Thou confirmest me not in Thy remembrance and praise and in immersion in the ocean of Thy good-pleasure, the hands of those near unto Thee and the sincere ones will not cling to the hem of the robe of Thy generosity that Thou mayest decree for me what I have desired through Thy bounty and write down what I have asked through Thy grace and generosity. By Thy glory, O Beloved of the world and Goal of nations! I am a supplicant who will not return disappointed from Thy door, and a seeker who will not turn back dejected. Thou seest, O my God, that I am cleaving to Thy door and knocking upon it, hoping for Thy ancient grace and Thy wondrous bounty and Thy all-encompassing generosity. O Lord! This is a day wherein Thy sovereignty hath appeared and Thy power hath prevailed and the banners of Thy Name have been raised in Thy lands and the standards of Thy remembrance in Thy kingdom. Ordain for every one who hath turned to the river of Thy mercy the reward of him who hath attained unto the visitation of Thy countenance and entered the White Spot and supreme Paradise by Thy leave and will. O Lord! The days which Thou hadst ordained fasting for Thy servants have ended and the Days of Ridvan which Thou hadst made a festival for the people of Thy realm have drawn nigh. I beseech Thee, O my Goal and the Goal of them who are near unto Thee, and my Beloved and the Beloved of the sincere ones, to open before the faces of Thy servants the gates of good things. Verily Thou art the Revealer of verses and the Lord of earth and heaven. O Lord! I have turned my face toward the splendors of the lights of Thy face and my heart toward Thy most exalted station and most glorious prospect which hath been named the Most Great Prison in Thy crimson Tablet. I beseech Thee to preserve me from the tyrannous ones among Thy servants who have turned away from Thy beauty and denied Thy signs. Then cause me to drink, at all times, the wine of life through Thy bountiful hand, lest the affairs of men occupy me from turning toward Thee and the ornaments of the world from facing Thy horizon. I am he who, O my God, hath desired in all conditions Thy pardon and Thy good-pleasure and tranquility beneath the shade of the Tree of Thy Cause and submissiveness at the manifestations of the lights of Thy power. Verily Thou art the Almighty to Whose sovereignty every possessor of a heart hath testified and every possessor of a tongue to Whose power and greatness. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Bestower, the Generous, the Bountiful.

He is the Mighty! We remember the veiled ones of the City in a land that is sanctified from nearness to anyone and purified from union with any soul, and in remoteness and separation has reached such a state that the hands of the hopeful and feet of the seekers fall short of reaching it. Although for those ascending to the heaven of nearness and rising to the atmosphere of love, no distance proves far and no barrier becomes an obstacle, for though the earthly path may be distant, the heart's path is nearer than the jugular vein. This is the path of God, the Mighty, the Beloved.

In any case, these days we reside in Adrianople. Although it is a great city and vast country, yet the heart finds no rest or tranquility due to separation from friends, and the heart's agitation has made all affairs agitated and scattered. In any case, O friends and companions, do not forget these emigrants and captives. The clouds of divine destiny and the mists of heavenly decree have risen from every direction, and the rains of tribulations and calamities have poured down in such measure that neither can the eye find relief in weeping to comfort withered hearts, nor can the tongue find strength in lamentation to provide solace. Each day we passed over a mountain and arrived at another mountain and hill. We traversed a hundred thousand deserts and crossed a hundred thousand mountains. How many unseen things were seen and how many unheard matters were heard. We never heard of such glorious captivity nor saw such mighty abasement. Outwardly we were in the utmost glory, majesty and sovereignty, although we were afflicted among enemies. The power and ascendancy of the true Sovereign was evident in this journey. After traversing all these aforementioned stages, we reached the sea. Glory be to God! What transpired and occurred with the waves of the sea, the various winds, and these small children! Until by the aid of the Most Great Sea we crossed the Lesser Sea and arrived at the seashore which is the city of Constantinople. From there we took a carriage to the residence assigned by the government. We remained four months in that unillumined city and left there the fruit of the divine Tree and the leaf of the heavenly Lote-Tree. From there like captives we arrived in another city named Adrianople. Forty days of captivity had been heard of, but six months had never been heard of. Throughout this period several children were sick and ill until we found residence beyond Qaf. And now strange and alone, without companion or friend, without associate or helper, in this dark city we pass these transient days. This is the detailed account of our affairs. Now whoever has a true eye should weep, and whoever has opened the spiritual ear should hear the moaning and lamentation, for the metaphorical eye is not worthy of this weeping nor is the physical ear worthy of this hearing. All this was decreed for Us by God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. We thank Him in all this and praise Him for all of this and for all that was ordained from His presence, and We shall be, God willing, among the patient ones. O dear sister without expression, if you send a letter, send it detailed and extensive like this blessed letter, otherwise even that one word will remain in mouth and tongue. Why do you leave the poor helpless one without shelter and home and send him on a distant journey? Thus does He teach you with truth that you may be among the doers. And praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.

In the Name of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful! This is a Book from Us to him for whom God hath ordained a lofty and glorious station, that he may hearken unto that which the Tongue of Grandeur doth speak from the direction of a mighty Throne, and act according to that which the Spirit teacheth him of the verses of his Lord, and be among the God-fearing in this Cause. Say: Knowledge is within Our grasp; We bestow it upon whomsoever We wish among Our servants, and verily We have power over all things. Whoso feareth God, him shall We teach of the wonders of His knowledge, for He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He pleaseth, and He encompasseth all things. Verily, the highest of all knowledge is His recognition and the recognition of His Manifestations on the Day when He appeared in truth with manifest sovereignty. Say: Knowledge is a light We cast into the heart of whomsoever We wish - thus was it sent down aforetime from the presence of the Mighty, the Wise. Apart from this knowledge, that which profiteth men not are mere words that breed naught but heedlessness and pride. Say: O people! Fear God and be not veiled by your learning from Him Who, should He wish, could expound from a single Point the knowledge of what hath been and what shall be, and what lieth concealed behind the pavilions of glory. Beware lest ye approach Him with your learning, for in these days nothing shall profit you, even if ye should come with all the knowledge of earth combined. Say: O people! Purify your hearts from the allusions of men, then turn with radiant hearts to the treasury of knowledge. And thou, O thou who gazeth toward the direction of the Cause, hearken unto the call of this Prisoner from this horizon which shineth with truth resplendent, that the words of thy Lord may draw thee nigh unto a glorious and holy seat. Know thou that from every verse of thy Lord there waft the breezes of life upon all created things, whereby the dead are raised from the graves of allusions and advance with great lights toward the seat of holiness. Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee that they may draw thee to a mighty and glorious kingdom. Arise to serve the Cause of God and to praise Him, then guide the people to this Paradise wherein hath been established the throne of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, round which circle the hosts of revelation with wondrous standards. Tarry not within thyself, neither be silent. Deliver unto the people this Great Announcement which hath been inscribed in all the Tablets by the Pen of God. Say: He it is Who sent down the Bayan unto Himself, and He is the Beloved enshrined within the heart of Baha. He hath come unto you from the horizon of the Cause with manifest signs. O people! Fear God and spread not corruption in the land after its reformation, and be not among those who tarry about the Path. Pass by it in the name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most High, and be not among the doubtful concerning this Cause which hath appeared in truth with mighty sovereignty. That the servants of God should gather together upon the law of His Cause is better for thee than all that is on earth. Say: O people! Unite in the Cause of God, then drink from this Salsabil which floweth in truth from the direction of the throne of your Lord, the All-Merciful, in this Paradise which shineth in truth with the lights of beauty. Convey Our greetings unto the faces of them that have believed in God and His signs, on whose countenances can be seen the radiance of a glorious name. Thus have We commanded thee in truth. Act thou according to that which thou hast been commanded, and fear not any overbearing doubter. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon thy kindred and upon those who have burned away the veils of self and desire through the heat of their love for their Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High, and who have severed themselves from every remote idolater.

Here is the text translated from Arabic/Persian into English:

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious

This is a Book from Us to him who turned to God and detached himself from all else - verily he is among those who have attained the presence of God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Wise, and who circled the Spot of God until he entered therein by His leave and appeared before the Throne with evident humility. Blinded were the eyes of those who prevented the servants from entering the precincts of their Lord's mercy, the Forgiving, the Generous. And whenever he desired to attain the presence, the eyes of those who denied God were blinded and prevented His loved ones from turning to His shining and radiant Face.

O Muhammad! Hear the call of God from the direction of His Most Glorious Name, then consider the leaders of the Qur'an who denied the verses of God, the Mighty, the Wise. They attribute themselves to Muhammad the Messenger of God while He weeps and laments, yet they understand not. They oppose His very Being and slay Him unjustly, while in His Name they glory, unaware. Say: He calls you from the Supreme Horizon saying: "O people! This is He of Whom We gave you tidings, and verily this is the Beloved of the worlds. This is He but for Whom I would not have revealed Myself nor sent down the Qur'an and the Gospel. Fear God and follow not those who call you to vain desires. This truly is the Most Glorious Horizon - turn to it from near and far. Beware lest you violate the sanctity of God among you. Cast away what you possess and take what you are given from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Wise."

O Muhammad! Blessed art thou for having heard the melodies of thy Lord and attained His presence after the Ancient Beauty was imprisoned in the Most Great Prison. At this, every atom bears witness that thou art among the triumphant. Recount to My loved ones what thou hast seen, known and understood, lest tribulations prevent them from the Lord of Names. Thus does the Youth command thee from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Praiseworthy.

We counsel thee and Our loved ones to fear God and to detach from all else but Him, that there may appear from them that which will attract the hearts of the world. This is the path of thy Lord between the heavens and the earths. Give thanks to God for having entered a place which He made the circling-point of the angels of the near ones, and for entering the Spot of God by Our leave and departing by Our command. Verily thy Lord does what He wills and ordains what He desires. Grieve not at departing, but ask God to make thee a destroyer of the edifices of Gog, for this is the greatest of deeds in the sight of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High - though the people know it not. Leave the outward edifices - We mean the edifices of hearts. Thus does thy Lord, the All-Knowing, teach thee.

Say: O people! Spread not corruption in the earth nor follow every obstinate tyrant. It behooves My loved ones to call the people to their Merciful Lord with wisdom and utterance. Disputation has been forbidden in this mighty and glorious Revelation. The people have been prevented by veils of their own making - had they but known, they would have cast away what they possess and turned to the direction of God, wherein the Ancient Beauty has shone forth with manifest sovereignty. Thy Lord desires not the harm of anyone - verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful - and He desires that all on earth should enter His holy and mighty and resplendent kingdom. Look not at those who wronged My loved ones - they are heedless. Had they known, they would have sacrificed themselves in My path. Soon will come a day when they shall bite their fingers in remorse and weep for themselves. Thus has the matter been decreed from the presence of One Mighty, Ancient.

Convey My greetings to the faces of My loved ones and say: Blessed are ye for having recognized Me and stood firm in a Cause at which the feet of those who deemed themselves virtuous have slipped. Know ye that they are among the corrupt ones, to which the bearers of the mighty Throne bear witness. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious! This is a Book from Us to him who has surpassed all others in the service of God, his Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, and who has arisen to serve his Lord in a manner befitting Him. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. Sorrow not over anything, for by My Self, the Truth, thou art with Us in the kingdom of earth and heaven. Can anything be hidden from His knowledge? Nay, by His Self, the One Who dominates all that was and shall be. Our trusted servant has appeared before Our presence and mentioned what thou didst desire in thy love for thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved. We beseech God to assist thee in all conditions and aid thee in serving His Cause. He, verily, is the Witness of all deeds and transcendent above all that is witnessed.

After Sin along with all tablets and materials met with trials, then through divine assistance safely reached the seat of the throne, and when the petitions of the people all fell into the hands of untrustworthy souls and some were lost and did not reach the Most Holy Court, yet that which pertained to your honor arrived safe and sound at the seat of the Cause. This is from God's bounty to you.

Regarding the aforementioned matter, His Honor the Name of God, the Mahdi, has written the details, and regarding the land matter, the details were conveyed to Amin. He mentions that at first the intention was for it to be kept in utmost secrecy, but later some of the servants made it public, therefore Amin himself was instructed to keep it in complete secrecy. He will mention it to your honor. A special Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will for Aqa Siyyid Muhammad-Rida and was sent. They must act according to the conditions mentioned therein. Review whatever Tablets reach that land and then deliver them. And regarding certain Tablets containing certain mentions, We commanded the Greater Branch - they were written repeatedly and sent to certain places. It would be appreciated if a copy of the Tablet of Aqa Siyyid Muhammad-Rida could be sent to the land of Kha and Nun.

We beseech God to ordain for thee that which shall gladden the eyes of creation. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. And may He make thee a banner of the mention of His name amongst His servants. Thus do We show thee at this hour. Give thanks unto thy Lord for having enabled thee to serve His Cause and ordained for thee that which none knoweth save His all-knowing Self. We beseech Him to send down upon thee from the heaven of His bounty that which shall increase thy love and steadfastness at all times in the Cause of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. He, verily, is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth.

I am seated and the servant present before Me is before his Lord's face, writing what descends from the heaven of Command on this night from whose horizon hath shone forth the Sun of Certitude. Can anything grieve thee after We have given thee to drink of the choice sealed wine and singled thee out for Our mention among the worlds? By My life! Thy head hath been adorned with the crown of thy Lord's love, the Most High, the Most Great. The denizens of the highest Paradise behold it and send their blessings upon thee. Thy Lord, verily, is the Witness unto all things. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Say: O my God! Praise be unto Thee for having mentioned me in Thy Tablets and made me turn to Thy will, and become effaced before Thy good-pleasure, and a servant of Thy Cause, and one who speaks Thy praise amongst Thy servants, and one who seeks protection in Thy custody and shelter in Thy presence. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which all things spoke and the sun of power and might shone forth from the horizon of Thy will, to behold me at all times with the glances of Thy mercy, then send down from the heaven of Thy grace that which will make me soar in the atmosphere of my love and yearning for Thee. Thou art verily the Almighty, the Transcendent, the Single, the Mighty, the All-Wise.

In the Name of Him Who is the All-Powerful over whatsoever He willeth!

This is a Book sent down in truth, wherein is mentioned that which causeth the Face of the Cause to shine forth between earth and heaven. Say: Verily it is the Exposition of God unto all who dwell in the realm of possibility. From its horizon hath shone forth the Sun of Utterance, and there hath been inscribed upon it by the Pen of the All-Merciful: "The Prison," for the Manifestation of your Lord's Cause, the Mighty, the Bountiful.

O thou who art of the kindred! Hearken unto that which is spoken by the Tongue of Grandeur and Glory, that the mention of thy Lord may draw thee to a station wherein sorrows shall not overtake thee. Through thee have We manifested the Cause in such wise that hearts were confounded and eyes were blinded. Know thou that when We desired to create that which was new, We brought it forth alone and spoke unto it a word whereat its very foundations trembled before the Face, in such wise that it was nigh unto swooning away. We preserved it through Our sovereignty, then did We proceed with its creation until We had created it and breathed into it the spirit of might and power, such that were We to command it, it would subdue all who are in the heavens and on earth. Verily thy Lord is the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing.

When its creation was completed through thy Lord's Word, and it was fashioned by the breath of Revelation, it smiled before the Face and turned toward the place of sacrifice with power and sovereignty, advancing in such wise that the Concourse on High and the dwellers in the Cities of Names were stirred thereby. Thereupon the call was raised from the direction of grandeur: "Blessed be the All-Glorious Who hath created whatsoever He willeth! Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing."

Would that thou hadst been present before the Throne when the Tongue of Power conversed with him in such wise as caused spirits to take flight! When We showed unto him the Kingdom of the Cause and shone upon him from the Dayspring of Revelation, he was illumined by the lights of that effulgence. Such rapture seized him that he soared on the wings of detachment to aid thy Lord, the Creator of all things. Through him were gladdened the eyes of victory and adorned was the temple of the Cause. Exalted be this station, the mention of which no Tablets can bear and before which all pens fall powerless!

Dost thou imagine that he is dead? Nay, by Him Who revealeth the verses! Through him hath the Spirit of Life stirred within the heart of all creation. Know ye this, O ye who are endued with insight! He is in the All-Highest Horizon and the Most Glorious Companion, calling the peoples of creation unto God, the Mighty, the Help in Peril. Dost thou reckon him as one among the servants? Nay, by the Lord of all existence! Through him have all tribes been seized with earthquakes, the pillars of tyranny have trembled, and the countenance of victory hath shone forth from the horizon of power. Can names attain unto him? Nay, by their Lord! He hath ascended unto a station beyond all mention. Through him have We caused the Cry to be raised once again, in such wise that the very rock hath proclaimed: "The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling!"

Thus have We adorned the heaven of utterance with the sun of the steadfastness of Our name, the Wondrous, and the heaven of power with that star which shineth forth from the horizon of all regions. The Most Exalted Pen then addresseth him from the direction of his All-Glorious Lord: Upon thee be the remembrance of God and His praise, and the praise of the people of the Realm of Might, and the praise of the people of the Kingdom, and the praise of all things at all times.

God hath ordained for every soul to turn his face toward the direction of the Letter Ta and to speak that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken. Thus hath the matter been decreed by thy Lord, the Knower of the hidden and the manifest. If aught hath been lacking in thy service unto Him, overlook it and be content. Thus doth the Sovereign of the Cause command thee. He is verily the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

We have prescribed for every son the service of his father. Thus have We ordained the matter in the Book. Be thou steadfast in the Cause under all conditions, in such wise that the cawing of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of Lords, shall not deter thee. Thou seest the idolaters as naught but earthworms, and their clamor as but the buzzing of flies. Can any thing withstand His Cause? Nay, by My true Self! Yet the people are in doubt and misgiving.

Illumine faces with the sun of thy Lord's remembrance and hearts with the light of His countenance that shineth upon all regions. The glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and upon those who have turned unto God on the Day of the Mutual Summons.

Praise be to God Who hath illumined the world through the light that shone forth from the horizon of His Most Great Name, whereupon the nations were shaken - among them were those who died and returned to nothingness, those who fell thunderstruck upon the dusty earth, and those whom the light drew unto the Supreme Horizon, the Blessed Spot wherein the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary proclaimeth that there is none other God but the Lord of the First and the Last. And praise be to God Who hath adorned all things with the ornament of the Point appearing beneath the letter B and hath composed them with the letter H, whereupon the Dove cooed and the Cock of Paradise crowed and the Dove of Utterance warbled upon the branch of eternity that there is none other God but Him, and that He is verily the Hidden Treasure and the Concealed Name whereby the Sacred Texts and Tablets have been adorned, and He is verily the Fire of God unto whoso turneth away and transgresseth, and the Light of God unto whoso draweth nigh and is guided, and through Him God distinguisheth between the righteous and the wicked, and through Him the Hands of Bounty have circulated the Kawthar of immortality. Blessed is he who casteth away vain desire and drinketh therefrom in the name of his Lord, the Most Glorious, and woe unto him who denieth and disbelieveth in God, the Lord of Names and Creator of earth and heaven.

Thereafter, the servant received your letter which was adorned with the remembrance and praise of God, and perfumed with the fragrance that wafted from the garment of your sincerity towards His sovereignty and presence. We beseech God to draw you near unto Him at all times and cause you to speak that which will attract the followers of all religions. He is verily the Omnipotent, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Helper.

Your letter was received. Praise be to God, the fragrance of love for the Beloved of the worlds emanated therefrom, and what was mentioned concerning the acceptance, harmony and unity of the friends brought the utmost joy, for today all have been created for the knowledge of God and unity and harmony in His Cause. Blessed are they, for theirs is a goodly return. And concerning the tribulations that were mentioned, though outwardly they caused grief and sorrow, yet as they were borne for the sake of God, they were and shall ever be light upon light. The world is transient, as is evident in its constant change and transformation, and this very change is a tablet whereon its evanescence hath been inscribed by the Pen of Power. O blessed are they who possess insight! Ere long shall the carpet of tyranny be rolled up as it was before, and the carpet bearing the fruits of the deeds of the sincere ones shall be spread forth. By the life of God! Were this station to be elaborated, all the hearts of the people of the world would circle round the loved ones circling round the Truth. We beseech God to open the eyes and cause them to be gladdened by beholding that which hath dawned, shone forth, gleamed and flashed from the Horizon of which the Sovereign of horizons was to all creation.

O spiritual brother! The heedless and ignorant have been prevented from the immortal divine Kingdom. The spiritual physicians must, through measures of wisdom and utterance, educate them and, with the utmost love and kindness, give them to drink of the Kawthar of inner meanings. This Kawthar appeareth with different manifestations in every station - in one station it is wine, a delight to those who drink; in another station it is milk whose taste changeth not; in another station it is water that never becomes stale; and in another station it is purified honey. These four stations were revealed aforetime, but from the Pen of our Lord, the Most Glorious, they have been revealed according to the number of the Greatest Name. Glad tidings to them that drink! Blessed are they that drink! Happy are they that drink!

And regarding what had been written about turning towards the land of Za \[Yazd\], associating with the friends of that land, and inviting certain capable souls to the divine direction - this matter was and is most pleasing. Blessed is thy heart for having intended to serve God, blessed are thy feet for having hastened to the land of Za to teach God's Cause, blessed is thy tongue for having spoken in remembrance of God, and blessed is thy face for having turned toward the loved ones purely for the sake of God. And blessed are those souls who have drunk from the Kawthar of love and recognition and turned toward the horizon of the All-Merciful. Some who have taken gods for themselves other than God have not been and are not aware of the foundation of the Cause, and through the vain imaginings of heedless souls remain afflicted and bewildered in the valley of error. If they were to become aware of the detailed circumstances of the one whom they have taken as their object of worship, by the Sun of the horizon of sanctity, they would flee a hundred thousand leagues and cry out "Would that I had not taken so and so as a friend!" and raise their voices in lamentation. Beseech ye God that He may, God willing, quicken all the dead through the living waters of knowledge and utterance in this Day which is the Lord of Days. Blessed are those souls who, through mention of thee, have shattered the idol of fancy with the arm of certitude and have joined themselves to the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Upon them be the glory of God and His mercy. God willing, may they remain firm and steadfast, for most people are observed to be like dried delicate leaves, moved by every wind. Where are the pure hearts? Where are the attentive ears? Where are the penetrating eyes? For if today a soul were to reflect upon that which hath appeared from the Dayspring of God's Command, he would observe all the world to be as nothing and would hold fast to the Most Firm Handle in such wise that none would be able to detach him.

As to what was written about certain friends considering the recent disturbance in that land to have been caused by thy presence - thy presence was never the cause of that disturbance; rather, it was caused by something else. Our Lord, the Powerful, the Manifest, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, beareth witness to this. All the people of that land among the friends of God should rejoice in thy deeds. The names of the souls and handmaidens who accepted the Faith, which were mentioned in thy letter, were presented at the Most Holy Court. Blessed are they, inasmuch as their names were mentioned in the Spot which God hath made the Seat of His Throne, the Dawning-Place of His Revelation, and the Dayspring of His Manifestation and sovereignty amongst all worlds. All have attained divine favors, for there is nothing greater than for a soul to be mentioned before the Throne. Were they to become aware of the greatness and nobility of this station, they would surely perish from joy and delight. A Tablet hath been revealed from the heaven of divine Will specifically for all the friends of that land, and through a bounty the oppressed ones of that land have been honored in that Tablet with that which, by God, nothing in creation can equal. We thank our Lord, the All-Merciful, for the gift which hath appeared and shone forth from the horizon of His grace, the All-Encompassing, the Mighty, the Wondrous.

As to your question concerning the ascendancy of the Cause of God, verily it hath an appointed time in the Book of God. However, these days have been and are more excellent, inasmuch as the tyranny of the oppressors and the denial of the divines and the objections and protests of the ignorant serve as a sieve - that which is pure enters in while impurities are prevented from entry. We must appreciate the value of these days. The love, fellowship and spiritual knowledge of these days possess another sweetness and another spirit. In the days of the ascendancy of the Cause and its outward dominion, every rejected soul will claim belief, even as is witnessed in these days when the fragrance of glory hath wafted over certain lands and some of the deceitful and dishonest have claimed love and faith while acting upon their selfish desires and speaking thereof, to such extent that they have regarded the divine commandments as child's play and have spoken that which God hath not permitted. We beseech God to assist all to do that which He loveth and which pleaseth Him. All must observe and act according to that which hath been revealed in the divine Tablets. Whosoever speaketh contrary to this is not of the Truth. He is quit of those who spread corruption in the earth and who consume the wealth of the people and who commit that which hath been forbidden in the Scriptures and Tablets. However, you must not be saddened by the abasement of these days. This very abasement shall become glory. Soon will the Cause of God prevail over all. None can frustrate His Purpose and none can prevent His Judgment. He doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty and ordaineth what He pleaseth through His power. Were one to observe carefully today, he would perceive the Sun of the Cause at its zenith, despite all rulers being opposed, all divines turning away, all kings outwardly united against it, all news flowing continuously by land and sea, and all ranks arrayed in opposition. Yet God, exalted be His glory, though alone in the Most Great Prison, hath manifested Himself in such wise as cannot be surpassed. Exalted, exalted be His dominion! Exalted, exalted be His power! Exalted, exalted be His grandeur! Had the friends of God acted in accordance with that which they were commanded, you would now witness most lands adorned with the banners of faith and recognition. We beseech God to assist His loved ones to accomplish that which they have been commanded.

As to what you had written regarding whether sacrificing one's life in the love of God is more beloved than teaching His Cause with wisdom and utterance - by the life of God, the latter is better. For after the martyrdom of Badi' - upon him be all the most glorious glory - all were commanded to exercise wisdom. Those like yourself must engage in teaching the Cause with the utmost wisdom, that perchance those who have strayed may find the divine path of truth and attain to the holy station of nearness, which is the goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Martyrdom in the path of the Beloved is considered among the most excellent of deeds - in truth it has had and will have no peer or likeness. However, if it should occur of itself, it is beloved. All matters depend upon acceptance by the Truth, and the Truth has commanded all to exercise wisdom. If one acts with wisdom and no corruption or reprehensible deeds that would harm the Cause of God issue from him, and then he drinks the cup of martyrdom through the arising of tribulation - this station has been and is the most exalted of stations, and in truth this station is the king of stations. Neither can utterance describe it nor the pen record it. It is strange that certain souls become disturbed and shaken at such times. The essential thing is that one should act according to what God has commanded. After attaining to this station, whatever occurs has been and will be beloved. You and all the friends must hold fast to the cord of wisdom in all conditions, for most are weak - at the mere rising of clamor they are seen to become disturbed, fearful and veiled. "His mercy hath preceded all created things."

As to what you wrote concerning the poetry of Shaykh Baha'i, this servant testifies that the mysteries now revealed between heaven and earth, which you have come to know, were not known or understood by a hundred thousand like the late Shaykh and far beyond that number. As you have observed, what imaginings the eminent divines have embodied regarding the appearance of the Qa'im, and how many delicate pages they have blackened with the mention of vain conjectures that neither nourish nor profit! They have written numerous books about this matter yet have not understood a single word of it. Strange that some among the people of the Bayan, like the owl that dwells in the land of Qaf, are still veiled by the utterances of old imaginings and dwell in the grave of ignorance and unknowing. They must engage in teaching the Cause with perfect joy and fragrance, wisdom and utterance, as indeed praise be to God they have done. Know this much: your turning toward the land of Za and your mention there have been accepted before the Throne. This suffices you, by the Lord of the worlds. Strive that the loved ones of God may act and speak in accordance with praiseworthy character, goodly deeds and pure words. I beseech the True One, exalted be His grandeur, to assist you in all conditions. You are among those souls who have been and are mentioned before the Throne, and a Tablet has been sent down from the heaven of favor specifically for you, and likewise a Tablet specifically for the honored mother - upon her be the glory of God. God willing, they will attain to visiting them.

As to what was written about the hardship of the loved ones of God - yes, the entire world and especially the right and the loved ones of the right have been created for this, and this is a matter to which all the Messengers and all the Books bear witness. Nevertheless, the heedless and ignorant people have, through manifest tyranny, imprisoned the Self of Truth in this mighty fortress. Assuredly, in this imprisonment and in the appearance of hardship and tribulations lie hidden the consummate divine wisdom. All divine favors, celestial powers, and lordly riches are directed towards the loved ones of God, though due to the absence of outward means they have not yet been made manifest. Soon they shall be made manifest. In the blessed and exalted Tablets that have been sent down from the heaven of the Lord's Will, the cause and reason for the straitened circumstances of the loved ones have been mentioned, therefore there is no need for this servant to elaborate. However, this much I will say: the good of all lies in this poverty and hardship. If the loved ones were to become aware of what has been ordained especially for them, by God, they would pay no attention to the world and its hardships, intensity, and tribulations. It is but a passing shadow; its carpet shall be rolled up, and there shall remain what God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, has ordained for them. And this outward hardship shall, God willing, be transformed into ease, and severe tribulation into tranquility. Verily, He is the Ordainer, the All-Knowing.

Convey greetings from this evanescent servant to all the loved ones of God and say: Today is the day wherein you must, with the utmost joy and gladness, and in spite of all the world, drink repeatedly from the cups of the love of the Ancient King and be occupied with the remembrance of God. Know ye the value of these days, and like the nightingales of the garden of inner meanings, sing with perfect yearning and longing in this divine springtime. And in every gathering and assembly where the divine mention is circulated, forget not this evanescent servant. The glory be upon you and upon the loved ones of God in that place.

He is God, exalted be His glory, wisdom and utterance!

O Name of Bounty, upon thee be My Baha! The letter of Ali Haydar, upon him be My Baha, was mentioned by this servant before the Wronged One and attained the honor of being heard. We beseech God to confirm him in mentioning, praising and serving the Cause. He had mentioned A.B., upon him be My Baha. Some time ago, a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed for him from the heaven of favor; now it has been sent. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist him, confirm him, and ordain for him the good of this world and the next. Say: O My loved ones, honor his dwelling place. This is what We commanded you before and at this time. The friends in that land must invite the people of the contingent world to the horizon of the All-Merciful with the utmost joy and fragrance. Whosoever attains to teaching is recorded among the near ones in God's Book. Be not grieved by the events of the days and the hatred and animosity of the deniers and those who turn away. Soon the effulgences of the light of the Day-Star of Manifestation will encompass all, and the station of the friends will become evident and manifest to all the worlds. The honored Ghayn who attained to the presence and another who arrived there have ever been and continue to be remembered in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and are recipients of God's grace and adorned with love. That which hath no peer or likeness hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen concerning them. Haydar-Qabli-Ali, upon him be My Baha, mentioned them repeatedly. We send Our greetings upon them both and We have honored them with a third one who is in Shin. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to make them banners of His remembrance among His servants and to assist them with that whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds, may be exalted.

O Ali Haydar, convey My greetings to the friends of that land. By the life of God! All are remembered in the nights and days. The Most Exalted Pen is moved to mention them and speaketh. At the end of this Tablet We make mention of the Deputy and give him glad tidings of God's grace, the Forgiving, the Generous. We beseech God to confirm all in assisting the Cause. In numerous Tablets We have forbidden the servants from conflict and contention and from that which is blameworthy, and have commanded that which is praiseworthy. They must arise to assist the Cause with the hosts of goodly character. We beseech God to confirm them, assist them and enable them to do that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His word "Be" and it is.

Thou didst mention Shaykh Abdul-Husayn, upon him be My Baha. O Abdul-Husayn! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He calleth thee and maketh mention of thee from this station which hath been named with the Most Beautiful Names in the Book of God, the Powerful, the Mighty. Verily He desireth him who hath desired Him and mentioneth him who hath mentioned Him. This is outwardly and inwardly. My remembrance hath preceded all things mentioned and My mercy hath encompassed all created things. To this testifieth every discerning one who is aware. They have sought permission. The True One, exalted be His glory, hath ever gazed upon His friends, but in these days this land is in turmoil and in the breasts of some the fire of hatred is ablaze. Therefore the Most Exalted Pen hath paused in giving permission. Be patient. Verily thy Lord is the All-Patient and commandeth thee to beautiful patience. This is a verse We have revealed in various stations, a command from the presence of an ancient Ordainer. Today whosoever is occupied with serving the Cause is recorded among the people of the Crimson Ark in the Books of the highest heaven. We beseech God to confirm thee in serving this mighty Cause. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. And We make mention of the Praised One who was mentioned in thy letter and We send greetings upon him from this exalted station. The Glory be upon thee and upon My friends whose names thou hast not mentioned, in wisdom from Our presence, and I am the Commander, the All-Wise.

O Afnan, Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Mirza, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God! He is the Consoler, the Comforter.

O My Afnan! We make mention of the sorrows that have befallen you in the days of the All-Merciful, and We console you with the verses of God, the Lord of all worlds. By the life of God! We have seen him who has ascended, detached from this world and sanctified from its dust and smoke, and We found him in a state of joy and delight, such that were it to be manifested to those on earth, they would assuredly detach themselves from all that is with them, turning unto God, the Mighty, the Praised. Blessed art thou, for We have heard from thy tongue the word of gratitude and submission, and found in thy heart the sweet savors of contentment. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Behold and remember when We sent My Herald with My verses and gave him a son whom We named Ahmad, and raised him to a station known only to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And before him We sent Muhammad, My Messenger, and gave him a son named Qasim, and after him Abdullah, and after him Ibrahim, and We raised them up through Our wisdom, for We are the Almighty, the Powerful. The idolaters called him 'abtar' (childless), and We revealed unto him a verse from Our presence, for We are the Ancient Revealer: "Wealth and children are the adornment of this world's life, but the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lord's sight, as rewards, and better as the foundation for hopes." And We seized the idolaters with Our might and authority. Thus did the fragrances of revelation waft, that thou mightest thank thy Lord, the Remembering, the All-Knowing.

O My Afnan! We wish to impart to thee that which We have not imparted to any of My loved ones, that thou mayest find within thyself the light of patience from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Peerless. God hath magnified thy reward for thy son who hath ascended unto Him, even as My son Mahdi ascended at the beginning of Our imprisonment.

O My Afnan! The world is troubled and dust-laden. Its tribulation precedeth its comfort, and its punishment precedeth its blessing, and its toil exceedeth its pleasure. It is the beloved of the heedless and the abhorred of the knowing ones. Comfort and fidelity in it are like the philosopher's stone, and its afflictions are beyond reckoning. Man seeth therein what he would rather not see, and consorteth with those whose company he would not desire. Were it to have any station, thou wouldst see Me seated upon its thrones, and were it to have any worth, its Creator and its Sovereign would not have turned away from it. Beware lest its grief sadden thee or its adornments gladden thee. Its glory is humiliation, its wealth is poverty, and its permanence is extinction. Where is the splendor of Parviz and his pure gold? Where is the might of the Pharaohs and their lofty palaces? Where is the wealth of the tyrants and their ordered armies? If thou wert to look today at the palace of Khosrow, thou wouldst find it a spider's web and echo. Take heed, O ye who are endowed with understanding!

Grieve not for what hath befallen thee. We console thee and comfort thee, and counsel thee to be patient and forbearing. Thy Lord is the Commander, the All-Choosing. We desired naught from the world save its people, for it, in itself, is but the footstool of My feet and the pasture of My sheep and the vista of My loved ones and the dawning-place of the manifestations of My power and the dayspring of My most beautiful names and most exalted attributes. Thy Lord is the Expositor, the All-Knowing.

We make mention of My leaf whom sorrows have encompassed through what hath been ordained for her by the irrevocable decree of God, the Lord of the ancient. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to change her sorrow into His remembrance and praise, His verses and evidences, His nearness and presence. Grieve not, O My leaf! He is with thee in all conditions. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. He will suffice thee in truth, and He is powerful over what He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Praised.

The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you, O My Afnan and My leaves, and upon those who love you for My sake and hear your words concerning this momentous News.

O thou who hast clung to the cord of deeds and utterance! How praiseworthy is thy service in the path of God and His love, and thy sincerity in His days, and thy turning to Him after His creatures turned away. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist thee in all conditions. He is verily the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.

Praise be to God, thy deed hath been accepted with honor, and the sign thereof is that his honor Fadl, upon him be the grace of God and His glory, hath mentioned thee and sent word to the Most Holy Court. Another sign is this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet which hath descended from the heaven of Will. By the life of God! Were its fragrances to pass over the decayed bones, thou wouldst behold them arising and speaking in praise of the Great News of God. And yet another sign is that thy mention endureth and persisteth in the Most Holy Court. Blessed art thou, and blessed is thy steadfastness, and blessed is he who hath given thee sustenance.

However, in this Most Great Revelation, the Divine Books have established gatherings of joy and illumined the arena of the world with the light of gladness and delight. Among the conditions of joy have been and shall be heavenly food and earthly bounties. They said to the Son of Mary that John the Baptist fasted and clung to asceticism and piety, while He and His companions ate and drank. The Spirit said: "John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say he hath a devil. The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, behold a gluttonous man." To those of insight it is clear that by John is meant John the Baptist, and by Son of Man the Son of Mary.

It is evident that all matters depend upon command and prohibition that shine forth from the Dawning-Place of the Divine Will and Heavenly Purpose. If He should say "Fast" and no word of "Break the fast" follow it, one should fast until death. Therefore, until now whatever hath proceeded from thee hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. And now He commandeth: Eat and drink. This is what thou hast been bidden by the Most Merciful of the merciful. He hath created the bounties and blessings of the earth first for His chosen ones and His loved ones and His servants. Despite these bounties, should anyone deny himself - God forbid - the creation of things and their cause and fruit would be rendered vain.

In all conditions one must look to the blessed word "He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth." Whatever proceedeth from the Source of Command is truth, in which there is no doubt. One must hold fast to it and render thanks. In one respect, the showing forth of bounty is thanksgiving for bounty. But some among the Shi'ite sect maintain their dwellings and attire in an unrefined state and consider this asceticism and the very essence of piety. Indeed, if these conditions arise from poverty, there is no harm in it and it is acceptable before God. But when means are available, whatsoever they manifest or bestow in charity is beloved in the sight of God. The Concourse on High and the sanctified spirits have their gaze fixed upon perfumed, pure and refined stations. Thus did the Herald declare that prayer offered in silk garments is more excellent before God. Likewise He said that if He knew which place thou wouldst choose as thy residence, He would even now command that it be built of diamond faces reflecting water.

That honored one should give thanks for having been the cause of the revelation of this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet. Today the people of Baha, if possible, should partake of delicate and fragrant foods. However, blessed is he who preferreth his brother over himself. He is assuredly among those who draw nigh unto God and who act according to His command. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon My friends in that land who have championed justice and fairness and have held fast to the cord of patience and composure. They are among the helpers in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds.

O Husayn, upon thee be My glory! For some time now the Leaf, the Mother, hath dwelt in the House and during the nights and days hath been blessed to hearken unto the verses of God. They have attained a great bounty and been honored with supreme grace. On this dark night, two hours past the nineteenth night of the sacred month of Mu?arram, the letter of 'Ali-Muhammad written on behalf of Ghulam-Husayn was presented and this servant read it aloud. Praise be to God that they are illumined by the rays of the Sun of divine love and are firm and steadfast in His Cause. This is a great favor from the Most Great Announcement which speaketh before all faces: "The Desired One is come and the Kingdom belongeth unto God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting!"

O Muhammad-'Ali! Praise be to God that thou hast been illumined by the rays of the Sun of Truth and hast hearkened unto the call of Him Who conversed on Sinai, Who is the Source of all good. We beseech God to preserve thee and ordain for thee that which profiteth thee. We make mention of thy father as We mentioned him before. We beseech God to send down upon him at all times mercy and grace from His presence. He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

Thou didst mention Ghulam-Husayn. We heard his call and have answered him with this clear Tablet. O Ghulam-Husayn! Thy call hath been heard and there hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen that which shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endureth. This grace shall not be erased by death, nor shall this utterance be effaced from God's Book. It hath been and shall forever be. At this hour the Leaf, the Mother of ?a', upon her be My glory, intended to visit the Most Great House. She entered on behalf of the souls mentioned and was blessed with the visitation, and from the Dayspring of divine verses and the Source of heavenly evidences the decree of acceptance was revealed. Blessed is the soul that hath attained this supreme grace. I swear by the Sun of the heaven of proof that all that exists and is visible cannot equal one word of His utterances. He verily knoweth and speaketh the truth, but most of the people know not and understand not.

We make mention in this place of My handmaiden who was named Farkhundih in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for her that which shall gladden her eyes and rejoice her heart. He is verily the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word "Be" and it is. And We make mention of My handmaiden Umm-Maryam and give her the glad-tidings of My mercy which hath preceded all and My grace which hath encompassed all in the heavens and earth. Blessed is the servant at whose name My Most Exalted Pen hath moved, and blessed the handmaiden who hath attained this glorious, mighty station. We make mention of My loved ones and handmaidens there. We beseech God to ordain for them the good of the hereafter and of this world, and to give them to drink from the cup of steadfastness in this Cause whereby the hearts of the learned were perturbed and the limbs of those who bear the names did quake, save whom God wished, the Almighty, the Powerful.

O Husayn, upon thee be My glory and My grace! Glorify on My behalf the faces of those who are with thee. We have made mention of them as a favor from Us. Thy Lord is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous. A single letter of thy Lord's verses cannot be equaled by all that the kings and rulers possess. To this testifieth every seeing scholar and every informed sage. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having remembered me time and again and for having sent down to me from the heaven of Thy bounty that which shall cause my mention to endure as long as Thy kingdom and dominion endure. I beseech Thee by the light of Thy countenance and the fire of Thy Cause and the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and whatsoever lay hidden and treasured in the repositories of Thine immunity, to aid me to preserve what Thou hast given me through Thy generosity, and to ordain for me the good of the hereafter and of this world. Thou art verily the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

In the Name of Him Who domineth all who are in the heavens and on earth! O peoples of the earth! The Mother Book calleth out in the return, how is it ye hear not? We have sent forth the Criterion in the form of man. Verily He standeth before the Face, crying out and calling: "By God! The Truth hath come, yet the people understand not!" This is the Day which God's Books have attested from aforetime, yet most among mankind perceive it not. The Hidden Treasure and the Stored Secret have appeared, and the world hath been adorned with the ornament of what God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, had promised. Where are the learned ones and the mystics, and where are they who turned away from the Truth, the Knower of things unseen? Today every learned one hath clung to vain imaginings, turning away from Him Who is Known, Who hath appeared through His Name, the Self-Subsisting. O concourse of rulers! The Lord of Names hath come, and desireth to draw you nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Loving. He hath appeared for the reformation of the world, and counseleth all with that which will manifest man's station in creation. Exalted be the All-Merciful Who speaketh, and continueth to speak, in the Most Great Prison: "Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Truth, the Lord of all existence!" O Muhammad! Thy remembrance hath been mentioned at the Most Great Scene, and the Lord of Power hath remembered thee in such wise as nothing in the unseen or visible realms can equal. Blessed be the face that hath turned unto the Face, and joy be to him who hath advanced toward the Most Exalted Horizon, and delight be to him who hath drunk of My Sealed Wine. We make mention in this station of the learned ones of the earth and its mystics, and remind them of that which hath been sent down from God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Fear God and follow not your desires. Look unto the horizon of justice, then speak with fairness concerning this Cause whereby the standard "There is none other God but Me" hath been raised in this praiseworthy station. If ye deny Him Who hath come unto you, by what proof can ye establish that which ye claim? Bring it forth, and be not of the unjust. Set aside oppression and take hold of justice - such is the way of man, did ye but know it. We desire not what ye possess, nor do We seek your might and power. We remind you for the sake of God, would that ye might know. We have desired your life and your drawing nigh and your attainment and your ascension to the most exalted summit, yet ye have pronounced against Us an injustice at which the Messengers have lamented. Say: Turn your ears toward the Prison that ye may hear the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, which speaketh in every state that which hath been inscribed in My Preserved Tablet. Were We to mention one verse of that which hath been traced therein by My manifest and renowned Pen, those who stood at the Mount would swoon away and every mighty edifice would be shaken. Thus hath the Nightingale warbled and the Cock crowed at this exalted Point. The Prison hath been named with the Most Beautiful Names - your Lord, the Most Glorious, Who speaketh in the Most Exalted Horizon with His supreme verses and calleth all unto the path of God, the Mighty, the Loving, doth testify to this. O Muhammad! We have found thy turning unto Him and known thy submissiveness before God. We have mentioned thee in this Most Great Tablet that it might draw thee to the station of holy nearness and beauty, and strengthen thee to stand firm in this Cause whereby souls have been agitated. Place thy trust in this Cause in God and say: "In the Name of God and by God." Then take the cup of eternity in the name of Baha and drink therefrom the Kawthar of certitude through the remembrance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast strengthened me and guided me to a station from which every polytheist and rejected one hath turned away. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy generosity to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, and to make me one of those who have bowed down at the appearance of Thy signs and the manifestation of Thy clear tokens. O my Lord! Thou seest me advancing toward Thee and turning to the horizon of Thy favor. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which is with Thee. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of the unseen and the visible. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Loving, the All-Forgiving."

Praise be unto the peerless Almighty Who, through His all-subduing power and all-encompassing will, hath brought countless creatures from the depths of nothingness into the realm of existence and visibility, and from among them hath adorned man with the ornament of knowledge and distinguished him with the recognition of His Own Self. Most great is the station He hath conferred upon man, for all that is \[...\]

Now, the soul that hath borne this most great trust and hath, through the grace of the Lord of all beings, arisen to promote His Cause, and with supreme steadfastness and consummate wisdom hath guided the people to the straight path and the mighty announcement - verily he is of those who have attained, by the Lord of the mighty throne!

O thou who hast attained to reunion in the end! Thy loving letter was received and from it were evident the signs of love and unity. We hope that thou wilt ever abide beneath the shade of \[grace\] and attain unto that which is good and mentioned in the Book of God. While hastening to reply, thy second letter arrived and added joy unto joy. It attained the presence and mention was made of thee and thy fellow-travelers. These manifest verses were revealed and sent down from the source of grace, exalted be His beneficence:

He is God, exalted and sanctified is He!

O Mir! Upon thee be the glory of God and His favors! Thy letters have repeatedly arrived, diffusing the fragrance of steadfastness and spreading the sweet savors of the love of God. We have heard what thou didst speak before the one who turned away from God, exalted be His glory, and followed his passions. Verily, he is of the rebellious faction. He cast the Book of God behind him and took what his self and desire commanded. This tongue, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, doth testify to this. Say: Die in your wrath, O people of hypocrisy! The Day of Meeting hath come and the Illuminator of the horizons speaketh before all faces: "The Kingdom is God's, the Lord of the worlds!" It behooveth them not to seek proof today from the Bayan. Behold, then mention what the Tongue of the Point uttered, saying: "I have written an essence concerning His mention - He cannot be indicated by My indication nor by what was revealed in the Bayan." Many such passages exist in the Bayan, but few are they who hear. Especially that heedless one who through passion is deprived of guidance, and through words is veiled from meaning. The Most Great Ocean surgeth before his face, yet he is occupied with proving the existence of a pond. So heedless is he that he knoweth not by what proof he believeth in the Primal Point. We bade him come that he might hear that which would renew the world of meanings and utterance. He accepted not the counsel of the counselor, for he was deluded by love of leadership. He knoweth not what he sayeth even now, being unaware of the root of the Cause. Were he to observe the evidences with insight, he would testify from whom came that which appeared before the Primal Point, from what horizon it dawned, and from what heaven it became manifest. Blessed art thou and those with thee. Mention of that company hath ever been and still is before the Wronged One. The wolves have surrounded Me from all directions. The Command is from God, the Revealer of verses.

We make mention of Mir \[Ali\]. We beseech God to protect him from his enemies and ordain for him that which shall cause his remembrance to endure. We testify that he attained the presence, achieved victory, and heard the call of God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. He gained the choice wine of reunion from the hand of God's loving-kindness, the Mighty, the All-Loving. We have mentioned him in verses by which those near unto God have been transported, and We make mention when he established for himself a station beneath the pavilions of God's grandeur, the Lord of the seen and unseen. The glory from Us be upon him and upon those with him, both women and men.

We make mention of him who was named Fath-Ali and say: My God, my God! Aid him to stand firm in Thy Cause and ordain for him that which shall draw him nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Then send down upon him from the heaven of Thy loving-kindness the rains of grace and favors. O my Lord! Thou knowest and seest that he left his homeland, seeking Thy presence in the prison, and attained unto that which was inscribed in Thy Book. Enable him and those with him to do that which befitteth Thy days. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

O Muhammad! O thou who didst migrate in the days of God and didst traverse the regions and lands until thou didst attain the presence of thy Chosen Lord, and didst witness what was hidden from eyes, and didst hear what was forbidden to the ears of men. We beseech God to adorn thee with the ornament of steadfastness and aid thee to remember and praise Him in all conditions. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.

We conclude this Tablet with the name of Khalil. O Friend of God! Give thanks for this supreme bounty. We testify that thou didst circumambulate the Kaaba of God, the Powerful, the Chosen One, and didst attain His presence, hear His call, and show forth thy submissiveness and humility before His countenance. We beseech God to give thee to drink from the ocean of His bounty time and again, and to ordain for thee the good of this world and the world to come.

We make mention of My loved ones there and bid them to be holy and detached. Through deeds are the stations of the valiant elevated and the glory of men made manifest. We send Our greetings to them from this station, and We make mention of My handmaiden who attained My presence and circumambulated around Me, and the maidservants who heard the call and turned to the Most Exalted Horizon. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid them to observe that which hath been enjoined in the Book. The glory from Us be upon them and upon My maidservants in all regions and directions.

Your honor and all your fellow travelers have each been mentioned by the tongue of the grace of the Intended One, may our souls be sacrificed for Him, and have been adorned with the ornament of bounty and loving-kindness. Convey to each one that which hath been revealed concerning them, and on My behalf make mention of them with wondrous remembrances and sublime greetings. The press of occupation, as your honor knoweth, hath prevented - otherwise separate letters would have been written and sent to each one. Make special mention of Jinab-i-Khalil, upon him be the glory of God, with remembrance and sublime greeting. Convey to the members of the household, on behalf of the people of the household, wondrous and sublime remembrance and greeting. The spirit and glory be upon thee and upon thy son and those who are with thee.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful!

Praise be to God Who, when He desires to open the First Treasury wherein were deposited the mysteries that were manifest from His Most Hidden Name, the Most Glorious, arises and speaks forth the Most Great Word. Then appears that which had not appeared in creation. Among the people are those who, having caught the fragrance, turn towards Him, detached from the world, and those who deny and disbelieve in God, the Most High, the Most Great. Exalted, exalted is He towards Whose atmosphere of love every sincere one soars, towards Whose ocean of beauty every seeker turns, towards Whose horizon of good-pleasure every searcher advances, and towards Whose Throne every humble one directs himself by His leave. Then exalted, exalted is He Whom all else fails to know and whose inadequacy to know His Essence all confess. He is the One remembered Who is not remembered by any rememberer's remembrance, the Beloved Who is not described by any lover's description, the Adored One Who is not characterized by any adorer's attribute. Were I to say that the Living Waters tell of His utterance, this would be manifest unbelief, and were I to say that light derives from the lights of His countenance, this would be denied by every knowing sage. The Tongue of Grandeur has testified to this, as has His Most Exalted Pen, at eventide and at dawn.

Furthermore, my spirit be a sacrifice for you, O beloved of my heart, mentioned by my pen, my heart and my tongue! I bear witness that I have suffered loss upon loss, and what loss can compare with the loss of the letter Ha as he claims, or the loss of any in creation? For I was lying upon my bed, afflicted with what had weakened me for numbered days. I knew not nor was I aware when the fragrances of your pen and the perfume of your love reached me. When I was granted healing, I heard and took and read and praised God, the Lord of the seen and unseen, and the Lord of all worlds. You know that I have loved to hear at all times your call and whatsoever proceeds from you in the love of God, our Lord and your Lord, our Master and the Master of all worlds. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to enable me to hearken unto your call, your mention, your description and your praise, O Beloved of the mystics! When I attained your most pure letter, I turned to the Most Great Scene and presented it before the Throne. He spoke, and His word is the truth: "Blessed is he, then blessed is he, in that he has occupied himself with the remembrance of God in all conditions and has spoken His praise among the servants. My tongue bears witness to this, even as My mighty, exalted Pen bore witness before."

And concerning what you mentioned about the people of Iraq, I presented both the verse sent by him and the prose that flowed from your pen in remembrance of God's loved ones there. The Tongue of Grandeur spoke: "We make mention of them, but it behooveth not that mention from this quarter be sent to them, for the people are in great waywardness. We act in accordance with wisdom." Thus hath it been sent down from One mighty, wise. Blessed is he who hath spoken the praise of God and composed in His remembrance that which gladdeneth the Concourse on High and those who circle round this exalted station. We have counseled them with wisdom. By My life! Whoso holdeth fast unto it, God will preserve him through a sovereignty from His presence. He is, verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

And concerning what you wrote about the dervish and what befell him, We beseech God to grant him double what was taken from him through deception and intrigue, and to adorn the servants with the raiment of justice and fairness. I hope that you will convey greetings from this evanescent one to him and to those whom you find upon a straight path. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatest, the Most Powerful

Praise be to God Who sent down the Books and dispatched the Messengers, for verily there is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Through them He manifested His sovereignty, completed His proof, bestowed His grace, and perfected His evidence. Through them He guided His servants to His Straight Path. Blessings and peace be upon Him after Whom there shall be no Prophet, through Whom His verses were sent down, His evidence appeared, His power encompassed all things, His Word was exalted, and its station was raised in the world among the nations. Exalted is the Ancient Lord Who sent Him and made Him stand in His own place in the realm of creation. And upon His family and companions who established the pillars of religion through His firm and impregnable Command.

And then - may my spirit be a sacrifice for your presence - the letter from the spiritual friend, his honor Aqa Darvish Ghulam-Husayn, upon him be God's peace, which he had written to that beloved one, arrived and was presented before the Countenance. The Master - may our spirits be a sacrifice for Him - said: Mention of this Cause has been forbidden in the outskirts of this city and surrounding regions, for the people are weak and make no distinction between good and evil, guidance and error, benefit and harm. Although the loved ones of God have had and have no purpose except the reformation of the world and the refinement of the nations, nevertheless the divines, rulers and every faction have attributed pure righteousness to corruption and have understood building up to mean tearing down. In such case what station remains for words and what place for deeds? In any case, mention of this Cause is not permitted in these parts. Beseech God to aid the servants to justice and fairness. He who knows does not deny, he who understands does not turn away, and he who comprehends does not object. Let one proceed with brevity and we make mention of Muhammad-Qabli-Mu??afa - upon him be my peace. Remember him on my behalf and give him the glad tidings of my attention to him. We beseech God to preserve him and those with him from the evil of every stubborn oppressor and from the tyranny of every sinful transgressor.

O servant! Upon thee be My peace. Quickly pass beyond the border of Rum. In view of the promise of his honor Muhammad-Qabli-Mu??afa - upon him be my peace - regarding meeting and encountering the mentioned souls, there has not been and is not any objection for two or three days. Convey greetings from the Wronged One. Firm counsels are necessary in wisdom. God willing, may you be enabled to mention and praise and spread and diffuse after passing beyond these bounds. Verily the Command is in His hand - He doeth what He willeth and decreeth what He pleaseth. He is the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the Wise. We beseech God to preserve His loved ones through His power that encompasseth the world, to guard them from the evil of His enemies, and to draw them nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.

End. Praise be to God, the purpose has been achieved, for they have been adorned with the mention of the Beloved and illumined by the lights of providence. Blessed are they! The request is that they seek confirmation and ask for enablement for this poor one as well. Verily God is the Hearer, the Answerer. This evanescent servant conveys greetings to his honor Muhammad Mu??afa - may God the Exalted assist him. For his presence and those with him, before and after, I have sought and seek enablement, and praise be to God it is assured of response. I convey greetings to his honor Aqa Darvish - upon him be God's peace - and I beseech God for confirmation for him. Likewise I convey greetings to the other friends and have besought and beseech from God, exalted be His glory, confirmation and enablement and the good of this world and the next for each one. At this time mention was made in the Most Holy Court of his honor Haji 'Ali and their honors the most exalted ones - upon them be God's peace. Praise be to God, all are mentioned and have attained the glances of providence. Praise be to God, first and last, outwardly and inwardly.

May my exalted Master, the honored Haji Mirza Muhammad 'Ali, upon whom be all my most glorious Baha, be pleased to receive this.

He is God, exalted be His station in greatness and glory! Praise be to God Who has made Himself known to us, taught us His Cause, made clear to us the paths of truth and certitude, and manifested what befits His generosity towards all the worlds. We thank Him in all conditions with thanksgiving wherewith He has spoken in His Book and taught us through His bounty and sovereignty. And glory and splendor be upon those who have remained steadfast in His Cause, who have voiced His praise, who have attained to hearkening unto His call, who have turned towards the horizon of His grace and drawn near to the ocean of His Most Great Name. May my spirit be a sacrifice for your honor.

Some time ago this servant submitted a petition which I hope has arrived. After that, during the days of Ridvan, the dishes which your honor had sent were used according to instructions. One night among those nights, Khwajeh Ilyas 'Abbud, in whose house the Throne is now established, attained the Most Holy Presence, and after seeing the dishes, at one point asked this servant whether it would be possible to write and have brought one set of coffee cups with one covered soup bowl from the Chinese dishes. This servant remained silent. Recently he made the request again, therefore this servant has taken the liberty to submit that if it can be arranged with utmost ease, please send them. The aforementioned Khwajeh is not a believer, but he has shown much consideration to the friends in this land and during the commotion that occurred in this land he stood firm. Since he is among the notables of the city and has now become the Russian consul, he has rendered assistance without dissimulation and shows the utmost affection. Sometimes he is present during the revelation of verses and listens with complete humility and submissiveness. It is not known what is God's will concerning him. Thus far he has attained to the aforementioned virtues, and afterward the matter is in His hand. As for the bowl that was mentioned, let it be medium-sized, neither too large nor too small. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist him in that which He loves and is pleased with.

Glory be to God! This servant is astonished at the condition of people. A group of Christians from various regions have shown sincerity and affection, and have come to this land purely to investigate and examine. Although they did not attain the \[Holy\] Presence, they were blessed for several days to attain the presence of the Most Great Branch of God - may my spirit and the spirit of all the worlds be a sacrifice for Him - and they asked several questions about religions, faiths and the principles of divine knowledge, and heard complete and sufficient answers, such that after returning they recorded the details in the London and Prussian newspapers. Nevertheless they are still hesitant, and those newspapers have also reached this land. In any case, the Fire is ablaze, the Sun is shining, and the Light is manifest, yet the people are in great delusion. Soon most of the people of the world will become enkindled, for there has not been and is not any escape for anyone. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to rend asunder the veils that have come between them and the lights of the Face, to show them His most exalted horizon and His most glorious view, to cause them to hear the cooing of the Dove and to give them to drink of the purest nectar. Verily He is the Ruler over what He wishes. There is no God but He, the Most High, the Most Great.

If Jinab Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'l-Hamid is present, this servant's greetings to him depend on your honor's grace. And verily glory be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon those who love you.

Let him who is honored, his eminence Aqa Mir Muhammad Husayn Beg, may the glory of God be upon him, take note.

In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord! Praise be to God Who was when naught else was, and Who will be as He has been. He has sent down the laws and ordinances and dispatched the Messengers for the education of all peoples. He, verily, is the Single, the One, the Most High, the Compassionate, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.

And now, to proceed: A question was previously submitted to the Most Holy Court regarding those who pass away in their youth and early age - whether, if they were to consult physicians, their treatment would prevent death or not, and so forth. The decisive command of God is that the sick must consult a skilled physician and act upon whatever he prescribes. Regarding what is determined and what is conditional, in the days when the Sun of Revelation was dawning from the horizon of Iraq, this exalted Word was revealed from the Supreme Pen. His words, exalted be His grandeur: "Consider the candle and its light. If you protect it from outward elements through means such as a lantern or otherwise, then as long as the wax and wick remain, it is possible to preserve it from temporal vicissitudes. However, if it reaches its end - that is, if the wax and wick are exhausted - in this case the continuation of light is impossible. This latter state is determined, while the former state is conditional. Know ye what hath been sent down in truth from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise."

Furthermore, two most mighty, most holy Tablets have been revealed and sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will specifically for you and for his eminence Aqa Mirza Abu'l-Hasan, may the glory of God be upon him. God willing, they will attain unto them and become detached from all else but God. This evanescent servant conveys greetings to all the gentlemen and friends of God, and seeks their remembrance during times of communion and turning to God, that perchance he may not be deprived in these most glorious days and may at all times attain unto infinite bounties. I seek forgiveness from God, the Almighty, for my mention and utterance, for the call of the evanescent reaches not the realm of the everlasting and is not worthy of that Court which is sanctified from mention and utterance. However, as His grace has no end, there has been and is hope from every direction.

Regarding what you mentioned about the leaf who turned toward the Divine Lote-Tree from your presence, after this matter was submitted, these manifest verses were revealed from the heaven of God's Will. His words, exalted be His grandeur: "O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! We found from her the fragrance of My love at the time of her ascension to the Supreme Companion. Thy Lord is, verily, the Witness, the All-Hearing. We have remembered her with this remembrance that God's mention may be a treasure for her in every world of the worlds of her Lord. It behooveth thee to thank thy Lord, the All-Bountiful. Grieve not at her ascension, her return, and her turning to God. By My life! She hath attained unto that which the hearts of the mystics cannot comprehend. The glory shining forth from the horizon of eternity be upon her and upon those who have won victory in the days of God, the Lord of the worlds."

Praise be to God that this leaf, may the glory of God be upon her, has been honored with the mention of the Beloved of the worlds. Blessed is she! Happy is she! Welcome to her! Congratulations to her! If all the world were to recognize the station of but one word of the divine utterances, all would surely sacrifice their lives to attain it. However, due to lack of capacity, they are today veiled and deprived. Glory be upon you and upon those who have drunk the wine of steadfastness, despite every heedless, veiled one and hateful denier. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Loving.

This is revealed from the heaven of the will of the Bayan of our Lord, the Most Merciful. His word, exalted be His majesty: O Greatest Fath! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of Eternity. Thou didst call upon Him with the tongue of love and affection, and He hath answered thee with these verses, for which all existence would sacrifice itself. Thou didst call Him with attraction and longing, and He calleth thee through His grace that hath encompassed all created things. Thy letter hath come before the Countenance and was read by the tongue of Our servant who is present before the throne of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Choosing. From each word thereof We discovered the fragrance of thy sincerity towards God and thy steadfastness in His firm and wise Cause. We have sent down Tablets unto thee and dispatched them through the Trustworthy One. Be grateful for what hath been sent down unto thee of the enduring bounty which shall never cease. We beseech God to assist thee under all conditions, and those who have arisen to help this Wronged One among the servants. From this station We send Our greetings unto thy face and the faces of those around thee who have turned towards the Countenance, detached from all else save Him.

The supplication of that honored one reached the throne, and these exalted verses were revealed from the heaven of grace: In the name of our Lord, the Most Impregnable, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most High. Praise be to God Who hath manifested the Hidden Point beneath the veil of Oneness through His Name that speaketh in the Divine Lote-Tree. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Trustworthy. Praise be to God Who hath quickened all created things through what hath sprinkled upon them from the ocean of His Name, the All-Encompassing over all beings. Then did the people of the graves arise, turning towards the Manifestation, while the people of darkness perished by turning towards gloom. Those who attained unto arising are among the most exalted of creation - through them have the faces of the days been illumined and the horizon of utterance hath shone forth. Then He chose from among these whom He willed and established him to aid His Cause in the kingdom of creation, and caused him to speak His praise in such wise that neither the conditions of the servants nor the deeds of those in the land could prevent him. Exalted, exalted be His dominion! Exalted, exalted be His power! Exalted, exalted be His favors whereby He hath delivered His loved ones from the oceans of idle fancies and drawn them nigh unto the horizon of revelation - a station whereof the pens are powerless to make mention. Verily He is the Almighty over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. My spirit be a sacrifice for thy steadfastness.

Praise be to God, this evanescent servant hath been honored by His mention of that honored one. I beseech God to make this bounty everlasting, that we may ever be blessed with the like thereof. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Regarding what was written about the new joy and gladness, we praise God for this. God willing, it hath been and shall be blessed. This matter was most acceptable before the Throne, and when the honored Amin, upon him be 96 \[Baha'u'llah\], was departing, mention was made of it in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet which was revealed from the heaven of favor specifically for the master with the name 66 \[of God\] Ha', upon him be all His most glorious Baha. I beseech the True One, exalted be His might and glory, to make this joy blessed and permanent. Verily He is the Giver, the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Generous.

This servant requests that you convey profound and exalted greetings from this evanescent one to all the loved ones of God in that land. The friends who are present also convey their sincere greetings and most wondrous, most exalted, most glorious salutations to your honor. The Most Great Branch and the Greater Branch, may our spirits be sacrificed for them both, remember your honor with most wondrous mentions and greet you with salutations sanctified above the realm of mention and description. And the glory be upon you and those around you.

In the Name of Him Who speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance!

O My Most Exalted Pen! We behold thee coursing upon the Tablet, now inclining to the right, now to the left. Hath intoxication seized thee? It replieth: "Yea, by Thy Self, the Truth! The wine of reunion hath so inebriated me that I move without mine own volition. Thou art verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed." How could it be otherwise, when the finger of Thy Will and Power moveth me as it pleaseth and desireth? Thou art verily the Ordainer, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised.

Thy Name, the Swift, hath made me swifter than lightning; Thy Name, the All-Seeing, hath made me more perceiving than all the worlds; Thy Name, the All-Knowing, hath taught me the knowledge of what was and what shall be; and Thy Name, the All-Informed, hath acquainted me with that which none knoweth save whom Thy knowledge willeth, the knowledge that dominateth all who are in the heavens and on earth.

Despite my inherent baseness, Thou hast made me to excel all standards, and notwithstanding my manifest weakness, Thou hast made me powerful through Thy Name, the Almighty, the Powerful. Through me is broken the back of every mighty one, and through me is exalted both the lowly and the high. Were Thou to loose my reins, I would brandish the spears of utterance, subdue the cities of the earth, and take possession of the hearts of those who wander in the wilderness of heedlessness, drawing them nigh unto the dawning-place of Thy Name, the All-Forgiving, the All-Generous.

O Pen! Remember when We sent Our Tablet, named the Call, to the leader of mankind, and he sent it to those renowned for learning. When they read it, they were bewildered and spoke according to their desires. Thy Lord is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing. Among them was one who said He seeketh sovereignty. Say: Woe unto thee, O heedless and remote one! We have commanded the kings to cast it behind them, turning unto God, the Mighty, the Beauteous.

We bear witness to the manifestation of reason among the nations when We behold absolute sovereignty cast upon the dust, with none approaching it. Thus hath the matter been decreed in a perspicuous Tablet. Say: It is the most abject of stations in My sight, though thou seest it as the most exalted station. Open thine eyes that thou mayest know Him Whose Pen ruleth over all who are in the heavens and on earth.

O concourse of divines! Pride not yourselves on your conjectures and idle fancies, nor on your riches and wealth. Choose for yourselves that which shall endure in the kingdom of your Lord, the Most High, the Mighty, the Great. This is a matter that your power and might cannot weaken, nor your imaginings affect. Fear God and be among the discerning ones. We call you for the sake of God - to this every atom beareth witness, would ye but hear. Draw nigh with attentive ears unto the Source of verses, that ye may hear from the scratching of His Pen that which the Son of Imran heard when he turned toward Paran. Fear God and invalidate not the truth through your conjectures and imaginings.

O thou who hast turned unto God! Hearken unto the call from this Lamp kindled between earth and heaven. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Invincible.

Thy mention hath been made in the presence of this Prisoner, and We have perceived thy joy at the breath of divine revelation. We have, therefore, revealed unto thee this Tablet and dispatched it to thee, that it may attract thee in such wise as to cause thee to arise for the triumph of thy Lord's Cause and to be numbered among them that remember Him. Beware lest the conditions of blind imitation prevent thee from the Dayspring of divine unity. Break asunder the chains of idle fancy through this Name whereby the horizon of certitude hath shone forth. Be thou diligent in the Cause of God, and give thou to drink of the Kawthar of thy Lord's knowledge unto them that are heedless, that they may turn towards the Most Sublime Horizon in this wondrous Revelation. We have desired for thee that which shall cause thy mention to endure through the eternity of Our most excellent names and most exalted attributes. Choose thou what God hath chosen for thee. He, verily, is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Soon shall all that is possessed by men perish, and that which hath been ordained in the preserved Tablet shall endure.

In the Name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Sorrowful, the Most Glorious!

O thou Manifestation of Bounty! Hearken unto that which the Pen, encompassed by sorrows from the hosts of Satan, imparteth unto thee. By God, the True One! Wert thou to become aware of that which hath befallen the Beauty of the All-Merciful, thou wouldst weep at all times. Verily, he whom We created by a word of Our command doth every day commit that which causeth the hearts of the denizens of Paradise to burn and the eyes of the All-Merciful to shed tears. He hath risen in opposition and stingeth, like unto a serpent, the Beauty of the All-Glorious every day, and in every moment there appeareth from him that which causeth the Cause of God to be lost, although His Cause is sanctified above all that His good-pleasure abhorreth. But the people, being seized by veils, regard the matter through other eyes. Thus do We impart unto thee, O Manifestation of Bounty, that which hath set aflame the realities of the people of the Ridvan. One day he writeth unto his like, with whom it beseemeth not the loved ones of God to converse - may my spirit be a sacrifice unto thee - and another day he sendeth his representative to the chief of the city to lodge a complaint against the Beauty of God, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Bountiful. By God! Were We to recount unto thee that which hath appeared and continueth to appear from him at every moment, thou wouldst cry out within thyself and weep continuously, by God, the King, the Supreme, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the All-Glorious. In all this he seeketh naught but to beg from his like and to cause the Cause of God to be lost amongst His servants. Reflect then upon that which hath befallen Us from him who, by God the True One, causeth even the people of reckoning to flee from his deeds. The matter hath reached such a pass that We desired to give him all that We possessed, that perchance the fire of his greed might be stilled. By God, it shall never be quenched, but shall blaze forth at every moment like unto flames of fire. By God, the True One! The eye of creation hath not witnessed his like, nor have the eyes of invention beheld his peer. He committeth the deed of Nimrod, then crieth out within himself; he severeth at every moment the head of the Wronged One, yet calleth out amongst men. Such hath been his deed, and he is not ashamed before God Who created him by a command from His presence. Thus doth he write unto various lands without any evidence or proof. Behold then the state of those who have taken him as a friend instead of God. Alas for them and for him, by reason of that which they have committed in their vain life and were numbered with the people of tyranny and unbelief. Reflect then upon My tribulations: Hath their like been witnessed in former ages? Nay, by My Self, Which hath encompassed all contingent things in the kingdoms of earth and heaven! And thou, grieve not, but arise to serve the Cause of God, then be patient and long-suffering, and put thy trust in God. Verily, He is with thee, through thee, and for thee. Grieve not on account of the hosts of Satan. Say: O people! Fear ye God, and take not unto yourselves at every moment a lord besides God. Fear ye the Day whereon all things shall be terrified and all who are in the heavens and on earth shall tremble, save him whom God hath preserved through His power and sovereignty. Beware lest ye join partners with God. Verily, He hath ever been One in His Essence, and hath taken unto Himself neither partner nor likeness nor kinship nor offspring. All before Him are equal, and whoso ascendeth unto Him and cleaveth unto Him is of those who have attained the highest Paradise, and whoso denieth and joineth partners with God, verily, he is not of Him and He is quit of him, whereunto the realities of all things bear witness, but the people comprehend not a word from God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Merciful. And sorrow be upon thee from these sorrows which have encompassed the Pen of the All-Glorious.

He is the Ever-Abiding, the Eternal, the All-Powerful, the Most Glorious!

O Najaf-'Ali! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord from the right hand of the Throne, and be thou enraptured by the holy melodies. Beware lest thou hearken with the ear wherewith thou hearest the sounds of created things, but rather with that hearing which God hath made specially for His melodies, that He may strengthen thee in His Cause and raise thee to the heaven of glorious love, and bring thee to that station wherein thou shalt stand before Him, even though thou be far removed from the gardens of nearness. And thou shalt drink at all times from the cup of His bounty such that none shall be able to prevent thee from attaining this station which is, in truth, praiseworthy.

Beware lest thou turn to anyone save thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Place thy trust in Him, and He shall suffice thee against all who dwell on earth. Know thou that We have loved thee aforetime and now, and have ordained for thee in the Tablet a station which none can attain save those who have attained the presence of their Lord and have been illumined by the lights of manifest glory. This is of God's bounty unto thee, that thou remain steadfast in His love at a time when the feet of the mystics slip from the straight path of exalted glory.

Therefore, render thanks unto God, thy Lord, for having made thee to know the Manifestation of His Self, and caused thee to be among those who associate with His Beauty, and made thee to journey with Him through months and years, and acquainted thee with mysteries whereof none are aware save those who have followed His good-pleasure and have detached themselves from every rebellious rejecter. Thou hast witnessed the sovereignty of God with thine own eyes and heard the melodies of God with thine own ears, and wert in the pavilion of eternity and the tabernacle of glory both evening and morn. And thou hast reckoned His sovereignty and His power and His might and His grandeur, such that all who are on earth were in the grasp of His power like a handful of dust.

Beware lest thou forget the bounty of thy Lord or doubt His power and sovereignty, for He will not leave thee to thyself but will preserve thee from every rejected satan. Act thou according to what We have counselled thee aforetime, and follow the words of God after their revelation, and walk thou the paths of justice.

O My servant! Hearken unto the counsels of thy Beloved Who loveth thee, that thou mayest be, through thy Lord's grace, victorious amongst the peoples of the world. First, forget not the bounty of thy Lord, then walk thou the paths of His good-pleasure in this Path which is, in truth, manifest. Beware lest thou associate partners with God, thy Lord, or pride thyself over anyone, and stand thou upon the path of courtesy before thy Lord. Though thou seest Him not, verily He seeth thee, and with Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and the knowledge of what was and what will be, and He doth encompass all things.

Then be thou steadfast in the love of thy Lord to such a degree that if all who are on earth were to gather against thee otherwise, nothing would enter thy mind, and thou wouldst stand firm like unto the letter "alif" at the end of My name. Thus doth the Pen of counsel teach thee from these Fingers which were, through grace, extended. Be thou possessed of the attributes of thy Lord, and humble before those who love thy Master - this is My command unto thee and unto every possessor of sublime love. Be thou as fire unto His enemies and as light unto His loved ones, that thy fragrance may be diffused throughout the East and West of the earth, and thou mayest become a luminous lamp among the worlds.

Then remind every soul that hath submitted to thy Lord with that wherewith We have reminded thee, and inform them that the Ancient Beauty hath entered into two prisons, one of which thou knowest and every possessor of knowledge knoweth with insight, and the other none knoweth save God, thy Lord and the Lord of all things and the Lord of all the worlds.

In the Sacred Precincts, He is the Most Exalted, the Resplendent, the All-Glorious

O Leaf of Paradise! Bear thou witness within thyself that there is none other God but Him, and that 'Ali before Muhammad is His Beauty, His Mystery, His Command, His Grace, His Mercy, His Remembrance, His Manifestation and His Concealment to all who are in the heavens and on earth. Through Him were the heavens raised up and from the earth were revealed treasures of transcendent glory. Through Him were the clouds lifted up, the sun did shine, and the moon of the Cause gleamed forth from a holy and luminous dayspring. Through Him did rivers flow, seas surge, and fire appear from the Divine Lote Tree made manifest.

Therefore render thanks unto God that the All-Merciful established Himself upon thee in the form of the name 'Ali, and that thou wert the Throne of God though none among the believers, even the most distinguished, knew thereof. Thou didst commune with God thy Lord and didst enter the depths of union with Him in ancient times. Thy soul was joined to the soul of the All-Merciful and thou wert overtaken by the lights of the daybreak of His presence - a station none hath attained, whether lowly or great. Thou didst experience the Resurrection and enter the highest paradise in His presence, and wert honored with the meeting of God before the creation of the heavens and earth - this hath been sent down from the Pen of the Most Resplendent Name. Thine eyes beheld the Eye through whose movement all created things offered up their souls, as testified by a clear and glorious Tablet. Thou didst hear the melodies of God with thine ears and wert established in the most exalted Paradise. Thou wert a mirror of God as the sun of love shone upon thee in perfect form, and thou wert anointed by thy Lord every morn and eve.

Blessed art thou, O Leaf of Eternity, O Land of Faithfulness, O City on High in the sacred precincts of nearness! Thou art the first Throne to appear in creation, as ordained in a preserved and mighty Book. Thou art the first earth upon which descended the waters of longing, drinking from a sweet and flowing spring. Thou art the first garden wherein sang the Nightingale of Holiness with verses that encompassed all worlds. Thou art the first station whereon shone the Pre-existent Sun, though thou knewest it not. Thus did thy Lord's mercy precede thee and His grace encompass thee from the presence of One Mighty, Praiseworthy.

All this came upon thee while thou wert heedless thereof. And when thou didst become aware within thyself and turn to God, We revealed unto thee what had been hidden from thee and from all possessed of insight. Thus do We bring forth the earth's treasures and pearls for whomsoever We wish, for verily We have power over all things. Were We to wish, We could bring forth from every land its pearls and mysteries and whatsoever is treasured therein, but what is decreed is decreed and judgment hath been passed.

Know thou that what indicated thy love for thy Lord hath come before Us, and We have answered thee with verses that would confound the minds of the wise and the understanding of every knower. This is that thy heart might find peace, thy soul be tranquil, and thou rejoice with exceeding joy. Preserve thou this Tablet and recite it every day. Let none prevent thee, even if all on earth should try. Thou art the best among the women of the world if thou remainest steadfast in love. Recite this Tablet with sweet and manifest melody that thy song may ascend to the Divine Lote Tree and thy fragrance draw thee to a faithful and holy dawning-place. The Spirit, Glory and Great Declaration be upon thee, that thy protection may encompass all worlds.

He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Speaker, the Manifest, the All-Knowing

We make mention of him who was named Farajullah and who emigrated with his Lord, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Wise, the All-Knowing. By the life of God, verily thy Lord's grace hath encompassed the world. Every atom beareth witness to His generosity, as do they who circle round His mighty throne. By the face of God, He hath come with a mercy that hath preceded all created things. To this all things bear witness, yet most people are heedless. And by the Word of God, His bounty hath encompassed existence itself. The tongue of the Adored One hath testified to this as He was established upon the throne and spoke: "There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Praised." And the Beauty of the Beloved - His loving-kindness hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. To this bear witness all trees and leaves, and beyond them the mountains and the seas, yet the people remain behind a mighty veil.

We have mentioned him whose name We have recalled, who turned to God, and We have immortalized his remembrance in Our perspicuous Tablet. We now make mention of what was presented before the Throne when his residence was in this Prison, which is circled by the Concourse on High and the near-stationed angels. We were seated upon the carpet when the servant in attendance appeared and mentioned that which had saddened his Lord, the Speaker, the All-Informed. O Farajullah! Hearken unto the call from this exalted Prison: "There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Inaccessible." Let not what hath befallen thy handmaiden sadden thee, for she hath ascended unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Rather rejoice that she turned toward God when she departed from the Land of Bounty, advancing toward the Land of Mystery - that place wherein the Herald proclaimed: "The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Wondrous!" She directed herself, hastened, entered in, attained, and heard the call of her Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. She was with her Lord in the Land of Mystery, abided beneath the shade of His mercy, heard His call, was honored to hearken unto His verses, and was gladdened by what she witnessed of the traces of her Lord's mercy, the Generous.

We make mention of her on this day and give thee these glad-tidings that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. By My life! My grace hath preceded the world and nothing in the heavens or earth can prevent it. Thus have We mentioned her that she might attain unto the remembrance of her Lord, and We have sent this unto thee that thou mayest be among the thankful. Hast thou witnessed any greater bounty than this? Nay, by the Self of Truth - yet most people remain heedless. The call hath been raised between earth and heaven, and the sun of grace shineth from the horizon of generosity, yet most nations are among the losers. Blessed is the eye that no veil of desire hath prevented and the face that hath turned toward God, the Mighty, the Wise.

Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken as He walked in this mighty Prison. And the glory rest upon him and upon all who have preferred the love of God to all else on earth and who have remained firm in His Cause. O Pen Most High! Make mention of the loved ones of thy Lord who circle round the Throne and have entered this Prison which hath been named the Most Great Prison by God, the Mighty, the Great. We beseech God to make you such that nothing on earth may come between us and you. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Answerer, the Generous. You are there and We are in this spot, yet We make mention of you as a bounty from Our presence, that ye may be among the thankful. By the life of God! You are beneath the glances of My loving-kindness and before Mine eyes. To this My mercy and My tenderness bear witness, as do they whom We have acquainted with this wise Cause. We beseech God to assist you in that which will exalt your station and God's station, and to aid you in that which will cause your remembrance to endure throughout the kingdom of your Lord, the Ordainer, the Faithful. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.

O 'Attar, he who hath attained unto Our presence and won Our good-pleasure, who speaketh the truth and manifesteth justice! The essence of praise and thanksgiving, and the very source of gratitude, beseemeth and befitteth that Desired One Who was not deterred from reformation by the tyranny of oppressors, the turning away of the heedless, or the corruption of the mischief-makers, nor was He prevented by their acts from exercising His all-pervasive and penetrating Will. O 'Attar! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, raised from the prison of 'Akka. Verily, He uniteth hearts and revealeth that which lieth hidden in the breasts. This call is, in one station, as a spirit unto bodies, and in another station, as the Water of Life unto all existence. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto and drunk thereof in My Name, the All-Loving, the Bountiful. The letter thou didst send to him who beareth the name of God - upon him be My glory - was forwarded to the Most Holy Court, where it was presented and heard. O 'Attar! Upon thee be the glory of God, thy Lord, the Chosen One. I speak the truth when I say that manifest tribulations and sorrows have encompassed the Truth - exalted be His glory. Wert thou to become aware of them, thou wouldst weep by night and day like unto one bereft, by reason of what hath befallen Me at the hands of those whom We caused to hear Our call, to whom We showed Our path, whom We guided to Our straight way, whom We aided to turn toward Our direction, and whom We gave to drink from the Kawthar of Our reunion and the cup of Our presence, the Mighty, the Wondrous. O 'Attar! Upon thee be My glory and My peace. Should anyone ask thee concerning the All-Glorious, say: He is caught in the talons of hatred. There hath befallen Him that which no pen in all the world can move to recount or enumerate, nor can any ink record. To this doth testify He with Whom are the treasuries of verses and the Preserved Book. Refresh and gladden the friends with the Kawthar of the utterance of Him Who is the Goal of all the worlds. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid them to stand firm with such steadfastness as no law of the world nor anything possessed by the nations can prevent from turning toward the Most Great Ocean, from whose waves can be heard: "The Owner of all things hath come! The Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting!" Be not grieved at what hath befallen you. Soon shall the oppressors behold the recompense of their deeds. Verily, thy Lord is the Just, the All-Wise. What is necessary and obligatory today is that the loved ones should remain steadfast and immovable in the Cause with the utmost firmness, and should shun whatsoever giveth off the odor of mischief. At present most kings and subjects bear witness to this community's freedom from corruption. Should they observe even the slightest association with the corrupt - nay, less than the eye of a needle - they would arise to inflict grievous oppression. Say: O My loved ones! Ye are mines of the pearls of steadfastness. Defile not yourselves with the vain imaginings of the corrupt. Such is the counsel of the Wronged One unto His loved ones. Blessed are they that act accordingly. Today is the day of teaching. With wisdom and utterance must ye cleanse the people of the world from the defilement of corruption, conflict and contention, and draw them to the direction of the One Beloved Friend. Verily, He hath come for the reformation of the world and the refinement of the souls of His servants. To this testify His holy Tablets, His revealed Books, His manifest mysteries, and this clear Book in this brilliant station. The son who beareth My name, Husayn, brought the letter of thy son into Our presence. We read it and have revealed for thee and for thy son and for those with thee that which cannot be equaled by the pearls of the seas, nor by the mines in the mountains, nor by the treasuries of kings. Adorn all the members of that household, on behalf of the Wronged One, with the ornament of loving-kindness and with the embellishment of bounty and mercy. They have ever been mentioned in Our Tablets, and mention of each one hath been sent down from the Most Exalted Pen. The glory be upon thee and upon My loved ones and friends, and upon My leaves who have hearkened unto the call and believed in God, the One, the All-Informed.

To His Honor Aqa Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be the peace of God

He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power

Praise sanctified above letters and words befitteth the Revealer of verses and the Manifestor of evidences, Who hath quickened the world through the Kawthar of utterance and guided it. This Kawthar in one station is the utterance of the Purpose of all worlds, which appeareth from the Kingdom of might and power. Verily He hath ever been sanctified above all names, remembrances, attributes, hand and tongue. And in the second manifestation it is the station of the Book, namely the Furqan, whereby He quickened and bestowed life, exalted be His glory and universal be His bounty. And blessings and peace be upon the Essence of existence and the Sovereign of the unseen and the seen, and upon His family and companions through whom God's commandments and laws were made manifest in His lands and the banners of His oneness were raised among His servants.

Thereafter, as the letter of that honored and kind friend indicated the well-being of the friends, this evanescent servant was filled with the utmost joy and gladness. I beseech and implore God to protect His loved ones and assist them in that which is befitting. Today it is incumbent and obligatory upon all to aid the manifest religion through prayer, that perchance cities and lands may be preserved from the oppression of the idolaters and the transgressions of the deniers. O brother! Each day they seize and carry off \[a portion\], yet none hath discovered the cause or understood the reason. I beseech God to unite the people of divine unity and make them aware, that they may act with one hand and eat with one mouth. The purpose is that they may become adorned with the true unity of religion. This is the first deed, the first adornment, and the first station. Blessed is he who attaineth, and woe unto every heedless doubter.

It is evident that the government is occupied day and night with reform, order and the manifestation of truth. Now the people must unite and sincerely implore God, exalted be His glory, that perchance the fire of the greed of the deniers may be quenched and the flames of self and passion may be stilled. Verily our Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. Verily He is the Hearing, the Answering, and nigh unto response.

As for the new secretary, praise be to God, he is capable in both prose and poetry. I beseech God to cause two sweet, delicate and pleasant rivers of verse and prose to flow from both sides of his pen. Verily He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word "Be" and it is. Convey my greetings to him, and his mention was made before the face of his Lord Who showed him kindness, and likewise towards your honor. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist Jinab-i-Mirza Muhammad-Qabil-Rida in that which causeth the exaltation of stations.

The table sent through His Honor AF, upon him be 966 \[Baha'u'llah\], the Most Glorious, arrived and was indeed most excellent, desirable and acceptable. As for the two boxes you mentioned, they will be received. And regarding the tea, let it not escape your notice - the purpose is to know what kind it is. Even if it is only a few mithqals it suffices; it need not be much. Peace and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon the people of divine unity among God's servants, the Lord of all worlds. And praise be to Him, for He is the Goal of those who know.

He is the Rememberer, the Consoler, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise

Praise be sanctified above mention and utterance and all that is in creation, befitting the court of the Beloved of the worlds, Who hath ordained death and life as herald and warner in a single station. Through the first He illumined hearts and souls with the light of promise and adorned them with the seal of "Verily I am God's", and through the second the fear of God was made manifest, whereby He restrained the self and passion from transgression. Outward life in one sense merits the decree of veil, but when it is removed the Hand of bounty raises high the banner of nearness and meeting. Great is His glory! Let those near drawn rejoice in the Kawthar of attainment and the sincere in the fragrant breezes of nearness and beauty.

O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention in this station of him who drank the wine of certitude and attained the Companion, who believed in the Lord of all beings when the people of tyranny and oppression denied Him. He was named Muhammad-'Ali in the Book of Names. Say: The first wave that surged from the ocean of grace, the first fragrance that wafted from the utterance of the Most Great Name, and the first light that shone from the horizon of the world be upon thee, O thou whom God adorned in His days with the pearls of submission and contentment and the gems of glory, wisdom and faithfulness. I testify that thou didst drink the choice wine of understanding from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, when all in creation were deprived thereof. Thou art he whom the might of the oppressors deterred not from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of lords, and whom the veils of the transgressors prevented not from gazing toward His Most Luminous Horizon. Thou didst shatter the idol of vain imaginings with the arm of certitude and illumine thy heart with the light of the knowledge of God, the Lord of all beings and the King of days. Blessed art thou for having been mentioned by the Pen of Bounty before and after thy ascension, as a grace from God, the Lord of Names. At this moment We beseech Him to send down upon thee at all times mercy and loving-kindness from His presence, and to cause thee to enter with the people of Baha into the Most Exalted Paradise. He, verily, is the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below, the Lord of the world to come and of this world.

Glorified art Thou, O my God, O Thou Who causeth the winds to blow, Who sendeth down the Tablets and ordaineth good fortune and prosperity! I beseech Thee by the pearls hidden in the ocean of Thy knowledge and the mysteries treasured in the repositories of Thy protection to forgive him and those who visit him, through that which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy Will and the atmosphere of Thy good-pleasure. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy generosity that hath encompassed all created things and by Thy bounty that hath embraced all existence to rain down upon Thy loved ones from the clouds of Thy grace the showers of Thy mercy. Then ordain for them the good of this world and the world to come through Thy Will and Purpose. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Vanquisher, the Powerful. And verily Thou art the Forgiving, the Generous, the Kind, the Merciful.

O My leaf and My handmaiden! Praise be to God that the door of bounty is opened and the rain of mercy is pouring from the heaven of grace. Through His Name the Sun of Certitude hath shone in this moment upon all who are in the realm of possibility, and the heaven of wisdom and utterance hath been adorned with the stars of the knowledge of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. We beseech God to confirm thee in supreme steadfastness and to draw thee to a station wherein nothing among all things shall prevent thee from the remembrance of thy Lord, the Possessor of the Kingdom of Names and Creator of heaven. We make mention of My leaves and handmaidens there and give them glad tidings of the ocean of My bounty and the heaven of My generosity and the sun of My grace, whereby existence hath been illumined in both the unseen and the visible realms. The glory of God be upon thee and upon them from God, the Mighty, the Loving.

O Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God! He is God - exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power!

Praise be sanctified above all manifestations of contingent beings and conditions of created things, befitting the Court of the Intended One Who, through one exalted blessed Word, brought the world from nothingness into being, and through the wonders of His bounty and generosity adorned it above all other things with the crown of distinction, and guided it to the holy carpet of nearness to His presence. And from among humanity He sent forth certain souls who were sanctified from the conditions, veils, allusions and indications of creation, dispatching them with the royal seal of "I am the Truth" and sending them to guide mankind. And all these holy souls who were the manifestations of divine knowledge and dawning-places of heavenly wisdom were afflicted with countless trials. And this holy, blessed, and exalted chain ended with the Seal of the Prophets and King of the Chosen Ones, through whom the gate of heaven was opened and the Nightingale of Eternity sang upon the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree that which the Tongue of Grandeur had spoken before the existence of all things: Verily there is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. I pray and send peace upon Him and upon those whom God made the Dawning-Places of His Cause, the Rising-Points of His Names, the Manifestations of His Signs, the Recipients of His Revelation, the Sources of His Clear Proofs, and the Settings of His penetrating Wisdom - those servants who were adorned with the ornament of divine authority and were honored among creation with pure servitude to the face of God, the Lord of all beings.

Glory be unto Thee, O Answerer of the prayers of the supplicants and Guide of bewildered souls! I beseech Thee by Thy Prophets, the Messengers, and the near-stationed angels to assist Thy servants to recognize the Dawning-Places of Thy Revelation and the Rising-Points of Thy Inspiration. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Thereafter, your letter which was the cause of joy and gladness arrived and the fragrances of love were inhaled from it. God willing, you will be occupied with the remembrance of the Lord of all beings throughout all nights and days. Praise be to God that through the favors of the True One, exalted be His glory, you have attained to that which is today the cause and means of salvation. This station is great in the sight of God. God willing, you will be assisted to preserve it. Verily He giveth to whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He willeth and withholdeth from whomsoever He desireth whatsoever He desireth. This evanescent servant beseecheth the True One, exalted be His glory, to make you successful in all matters and to assign you an abode in the shade of the Tree of His loving-kindness. Verily He is the Generous, the Bountiful. Praise be unto Him for He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.

Furthermore, after perusing your august letter, it was at one time presented and He said: "God willing, may they be assisted to perform good deeds and manifest spiritual qualities that are pleasing to Him. We counsel him with wisdom and kindness. In no matter should they depart from wisdom, and they must ever be attentive to it." End quote. Praise be to God, you have come under the glances of His favor. God willing, you will, in the name of the Beloved of the worlds, keep this station protected from the eyes of the treacherous. And concerning what you wrote about steadfastness and certitude - this station deserves thanks and praise. The Almighty Truth is witness and testifier that this servant has always sought and continues to seek lofty stations of steadfastness for the friends and masters. He is the Generous, He is the Merciful, He is the All-Knowing, He is the Answerer, He is the Watchful. We have placed our trust in Him in all conditions and circumstances and have committed all affairs unto Him. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. The Glory be upon you and upon those who have held fast to the Sure Handle and have acknowledged the unity of God, the Lord of all worlds. And praise be to God, the Goal of the mystics and the Object of worship of all who are in the heavens and the earth.

The Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Great

The Remembrance of God from the Divine Lote-Tree upon the glowing Spot hath been raised up in truth, and every people heareth from it that there is no God but Him, and He Who hath come with the truth hath been the Guardian over all the worlds. He is the Beauty of the Cause in the Most Exalted Concourse, and the Mystery of the Manifestation in the unseen cloud, and the Hidden Book within the pavilion of grandeur, and the Temple of Eternity amidst the world, and the Most Great Name unto him who is powerful in the Cause. O people of creation! Know ye your Lord, the All-Merciful, and be not veiled from Him Who hath come in the shadows of the Names with a sovereignty that encompasseth all the worlds. At His right hand marcheth the Kingdom of divine knowledge and at His left hand the Realm of utterance, and before Him the hosts of revelation and inspiration. Thus hath the matter been decreed by the Pen of might in truth. Say: O people! Fear ye the All-Merciful and follow not Satan, for he is far removed from truth. O people of the earth! Hearken unto that which the Spirit hath imparted to the heart of the Bayan and that which the Tongue of Eternity speaketh at the midmost heart of the world, when the Beauty of the All-Merciful was established upon the throne of power with a command that was mighty in its concealment. Hasten ye to the Kawthar of revelation and the choice wine of inspiration. This is what ye were promised in the Tablets, did ye but know it. By God! Whoso pondereth today, the melodies of the All-Merciful will draw him to the heaven of good-pleasure and purify him from human limitations and bring him nigh unto the Most Great Prospect. He is powerful over all things. Say: Turn ye, O people, unto the countenance of God and His Cause, then rend asunder the veils of idle fancy by His sovereignty. Beware lest ye be frightened by the might of those who are veiled from the Cause. Say: Nothing shall profit you this day, even should ye bring forth all the books of the world. Thus hath it been decreed by the Pen that was renowned by the name of God. Cast ye aside all allusions and intimations, place them beneath your feet, and turn with radiant faces unto a station that hath been illumined by the lights of the Throne. Say: This is the One Who called out to Moses in Sinai, and the Beloved when He drew nigh unto the Most Exalted Horizon. Be ye thankful unto God for this bounty and be not among the ungrateful sinners. Through Him the spirit of life was breathed into all creation and all things spoke when the breezes of reunion wafted. Thus hath the matter been sent down in truth from the heaven of revelation. O people of creation! Purify your ears to hearken unto My most sweet call, and sanctify your hearts from human veils, and turn unto the Most Great Prospect, the station wherein speaketh the Lord of Destiny. This is what ye have been commanded in a Tablet that hath been preserved by God's command. Behold what ye were promised in the Tablets, then behold Him Who hath appeared in truth, that ye may find a path unto God. Say: By the Lord of existence! He is the Promised One, and when the appointed time came, He appeared with the kingdom of verses. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Him, turning away from every sinful one who was deprived of the fragrances of revelation. When We heard of thy turning unto God, We sent down this Tablet for thee and dispatched it unto thee that thou mayest find from it the fragrance of the All-Merciful and arise to aid His Cause with wisdom and utterance. God is witness unto what I say. It behooveth every soul to manifest from him that which will profit him in the Kingdom and establish his name in a Tablet that hath been adorned by the Most Exalted Pen. This is a station that is not equaled by aught created on earth, and God is knowing of what I say. Arise with the most great steadfastness, then rend asunder the veils of creation by the name of thy Lord, the Lord of all names. This is better for thee than all that thou hast wrought in thy days. The Tongue of grandeur and glory beareth witness unto this, and beyond it the denizens of Paradise and those who circle round this station that hath been known by the name of God.

He is the Mighty, the Triumphant, the Powerful

The remembrance of God from the sacred leaf upon the tree of paradise in this hallowed and luminous spot. God, there is no God but Him. Verily the Tree of the Bayan was the first tree raised up in truth, and it spoke: "I am God, the Mighty, the Generous." Through it the fire was kindled in existence and the beauty of the Worshipped One appeared to every seeing eye. Through it the face of polytheism was veiled and the beauty of divine unity dawned from the dayspring of the name All-Knowing. Through it the idols were shattered and God was established upon the throne of manifest might. Through it mysteries were revealed, lights shone forth, and darkness was transformed by this rising, luminous dawn. Thus do my tongue, my heart, my bones, my form, my body, and this wise and brilliant Pen bear witness. Say: By God the Truth, my lips will not open concerning that which hath aroused hatred in the hearts of the polytheists, nor will my tongue move with that which God my Lord taught me before the creation of the heavens and earths. Say: We desire not to speak a word, but the Spirit speaks within my breast and causes to flow from my pen whatsoever He willeth, for He doeth what He pleaseth. Therefore, O concourse of the earth, take not vengeance upon me for this, but judge fairly in my cause and be not of the wrongdoers. And if this be my crime and sin, and the word of the sinners hath been fulfilled against me, then have mercy, O people, upon me and upon my exile and my suffering and my tribulation at the hands of the deniers. Fear God and transgress not the bounds of God which ye have been commanded to observe in the Book of God, the King, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Thus did the Dove speak before and speaketh now with verses of compelling attraction, that God's favor may be completed for those who have believed and His proof may be perfected against the turn-aways.

O Leaf of Paradise! Thy letter hath come before Us and We have learned what was therein, and We were among the witnesses. We heard thy cry of separation after the fire of longing was kindled in thy breast, and We learned what was therein of every sigh and lamentation. Verily thou didst weep in places of joy, so how much more in this tribulation which hath dawned from the horizon of God by mighty decree. And if thou shouldst weep in this sorrow for the duration of the kingdom and rend the garment of patience, thou wouldst be justified, for by this the mantle of grandeur was rent, the mountains of the Cause were leveled, and the Maids of Heaven cried out in chambers of holy and luminous sanctity. But if thine eyes should turn toward the direction of patience, this would be better for thee with God, thy Lord, the Patient, the Powerful, the Mighty. And if thou desirest to know what hath befallen Us after Our departure from the City of God, the Mighty, the Generous, know that We journeyed for four known months until We arrived at this prison, which is cut off from the feet of seekers, for it lieth beyond upraised mountains and unnumbered cities and a surging sea and a deep ravine. And We remained therein in sorrow and bewilderment until God should please, for He is the best of judges and the wisest of rulers. And thou, remember thou Our days, then Our sorrow, then Our exile and what befell Us from these wrongdoers. Thus have We imparted to thee what was decreed for Us in this journey and inspired thee with that which is concealed from the eyes of the mystics. Then convey Our remembrance to all who are in thy land of those who have believed in God and turned away from every rebellious devil. And the Spirit and the light and the glory and the splendor be upon thee and upon every servant who turneth repentant unto God Who created him and fashioned him and made him to be of the guided ones.

O Nazir!

In Rajab - He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious

Praised be He Who has favored man with utterance and made him the dayspring of exposition in the contingent world. Exalted be the All-Merciful Who adorned him with reason and through it manifested justice, that He might complete His favor upon His servants. Blessed is he who has turned away from desire and held fast to that which was commanded by God, the Lord of all beings and the Sovereign of the hereafter and of the first life, Who adorned the world with His Most Great Name and made it a straight balance among the nations. Verily He is the One Whom God made utterance a gift unto Himself and a leaf from among the leaves of the paradise of His remembrance and utterance, and Who testified to His sanctification above the indication of every indicator, the knowledge of every knower, the utterance of every utterer and the description of every describer. Yea, by His might, this is the truth - whoso holdeth fast unto it shall live, and whoso turneth away from it is accounted among the most lost in the perspicuous Book.

And now, the servant's eye hath been gladdened by your letter, and from it he found the fragrance of your love, your faithfulness, your sincerity and your arising to serve the Cause of God, our Beloved and the Beloved of the heavens and earths. I beseech God to preserve you and grant you the good of the hereafter and this world, and to assist you at all times to say as one hath said: "Speak Persian though Arabic is more pleasing."

It is submitted that the messenger arrived and attained the presence of the Desired One, but his coming was without permission. Glory be to God! Despite your constant writing that you prevent the friends from turning towards the Most Holy Court so that none might move without God's leave, nevertheless groups arrive each day and after returning speak as they wish and say what they desire, save whom God willeth. There is no doubt that some souls upon returning relate and report according to their own desires, and this matter has been and is a cause of harm which none comprehend save the wise ones. That which the Truth, glorified and exalted be He, has ever commanded the loved ones to do and will continue to command them to do, has been for the good of all, but none hear it save the sincere ones. If a soul truly looks to God's consummate wisdom in what He commands, he will certainly not move contrary to God's will, with complete contentment and submission. The people know not their own good, and most do not accept from the wise counselor. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist all to do what He loves and is pleased with.

If you wish news of the Most Great Prison, it remains in the same condition that you observed. No new matter has arisen, and the affairs of the rebellious city were submitted before. That which the All-Merciful revealed in the Tablets has come to pass. His honor Mulla Ali-Akbar, upon him be 966 \[Baha'u'llah\], previously set out and a detailed petition was submitted to that Beloved One, and likewise his honor Abu-Badi, upon him be the Glory of God, with a detailed petition. I beseech the Truth, glorified and exalted be He, to make all the loved ones of that land steadfast in His Cause and to adorn all with the ornament of love and unity, that the fragrance of discord may be utterly cut off and they may engage in teaching God's Cause with perfect wisdom and sanctity. This is the matter that has been and will be the cause of the exaltation of God's Word and the turning of souls to the supreme horizon. Blessed is he who acts according to what was commanded, and woe to the heedless ones.

The Glory be upon you and upon those with you who have spoken the truth and followed His clear and straight path. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

O Siyyid Husayn, He is the Most Wondrous in the Most Glorious Horizon!

Glorified be He Who hath sent down the verses in truth and made them a guidance and remembrance for all the worlds, and through them hath caused the servants to know His exalted and mighty Self, and through them hath caused all created things to speak forth that which He hath testified of Himself by His own Self, that there is none other God but I, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.

He whose vision God hath made penetrating recognizeth Him by His own Self and by His manifestation between the heavens and the earth. And for him who is powerless to recognize His Self by His Self, He hath made the verses a proof, lest he be deprived of the Sun of Divine knowledge in the days of his Lord, and that His proof may be completed unto all His servants. This is of His grace unto them, that they may be thankful and be numbered among the grateful ones.

Be thou steadfast, O thou who gazest upon God, in the Cause of thy Lord. By God the Truth! There hath appeared a test whereby all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck, save those whose hands God took within the hands of grace and delivered from the wrongdoing people, and aided them through the truth, and sent down upon their hearts tranquility from His presence, and severed them from the idolaters. But the test is a test for those who are not firm in the Cause. As for him who is established upon the throne of certitude and hath recognized God by His own Self, the tempests of trials shall not move him, nor shall the hurricanes of tests, and they shall not turn their gaze from a holy and gracious scene. These have passed beyond this world and all that is therein, even though outwardly they may be occupied with its bounties, for God hath made their hearts purified from the mention of aught else but Him and hath chosen them for His most wondrous and glorious remembrance.

Be thou steadfast in the Cause in such wise that should all who are in the heavens and on earth oppose thee, thou wouldst not be disturbed within thyself and wouldst be of them that are firmly established. Thus have We imparted unto thee the word of truth that thy heart may be gladdened thereby and thou mayest remember thy Lord amongst His idolatrous servants.

Know thou that thy letter hath come before Us and We have witnessed that wherewith thou didst call upon God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Blessed art thou, O servant, for having attained unto the recognition of thy Lord. However, strive within thyself to be among the steadfast ones whom no hindrance can hinder, nor the gloating of enemies, nor the turning away of all creation. Rend asunder the veils, then behold thy Lord with thine own eyes, then detach thyself from the eyes of all the worlds, for whoso gazeth upon Him with any eye but His own shall never know Him, and this is an undoubted truth.

Know thou further that God hath accepted from thee what thou hast done and what thou hast not done, as a grace from His presence, for He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. He hath ordained for thee in the heaven of His Cause that which He hath desired for thyself. Soon shall it descend upon thee - fear not, neither be thou grieved, for He is the Protector of the doers of good. He shall provide thee with the good of this world and the next if thy feet slip not from this Path which hath been raised up in truth from the presence of One mighty and wise. He knoweth what is in thy heart and in His grasp is the kingdom of all things. He giveth what He willeth and taketh what He pleaseth.

Beware lest thou grieve over anything save that which hath befallen My own Self from him who was created by My word, and God is witness unto this. Today the feet have slipped of those who have taken vain imaginings as their lord instead of God and were behind a mighty veil. Beware lest thou consort with those in whose hearts thou perceivest hatred for God, thy Lord and the Lord of all that hath been created between the heavens and the earth. Thus have We instructed thee and made mention of thee at this time when sorrows have encompassed Me from every direction from those who have been heedless of the remembrance of God, the Mighty, the Wise.

The Spirit and Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee among those who have been seized by the breezes of the Cause from this exalted Paradise.

In the Name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most High! God beareth witness that there is no God but Him and that this is indeed 'Ali Who hath appeared from the horizon of the Most Glorious. He heareth and seeth and speaketh in all things saying "I am God, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Luminous." I have sent the Messengers from before which hath no before, and I shall send until an end which none among contingent beings can reckon save My All-Numbering, All-Knowing Self. We have ordained in every name the dawning-places of Our most beautiful names and the manifestations of Our most exalted attributes, and We reveal from it as We wish according to a measured decree, if ye be of those who know. And We have made all things mirrors of My Self that they might face this Sun, the Dawning, the Holy, the Manifest, the Wondrous. Thus hath My mercy encompassed all contingent things and My grace all the worlds. And thou, O First Pillar of My Name, hear My call from this Tree which hath been raised up in truth and speaketh at the pole of eternity that "There is no God but Him and that this Beauty is His splendor unto all who are in the heavens and the earth." Thy mention hath been made before the Face, therefore have We sent down unto thee the verses and dispatched them to thee as a grace from Us upon thee that thou mayest be of the thankful. We have heard the yearning of thy heart and thy longing for God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord in these days wherein all souls are disturbed and all feet have slipped save those whom God hath preserved through a power from Him, for He is the Mighty, the Powerful. Then know thou that he whom We created through a breath from the breaths that appeared from a Pen of ancient glory - when the sweet savors of might wafted forth he emerged from behind the veil and warred against My Supreme, Most Great Self. When God preserved Me from his plot, he then arose with another plot. By God the Truth! He hath fabricated such words against Me whose falsehood would be recognized by anyone possessed of discernment though it be less than a barley-corn. Were someone to say that the Most Great Sea containeth no water, would any soul accept this? No, by My True Self, save every remote ignorant one. And were it to be said the sun hath no light, would any soul believe it? No, by My True Self, if ye be of the certain ones. By God the Truth! All that he hath attributed to My Holy, Transcendent, Mighty, All-Knowing Self - its falsehood is more obvious than what We have mentioned to thee, were people to look with their eyes and be of those who see. And thou - purify thyself from all veils then place these ones beneath thy left foot. Put thy trust in God in all matters and be of those who trust. Take care that thou grieve not at anything - rather rejoice in the gladness of the Cause though at this moment the Eye of God weepeth and His heart yearneth and His tongue uttereth this wise remembrance. And were We to detail for thee what hath befallen Us, thou wouldst forget all that thou hast heard from the beginning of creation until now, and God is witness and knowing of this. But We have concealed it, and God shall soon manifest one who will mention it truthfully among all creatures. Say: O people! By God! These fabricated, false words will never veil the Ancient Beauty nor change the Cause of God though all the worlds should oppose from behind these ones. And thou, O servant, hear My call then be steadfast in My Cause and fear no one, for thy Lord will guard thee from the hosts of devils. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who are steadfast in the Cause through the sovereignty of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wise.

In the Name of the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!

God beareth witness to what We have inscribed upon the Crimson Scroll with Our Most Exalted Pen. Were We to make mention of it, verily all who are in the heavens and on earth would be struck with thunderous awe. Therefore have We safeguarded it through Our protection and veiled it through Our sovereignty. Verily, I am the Omnipotent over whatsoever I desire. There is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

We have manifested the Cause and raised aloft the standards. The might of every oppressor hath not rendered Us powerless, nor hath the clamor of the heedless veiled Us. We act in the kingdom as We please and ordain whatsoever We desire through Our power that prevaileth over the worlds. This is not a lamp that can be extinguished by the winds, nor a fire that can be quenched by the gestures of the opposers. The former hath appeared with a light whereby the heavens and earth were illumined, and the latter with a flame that hath set ablaze the hearts of the sincere ones. This is not a ship that can be shaken by the winds, or drowned by the seas, or shattered by the rocks. By God! This is the Ark of God that traverseth both land and sea, whose captain is the Will of the All-Merciful, and whose passengers are the people of Baha in all creation. Exalted be God, its Maker and Creator, the All-Wise, the All-Informed.

Arise with the arising of thy Lord. Say: O people of the mortal realm! By God, the Lord of the Kingdom hath come, and the Realm of Might circleth round Him, if ye be of them that know. Say: O people of learning! The Sealed Wine hath been unsealed by the finger of the Self-Subsisting. Come ye unto Him and be not of them that tarry. O people of the Furqan! By God, that which ye were promised in the Book hath appeared. Fear ye God and deny not the Cause of God when it hath appeared with the truth, and dispute not the signs of God when they have been sent down from this heaven. Turn ye unto God, your Ancient Lord. The breezes of grace have wafted, the carpet of justice hath been spread, the mountains have passed away, and the Beauty hath shone forth with a light that neither the veils of the wicked can conceal, nor the idle fancies of the hearts of the polytheists can obscure. Through it the Beauty of Divine Unity hath appeared and been established upon the throne of detachment. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Him, turning away from the people and what they possess of images and idols. Those who have turned away from this Manifestation are indeed idol-worshippers who have devoted themselves to the idols of their desires, yet they perceive it not.

I know not whether, when thou attainest this Tablet, thou wilt soar upon the wings of longing and attraction, or be thunderstruck with yearning, and whether thou wilt find thyself in utter effacement or in complete awareness. Nay, We know, We know, O My servant, through Our knowledge that encompasseth the worlds. If thou wert to taste the sweetness of what the Tongue of Eternity hath spoken in addressing thee with the word "My servant," thou wouldst cry out and proclaim a thousand times: "Here am I, here am I, O Thou Goal of the mystics! Here am I, here am I, O Thou Beloved of the worlds! Here am I, here am I, O Thou Who art imprisoned by the hands of the oppressors!" And thou wouldst arise to make mention of thy Lord until thy spirit meeteth the Concourse on High and thou attainest unto the Most Glorious Companion. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, possessed of great bounty.

Give thanks unto thy Lord for this Tablet through which the Most Great Ocean hath surged upon all who are in the world, and the Spirit of Life hath been breathed into all who are in the heavens and earths. Work thou in My days that which beseemeth My mention of thee in this wondrous Tablet, and say: "Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds."

We send Our greetings from this remote and distant station upon thy father's countenance, and We make mention of him through Our grace. Verily, He is the Kind, the Generous. By My life! He standeth before the face of his Lord and is mentioned before My mighty throne. We make mention also of thy brother whom We mentioned before, and then the other, and We send Our greetings upon you and upon whoso hath attained unto this wondrous Cause. The glory be upon you and upon those who are with you, from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

O honored Seyyed Mirza Aqa! He is the Mighty, the Beloved. Your letter has come before Us and We have read it, for verily We are the All-Reading. Bear thou witness in thy inmost heart that there is none other God but Him, and that Ali before Muhammad was the Manifestation of His Self and the Dawning-Place of His Beauty unto all in the kingdom. Through Him did the Dove warble upon the branch of eternity, and the Light shine forth from the Lamp of holy radiance. Through Him did the Fire appear from this lofty, blessed, eternal, most holy and bountiful Tree. Say: By God! Were but a single letter of the Bayan to descend upon every lofty and towering mountain, and every mighty and elevated peak, thou wouldst behold it humbled and submissive before the sovereignty of God. Such are the examples We offer thee that thou mayest be of the assured ones. Say: With Him is the knowledge of the unseen, and the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and knowledge of what was and what shall be, if ye be of those who know. His are the most beautiful names, the most exalted Word, and the most glorious sovereignty. All who are in the heavens and earth glorify Him. Therefore hearken thou to the Call of God from this Tree of Unity in this blessed spot, from this Primal Beauty, that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Then read what hath been revealed unto thee in this Tablet, for verily a single letter thereof is more precious in the sight of God than the worship of both humans and jinn. Soon shalt thou witness how the deniers turn away from this Light whereby the Sun of Glory hath shone forth from the horizon of a manifest dawn. But thou, be patient within thyself and turn not to anyone, nor be thou of the perturbed. Stand firm as thou hast been commanded by the Truth from the presence of One mighty and ancient, until the breezes of glory waft from the paradise of God, the Mighty, the Wise. Thus have We imparted unto thee the word of truth and sent thee the fragrances of musk from this garment, that thou mayest magnify God thy Lord in thy days and be of the content. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon His sincere servants.

Then know thou that We have heard how thou didst supplicate God thy Lord that He might enable thee to attain such station wherein thou wouldst never deny the signs of God at the time of their revelation, and be of the assured ones. Excellent is what thou hast desired for thyself, for this is a matter greater and more glorious in the sight of God thy Lord than any other matter, if thou be of those who perceive, and nothing that hath been created between the heavens and earth can compare with it. We beseech God to assist thee in this and raise thee to such station wherein thou recognizest His verses apart from all else and art firmly grounded therein. And praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.

Then know thou that there hath reached Us the page bearing the trace of God, and this is more beloved to Me than all who are in the heavens and earth and all that was and shall be. We beseech God to reward thee with the most excellent reward from His presence, to raise thee to a praiseworthy station of glory, to grant thee the good of this world and the next, to enable thee to attain such station as is beyond the reach of any outstretched hands, and to honor thee with His presence in His subsequent Manifestation. This indeed is the most excellent good and the most noble of all matters. And grieve thou not that God hath placed between Us and thee the paths of land and sea and towering mountains raised high. For all this only comes between the hearts of those who are heedless of God's remembrance, who turn away from Him, deny His verses, and are of those who join partners with their Lord. As for those whose hearts are purified through the love of God, nothing can come between them and their Creator. But God intervenes between a man and his heart when He willeth and desireth, for He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.

O loved ones of God in Mahmudi! He is the One Who calls from His most exalted horizon. This is a Book which the Wronged One hath sent down unto those who have quaffed the cup of utterance despite the people of the world and who have drunk in the name of their Lord, the All-Merciful, before the faces of all religions. We testify that they are among the people of Baha who have embarked upon the Crimson Ark which God sent down in the Qayyumu'l-Asma as a token of His grace - and He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.

Hearken unto the call from the precincts of 'Akka, from the Divine Lote-Tree: Verily there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Blessed is the heart that hath turned to the Intended One, and the face that hath been illumined by the lights of the Countenance, and the hand that hath been raised up unto God, the Lord of all worlds. We have manifested the clear proofs and revealed that which was hidden in God's knowledge - the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

The first requirement is the recognition of God, and the second is steadfastness in His Cause, the firm, the mighty. The Book speaketh and summoneth all to the Mighty, the Beautiful. The Most Great Announcement calleth out before the faces of the world: "O people of the Furqan! Fear ye the All-Merciful. O people of the Bayan! Fear ye God and deny not Him but for Whom the Bayan would not have been revealed nor would the Primal Point have uttered a word from His presence." Thus doth the Pen of Revelation make known unto you, if ye be of them that comprehend. The Kawthar of utterance hath flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful, yet most of the people are heedless.

Cast aside vain imaginings, holding fast to the Most Great Cord, and set aside idle fancies by the command of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. In the Persian tongue, hearken unto the call of the Wronged One: All the friends are mentioned in the presence of this Prisoner, and the name of each one hath been inscribed by the Pen of God's Will, exalted be His glory, in the Book. Ye must arise to serve the Cause of the Lord of all being with complete unity, and attract the hearts of the weak through your deeds and character, guiding them to the shore of the Most Great Ocean.

O My loved ones! Certain souls love those things that cause change and difference. Should anyone appear and utter a word from which the fragrance of discord can be detected, ye must counsel him with perfect steadfastness, with wisdom and utterance, that perchance he may turn to that which God desireth and be illumined with the light of unity and concord. O friends! Unity is the cause of the appearance of the lights of the Most Great Luminary throughout all regions. Say: God is our Lord and the Lord of the mighty Throne and the exalted Seat!

Today the gems of existence are those servants who have clung to the one true God alone and are detached from all else. Praise be to God that ye have attained unto this Word of the King of Words and this utterance which is the Sovereign of utterances. In these days when the divines of the earth are witnessed to be in manifest loss, hold ye fast unto wisdom and occupy yourselves with the mention and praise of God and the triumph of His Cause. In the days of the Spirit - may the spirit of all except Him be sacrificed for His sake - souls who were occupied with catching fish arose to render victory. This is not difficult for God.

Give thou the glad-tidings of the tender mercies of the Blessed Tree unto the leaves of that land. O handmaidens of God! By the Sun of Truth, in this word lieth concealed that of which all are unable to comprehend the significance, save whom God willeth. Every ear that hath been honored to hear the words "O My servant" and "O My handmaiden" hath been illumined with the lights of the Day-Star of divine favors and hath attained. Yet we beseech God to aid all to preserve this station. He is verily the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing. Know ye your worth and hold fast unto that which befitteth you. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty be upon you, O My servants and My handmaidens, and upon those whom the ranks of the world have not prevented from remaining steadfast in this Great Announcement. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O Muhammad-Taqi, upon whom be the Glory of God! He is the All-Seeing, the Ever-Present, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Book proclaims: Blessed is the one who deals kindly with the loved ones of God. The Tongue of Grandeur proclaims: Joy unto the servant who sheltered in his home those who have migrated unto God and treated them with the essence of love and affection. The Supreme Pen declares: Blessed art thou, O Letter Ta, for that which hath proceeded from thee befitteth thee and the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. Though three stations are mentioned, all return to this Point which God hath sanctified from the knowledge of His servants. Verily He is the Hidden, though He is witnessed and seen; He is the Treasured, though thou seest Him manifest; He is the Moving while at rest, and He is at rest while moving; and He is the Euphrates through which God hath quickened His servants, before which the seas have bowed down and through which the trees have spoken. The Kingdom and the Dominion, and the Glory and the Sovereignty belong to Him Who hath come from the horizon of power with an authority that hath encompassed the world and with a command that hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and We have answered thee with this perspicuous Tablet. I counsel you and the friends to wisdom. Most of the loved ones heeded not the divine counsel. By the life of God! Had they acted upon it, each one would now be witnessed as the head of the world. Say: My God, my God! Aid Thy loved ones to act according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book, and enable them to hold fast unto the wisdom which Thou hast commanded all to observe in Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. I testify, O my God, that confirmation cometh from Thee and success proceedeth from Thee. Enable us to do what Thou lovest and pleaseth Thee. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the former and latter generations. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful. His honor, upon whom be the Glory of God, mentioned thy kindness in detail. Well is it with thee and pleasant it is unto thee. By the life of God! He hath attained unto the honor of My acceptance and been adorned with the ornament of My good-pleasure. This is a word that cannot be equaled by all the words of the world. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Bountiful. We have desired to make mention of thy father as a token of grace from Us and as a mercy from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And We say at this moment: Upon thee, O Dawning-Place of forbearance, be the first wave that hath risen from the ocean of knowledge. I bear witness that thou hast ascended unto the Supreme Companion and attained the Most Glorious Horizon at this moment when the Pen of God, the Lord of Names, hath been moved to make mention of thee. We beseech God to send down upon thee a mercy from His presence and a blessing from His side at all times. He is verily the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. O Muhammad-Taqi! Give thanks unto God for this most great favor and say: Unto Thee be praise and glory, and unto Thee be grandeur and splendor, for having aided me to turn towards Thee and made me one of those who have won victory through Thy traces in Thy days. I beseech Thee to ordain for me the good of every world among Thy worlds. Verily Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. We have made mention of him who was named 'Ali in the Book of Names, and We make mention of Mahmud that he may rejoice and be of the thankful. He whom I love hath mentioned him; We have mentioned him and have sent down for him that which hath solaced the eyes of the sincere ones. Say: Beware, beware lest the doubts of the people hold thee back. Arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as cannot be shaken by the hints of those who have adorned their heads with turbans. We testify that they have been a barrier between God and His loved ones. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this in this exalted station. We beseech God to enable all to do what He loveth and pleaseth, and to draw them nigh unto Him. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones.

By the life of our Beloved and your Beloved, and our Goal and the Goal of all who are in earth and heaven! That Beloved One prepared hundreds of thousands of colored paper factories with various hues, and in each page thereof was concealed and hidden the love of the world's beloveds and the secrets of the lovers of the Ancient Countenance. This intention is dearer and more acceptable than a hundred thousand deeds. If a soul becomes aware of the sweetness and station and rank of this intention, without words he would arise among the people and say: "Intention is the sovereign of deeds, the dawning-place of deeds, and the dayspring of deeds." Glory be to Him Who has deposited in each letter of His letters a book, and in each intention of His loved ones deeds which none can reckon save His all-encompassing knowledge. Thus it was established that in truth the paper of the world was sent and arrived, and was adorned with the pen of the Beloved. All this is from God's grace, our Lord and your Lord. In this case, what mention could appear from the servant that would shine forth in this arena or become the bearer of meaning? I seek forgiveness from God, the Great, for what I have mentioned and mention, and what has occurred to my heart and been uttered by my tongue. And regarding the last writing of that Beloved One who had mentioned: "Now there is the intention to visit the shrine - may God accept it" - likewise the prayers and the visitation prayer of 'Ashura - sun and wind and cold and we had neither fur coat nor cloak - on the high roof until complete noon, and from there to another place until evening, and from evening until midnight - may God accept it. These phrases which were presented before His presence, He said smilingly: "By the life of God, all is accepted and acceptable, for whatever appears from assured, content and successful souls has been and is acceptable. Indeed, that which is hidden in the realities of things all speaks this word: 'Whatever appears from the acceptable one is acceptable.' Blessed is he whose acceptance by God all things have testified to, and his arising to serve again and again." The Sun of loving-kindness is shining and evident. God willing, may all the friends of that land be illumined by its lights and made happy and joyful and delighted and blessed by its kindness through all ages and centuries. And I convey praise and greetings to each of the masters and friends of God. They have never been and will never be absent from sight. The One God is witness and aware that the honored beloved, Jinab-i-Aqa Ghulam-Husayn, upon him be the praise of God, has been and is in view and has attained to the loving-kindness of the Goal. I send greetings to the spiritual beloved Aqa 'Ali-Akbar, upon him be Baha'u'llah. His letter arrived bringing joy and gladness, and whatever he had written was carried out. I beseech and hope from the True One, exalted be His glory, that he may ever be adorned with the ornament of grace and loving-kindness. And further, the spiritual beloved Jinab-i-Aqa 'Ali-Asghar, upon him be Baha'u'llah, due to the upheavals in Iran returned to that direction, and a box containing two bounties, namely two sweets - that is, white musk and rose candy - was bestowed. The details of this are that since at a feast pertaining to this evanescent one some divine bounties were arranged and presented before His presence, by His command this portion was specially sent for that beloved one and the friends. Well done to those who have attained! Peace and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon God's loved ones and friends and upon God's sincere ones. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

O Siyyid Ibrahim in the Land of Alif, He is the Mighty, the Sorrowful. Your letter hath reached the dawning-place of grief and arrived at the dayspring of tribulations. May God reward thee with a goodly reward which no alteration shall follow, for He, verily, hath power over all things. O Ibrahim! The idol of self and desire hath encompassed the world. All have turned away from God and become worshippers of desire. Beseech the True One that He make manifest a Friend who, through the power of the All-Glorious, may shatter and cast down the idols of creation. Though it hath ever been the custom of men to turn eagerly to vain imaginings while turning away from the Sovereign of certitude, until the Spirit of God appeared manifest and evident among all things, yet all remain occupied with the vain imaginings of their own souls, to such extent that they cling to the cord of fancy while cut off from the Sure Handle. Consider My first Manifestation: when it appeared from the most holy and exalted Horizon, none turned towards that Essence of Oneness. Yet they would endure countless hardships and become detached from all things that they might attain to circumambulating a stone which, according to some, was created. The Lord of Lords had risen from the horizon of His name, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing, yet all would run through the wilderness that they might be blessed with visiting dust. Observe this Day, which is the Lord of all days and the most wondrous time before and after. The True One, exalted be His grandeur, hath appeared with complete manifestation and concealment, yet should any soul observe with the slightest fairness, he would testify that the like of this Revelation hath never appeared in creation. Nevertheless, they cling to a name, of whose reality none had any knowledge, while turning away from Him Who brought it into being. Fie upon them and their deeds! Even though at the time of departure He informed all that the Calf would bellow after the departure of the Ancient Beauty, and the Samiri would appear, and the birds of night would stir after the setting of the Sun, yet though all witnessed this, they recognized it not. Rather, most became worshippers of the Calf and followers of Samiri, turning entirely away from the Truth. Their abode is naught but the fire - how wretched the dwelling-place of the deniers! O Ibrahim! Walk with perfect steadfastness upon the path of God. Close thine eyes to all else but Him and open them to His beauty, for all today are evanescent and accounted as utter nothingness before God. Fix thy gaze ever upon the essence of the Cause and that whereby the Cause is established. Seek not to rely upon anyone in thy recognition of the Truth, for that Essence of eternity hath never been and shall never be known except through Itself. It hath never depended upon the acceptance or rejection of anyone. Its proof hath been Its Own Self, and Its evidence that which It hath revealed through Its grace. Were one to observe with illumined vision, all the movements of the Truth - whether standing or sitting, walking or resting, speaking or silent - would be seen as distinguished and sanctified above the deeds of all who are in the heavens and the earth. The Truth hath never been confused with aught else, yet doubt hath ever existed and shall continue to exist in deluded souls. Purify thy breast from the allusions of the veiled ones and sanctify thy heart from doubt. Strive to the extent of thy capacity to teach the Cause of God. This is the fruit of existence for every existent being today. The eye of God hath ever been and shall be, God willing, fixed upon thee. Moreover, convey to all the friends, both men and women, greetings from the tongue of God. God willing, may thou circle round the Truth as a shadow circles round the sun.

O He who has been named Muhammad-Qabli-Rida in the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Powerful!

He is the Most Wondrous, the Most Inaccessible!

This is a Book sent down in truth from the presence of One mighty and beautiful. Therein doth God make mention of one of His servants, that he may be of them that remember, and that He may quicken thereby his heart and his inner being, and that he may give thanks unto God and be of the thankful ones.

O thou who believest in God! Thou hast visited the House of God aforetime and wast among them that made pilgrimage. Therefore, strive within thyself to visit the Most Great House of God which hath appeared in the temple of the Youth. Blessed be God, the best of creators, through Whom every direction was intended, every house confirmed, and every wise matter made manifest.

Say: The sanctuary of God hath appeared and the Most Great House hath been built by the hands of might and power from the presence of One mighty and powerful. Say: By God! This is verily the sanctuary of God and His House, round which circle the denizens of the All-Highest Paradise and the angels drawn nigh. By His command have appeared the Place of Commemoration, the Holy Place, and the Spot of Security for all who are in the heavens and on earth. And verily it is God's perspicuous Book.

Say: O people! Wage not war against Him Who hath come unto you with a proof from God and Who summoneth you unto His Self that standeth over the worlds. He desireth from you no recompense; His reward is with Him Who sent Him with the truth and dispatched Him unto all created things. O people! Make not your deeds null and void, and deny not what hath been sent down in truth from God, the Most High, the Most Great. And should ye deny it, what proof have ye for your cause? Bring it forth then, and be not among them that tarry.

Beware lest ye dispute concerning God after He hath appeared with all the signs, which none denieth save every hateful enemy. Verily, they who have disbelieved and joined partners with God, were God to come unto them from the heaven of His Cause surrounded by a company of angels, were the earth to be cleft asunder and to yield up its treasures, and were the sky to be rent - they would never believe. Nay, were they to witness every sign their associating of partners would but increase. Thus have their souls enticed them, and they were among the deniers.

And thou, O servant, hearken unto the words of Him Who counseleth thee for the sake of God, and be not of the heedless. Purify thyself, then look into the proof whereby God hath manifested His Cause in every age, then into this firm and mighty proof, that thou mayest be assured in the Cause of God to such degree that were all who are in the heavens and earth to oppose thee, thou wouldst not turn unto them and wouldst remain possessed of clear vision and manifest proof.

Say: God is the Creator of all things and standeth over every soul. He witnesseth what His servants commit and recompenseth them for what they have wrought. And verily He is the Rewarder of the doers of deeds.

Turn thy heart in all days toward the court of God, thy Lord, with sublime humility, that the breezes of grace may waft over thee and the breathings of holiness may take hold of thee from the direction of a mighty throne. By God, besides Whom there is none other God! A single breath thereof excelleth whatsoever hath been created between the heavens and earths.

Shun all that directeth thee unto passion, and draw nigh unto the court of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, with a pure and radiant heart. Grieve not for this world and what lieth therein, for it shall perish more quickly than a moment, and there shall endure what hath been ordained for thee by thy Lord, whereby thine eyes shall be solaced, thy soul find rest, thy body repose, and thy heart rejoice. Thus doth the Pen of the Command give thee glad tidings through God's favor unto thee, that thou mayest be of them that are gladdened.

Beware lest thou deprive thyself of the bounty of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. And glory be upon thee and upon them that have entered beneath the shadow of their Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.

O Ali, Most Holy and Most Great! This is the Tablet of Command which hath been sent down from the presence of Him Who is the Lord of Destiny, that He might draw mankind nigh unto the Most Great Scene, this Most Pure Station, round which circle the angels brought near. Say: The Hour hath passed, and the stars have fallen, and the moon hath been cleft asunder, if ye would but understand. And the Herald hath cried out between earth and heaven: "The Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting!" Every atom beareth witness unto Him Who sendeth down the verses, yet most men do not testify. Their wretchedness hath overcome them, and their desires have held them back, and today they rush headlong in the wilderness of error. When it is said unto them: "Have ye not heard the Call of Truth?" they say: "Yea." And when it is said unto them: "Have ye not witnessed God's majesty and power?" they say: "We saw and we disobeyed." Nay, they are unaware.

O thou who hast turned to God! Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the Sinai of grandeur and power. Verily, there is no God but Me, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. I have created all contingent things for Myself and have brought all beings into existence through My command. I am the One Who doeth what He willeth through My word "Be" and it is. Grieve not at anything. Arise to aid thy Lord, detached from all who dwell on earth. A station hath been ordained for thee in a guarded Tablet. Be as God's fire unto all else, that through thee the hearts of creation may be set ablaze. Thus have We commanded thee from the presence of One mighty and wise. Say: O my Lord! I am he who is content with Thy good-pleasure and who hath desired naught save Thy face, and have caused my will to be extinguished in what Thou hast willed. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name, through which the ocean of eternity surged, to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for the people of Baha who are established upon the Crimson Ark and who sail upon the sea of grandeur. Thou art the Lord of Names and the Creator of earth and heaven. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O Siyyid Muhammad!

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Great! This is a Tablet from which waft the breezes of forgiveness upon all beings and mercy descends upon those who have believed in God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. Say: Should God so desire, He would renew all created things through a word from His presence. He, verily, is the One Who has power over whatsoever He willeth and Who ruleth over whatsoever He desireth. Say: Should He wish to adorn all things with the ornament of His names, He would be able - there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing.

Say: O people of the Bayan! Whither do ye flee? The word of chastisement hath been fulfilled against him who hath denied the All-Merciful in this Revelation which hath shone forth from the horizon of all existence with manifest sovereignty. Say: Do ye imagine within yourselves that were ye to deny this Revelation, your faith in any of God's Messengers would remain firm? Nay, by your Lord, the Most High, the Most Great! Ye have no escape save either to deny all the Messengers of God or to acknowledge this Ambassador upon whose brow the Hand of Grandeur hath, with the seal of might, inscribed upon all things that, by God, this is the Beloved of the worlds. By God the Truth! There hath been inscribed by the Most Glorious Pen upon the cheek of all things: "This, verily, is He through a mere sign from Whose eyebrow was created the kingdom of names, and those who abide behind the pavilions of grandeur, and the denizens of the Concourse on High, and the dwellers of the cities of eternity." Thus was the matter decreed in the Tablet of Destiny by your Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.

O servant! Arise to serve the Cause of God and leave those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, for they are like unto children who ought to play with clay. Indeed, those endowed with keen vision behold them as worthless rabble. Leave them to their vain imaginings and take what hath been sent down unto thee from the heaven of God's dominion, the Protector, the Mighty, the Ancient of Days. Purify thy heart from all allusions and sanctify thy breast from the whisperings of the deniers, that the effulgences of thy Lord may be reflected therein, and that there may appear from thy countenance the radiance of the All-Merciful and from thy tongue the Salsabil of utterance in commemoration of this Most Great, Most Momentous News. When the clamor of the polytheists is raised, grieve not. Place thy trust in God - He will suffice thee in truth and make thee independent of all created things. All things are within the grasp of His power, and He, verily, is none other than the Single One, the One, the Mighty, the Beautiful.

Arise to aid the Cause of God by Our command. He will, verily, assist thee in truth. He is with His servants who remember Him - those whom nothing hath prevented from the remembrance of God, their Creator. Upon such as these do the inhabitants of the Concourse on High shower their blessings, and around them circle the realities of those brought near. Whoso is established in this Cause - all that hath been created between the heavens and earth cannot equal him. Thus was it inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in a previous Manifestation, if thou be of them that comprehend. He spoke - and His word is the truth - "A drop in the subsequent Revelation shall be mightier than all that was created in the Bayan." Yea, by thy Lord, the All-Merciful! Were it not so, He would not be able to rend asunder that which hath caused the hearts of the people of the Bayan to tremble. This is God's decree from aforetime. Now behold what issueth from the mouths of these people - they speak that of which they are unaware, thinking themselves to be among the guided ones. All things disavow them and atoms curse them, while they remain dead within the veils of their own selves. Thus have We explained to thee that which most people have neglected, that thou mayest aid thy Lord through utterance and be among those endowed with certitude.

Convey Our remembrance to thy wife and then to thy children, and impart unto them the glad-tidings of God, that they may be among those who rejoice. God hath ordained for thee and for them an exalted and glorious station. Glory be upon thee, then spirit be upon thee and upon those who have believed in this Revelation, wherein the feet of the doubtful have slipped. Praise be to God, the Beloved of the sincere ones and the Goal of them that have knowledge.

O Siyyid Ja'far, in whatever land thou mayest be! He is the Mighty, the Triumphant, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting! This is a Tablet sent down in truth from the presence of One mighty and powerful, wherein the measures of the Cause have been ordained by a holy and exalted Pen. It speaketh the truth in the heaven of eternity, even should all who are on earth oppose it. Say: They who have believed in God and in what hath been sent down from Him, these are guided by their Lord and are possessed of a mighty remembrance. The angels of the Cause shall receive them and give them glad tidings of a paradise which hath been opened in the sublime heights. Say: O people of the earth! Hearken unto My call, and deny not the signs of God after they have been sent down in truth, and be not oppressors and wretched ones. He it is Who aideth whomsoever He willeth with the hosts of the heavens and earth, and ordereth all things as He pleaseth. Who is more powerful in sovereignty than God, and more truthful in utterance? He it is Who causeth night to be succeeded by day and ordaineth the measure of all things, and He, verily, hath power over all things.

Know thou that thy letter hath come before Us in this prison, and We have learned of its contents and have answered thee with these verses which God hath made a proof unto all who are on earth. What thou didst mention regarding the occurrence of that which We had formerly told thee is truth from the presence of One wise and informed. Yet thou dost not turn to this, nor to what the people possess; rather turn thy face unto a beauty mighty and beauteous. Know thou that all We have told thee is truth from God - it hath appeared and shall appear, and We, verily, have knowledge of all things. After this there shall appear a test which shall cause all who are in the heavens and on earth to burst asunder, save those who have ascended wholly unto a beauty mighty and resplendent. Be thou not disturbed by this, but find peace in this Tablet which hath been sent down in truth from a heaven sublime and exalted.

Say: We believe in what hath been sent down unto Us in this Tablet, and in what was sent down unto Moses and Jesus, and in what was sent down unto Muhammad the Messenger of God, and in what was sent down unto 'Ali before Nabil from holy and exalted verses. We make no distinction between any of them, and We are, verily, on a straight path. Should abasement overtake thee for My name's sake, grieve not but be patient within thyself, and put thy trust in God, and be clear-sighted in the Cause. Say: We were among you for many years, yet none of you recognized Us until the promise came and the matter was decreed by One powerful and wise. When We entered the prison We revealed Our countenance and lifted the veil with manifest sovereignty. Thus do We recount unto thee what was then sent down in truth, and We have revealed what was hidden behind a delicate and holy veil.

Know thou that the idolaters have denied God's favor and turned away from a path mighty and lofty. Say: O people of the Bayan! Do ye imagine that ye shall be left alone when ye say "We believe" and the test cometh not unto you from a quarter mighty and near? By God! This is the test whereby the sincere ones shall flee - how much more these people! And God doth take account of all things. None shall escape therefrom save he who holdeth fast unto this luminous cord, and God is witness unto this. Convey unto the people what thou art able, and turn not to thy right or thy left, but hold fast unto this mighty pillar which standeth firm in the Cause. We have indeed sent unto thee what was revealed in the prison, and verily a single letter thereof is greater than the creation of the heavens and earth, and through it God's proof, His evidence, His testimony and His signs have been perfected for all, whether small or great.

In the name of the one God. O people of Beauty! Hearken to the divine call in the Persian tongue from the mystic Tree. Every soul that today has attained to hearing the call of Truth has become detached, sanctified and free from the allusions of creation and what lies with them. Praise ye the Best-Beloved of the worlds, that ye are associated with a Name that is truly associated with Him. Though today the station of this is not known, yet soon shall ye behold this station as having no equal. Today, whosoever is enkindled with the fire of the divine Word and has drunk from the Euphrates of the All-Merciful shall live and endure forever, his name recorded and inscribed by the Pen of the Command in the divine Tablets. No created thing past or future can equal this bounty. Well is it with them that understand.

Be not grieved by differences in outward matters. Fix your gaze at all times upon the Dawning-Place of God's Cause and exert your utmost effort that perchance, through the blessing of the Most Great Name which has encompassed the world, ye may drink of this most pure and luminous nectar that hath been unsealed through the key of remembrance of the Lord of Power. Happy are ye, O people of Beauty, were ye to be of them that drink thereof.

God willing, through the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful, transcend the contingent world and cling to the hem of the bounty of the Lord of nations. Be ablaze with the fire of the love of the Beloved - such a blaze that the people of those regions may turn toward the sanctuary of oneness from that spiritual heat.

O Muniru'd-Din! Hearken unto the call from this manifest Prison. He is, verily, none other than Him, the Almighty over the worlds. Arise to serve the Cause of thy Lord in a manner befitting these days, then summon the people to the horizon from which were illumined the heavens and earth. Be not perturbed today by the intimations of the divines and what they possess. Consider when the Sun of the Cause dawned from the horizon of Batha, the divines and men of learning opposed Him, and before that when the Spirit appeared with the signs of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great, the greatest among the people turned away from Him. Thus was it ordained aforetime. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Soon will God obliterate the traces of those who disbelieved today, even as thou hast witnessed what the hand of might and power wrought in the past. Nothing can frustrate what He willeth - all are within the grasp of thy Lord's power, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Wise.

O Muhyi'd-Din! Rejoice in that thou hast been mentioned by the Pen of the Command, and stand firm in the service of thy Lord in this mighty Revelation. Beware lest the conditions of them that are on earth veil thee. Leave them to themselves and turn thy heart to God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. Beware lest thou deprive thyself of the breezes of the days of thy Lord. We love to see thee soaring in the atmosphere of remembrance and utterance, and speaking forth the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, throughout all possibility, that through thee may awaken those servants whom the wine of passion hath overcome and held back from this resplendent horizon. We beseech God to assist you in His love and good-pleasure and to make you among those who have fulfilled God's Covenant and His Testament, and who have stood firm in the Cause in such wise that neither the doubts of the transgressors, nor the intimations of the oppressors, nor the onslaught of the heedless held them back. The glory be upon you both, and upon your mother and sister, from One mighty, praiseworthy.

Hear with the ear of the spirit what hath been mentioned and reflect upon the divine verses, that ye may behold all the world as non-existent and null. This is the counsel of the Wronged One which hath flowed from the Pen of Command. Blessed are they that act, and blessed are they that are patient. Grieve not at hardship, for ease is in His hand. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

His Honor Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be the Glory of God

He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power

O beloved of my heart! There exists no reminder in the world, no educator and no reformer like separation. Glory be to God! The light of union and its station and rank become manifest through it, and patience and forbearance shine forth from it. At every moment it makes the soul aware. Infinite grief appears from it, yet the discerning soul beholds in the ocean of grief the hand of divine training and witnesses the chalices of mercy. In brief, whatsoever comes from God, glorified be His majesty, is adorned with wisdom, and His wisdom in all conditions and circumstances is the cause of the exaltation and elevation of His servants. Praise be to God Who has made separation the key to union and remoteness the harbinger of nearness, Who has honored us with His oneness among His servants and adorned us with the ornament of His laws and ordinances. Verily He is the Lord of all beings. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. And blessings and peace be upon His Beloved through whom the light of unity shone forth from the horizon of God's will, the Lord of lords, and through whom the gate of knowledge was opened and the dove of mystical understanding warbled upon the highest branches. Sovereignty belongs to God, the One, the Chosen. And upon His family and companions whom the affairs of the world prevented not from helping the Cause of God, the Lord of all beings. They strove with utmost striving until they conquered the lands. Verily He is the Lord of the servants and the King of creation in the beginning and the return.

Glorified art Thou, O my God and my Purpose and the Ultimate Object of my hope and my desire! I beseech Thee by Thy Book through which Thou didst separate between truth and falsehood and which Thou didst name the Furqan among Thy servants who arose to help Thy Cause and exalt Thy Word and manifest Thy laws, that Thou assist Thy servants in that which Thou lovest and approvest. Then I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Throne that Thou preserve the one who hath acknowledged Thy unity and oneness and hath adorned his life with Thy remembrance and praise. O Lord! Ordain for him through Thy bounty that which befitteth the waves of the ocean of Thy generosity and bestowal. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

And further, O beloved of my heart! Although the pen of this ignorant one wrote of the virtues of separation and established proofs, yet much pain and injury proceed from it. It melts the liver, dissolves the heart, and prevents the breast from expansion. I beseech God, glorified be His majesty, and hope that He will soon ordain reunion and not deprive us of the blessing of meeting, by the truth of His Prophets and Messengers and their Lord and Master. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer. You have always been and continue to be remembered. This evanescent servant beseeches God that He make this journey of yours the cause of outward and inward profit and the means of ordering scattered and dispersed affairs. He is the Powerful and the Mighty. If you wish to know the conditions of this land - we are alive and enjoying God's infinite bounties. All the relatives are well and adorned with the ornament of health. No grief exists save separation from that beloved, and it is hoped that even this will soon be transformed into joy and delight. I convey greetings to the friends of that land and beseech God for their assistance and confirmation. He is the All-Bountiful, He is the Bestower, He is the Generous. A letter was written by this servant in reply to the letter of his honor Aqa Muhammad Ali, upon him be God's peace, and sent, and likewise a blessed Tablet especially for the beloved of the heart, his honor Nabil ibn Nabil, upon him be peace. Peace be upon you and upon God's sincere servants, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is established upon the throne of grace! The doors of My favors, which from the beginning that hath no beginning until now had remained sealed, are now opened in truth by the finger of ancient glory. And verily thou, say: In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. And after beginning with My blessed Name, give glad tidings to all created things and proclaim between earth and heaven that whosoever desireth to ask a question may present it to the Manifestation of ancient glory - an answer will descend from the heaven of grace. And any learned one who wisheth to inquire about knowledge, let him surely present it to the most holy and pure court, for he shall not be deprived. And any who thirsteth for the wine of verses and longeth for words and verses from the heaven of names and attributes of the King of attributes, let him ask and it shall be granted without delay or postponement. I swear by My beauty that were it not for the prevention of preventers, the oppression of oppressors, and the obstruction of deniers from among the people of the Bayan, We would have commanded all things to seek knowledge of what was and what will be, and would have honored them all with this mighty robe and this most glorious garment. But how can these people be capable when they remain veiled by a mere allusion to a letter of the Most Great Word, and are kept far from the subtle and delicate fountain of grace by a thick veil? And if anyone today should ask questions numbering as the drops of rain from the clouds, all would receive answers in a wondrous tongue in verses sent down and dispatched from the holy heaven of grace. Exalted then is this breeze that hath encompassed the worlds! Exalted is this grace that hath become renowned among all created things! Exalted is this countenance at whose light's dawning the faces of the people of the highest paradise fell prostrate! There hath never been any delay in the wonders of My grace, but since people have veiled themselves with imaginary veils, they have remained deprived of the wonders of grace and the gems of glorious bounty. For I made the servants the manifestation of My wealth and established in all things the sign of wealth above all else. And since they remained veiled from this mighty sign, they have been afflicted with accidental poverty. How excellent then is the state of those souls who free themselves from all else but God and turn with all their might to the Beauty of the One, that the wondrous manifestations of power which I have deposited within their souls may become apparent and evident, and they may witness themselves as wealthy and independent of all who are in the heavens and earth. And whosoever attaineth unto this station hath attained unto the presence of God within his own self, by his own self. And let not the ignorant among the people cling to these words and step into the arena of pride and vainglory, as hath been observed in some who, after being called for years to absolute wealth by the melodies of the Spirit, have finally claimed independence from the Truth. We seek refuge in God from this! For all these riches appear from and return to the contingent Will. Beware lest at the time of manifestation ye cling to station and recognition or to all who are in the heavens and earth, becoming occupied with these and remaining deprived of My Beauty, Who with a single word can draw all who are in the heavens and earth to the treasury of wealth. In brief, wealth apart from Me hath been beloved, not My Self; and severance from all save Me hath been sought, not My Beauty. Thus doth the Pen of God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Powerful, inform you.

O Siyyid Muhammad in the Land of Ya! In the Name of God, the Most Wondrous, the Most Impregnable, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious! Then did the Tongue of God speak in all things, saying: "Verily, I am alive in this horizon which hath appeared with truth and hath been named in the Concourse on High by the name of the Most Exalted, then in the cities of names by the name of the Most Glorious, then among the concourse of creation by this Name whereat the cry hath been raised from all who are in the heavens and earth save them whom God preserved through His grace and delivered from the floods of fancy and desire and caused to ascend unto the divine Lote-Tree in this most distant sanctuary round which circle all that was and will be. Yet the people have veiled themselves from that which hath shone forth with truth and manifested itself among the worlds with a sovereignty that encompasseth the truth. Say: O people! By God the Truth, this is the Sea from which all seas have appeared and unto which they all return, and from which all suns have dawned and unto which they all revert, and from which the Lote-Trees of the Cause have brought forth fruits, each one of which was raised in the form of a Prophet and sent to one of the worlds which none hath numbered save God Who hath encompassed all created things through a letter of the Word that proceeded from His Pen which was controlled by His Finger that was mighty over the truth." Thus doth the Ancient Beauty sing in these dark and gloomy days. Would that there were someone with hearing to hear His melodies and detach himself from all the worlds! O servant who gazeth toward the direction of Glory in this Day wherein the souls of every distant polytheist are agitated! Know thou that what God inspired in thy heart hath come before Our presence and We have witnessed it with the eye of mercy and bounty and have sent down unto thee these words whereby every irrevocable decree and every hidden secret hath been made manifest. Know thou further that God hath forgiven thee through His grace and purified thee from sins at the time when thou didst make mention in thy letter of this remembrance whereby the skin of every base heedless one doth creep, and the breezes of eternity wafted upon thee from the direction of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, and turned thee toward the Ultimate Shore at a time when thou wert heedless of Him. Thus hath God's favor and grace been perfected upon thee that thou mayest be among the thankful in thyself and be content with the truth. We have verily sent down in this Tablet the table of the Cause from the heaven of grace. By God! Whosoever partaketh thereof shall find himself independent of all who are in the kingdom. As to what thou hast asked about God thy Lord concerning what We revealed aforetime unto Muhammad in Arabic, know thou that the first one We sent with truth was Ali whom We caused to shine forth from the Persian horizon and sent down upon clouds of the Spirit from an exalted heaven, and the last one We sent was also Ali whom We named in the Supreme Concourse by Our Most Holy Name, if thou be of them that know. And We strengthened them both with this Beauty Who hath appeared with truth and shone forth from the horizon of the Cause with manifest sovereignty. Were We to desire to interpret this verse for thee, all the ink and pens would not suffice, but We have abbreviated what We have explained to thee since We are in those days engaged in a mighty matter and find not the opportunity. Yet should God will and desire, We shall interpret and expound it as a mercy from Us unto thee, for My mercy upon thee is abundant. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, then remind the people with wisdom and counsel and dispute not with anyone. Thus hath the Tongue of Holiness commanded thee. Act according to what thou hast been commanded and be steadfastly persevering.

Praise be to God Who completed His First Most Exalted Word with His Last Word, which is "He doeth whatsoever He willeth." Glory be unto Him! Glory be unto Him! How great is His station and how mighty His sovereignty!

And blessings and peace be upon the Divine Lote-Tree through which appeared the fruits of wisdom and utterance and the leaves of knowledge and understanding - He Who was named Muhammad in the Kingdom of Names. Verily He is the Manifestation of His most beautiful names and His most exalted attributes, and the Manifestation of His Command, and the Dawning-Place of His Revelation, and the Recipient of His knowledge - blessings eternal and everlasting.

And now, O beloved of my heart, the luminary of your words has shone forth from the horizon of your love and sincerity towards God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne. At that moment I attained joy and gladness, for from your words wafted the fragrance of the oneness of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

Thereafter I approached the Most Exalted Station and presented myself before the countenance of the Lord. He - may our spirits be sacrificed for His sake - said: "We have made mention of him and have beseeched the Lord of the exalted Throne to ordain for him the good of the hereafter and of this world, and to aid him to perform deeds that will be as light before his face in all the worlds, and to make them a treasure preserved with Him. We testify that he has testified to the oneness of God, His singleness, His might, His greatness and His sovereignty. Peace be upon him from the Wronged One, and upon those with him, and upon God's righteous servants." Thus ended His words.

As for what you mentioned regarding Jinab-i-'Abdu'l-Mahdi - upon him be God's peace - he is among those who have attained to turning towards God and drawing near, and has attained His presence and associated with the friends and taught the Cause. However, O beloved of my heart, sincerity and certitude and faith and knowledge are not perfected through words but through deeds. God has counseled His servants in His perspicuous Book regarding spiritual and praiseworthy conduct. This servant conveys greetings to him and counsels him with that which God has counseled His servants in His firm and perspicuous Book.

And regarding what you mentioned about God's servants and His loved ones in Abu Sida and Ya'quba and 'Awashiq, after presenting this before the countenance of the Lord, He - may our spirits be sacrificed for His sake - said: "We make mention of them and counsel them to justice and fairness and to that which befitteth man. O servants of God! God has commanded you to act with righteousness, and the Wronged One counsels you to fear God. Blessed is he whose head is adorned with the crown of detachment, whose temple with the ornament of the fear of God, and whose heart with the light of recognition. Hasten to that which pleaseth God. He hath ordained for those who act in the Most Exalted Paradise stations which the pens are powerless to describe. And We counsel you, O My loved ones, to fellowship and unity that the horizons may be illumined with the light of accord. We beseech God, exalted be He, to ordain for you that which will bring joy to your eyes and gladden your hearts and expand your breasts, and to aid you in that which will benefit yourselves and your brethren, and to assist you with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower. We send greetings from this station to My loved ones whose names you mentioned before the Wronged One, and We make mention of them with My mention and remind them of My words and give them glad tidings of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of the worlds." Thus ended His words.

And this servant conveys greetings to them and beseeches God his Lord to send down upon them from the heaven of His bounty and the clouds of His grace the rain of His mercy and generosity, and to aid them to act according to what He has revealed in His Book. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Wise. And he conveys greetings to your honor and to those with you and to those among God's servants who are firm in His unity, the Lord of the worlds. And praise be to Him, for He is the Goal of the mystics and the Beloved of the hearts of the sincere ones.

O Muhammad, son of Haji Siyyid 'Ali, upon both of you be the Glory of God! He is the All-Knowing Speaker.

Praise be to God Who hath manifested His Cause, sent down His verses and commanded all to act with rectitude. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, All-Wise Commander. O Muhammad! Hearken unto the call from this far-distant Shore. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Watching. He witnesseth and seeth, and nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He, verily, is the Omnipotent, the Almighty. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for having aided thee to attain recognition and given thee to drink of the choice wine of utterance from the hands of His bounty. He, verily, is the Compassionate, the Generous.

That which thou didst address to God, the Lord of the worlds, hath come before the Wronged One, and the servant present before the Wronged One hath read it. We have sent down for thee that which was a pearl in the shell of utterance and a light at the horizon of possibility. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. Blessed is the tongue that hath been occupied with My remembrance, and the house that hath been honored by My praise, and the air that hath been perfumed by My wondrous utterance.

O Muhammad! The ocean of utterance hath surged in the realm of possibility, and that which was hidden in knowledge and inscribed by the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Praised, hath been made manifest. Say: O heedless ones! Raise your heads and behold that which hath shone forth and gleamed from the horizon of the tender mercy of your Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Beware lest the veils of the world withhold you, or the might of any remote oppressor frighten you. By God! The ocean of verses hath surged when the Manifestation of clear proofs came, yet the people are in evident error. Desire hath kept them back from the Lord of all beings. Thus have their souls prompted them. They are indeed among the idolaters. Say: O people! Fear God and believe in Him Who hath come to you with a mighty sovereignty, on His right hand the hosts of revelation and inspiration, and on His left the angels and the Spirit, if ye be of them that know. And before Him walketh the Point of the Bayan, saying: "O my people! Your sayings and deeds have put me to shame, after We counseled you night and day. Fear the All-Merciful and be not of them that turn aside. In every leaf We commanded you to present yourselves before the Countenance, yet when He appeared ye turned away and denied, and committed that which caused My heart and My Pen and the Supreme Concourse and the most exalted Paradise to lament. Every discerning soul beareth witness to this."

O people of the Bayan! We have sent down for you the verses and manifested the clear proofs, and ye were commanded to that which would draw you nigh unto the supreme horizon. Ye cast behind you that which ye were commanded and took up that which caused the Faithful Spirit to lament. Say: O sources of knowledge and manifestations of arts! Hearken unto the call of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. He hath come from the horizon of power with a manifest sovereignty.

Blessed art thou, O Muhammad, for having attained unto the traces of My Pen while the Wronged One was in this mighty prison. We beseech God to assist thee with the hosts of wisdom and utterance for the promotion of His mighty and wise Cause. Know thou that should anyone bring thee all the books of the world, leave them behind thee. Thus doth the All-Knowing command thee from the presence of the Mighty, the All-Informed. We have found those who turned aside among the people of the Bayan to be more lost than the people of the Furqan. Thus hath the matter been decreed, and We are among the witnesses. God hath forgiven those two whom thou didst mention in thy letter, as a grace from His presence. He is the Mighty, the Beautiful.

When thou hast taken the cup of My utterance and drunk therefrom in remembrance of My Name, say: "My God, my God! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, assured by the rain-showers of the heaven of Thy grace, and anticipating the wonders of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne and by Thy mysteries which none save Thyself hath known, to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy love and firm in Thy Cause, such that neither the doubts of the doubters nor the signs of them that turn aside may keep me back from Thee. Thou art, verily, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Triumphant, the Omnipotent."

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most High!

Praise be to God Who caused the Mount to speak forth that there is none other God but Him, the God of Moses and Aaron, and caused the solid rock in the hand of His Beloved to speak forth that there is none other God but Him, the God of all worlds, and caused the mountains to speak forth His mighty remembrance and the seas His surging, prevailing, swift Name, and the trees that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Wondrous. He it is Who gave the world the glad-tidings of the Day wherein the sun shall rise from its setting, and the mountains shall pass away with passing upon passing, and every soul shall be weighed with weighing upon weighing, wherein feet shall slip and mankind be confounded and the hearts of the possessors of understanding be thunderstruck and the limbs of all servants tremble, that His supreme sovereignty might be made manifest therein, even as He informed His servants in the Book that erreth not nor forgetteth. The Kingdom on that Day shall be God's - my spirit be a sacrifice for your remembrance.

The servant hath been honored by that which hath trickled from the cloud of your ink, and joy and gladness have seized him in such wise as no mention can contain. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Choosing. As to what ye mentioned regarding the City and what Sheikh Muhammad and he who is imprisoned - upon them both be the glory of God - have composed in verse, what they composed and wrote hath been read before the Countenance and there hath shone forth from the horizon of grace that which the Pen is powerless to describe. We beseech God to assist them both to remember and praise Him, and to spread abroad from them that which shall perfume the horizons. He, verily, is the Lord of the Day of Mutual Disillusion.

After hearkening to this remembrance and utterance, the Tongue of the Beloved spoke and said: "O Mustafa! Befitting on this day for all the loved ones of God in that land is the mighty veil and beautiful patience. Should any of the people of Zawra' learn or discover that My letter or word hath come unto it, they would make of it a cause of corruption, and perchance what appeareth therefrom would return to the root of the Tree. It behooveth every soul to preserve it and arise to serve it and conceal it from every objector and violator of the Covenant."

As for what thou mentioned regarding the name of Sasun - upon him be 96 \[Baha'u'llah\] - verily he is remembered before the Countenance, and it behooveth Moses to speak truthfully at first saying "I have nothing and what is in my hand belongeth to none other than myself." By these words he shall deliver himself from all afflictions and turn unto the Mighty, the Beloved.

As for what Fayzullah Bey wrote to his father, it hath been presented before the Countenance. He - may my spirit be sacrificed for Him - said: "This is contrary to what God hath revealed in the Book. It behooveth everyone who hath turned to the Supreme Horizon and attained the Most Pure Sealed Choice Wine to hold fast unto wisdom and speak that whereby servants draw nigh, not that whereby they fall thunderstruck upon the dust. Blessed is he who was prevented from sending his letter to his father, and blessed is he who held fast unto wisdom and acted according to what was commanded from before God, the Lord of the worlds. We have mentioned Fayzullah - We beseech God to assist him and grant him that which shall profit him. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Wise."

It is submitted that in all circumstances the concealment of the Cause is necessary, for if the people of Iraq become aware in any way that news from the Most Holy Court reaches anywhere, they will surely complain to the great city and this will become a cause of corruption. Your honor should write in such a way that the friends in that land should understand as though no news reaches from the Most Holy Court. In any case, the concealment of this matter is necessary.

May the Glory be upon your honor and the people of the household and upon the loved ones of God in that place.

He is the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious

Praise be to God Who has caused the world to speak forth in remembrance of His Most Great Name and has made His remembrance \[His existence\] to be from the Word of God that is obeyed, which neither the outer nor inner senses can comprehend, for it is sanctified above nature and above the limited, created letters. Through it the Resurrection and its signs appeared, and the Hour and what pertains to it, and through it He distinguished between contingent beings and chose whatsoever He willed from among created things. Exalted is He Who brought it forth, Who sent it, and Who manifested it, Who was, and there was naught else beside Him, and Who shall be even as He was. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Powerful.

Glory be unto Thee, O God of the worlds and Beloved of those who know Thee! Thou knowest that my tongue is powerless to make mention of those whom Thou hast chosen for Thy love, whom Thou hast preferred above Thy creatures, whom Thou hast made to be branches of Thy Lote-Tree, lights in the horizon of Thy Revelation, streams from the paradise of Thy Cause, and a gulf from the ocean of Thy grandeur. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the nations and Quickener of the world, to cause me to speak at all times of that which befitteth their station and befitteth those who have turned towards Thy face, turning away from all else besides Thee. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest through Thy word "Be" and it is.

My spirit be a sacrifice for your love! This servant has been honored to receive your esteemed letter. Praise be to God, its fragrant breezes perfumed the heart and gave life to the soul. We beseech God not to cut off these spiritual breezes and this diffused musk-scented fragrance. Tongue and utterance are powerless to mention this station. I beg and implore the True One, exalted be His grandeur, to bestow its reward. Verily He is the Giver, the Munificent, the Mighty, the Generous, and unto him who calls upon Him, the Hearing, the Responding One.

Furthermore, your letter arrived at the Most Holy Court at an appointed time, and He in Whose hand is the Kingdom of all things took it, and after it was honored to receive His glance of favor, He bestowed it upon this servant. As commanded, this servant again recited it in His presence. He knoweth what was uttered by his tongue at that time. Verily He is the All-Numbering, the All-Knowing. If this servant were to mention the bounties he hath witnessed, neither pens nor papers would suffice. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid you in all conditions and to protect you from those who have denied God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

Moreover, whatsoever you had sent previously and subsequently, of tea and preserves, arrived completely and perfectly. But what shall I say about the preserves which truly became heavenly food - groups of people were sustained by it, whether from among the assured believers, the sincere faithful ones, the wavering ones, or the heedless ones of the city who have attained to the love of God according to their measure though they have no knowledge of the Cause. In any case, as commanded it was distributed and all were sustained by it.

And another submission: I present my most sublime greetings to his honor Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'l-?amid, upon him be the glory of God, the King, the Mighty, the Peerless. Praise be to God, he is mentioned at the Throne and is under the glance of favor. Blessed is he and those from whom the fragrances of certitude were diffused in the days of the All-Merciful. All those round about present their utter nothingness and most sublime, most mighty, most exalted greetings to your honor. May the Most Glorious Glory and then the praise of God, the Most High, be upon your honor and upon those who love God in those parts.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Grandeur

Praise be to God Who hath caused us to know the unity of His Essence and the sanctification of His Being from creation and whatsoever pertaineth unto it, and hath made us to be among those who acknowledge the Word which His Beloved and Chosen One taught us - that there is none other God but Him, Who was and is and ever shall be, the All-Powerful, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.

Your esteemed letter with its spiritual tidings that brought joy and delight hath arrived. Praise be to God, health is attained, the fragrance of love is diffused, bounty is descending, the door is opened, the sun is shining, the star is gleaming, and the tree is flourishing and speaking. We need life that we may engage in circumambulation, yet great would be the loss if God should not assist in this mighty matter. The command is in His hands and He is the All-Informed.

Regarding the Tablet of Ustad 'Ali-Akbar-i-Banna, upon him be the Glory of God, which you mentioned - some of it was written by the Blessed Beauty Himself. God willing, the names mentioned will also be recorded therein and sent. Concerning Jinab-i-Fu'ad, Jinab-i-Samandar, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, according to the command, movement is not permitted and patience is preferable. Verily God is with the patient ones. They said if God willeth, in another instance the answer to 'Andalib will be written and sent. Jinab-i-Samandar should repeatedly inquire on behalf of the Wronged One about their condition and that of the prisoners, upon them be the Glory of God, and should also ask Ibn-i-'Attar on behalf of the Wronged One about Ismi, upon him be my Glory and Grace, and Jinab-i-'Ali, upon him be my Glory and Loving-kindness, and the other loved ones. The purpose is to show love. By the life of God, they have not been and are not absent from sight for a moment, and their reward is with God, exalted be His glory. What is now necessary is that they should beseech God to make the bitter draught sweet and grant patience. By My life, from some the fragrance of contentment is wafting. If God willeth, all shall attain to this most exalted station.

Regarding what was written about permission for the spiritual friend Haji Mirza Husayn, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God - it was submitted. They said to wait a few days and afterwards the answer will appear and be sent. Likewise, especially for Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Kazim-i-Isfahani, resident of Khadra, after this a token of loving-kindness will be shown according to what was promised. And likewise, especially for the beloved of the heart Jinab-i-Haji Mirza Haydar-'Ali, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, a wondrous and sublime Tablet hath been revealed and will be sent.

They said to write to the one named Jud to write two words to Jinab-i-Samandar, upon him be my Glory, and send the Tablet in the handwriting of the servant, but make no mention of Ibn-i-Abhar. Just write that they had asked for him before, and now you should send him. According to the command they should depart by way of H and M, and en route, that is after leaving Mosul, they should completely conceal the Cause until they arrive. The purpose is that they should move with the utmost wisdom. And it was written that from a certain place an amount of thirty tumans would be sent for their expenses. If it has not arrived, Jinab-i-Samandar or others should give it and later when it arrives they can receive it back.

Peace be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon God's righteous servants. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

O Ali Akbar! In the Name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!

O Ali! Hear My call from this Prison wherein I remain alone amidst enemies, finding no helper for Myself save God, thy Lord and the Lord of all things and the Lord of all worlds. Beware lest thou forget the days when thou wert in the presence of the Countenance. Remember thy Lord and be not of the heedless. We have not forgotten thee, for We have loved faithfulness before the creation of the heavens and the earth. Stand firm in the Cause of thy Lord. By God the Truth! This is the Day to aid thy Lord - aid Him and be not of the patient ones. Leave those who have denied on thy left, then turn to the right, the seat of thy Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Remember the days thou wert with Us and what thou didst hear from this truthful, pure and wondrous Mouth. Stand firm in the love of thy Lord, for by it all created things are purified, wert thou of those who know. Yet by it God distinguished between the concourse of creation and he in whose heart was the love of God - he is today among the denizens of the Supreme Concourse, wert thou of those who know. Arise and remember thy Lord, and fear no one but place thy trust in God, the King of the Mighty Throne. Say: O people of the Bayan! Do ye deny Him Who was among you, from Whom in every moment there dawned upon you suns of glory and majesty, then suns of power and sovereignty, and Who was more merciful to you than your own selves, and Who watched over you and conversed with you as one of you, and associated with you morning and evening, and from Whom ye perceived the fragrance of the Beloved at dawn and at dusk? By God the Truth! Whoso denieth Him after He hath come with all the signs hath denied God from all eternity and will deny Him unto all eternity. Say: I know not, O people of the Bayan, what ye seek to prove the Truth. If ye seek God's power, by God it hath appeared in truth. If ye seek the attributes of the All-Merciful, they have emerged with justice. If ye desire God's signs, they have been sent down in truth in such wise as to fill the East and West, were ye of the fair-minded. Fear God and His Manifestation, and ascribe not partners unto Him after all atoms testify that there is no God but Him - He hath no likeness, no peer, no opposite, no equal, no similitude, no partner. Say: O people! Hearken unto the melodies of the All-Merciful from the direction of the Ridvan at this time wherein the Beauty of the Unseen hath appeared with all His attributes, manifestations, signs, tokens, evidences, proofs, arguments and words. Be not among the dead! O people! Be quickened by this Kawthar which floweth from the right side of this Most Great, Mighty and Firm Corner. Cast not God's Cause behind you, render not your deeds vain, and be not among the rebellious. Thus hath the Tongue of God conversed with His servant that he might hear and be among the thankful. Be content with what hath flowed unto thee from the Holy Pen, then read it that it might kindle in thy heart the Fire of God, the Kindled, the Luminous. Then convey Our greetings to thy wife and give her the glad-tidings of Our mention of her, that she might be among the grateful women. This is a mighty bounty. And the Glory be upon thee and upon those with thee among the loved ones of God, the King, the Truth, the Just, the Wise.

He is the All-Powerful!

Rejoice in thy soul, O Muhammad, inasmuch as a noble and holy Book hath been sent down unto you. In it is that which shall detach thee from the dominion of heaven and earth and cause thee to attain unto the threshold of manifest glory. Say: Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! Thou seest my weakness and my powerlessness, my woes and my misery. Send down upon me, from the sweet-savors of Thy holiness that which, even if it doth waft in proportion to the black of an ant, is capable of drawing the former and latter generations nigh unto the sovereignty of Thy luminous Beauty and ennobling them by the lights of Thy resplendent Face.

O my God! I am he who hath held fast unto Thy firm cord within the Most Perfect and Mighty Word and hath clung to the hem of Thy loving-kindness in Thy Name, the Exalted, the Most High, the All-Knowing. Therefore, O my God, debar me not from this living water which Thou hast caused to flow from the spring of the noble Throne after Thou hadst honored me by Thy Presence and made known unto me the Manifestation of Thy Self. Suffer me not, O my God, to be kept back from Thy transcendent grace and Thine ancient and bountiful favors which Thou hath sent down from the clouds of Thy sublime Mercy.

Say: O people! I swear by God, the Truth, that the Primal Point hath been clearly set forth in this Word, if ye be of those who know, and the fire of oneness (al-aHadiyya) hath been manifested in this exalted Tree round which all the worlds circumambulate. Say: The Holy Spirit hath appeared in a new garment! Say: Verily, the pebbles glorify God in this luminous, white hand! Say: Verily, the Beauty of God hath come forth from behind the veil of light! Wherefore, glorify God, the Sovereign of Sovereigns. Say: The dense veils hath been rent asunder and the Youth hath risen from the dawning-place of His name, the Compassionate, the Merciful (ar-RaHmaan ar-RaHiim). This is that which none hath previously known, neither the inner light of the soul ('irfaan nafs) nor the wisdom of the wise (Hikmat al-baalighiin). At this very moment He is speaking in the atmosphere of this heaven, calling aloud unto all who are in the heavens and on earth, and announcing the Paradise of God (riDwaan Allah) unto all created things and calling them unto a holy and praiseworthy station.

Say: Whosoever doth not cleanse his heart of the veils of blind imitation (Hijaabaat at-taqliid) shall be unable to approach this sublime, irradiant Face. O Muhammad! Soar in this heaven with the wings of detachment and fear no one. Rely, then, upon God, Thy Lord, the Gracious, the Beneficent, the Almighty, the Most Powerful. Pay heed to no one, even if the most deleterious person in all of creation doth oppose you. Leave, then, the people to God and to that which hath been sent down in the Bayan and be not of those who fear. Say: O people! Fear God and follow His precepts (sunan Allah) with both your inner and outer being and been not of the negligent, lest negligence debar you from each Court of divine nearness.

Say: Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, through which disobedience is blotted out by forgiveness, and wrath is replaced by mercy, and by which Thou doth usher the sinners into the Tabernacle of Thy beautiful clemency, not to abandon me to myself for less than a moment. Sever me not from the cord of Thy loving kindness nor withhold me from the knowledge of Thy Beauty in Thy latter resurrection. Suffer me not to be far removed from His Presence on a Day in which the eyes are glazed over and the minds of the negligent are stupefied and the feet of the mystic knowers falter. O My God! Thou art He Who is the Sovereign over all creation and their Maker and the Ruler of all existent things and their Source. Verily, Thou art He Whose mercy hath encompassed all things and Whose loving kindness hath permeated all who are in heaven and on earth. Verily, Thou art the All-Compelling, the Almighty, the Sovereign, the Powerful, the All-Wise. Therefore, I have sought shelter, O my God, in Thy sovereignty and Thy might and I have taken refuge in Thy grace and Thy good favors. Deprive me not of Thy mercy and Thy kindness nor remove me far from the Paradise of Thy love and Thy remembrance. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, and upon Thy servants be Thy mercy and forgiveness.

In the Name of the Beloved of the horizons! O Husayn! Hearken to the call of Husayn, Who from the Most Great Prison summons thee. This call quickens the body and brings the soul to its Beloved. O Husayn! Listen with thy heart's ear, that thou mayest attain, through the sweetness of the divine Word, to such a station that thou wilt find thyself, at all times, in a state of joy and delight. A great bounty hath been bestowed upon thee, in that thou hast twice entered the Most Great Prison and attained the station of nearness and reunion. Though the grace of this station may be concealed today, owing to the lack of capacity of the people of the world, it is witnessed and remembered before God. God willing, thou must arise to serve the Cause and be one of its servants. This station is most great - know thou its worth and act according to its conditions. With complete detachment and spiritual qualities thou must occupy thyself among the servants with the mention and praise of God, that perchance the worshippers of vain imaginings may become mindful and turn to the Lord of all beings. To the friends in every land, if thou meetest them, convey greetings from this Wronged One. Say: O ye who soar in the atmosphere of divine love and O ye who seek the heavenly Sanctuary! This is the day of steadfastness. Ye must become so steadfast that the fragrances of your steadfastness may waft over the people of all lands. Today is the day of assistance - strive that ye may not remain deprived of service to the Cause in the days of God. The people of hypocrisy lie in wait - be vigilant! And the companions of wickedness are filled with hatred - be aware! Ye are all mentioned in the presence of this Face and all your names are recorded in the Tablet. This is among the great divine bounties, as the Tongue of Grandeur and Power doth testify. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed Witness. O Husayn! Were this Wronged One to recount what hath befallen Him, it would surely cause grief to all the peoples of the world. We have therefore concealed most of these matters and deemed it inappropriate to reveal them, in consideration of the Most Great Mercy. Yet thou art aware of some of these things. Nevertheless, at all times We speak forth the verses of God and stand firm in the promotion of His Cause. The tyranny of the oppressors, the harm of the transgressors, the turning away of the deniers, and the afflictions and successive tribulations that have befallen Us - all these are as nothing and unworthy of mention, for whatever hath occurred and continueth to occur hath been in the path of the Beloved of the worlds. With yearning soul We long for it. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou seest the Wronged One in the hands of the oppressors among Thy creation and the idolaters among Thy creatures. I beseech Thee by Thy power which Thou didst manifest from the horizon of the prison, the Dawning-Place of Thy verses, and by the call which was raised therein through Thy might and sovereignty, to make me detached from all who are on earth, turning unto Thee, firm in Thy love, steadfast in Thy Cause, celebrating Thy remembrance, and proclaiming Thy Name. O Lord! Aid me to serve Thee amongst Thy servants and to praise Thee amidst Thy creation. Then ordain for me that which befitteth the heaven of Thy generosity and bounty, and the clouds of Thy grace and favors. O Lord! I have hastened unto Thee and turned to the Dayspring of Thy Cause and the Dawning-Place of Thy power, and have attained unto that which most of Thy creatures have been prevented from. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Name and by Thy Most Supreme Self to make me one of those who recognize Thy bounty and what Thou hast bestowed upon them at the dawning of the lights of Thy countenance and the manifestations of the Sun of Thy mercy. I am he who, O my God, hath been assured of Thy greatness and hath acknowledged Thy majesty. Preserve me, then, in all conditions, from that which Thy good-pleasure abhorreth. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

In the Name of the Beloved of the Worlds!

O 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar! God willing, through the grace of the Lord of Destiny thou shalt in all times and conditions be gazing toward the Most Great Horizon and drinking the water of life from the fingers of the mercy of the All-Merciful. Thy turning to the Friend hath been accepted, and thy orientation toward the face of the Beloved is beloved. Although the most exalted summit and the highest station is the meeting place of the two stations in the presence of the Lord of the Worlds - that station being the conjunction of the two nearnesses, namely the outward and inward nearness - this is of God's grace which He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth. This station dependeth upon the Divine Will and the Holy Purpose. Often hath it been that the reward of this station hath been recorded for a soul that hath turned to God and found peace, even though outwardly it was not present before the Throne. And likewise hath it often been that less than this hath been recorded for one who was with Him. O 'Ali! Verily He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth, and He is verily the Mighty, the Powerful.

Be not grieved by separation and remoteness, for the Pen of Divine Command hath decreed nearness and reunion in thy case. The differences in this land and its hidden upheavals are many, many and great, great. Soon that which is concealed therein shall be revealed. I swear by the Sun of holy transcendence that the Ancient King hath been afflicted between two parties. Were anyone to look toward the heart, they would see Him in the two prisons. Thus doth the Dawning-Place of the two Commands and the Possessor of the two Pillars and the Rising-Place of the two Suns recount unto thee.

O 'Ali! Hearken unto the call of the Ancient King, Who calleth from the direction of the Most Great Prison, and praise the Beloved of the world Who hath enabled thee to turn toward the Divine Ka'bah and the Dawning-Place of unique Light. This station is most great - know thou its worth and be grateful at all times.

Previously, wondrous and sublime Tablets were sent down from the heaven of Divine favor specifically for thee and thy relatives, one after another. God willing, you shall attain unto them. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the Hour was troubled and the Resurrection was shaken, to make me one of those who move not save by Thy leave and breathe not except by Thy command. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Generous.

O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the All-Prevailing over all names and the Ruler over all who are in earth and heaven, to make me in all conditions one who circleth round Thy Will and gazeth toward the horizon of Thy Purpose, in such wise that I desire naught from Thee except what Thou hast desired and seek naught save what Thou hast decreed in the Tablets of Thy Decree and written with the Pen of Thy Destiny.

O my God! I testify that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee. Thou hast ever been established upon the throne of Thy oneness and seated upon the seat of Thy singleness. None can draw nigh unto Thee or soar in the atmosphere of Thy knowledge save to the extent which Thou hast ordained for them through Thy mercy which hath preceded all created things and Thy grace which hath encompassed all existing things.

O my Lord! Ordain for me from Thy bounty that which shall profit me. Verily Thou knowest what is within my soul and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Then write down for me, O my God, the good of this world and the next, and make me one of those for whom Thou hast ordained circumambulation around Thee in every world of Thy worlds. Verily Thou art the Giver, the Bountiful, the Generous.

I am the one, O my God, who hath left his abode, turning toward Thy abode. Thou hearest the lamentation of my heart in my separation from Thee and my yearning to meet Thee. This is my condition, and Thou art the Almighty, the All-Choosing over what Thou desirest.

Our Charmer came (But-i-ma amad)

Our Charmer came with a glass and wine,

His face as a sun, His heart, pure.

Pure from what? From this and the other world,

And from the designs of this one, free and independent.

From His moon-like face a crescent arises.

The sun is dimmed by His raven hair.

Crimped the hair of His mane,

Enigmatic His unequalled lips.

His chin is an alabaster globe,

His mouth a coral casket.

His laugh is sweeter than sugar.

His rage fans the flames of hell.

Behind His honeyed lips, rubies from Badakhshan,

An untouched pearl is hidden.

He came with drunken eyes and a sober heart.

O God, how furious is this drunkard!

I said: 'O King, give me a glass'. He answered:

'May God protect thee from such an idle longing!

This is the Wine of Life, do not spoil it.

This is the Water of Eternity, do not pollute it.

First, watch thy language.

Then, curb and calm down thy fancy.

Set thy heart free from exteriority.

Be inwardly pure and excellent.

Purify thyself in the crucible of oneness,

And I will give thee two or three glasses of this wine'.

I said: 'O Thou, Whose hand has signed the decree of Fate!

O Thou, from Whose might the light of destiny shineth forth!

Were I worthy of this wondrous Cause,

Should I have the qualities Thou mentioned,

Why should I take the glass from Thine alabaster hand?

Why should I drink wine in this festive night?'

He said: 'Have a care! Thou art wrong.

Thou art very far from the path of Truth.

Where is he who deserves to mention this chalice?

How could a dejected one be worthy of this fire?

If thou wilt drink a drop from My sea,

Thou wilt see many unheard and unseen things'.

I said: 'Why dost Thou tarry, o Prince of the age?

Give me a glass from that sparkling Fount.

Dost Thou want my soul? I will bestow it a hundred times.

Dost Thou want my head? Here it is at Thy feet'.

Then He offered me that mystic Draught.

I drank it and saw the eternal World.

I saw a morning wherefrom the sun was arising.

I saw a dawn breaking through from the soul.

I saw a Paradise like unto the Face of the Beloved,

A springtime hidden from the autumn's eye.

The essence of the nightingale was hidden in the form of the rose;

The Divine mystery was heard from the nightingale.

The manifest and the hidden in the same embrace,

The form and the essence covered by the same mantle.

From His Tree I heard a subtlety that Moses

Did not hear from the Burning Bush.

I beheld a people inebriated by the cup of God,

And free from being and not-being.

They were all drunk with the morning draught,

And from the world of place they flew towards the Placeless.

True, I saw what cannot be told.

O God, what a fortunate occurrence!

I was bewildered by this sublime world.

Why had this carpet been spread out?

My mind did not find its way;

My thought stepped back.

I said: 'An auspicious Leader is needed'.

I said: 'An esteemed Guide is required'.

I said to myself that in the world of wonderment

The Intellect assists every faltering foot.

I asked: 'O Intellect! O holy Messenger!

O Mind! O Guide of every destitute!

What is this place where the soul is a servant?

What is this life-giving joy?'

I was engaged in this talk with the Intellect,

When, lo, from the Invisible this glad tiding arrived:

O thou, who art distraught and crazy with love! Know thou,

They were brought through the Advent of that new King,

That King, Who hath renewed the world through His Cause,

And quickened the Spirit of Jesus by His breath.

Of the decree of that Divine Splendour

The Holy Spirit is a humble servant.

That's enough, O Dervish! Do not speak further.

It is sweeter for the lovers' secret to remain concealed.

Hearken unto what the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth from this blessed land upon the glorious spot: He is, verily, none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Compelling. The gaze hath been directed towards thee from this Most Great Scene, the spot wherein the Lord of Destiny hath been imprisoned through what the hands of the oppressors have wrought. Were I to mention what hath befallen Me of sorrows, the dust of grief would envelope all who dwell in the realms of being. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have, in all Our Tablets, commanded the people to behold this Revelation with their own eyes. Yet they have cast behind their backs that which they were bidden, except those who have rent asunder the veils through this Most Great Name. Fie upon those who have cast away their Lord and followed the desires of such as have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The more intense the tribulation, the more doth the glory of Baha shine forth in proclaiming that which hath been ordained by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. By God! He hath stood firm in the Cause in such wise that were anyone to ponder thereon, he would cast away all created things and hasten unto the All-Merciful. Yet most of the people are heedless. Say: He stood between earth and heaven, and nodded His head, and winked His eye, and raised His brow, and caused His garment to shine forth, and raised His sleeve, and moved His lips, and gestured with His hand, saying: O people! Follow Him Who hath come unto you from the Dayspring of the Cause with manifest sovereignty. In the midst of tribulation, with every member of His body He proclaimeth the Cause of God, the Most High, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Blessed is he who hath been guided by the guidance of God, and woe betide them that have turned aside. Render thanks unto God for having been made the recipient of thy Lord's attention and for that which hath been sent down unto thee that causeth the hearts of them that are endued with understanding to take wing. Great, great is the Cause, and great, great is the tribulation. Blessed is he who hath remained steadfast in his love for his Lord and hath cast aside all else - he is of them that are sincere. Thy letter which thou didst send to the servant who standeth before the Throne hath come before Our presence, and We have heard that which it contained, and We were among them that hearkened. We sat alone in the house and occupied Ourselves with diverse matters - thus have We been commanded by the Mighty, the Ancient. At times We swim in the ocean of mysteries and praise the Lord with wondrous remembrances, veiled from the heedless. And at times We soar in the atmosphere of detachment and behold all things as though no mention had ever been made of them. Verily thy Lord is not hindered by any occupation from another occupation. He is, in truth, the One Who overshadoweth all things. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as the Kawthar of life hath flowed in thy name in this Tablet whereby the hearts have been assured and the faces of them that are nigh unto God have been illumined. We beseech God to aid thee to serve Him and to make thee of them who have helped His Cause after all the heedless ones remote had veiled themselves therefrom. Give thanks for having drawn nigh unto the Divine Lote-Tree and for having heard its most sweet call when it warbled forth verses whereby the land of polytheism was rent asunder and the pillars of them that were immersed in fancy were made to tremble. Say unto My loved ones: Grieve not for what hath befallen Us. By God, the Truth! Tribulation is the crown of glory and abasement in God's path is the adorning of His Temple - your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old. Be ye steadfast in the Cause, then drink ye of the most pure wine through this Name whereby the breathings of God have wafted among mankind. Thus doth the Wronged One command you from this most luminous Spot. He, verily, is the friend of him who hath loved Him, and He is, in truth, the Mighty, the Bountiful. And upon thee be glory, and upon them that are with thee - they who have hastened with their hearts unto the court of God, the Mighty, the Wondrous.

O H.S., upon him be the Glory of God! He is the One manifest from His most exalted horizon. Exalted be His majesty, all-pervading His bounty, and great His power! He has named the prison the Most Exalted Horizon and designated the lowest station as the supreme height. The renowned scholar whose name was celebrated like the sun slipped from the path and returned to his place, while He made the unknown ignorant one succeed in attaining the ocean of knowledge. God doth as He willeth and ordaineth as He pleaseth. With Him is the Mother Book. O H.S., upon thee be My Glory and My loving-kindness! Praise be to God, thou hast repeatedly been blessed with the loving-kindness of God and the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. Thou didst aim for the ultimate goal and through the assistance of the Lord of all beings, thou didst arrive and witness and hear. Praise be to Him in all conditions for His infinite and countless favors. Glory be to God! Vain imaginings have prevented the servants from the Kawthar of the utterance of the All-Merciful. Veils thicker than before have appeared and intervened. The cause and reason are the veils of the past. In early Islam there were certain souls who were occupied day and night with fabrications, as became clear and evident to every person of insight at the appearance of the True One on the Day of Judgment. Their condition has become the cause of the veils of Hadi of Dawlat-Abad, although he was and is unaware of the root of the matter. This ignorant oppressor speaks the same worthless words as before and is occupied with organizing a party similar to the Shi'ih party. It is not known what he has understood and what he has intended and what he has comprehended of the fruits of the Blessed Tree. If the servants would, through divine assistance and heavenly grace and mercy, observe with their own eyes what has appeared from the Most Exalted Horizon, they would instantly enter another world and find that which would free and liberate them from all else besides God. But the recompense of their deeds has seized them all. Say: My God, my God! Thou seest Thy servants in the pit of vain imaginings. Where is the arm of Thy power, O Thou the Goal of the worlds? O Lord! Assist Thy creation and disappoint them not of the wonders of Thy grace. Verily Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful ones. Thy letter was presented before the Wronged One and the Greater Branch submitted it. We have answered thee with this perspicuous Tablet. We have found from each of its letters the fragrance of My wondrous and glorious love. We beseech God to assist thee and make thee successful and to exalt thee through the truth. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer. And We make mention of the leaf, thy wife, and give her the glad-tidings of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of the mighty throne. O my leaf! Rejoice, then be gladdened by My mention of thee. Reflect upon the loving-kindness of God. He confirmed thee and enabled thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of revelation and the Source of verses. In days when the divines, rulers and mystics of the earth are heedless and veiled, this is the greatest of bounties and the supreme loving-kindness. Thank thy Lord for this manifest grace and say: Praise be to Thee, O Goal of the world, and glorified art Thou, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of the heavens and earth! O H.Q.S., upon thee be My Glory! Convey My greetings to my brother, upon him be My Glory. They intended to journey and attain Our presence. This matter depends on the requirements of wisdom. If wisdom permits, they may come; otherwise We shall decree for him from Our Most Exalted Pen the reward of attaining Our presence. Verily He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the Praiseworthy. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon My loved ones there who have heard and turned and responded and said: "God is our Lord and the Lord of the exalted throne!"

He is the All-Knowing in the Heaven of Eternity. His honor Mahdi hath been specially favored with spiritual bounties, and after that Muhammad-'Ali - upon him be the glory of his Lord - may he remain steadfast in the Cause, for the Cause today is from one perspective easy and from another impossible to grasp save by those endowed with knowledge and understanding. O thou honored one! Today tarrying is not permitted. It is incumbent and obligatory upon all to convey the Message before the crowing. Then know that the Qaf is in the Qaf, and in this Name there is a lesson for those possessed of insight. The Truth hath summoned affliction to the hill, and in this there is wisdom for those who love. Tablets have been sent - write them with utmost haste and dispatch them to all regions. A mighty missive was sent in the name of Fath along with copies of other Tablets. If it reaches him it would be most pleasing, that perchance the people may be freed from their veils and attain to the maturity of the Cause. O friend! Pass beyond all contingent beings, gird up firmly the loins of service, and keep the victory of God's Cause before thine eyes at all times. Tablets have been revealed to Sultan-Abad and Nayriz - assuredly deliver them quickly. And if someone specifically travels to those parts for the love of God to teach the Cause, it would be most pleasing. Likewise to Yazd, to Radi'r-Ruh, along with copies regarding Muhammad-'Ali wherein mention is made of the people of that land. Soon fiery Tablets will be dispatched to all regions, especially in company with the Name Qaf. Then say: This is naught but Thy trial. Assuredly they will write and send to your honor as well, but all are commanded to write words in response to those who have rejected God. Details are mentioned in the Tablets which you will become aware of. This much was known - that no one was aware of the root of this Cause before the return of Qaf. Send whatever mighty words are possible to all lands before that. Thus hath it been ordained by the All-Powerful, the Ancient. His honor Muhammad-'Ali will mention the details of what has transpired and you will become informed. Show forth unity and love toward him. Beware, beware lest ye differ among yourselves. Rather, unite in the Cause and be of those who are united. Tablets have been revealed \[to the land of Sad\] - deliver them. Furthermore, his honor Muhammad-'Ali Akbar - may God cause him to enter the Most Great Scene - requested the letter Qaf, therefore it was revealed and summoned. No news has arrived from the beloved Mirza Aqa - assuredly write. Likewise from Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin. Soon what was mentioned in the Tablets will become manifest - blessed are they who are steadfast. No mention was made of his honor Mirza Ja'far and Muhammad-Sadiq - make mention of them. Convey greetings from God to all the friends, Arab and Persian, male and female. A Tablet was revealed to Mulla Ja'far - if deemed advisable deliver it, otherwise not, for such souls who have opened the eye of leadership are never susceptible to guidance. In any case, be not secure from his craftiness for he is most cunning and deceitful. Therefore be on your guard and keep your distance. Although the divine hand of change and transformation is encompassing and engaged, yet verily We have veiled the people with a mighty veil. Blessed are they who rend asunder the veils. Keep this missive concealed for mention of Qaf is in it, until that which is hidden becomes manifest. A Tablet was revealed to Muhammad-Husayn in the land of Kaf - deliver it quickly. Show much love to Rasul for he is beloved of God.

In the Name of our Lord, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!

Praise sanctified above mention and glorification befitteth the Court of the Lord of Names, Who through His complete power and the attraction of His Primal Word drew all creation to the supreme horizon, and in such wise did He kindle the fire of the divine Word in those who have turned towards Him, and in those who have drawn nigh, and in the sincere ones, that each with utmost eagerness and good-pleasure turned towards the dawning-place of sacrifice. Blessed are they and joy be unto them! We beseech God that He may cause new traces to appear in the earth from these holy souls who have attained unto complete sacrifice, inasmuch as sanctified spirits who ascend with perfect detachment and severance have ever been and shall ever be the cause of wondrous manifestations and exalted revelations. Were this servant to attempt to mention the influences of those spirits upon the inner and outer world, he would need to spend long periods expounding this station. By the life of God! If an eye were to be opened and perceive this station, that one would surely sacrifice the entire world, were it in his possession - how much more these weak, frail, worthless lives and these transient, impermanent riches. However, today service to the Cause, meaning its propagation, takes precedence over all else, as may be understood from the blessed Tablets.

Thereafter thy letter arrived which, praise be to God, indicated the well-being of all the loved ones. At every moment one must speak forth with a hundred thousand tongues, and from each tongue offer a hundred thousand thanks and praises, for He hath, through His infinite bounty, honored these servants with the robe of His special favor and enabled them to recognize the Manifestation of His Revelation. His is the praise, His the thanks, His the mention, and His the glorification.

And regarding what thou didst mention about the dream, it was submitted and He said: "Behold then what the wrongdoers have done to My shirt and My garments in the Land of Sad. By God! All things have wailed, every eye hath shed tears, and every person of insight and discernment hath cried out. O servant of God! The Supreme Pen hath lamented their oppression. They claim to have faith yet deny Him Who did ordain and send it forth, and they weep for Husayn while they slay his children. Thus have their souls enticed them, and they are in a strange sleep. But those who believed have profited by what they did, while these are in manifest loss." He further said: "God willing, as a result of what hath come to pass, the temples of existence shall be seen adorned with a luminous vesture, and all shall attain unto the garment of divine bounty. The Command is in God's hands - He doeth what He willeth, and He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful."

And regarding what thou didst write about how, after receiving this evanescent one's letter and reading the verses revealed in the name of his honor the physician, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, the friends were seen both smiling and weeping - this was submitted and He said: "God willing, all must rejoice through God's grace and speak forth His praise. Blessed is the soul that hath taken the cup of joy and gladness in the name of the Lord of creation - such a one is truly of the people of this noble station. And assuredly those souls who have attained unto this station and have distinguished the True One from all else are gladdened by His gladness and saddened by His sadness."

I beseech thee to convey on behalf of this evanescent one greetings sanctified above mention and description. Blessed are they in that they have attained unto a goodly end. And praise be to God, the Lord of the beginning and the end.

6 Rajab 1296

The mention of thy praise and glorification and exaltation was submitted to the holy presence of the Branches of the Blessed Tree - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - and they remembered and conveyed greetings in more wondrous terms than what thou didst mention and express.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful

Praise sanctified from tongue and utterance befits the most holy court of that Desired One who, through a single word, brought the world and its manifestations and revelations from nothingness into the realm of being. His is the praise by which hearts soar to the atmosphere of holiness and nearness, and minds are drawn to the horizon of glory and acceptance. His is the praise for what He has revealed, His is the praise for what He has graciously bestowed, and His is the praise in all that has appeared from Him and been realized through His will. He is verily the Beginner, the Restorer, the Manifester, the Powerful, the Most High, the Most Great.

Thereafter, your letter brought joy and bestowed delight, for it was adorned with mention of the Friend. I swear by the Most Holy Beauty that the fragrance of those who make mention of Him is, at the time of mentioning, the cause of life for the world, but the people comprehend not a word. After perusing its contents, on a day when He was at the Most Great Scene in the mansion, it was presented before His face. His blessed words, exalted be His utterance and exalted be His remembrance: "O servant of God! The servant present has attended and presented at the Most Great Scene what you sent to Him, and the Wronged One has mentioned you in His station which has been named by the Most Beautiful Names in the Crimson Tablet. Verily your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

"O servant of God! Convey My greetings to the friends. Make mention of Aqa Muhammad-Sadiq and those with him on behalf of the Wronged One. For some time their mention has not appeared outwardly in the petitions from that direction. God willing, may they be gladdened through God's grace and be occupied in His remembrance. He is verily the Forgiving, He is verily the Loving, He is verily the Generous, He is verily the All-Knowing, He is verily the All-Seeing."

Regarding what you mentioned about the letter of the physician, upon him be the Glory of God, that they have sent it, and likewise the letter of H.M. - I beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist you in His remembrance and praise and service to His Cause. This servant and all other friends must today gaze with utmost eagerness and longing toward the horizon of the will of the Lord of the Day of the Covenant, and with a hundred thousand souls and spirits and limbs engage in serving the Cause and acting in accordance with that which will manifest its glory. He is verily the Helper, the Mighty, the Wise.

And regarding what you wrote about Haji Muhammad-Baqir and Aqa Siyyid Muhammad-'Ali, upon them be the Glory of God - that they arrived in Beirut and afterwards, without permission from the Dayspring of Grace, proceeded to the prison land - He said: Although it occurred without permission, yet He is verily the Kind, the Compassionate. We beseech God to adorn all with the ornament of permission and then to honor them with His presence, for the fruits of this are countless and will continue to be. And likewise He said: O servant of God! Those souls who are turned toward and gazing upon the Truth and moved by His will must obtain permission from their location. This is true permission. Blessed are they that attain!

Regarding what you mentioned about the guest and the sister of Aqa 'Amu, upon them be the Glory of God - mention of them was made in the Most Holy Court. He said: Blessed are those handmaidens who have won and been patient in God, the Lord of the worlds. The request is that you convey greetings to all those souls who have accepted and who have drunk from the Kawthar of oneness and attained recognition of the Lord of creation. The Glory be upon you and upon those who have remained faithful to God's Covenant, our Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

To the friends of God in Alif, Sin, Mim and Sad and their surroundings. He is the One Who calls between earth and heaven. Praise be to the King of Kings Who has gladdened His servants with the blessed word "The All-Merciful is established upon the throne," for this exalted word is a clear glad-tiding of the manifestation of Truth and His establishment, exalted be His glory. This blessed word in its inmost mystery gives the glad-tidings of His presence, that those who have turned to Him may attain supreme joy and hold fast to that which befits His days. O friends of God in those lands! His honor Siyyid Faraju'llah, upon him be the glory of God, has attained Our presence and has been blessed again and again with the waters of reunion. Now he has sought a portion of that blessed, luminous cup for the friends as well. We therefore desire to send you the Kawthar of utterance, the choice wine of recognition, and the Salsabil of certitude, that these may draw you to the supreme horizon and most exalted summit. We beseech God, blessed and exalted is He, to change your hardship to ease, your sorrow to joy, and your difficulty to comfort. Verily He loves His friends and desires for them a joy that neither sorrows nor the contingencies of the world can alter. Praise be to God! These are days of joy and gladness. We hope that at all times they may drink from the cup of bounty that which is the cause of eternal life throughout the dominion of earth and heaven. Cast off the garments of troubles and sorrows from the temples of love through the name of the Beloved of the worlds. The affairs of the sincere ones and those who profess His unity are with God, exalted be His glory. If He wishes He gives, and if He wills He takes away. All affairs are captive in the grasp of His power, and this indeed is easy and simple. In these days through His infinite bounty and supreme benevolence you have been blessed with that which causes the exaltation of the Word of God and the advancement of His Cause. My God, my God, my Lord, my Support, my Master, my Helper, my Goal and my Object of worship! I beseech Thee by the lamp of Thy Cause which Thou didst kindle with the hand of Thy power, and by the pearls which were hidden in the hearts of Thy chosen ones, and by the ocean of Thy verses and the heaven of Thy generosity, to protect Thy friends through Thy bounty and Thy hosts. Then open before their faces the doors of Thy riches. O Lord! Thou seest them holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty and clinging to the hem of Thy generosity. Disappoint them not of that which shall establish the signs of Thy trustworthiness in Thy lands, Thy religion in Thy realms, and the appearance of Thy justice amongst Thy servants. I testify, O my God, that they have desired naught but Thy mention and praise and the service of Thy Cause. I beseech Thee to raise up through them Thy names amidst Thy creation and Thy attributes among those who dwell in Thy heaven and Thy earth. Thou art He Who has testified to Thy power through all created things and to Thy sovereignty through all possible things. Thou doest what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp is the control of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous. God is witness and testifier that the friends have ever been mentioned on the Wronged One's carpet and their purpose has been and is the exaltation of the blessed Word. Assuredly this supreme station and exalted rank has been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Book of the Lord of all being, and its effects are endless. Soon will the heedless ones witness the greatness of God and His power, and the favors and kindnesses of God. Verily He loves whoever turns to Him, desires whoever seeks Him, and mentions whoever mentions Him with a mention whereby the trees catch fire and proclaim that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Chosen. Peace and glory and praise and blessing be upon you, O friends of God, and His bounty and favor and heavenly table and mercy which has preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth.

God makes mention of one of His handmaidens to establish her in the Cause and turn her wholly toward God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting, and to detach her from those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, that her face may be illumined by this Light which has appeared and shone forth from this Dayspring, from whose horizon have risen suns whose number none knows save God, with Whom is the knowledge of all things in a preserved and mighty Tablet.

O handmaiden of God! Thy letter came before the Throne and We learned of its contents and have answered thee with these words which God has made a testimony unto all who are in the heavens and on earth, that thou mayest read them morning and evening and give thanks to thy Lord that the Pen of God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved, has flowed over thy name. And wert thou to be present before the Throne and hear what has been revealed from the mouth of God, thou wouldst swoon away within thyself and be attracted by the raptures of God, the King, the Mighty, the Speaking, the Manifest.

Beware, beware lest thou grieve over anything. Then guard thyself lest the blasts of chastisement from the breaths of those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God and were among the heedless prevent thee. And when it is said unto them, "By what proof have ye believed in God?" they will surely say "The verses." Yet when the verses of thy Lord are recited unto them, their faces turn black and they return to their abodes in a punishment that no device of any schemer, nor plot of any plotter, nor deception of those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God and turned upon their heels, can avert.

Be thou steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord in such wise that should all who are on earth gather against thee, thy feet would not slip from the straight path of God, the manifest, the extended. Take refuge in the protection of thy Lord, then purify thy heart from love of those who have disbelieved in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Guard thyself in these days wherein relationship with all things has been severed and most of the servants have turned away from God after He appeared with all the signs and every destined matter.

If thou hearest My word, leave the world behind thee, then detach thyself wholly from all save God, thy Lord. This is My counsel unto thee if thou art of those women who have believed in God, the King, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

Then mention from Our presence unto him who was named 'Abdu'llah that he may remember within himself and be of those who remember. O servant! Be thou steadfast in the Path - by God, it is most subtle, most subtle! Then be firm in the Cause - verily it is most mighty, most mighty! Then guard thyself from Satan for he is accursed, accursed! Then turn to the face of God, thy Lord, with humility and submissiveness well-pleasing. Thus doth God command thee in this Tablet that thou mayest act according to what thou hast been commanded and be of those who turn their faces toward their Lord.

Then convey Our greetings unto the handmaiden who was named Sahib. Hearken unto the call of God from this Tree which has been raised up in truth and every leaf of whose leaves doth speak in a world among the endless worlds, saying: "There is none other God but I, the One with power over what I will, Who doeth what I desire through His word 'Be' and it is." Hear My word, then purify thy heart from all else but Me. This is My command unto thee and unto those women who have believed in God and testify that there is none other God but He - no partner hath He, nor minister, nor likeness, nor similitude, nor equal that can be limited. Thus doth the Ancient Beauty command thee on this eve that thou mayest be among those who remember, inscribed on mighty tablets.

O Nabil! The Sun of the mention of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, hath risen from the horizon of utterance through My Name, the Mighty, the Impregnable. It hath called out in the wilderness of guidance: "The Day hath drawn nigh - the Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise!" Verily, it hath given glad tidings unto all who are in the heavens and on earth of the Kingdom of their Lord. Thus was it sent down in the Bayan from the presence of One mighty and all-knowing. Among the people are those who have followed guidance and turned unto God, the Lord of the Last and the First, and among them are those who have disdained it. Blessed are they who have turned unto Him - these are they who perceive. These are servants who examine all matters and choose the best thereof. These are of the people of Baha, as inscribed in a Tablet by the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Powerful.

Say: Do ye dispute concerning the truth after that which hath come from the heaven of your Lord, the All-Merciful, with manifest authority? Beware lest ye reject the truth through that which ye possess. Cast away your allusions - these are clear signs sent down from the heaven of bounty by your Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. They who have turned away have followed Satan within their souls - these are the companions of the fire. They who have turned their faces unto the Countenance are of them that have attained. These have drunk from the Kawthar of life from the hands of the mercy of their Lord, the All-Merciful, and have turned with their hearts unto the Dawning-Place of Revelation in such wise that neither the hosts of the earth nor the opposition of the oppressors could withhold them.

Say: O people! Spread not corruption in the land, and enter not houses save by permission. This is that which ye have been commanded in the Tablets. He, verily, is witness over all things. Beware lest ye wrongfully consume the substance of others. Follow ye the ways of God and His religion, and be not of them who hold fast to words but cast away deeds - these are in manifest error. Hearken unto the counsel of Our Most Exalted Pen and follow not the steps of Satan. We have commanded you that which draweth you nigh unto God and removeth you from desire. This is of My grace unto you, did ye but know. All that ye have been commanded benefiteth you, and all that ye have been forbidden harmeth you in this world and the next. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Bountiful.

We have borne hardships for your ease, and tribulation for your deliverance. O ye that sleep! Arise in My Name from the couch of heedlessness and desire, and shatter the idols of wickedness and vice. This is better for you, as doth testify he whose heart hath been illumined with the light of certitude. If a transgressor bring you news, verify it not. How many are the servants who speak from desire and fear not God, the Creator of Names! Their tongues utter that which their souls command them. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

O thou who art mentioned before the Throne! Be steadfast through the power of God and convey unto My servants that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My mercy, that they may inhale the fragrance of the Divine Robe and be of them that are guided. Let not tribulation withhold thee from the mention of the Creator of earth and heaven. Be adorned with the characteristics of thy Lord, the Ancient. Verily, as tribulation increased, He increased in that which He desired, and as He was seized with oppression, He loosed the reins of utterance in celebration of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and called out to all in creation with this momentous News.

Thus have We imparted unto thee that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of Utterance, that thou mayest remember thy Lord and be of them who have arisen to aid their Lord, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Follow that which We have revealed unto thee, then tread the path of wisdom. Beware lest thou be of them who have transgressed against it after We commanded them thus in a clear Book. If thou findest one ready, cast upon him the verses of thy Lord, that he might take a path unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forebears. Be thou in such wise that sorrows touch thee not in the Cause of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Trust in Him - He sufficeth thee.

By the Lord of thy forebears of old! Be thou in such wise that sorrows shall not overtake thee in the Cause of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Put thy trust in Him, for verily He shall suffice thee, and verily He hath power over all things.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and Power

We have seen thy letter which was presented before the Throne, and We have read it and become acquainted with its contents. Verily, We were well-informed. Thou didst mention therein what befell thee in the path of God. He verily confirmeth thee in what thou hast mentioned and what thou hast not mentioned. We have encompassed what thou hast not encompassed and numbered what thou hast not numbered. Thy Lord is verily the Concealer, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We beseech God to assist all to do what He loveth and pleaseth, and to bestow upon them the Kawthar of virtuous character in the days of their Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We have learned that thou didst arrive at the guest house, but We know not whether thou didst drink therein a drop of water with joy and fragrance, or with that which troubleth the heart, as troubled were the servants before thee. Thereupon the Spirit calleth out and saith: "Verily Thou knowest, O Lord of the worlds! Thou seest and concealest, Thou hearest and art patient. Verily Thou art the All-Patient, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful." We have desired for no one save what is best for him. To this testifieth all things, and beyond them the Tongue of God, the Sovereign, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have counseled all concerning the manners and character traits of God, and We beseech Him to assist them through His grace. He is verily the Protector of whosoever loveth Him and the Helper of the sincere ones. It behooveth thee to strive for love and unity among the loved ones, that they may be united in the Cause of God. This is God's command, both in the past and in the future. Blessed are they that attain!

How excellent for thee that thou hast fulfilled God's Covenant and His Testament, and hast arisen to serve Him amongst His servants, and hast borne in His path what no one knoweth save God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. The Beloved will suffice thee and will be with thee in all conditions. He is verily the All-Powerful, the Almighty. A letter arrived aforetime wherein thou wast mentioned. We answered it truthfully and sent it with mention of thee. Read thou and be of the thankful ones. And as for what thou didst mention concerning him who is named Yusuf, We have indeed mentioned him in the Tablets with verses from which the fragrances of the musk of utterance have been wafted throughout creation and the perfumes of thy Lord's garment, the All-Merciful, have diffused between the heavens and the earths. Glorify him on My behalf with such glorification as will move him like an artery in the body of the world. Thus must it be for one who hath turned to God, the Lord of the nations, in this exalted Day. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to strengthen him in what he is engaged in. He is verily the Strengthener of those who remember Him.

And as for what thou didst mention concerning him who is named Ja'far, We have named him Badi' in the Most Great Scene. Give him the glad-tidings from Us of this mighty grace. Counsel My servants with wisdom in all circumstances. Through it the Cause is uplifted. We have been witness to this. Then make mention of My loved ones in that place, and then those in Iraq. Upon them be the glory of God and My favors at all times. Make mention of those who are with thee. Say: "O Muhammad! The Beloved calleth thee from this noble Scene and remembereth thee with joy and gladness while He is in the hands of the oppressors." The presence of thy name in the outward realm hath gladdened Us, and We have glorified thy countenance from this supreme horizon, and We do glorify thee in this moment wherein the verses of God, the Sovereign, the Protecting Friend, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful, are being sent down. Thou hast borne what thou hast borne in love for thy Lord. Nothing escapeth His knowledge. His gaze is fixed upon thee. He is verily the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing, the All-Perceiving. Grieve thou not over anything. Put thy trust in God. He will set aright what thou hast intended. He is verily the Bestower, the Mighty, the Beautiful. And verily the glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and upon those from whom hath appeared the supreme steadfastness amidst the hosts of creation. They are indeed among the firmly rooted ones.

He is the Hearer, the Answerer

Say: O servants of the All-Merciful in all lands! We counsel you at the outset to patience and forbearance in what hath befallen the friends in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. We exhort you not to associate any partners with God, the Possessor of Names. Hold fast to the cord of submission and contentment. Verily He seeth and heareth and judgeth with justice, and He is the Just, the Wise. And he whose temple is adorned with the ornament of contentment, he is of the people of Baha in the Crimson Book. To this doth My Most Exalted Pen testify in this station which God hath made the Dawning-place of His Cause and the Dayspring of His Revelation and the Repository of His knowledge and the Manifestation of His Self, the One Who ruleth over all who are in the heavens and on earth.

O people of Paradise! Commit your affairs unto God and place your trust in Him. Victory lieth in His grasp - He aideth whom He willeth through His sovereignty. The hosts of the world and the might of nations cannot withhold Him. He doeth what He pleaseth by His word and ordereth what He willeth, and He is the Strong, the All-Conquering, the Almighty.

Say: O people of the earth! This is the Day of Resurrection when the Trump is sounded and all who are in the heavens and on earth are struck down, save only certain letters of the countenance of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. By God! The dwellers of the graves have arisen when the Speaker on Sinai spoke forth in this Revelation, through which the Books of God were fulfilled aforetime and the Dove of Knowledge warbled upon the branches. He Who was hidden behind the veils of the Unseen and treasured in God's storehouse, the Most High, the Most Great, hath appeared.

Say: O concourse of the earth! Cast away vain desire and take hold of what ye are commanded by God, the Lord of all men. Verily Baha forbiddeth oppression and wickedness and commandeth you with what ye were commanded by God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.

Thy letter hath come and was presented by the servant in the presence of this Wronged One. This Tablet, mighty and wondrous, hath been revealed for thee. Drink from each of its letters an ocean of joy, by the command of God, the Kind, the Generous. We found from thy letter the fragrance of Our love. We make mention of thee with that whereby the sincere ones perceive the fragrance of His bounty, thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praised. Blessed art thou for having turned to the horizon wherefrom most people have turned away, and blessed is thy tongue for having uttered the praise of thy Lord, the Wronged One, the Stranger. Give thanks for what hath been revealed unto thee from My Most Exalted Pen in place of attaining My presence. He is verily the Forgiving, the Merciful.

In this station We make mention of My loved ones who were not frightened by the circumstances of men nor hindered by the veils of the heedless. We make mention of him who was named Muhammad that he may rejoice in the remembrance of the Wronged One and be of the thankful. O Muhammad! The Mother Book hath appeared and calleth out between earth and heaven, summoning all unto God, the Creator of Names, Who hath come with manifest sovereignty. And We make mention of him who was named Rabi' and counsel him with what beseemeth the days of God and with what hath been commanded in My perspicuous Book. Give thanks unto God that thy mention hath gained the attention of the Wronged One and My swift-moving, racing Pen hath moved upon thy name. And We make mention of him who was named 'Ali-Akbar and give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance of him, which surpasseth all the treasures of earth - to this doth every knowing, seeing one bear witness. Take hold of the Book of God with the power that cometh from Him and say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having strengthened me and made me know Thee. I beseech Thee by the breezes of Thy Revelation in Thy days to make me and Thy loved ones steadfast in Thy Cause. Thou art verily the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those whose names thou didst mention and upon those who have turned unto and believed in God, the Single One, the All-Informed.

He is indeed a true believer in the unity of God who, in this Day, will regard Him as One immeasurably exalted above all the comparisons and likenesses with which men have compared Him.

He hath erred grievously who hath mistaken these comparisons and likenesses for God Himself. Consider the relation between the craftsman and his handiwork, between the painter and his painting.

Can it it ever be maintained that the work their hands have produced is the same as themselves? By Him Who is the Lord of the Throne above and of earth below! They can be regarded in no other light except as evidences that proclaim the excellence and perfection of their author.

O ?Sh_ay?kh\_, O thou who hast surrendered thy will to God! By self-surrender and perpetual union with God is meant that men should merge their will wholly in the Will of God, and regard their desires as utter nothingness beside His Purpose. Whatsoever the Creator commandeth His creatures to observe, the same must they diligently, and with the utmost joy and eagerness, arise and fulfil. They should in no wise allow their fancy to obscure their judgment, neither should they regard their own imaginings as the voice of the Eternal. In the Prayer of Fasting We have revealed: "Should Thy Will decree that out of Thy mouth these words proceed and be addressed unto them, 'Observe, for My Beauty's sake, the fast, O people, and set no limit to its duration,' I swear by the majesty of Thy glory, that every one of them will faithfully observe it, will abstain from whatsoever will violate Thy law, and will continue to do so until they yield up their souls unto Thee." In this consisteth the complete surrender of one's will to the Will of God. Meditate on this, that thou mayest drink in the waters of everlasting life which flow through the words of the Lord of all mankind, and mayest testify that the one true God hath ever been immeasurably exalted above His creatures. He, verily, is the Incomparable, the Ever-Abiding, the Omniscient, the All-Wise. The station of absolute self-surrender transcendeth, and will ever remain exalted above, every other station.

It behoveth thee to consecrate thyself to the Will of God. Whatsoever hath been revealed in His Tablets is but a reflection of His Will. So complete must be thy consecration, that every trace of worldly desire will be washed from thine heart. This is the meaning of true unity.

Do thou beseech God to enable thee to remain steadfast in this path, and to aid thee to guide the peoples of the world to Him Who is the manifest and sovereign Ruler, Who hath revealed Himself in a distinct attire, Who giveth utterance to a Divine and specific Message.

This is the essence of faith and certitude. They that are the worshipers of the idol which their imaginations have carved, and who call it Inner Reality, such men are in truth accounted among the heathen. To this hath the All-Merciful borne witness in His Tablets. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

In His Name, the One Who has dominion over all things! Praise be unto Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, for having ordained for the Afnan such wondrous tokens of Thy grace and bounty, and for having strengthened them as revealed in Thy Tablets. Make then, O my God, each one of them to endure through Thine eternity and to stand firm in support of Thy Cause and the exaltation of Thy Word. Remove not from their temples the traces of the spring of Thy mercy, and adorn them, O my God, in all conditions with the leaves of Thy mercy and favors. Then ordain for them the reward of those who have attained unto Thy presence and appeared before the Throne in Thy days, and whom the wine of reunion has so inebriated that they have detached themselves from all desires, standing in service to Thee at morn and eventide. When he heard the call from the direction of tribulation: "Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise." There is nothing to which We have not conveyed the Command of thy Lord, and no land to which We have not sent the fragrances of this Musk that has perfumed all the worlds. Those who have found and remained steadfast - these are the people of Baha, and their names shall be mentioned in this noble scene. And those who have not found - the name of nothing can be applied to them except that they are among the dead. The trees of Paradise have been stirred by the breezes of your Lord, the Mighty, the Most Praised. When the winds pass over their branches from the right side, there is heard from them "The Beloved of the worlds has come," and from another direction is heard "Blessed is he who has attained the Living Waters when the All-Merciful appeared with a luminous countenance." Those who have attained today - these are the gems of creation, thus has the Truth testified in a clear Book. Blessed is he who has heard the call of God and turned with his heart to his Lord, the Mighty, the Generous. Know then that We have asked God to assist all the Afnan that they might proclaim from the Divine Lote-Tree that there is no God but Him, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Thus have We revealed in the Tablets when We were in the Land of Mystery and other lands - verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful. Be thankful to thy Lord for this bounty that has preceded thee and be steadfast with a mighty steadfastness. Soon will hasten unto you he who hesitated, and the vibration of thy Lord's verses will seize him - verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Thus did We inform the believers beforehand - verily nothing escapes His knowledge, He is the Protector of all things and knows what lies in the breasts of the worlds. Blessed is he who caused you to speak in remembrance of God and made known to you this straight path. Soon will spread in those parts and other lands a foul odor - avoid it, thus does the All-Knowing command you. By God, this is the day of steadfastness, were you of those who know. This indeed is the highest station and most exalted rank - blessed are they who attain. Be as mountains in the Cause of your Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, in such wise that neither the tempests of vain imaginings nor the hurricanes of the doubts of the polytheists move you. How many a servant has been veiled by the intimations of those who have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Great, and has strayed from the station wherein the Source of inspiration proclaims: "The Kingdom belongs to God, the One, the Everlasting, the Mighty, the Most Praised." Arise to serve the Cause through God's might and power, then remember thy Lord with such remembrance as will cause the spirits of those who have turned unto Him to soar. Beware lest the hardships of the world prevent thee from the remembrance of thy Lord, the Lord of all names. Follow thy Ancient Master Who, in the Most Great Prison, summons the peoples unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Verily, in the ocean of tribulation He remembers thee purely for the sake of God - be thankful to Him for this manifest grace. When thou hast drunk the choice wine of understanding from the words of thy Lord, the Lord of all religions, say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who called unto me through the tongue of the Manifestation of Thy Cause when He was in the hands of the oppressors."

O Haji Seyyed Mehdi! The King of existence, the Herald of God, continuously calls from the right hand of the Throne, yet none but the hearing ear has hearkened. Consider the times of the appearance of the Manifestations of the All-Merciful in the past: although all appeared with clear verses and firm, impregnable proof, nevertheless in each Manifestation most people, through satanic whisperings, remained deprived of recognition of the Manifestation of the All-Merciful and were, in these transient days, forbidden from eternal, everlasting life. The Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all in the realms of existence and possibility be sacrificed for Him - appeared with divine decisive verses and took from all the covenant of this most wondrous, most exalted Manifestation, to such extent that He made all the Bayan and what was revealed therein contingent upon the confirmation of this Cause. Nevertheless, some among the people of the Bayan committed that which no religious community had ever committed. Woe unto them from the punishment of a barren day! One must at all times take refuge in truth, lest the armies of ignorance prevail over knowledge and wisdom, and the hosts of conjecture and doubt triumph over certitude. Praise be to God that you are among the stars of the exalted heaven and among the branches of the divine Lote-Tree. You must, through the power of the Lord of Names and Attributes, rend asunder all veils completely, in such wise that should all the world arise in opposition, it would but increase your certitude. The divine Sun has shed its effulgences upon you in sleep; if these have not faded from sight, then rend asunder the veils and gaze beyond them with a luminous countenance. Verily your Lord is with you and with Him is the knowledge of the first and the last. In every Manifestation of glorious divine revelation, He sheds His effulgences upon all, but upon some in sleep and upon others in wakefulness, and this is God's way in every Manifestation, and verily your Lord is knowing of all things. We beseech God to preserve you from trials, and verily He has power over all things. In the days of God all else stands on one level, and the breezes of the All-Merciful waft equally from the paradise of grace and favor upon the peoples of all realms. Whosoever perceived from that sweet spiritual breeze the fragrance of the divine raiment attained unto eternal life, and all others returned to the fire by reason of what their hands had wrought. The tests and trials are discriminating angels of God who are occupied with separation and gathering - this is the meaning of what was revealed aforetime: "By those who drag forth violently." The intent is those discriminating angels who are charged with drawing forth and removing garments and spirits until distinction and separation become clear and evident. How excellent is the state of those souls who have remained firm in this Most Great Manifestation and who act according to the blessed verse "Say: God; then leave them to their vain disputations." To such degree that they have not been deprived by the world and all within it from the flowers of the garden of eternity. Those souls are preserved from all trials. Blessed are they! God willing, in this divine dawn you will drink of the choice sealed wine from the hands of grace and gaze upon the Most Great Scene. Ere long the foul odors of malicious souls will waft over that land. God willing, you will remain preserved in those days. Verily God is with you if you turn to Him. Today is the day of certitude and the obliterator of the doubts and fancies of the people of doubt, who have ever been deprived of the treasury of knowledge of the All-Glorious, while the people of certitude rest settled and at ease upon the throne of mighty assurance. And glory be upon you, O branches of the Tree of the Cause, and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

In the Name of our Lord, the Most Exalted!

This is a Book which speaketh with truth, and therein is that which sufficeth them that have believed in God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. O handmaiden of God! Thy letter hath come before Us, and therein was inscribed that which betokeneth thy love. Know thou that on the Day of Resurrection all things shall bear witness for their possessor, that thereby thy heart and the hearts of them that dwell upon the shore of nearness may be assured, and hear the melodies of Paradise, and be at all times drawn unto them. Verily, they who have rejoiced in the glad-tidings of the Spirit in the days of God, these are they who swim in the depths of the remembrance of God, who remember God with their hearts, who worship God with their limbs, and who unite with God in their inmost hearts, such that the gems of divine unity are manifest in their deeds. These are of the hosts of God - are not the hosts of God indeed the triumphant ones? They aid God at all times through their works and deeds and through all that proceedeth from them, could ye but perceive with the eye of God the mysteries of divine assistance. And thou, O handmaiden of God, give thanks unto thy Creator for that which He hath bestowed upon thee in truth and hath clothed thee with the raiment of holiness whereby the dwellers of the pavilions of eternity recognize thee and point to thee with their fingers in the chambers of hidden glory, and perceive from thee the fragrance of faith even as people perceive the fragrance of perfume. Therefore strive thou to remain steadfast in thy love for thy Lord, and guard thyself lest Satan strip the raiment of holiness from thy temple and thou be left naked before the concourse of Paradise when all eyes are turned toward thee. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of God and turn not to anyone even should all who are on earth prevent thee. Say: Glory be to God above that which ye utter! By God! Were the veils of earthly limitations to be removed from the face of thy heart, thou wouldst be struck down in that very moment by that which would seize thee with the raptures of yearning from every direction, such that thou wouldst find thyself in a station wherefrom are cut off the hearts of them that dwell within the tabernacles of glory. Therefore say: Glory be to Thee, O my God! Thou art He Who hath honored me through Thy bounty which hath preceded all created things, and hath given me through Thy generosity that which no soul among all existing things knoweth, inasmuch as Thou hast caused me to know Thy most exalted Self and the Manifestation of Thy most beautiful Names in Thy Name, the Most Exalted, and hast established me upon a path wherefrom have slipped the feet of them who throughout their lives have bowed down in worship. Therefore, O my God, since Thou hast gathered me together through Thy Name, the Self-Subsisting, and hast raised me from the dust of the graves, and hast caused me to arise for the love of Thee, and hast made me taste the sweetness of Thy affection, I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast unveiled the mysteries from the faces of the righteous, that Thou make me steadfast in Thy love and grant me Thy presence and honor me with the visit of Thy Beauty. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art the Mighty, the Beloved. Moreover, establish me, O my God, in the presence of them that are nigh unto Thee in the latter Resurrection, at the time when the Sun of Oneness shall shine forth from a Beauty wondrous to behold, for this is my hope in Thee and my trust from Thee, and verily Thou art the Bestower, the Most High, the Holy One.

He is the Most High. Praise be to God that thou hast attained to the supreme honor and been adorned with the mighty gift. Therefore, while time remaineth and the holy nightingale warbleth upon the mystic branch, strive that, God willing, ye may be sustained and refreshed by the pure wine and goodly fruits. Never allow sorrow to overtake you, for the world is a transient abode and for a transient thing sorrow and anxiety and grief are not befitting. Bind thy heart to the eternal Beauty that thou mayest enter the realm of eternity. Learn this Tablet well and recite it, especially from the beginning of the prayer.

He is the Most Wondrous, the Exalted, the Most Sublime

This is a tablet that speaketh the truth and remembereth one of our servants so that he may render thanks unto God, his Lord, and be counted among them who are grateful. O thou servant, rejoice in thyself inasmuch as God hath made mention of thee on this night - in which the embodiments of all names were resurrected through the potency of My sovereign and most exalted might and every resplendent dawn yearneth to attain its presence.

Say: O people! By the righteousness of the One True God, the dawn of the Day of God hath risen from the Day Spring of Baha and the Ancient Beauty hath appeared from behind the veils of names in the raiment of My name, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Hasten, O people, to the tabernacle of God and the adored sanctuary of His presence. This is, verily, that which we have ordained for ye in the kingdom of Our irrevocable decree with the pen of glory and wisdom. Journey, O people, with your hearts and not your feet, for We have entered the prison by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. This Spot lay behind a thousand mountains and whosoever hath reached for Us wert hindered from clinging to the hem of Our sacred vesture.

Say: those who have forsaken their selves and journeyed towards God and entered paradise - the abode where the Beauty of the All-Merciful was seated upon the Throne of His Name, the Most Mighty, the Great - and were honored by attaining the presence of the All-Glorious, and the glance of God, the King, the Powerful, the Almighty, the All-Knowing turned towards them; they have, verily, attained unto all good. The angels of eternity in the realms above, and the hosts of the unseen behind the mystic tabernacles and the embodiments of names in the kingdom of creation extol their praises. Thus hath the mercy of Thy Lord surpassed His servants who yearn for Him.

By the One in whose hand is my soul, one glance at My Beauty is preferable to that which hath been created between the heavens and the earth and from that which is ordained for all that dwell in the kingdoms of Creation and Revelation. Yet, in this day, whosoever directeth his heart towards the scene of His transcendent glory, God will verily compensate him for this. He is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient One. Say: O people of Baha! Journey not to this Sanctified Spot before leave is granted by Us, thus biddeth ye the Tongue of Might and Grandeur, if ye are of them who observe my precepts. O people! Direct thy steps towards the holy court of God with His acquiescence and at His behest and follow not your own selves and your corrupt desires. Follow the command of thy God, the Exalted, the All-knowing. Say: Heed O people the call of the One amongst you who summoneth you to God, and cast not His testimony behind your backs, and be not of them that transgress.

They who repudiated the signs of God in these days; they have verily reversed the favors of God upon themselves and have worshiped the idols of their vain imaginings and busied themselves therewith. O thou servant! Raise thyself from among them who denied the verses of God after they were sent down unto them and contended with Him and were among the infidels. Know ye that they who believed not in God, their Creator, in this Revelation, had verily waged war against God, and denied His proofs and gainsaid His signs and disbelieved in His sovereignty and were counted among the infidels in the mighty and wondrous tablets. Cleanse thou yourself from the love of these people, turn not thy face to them and befriend them not even for less than an instant. Avoid the likes of them and cling to the mercy of God and His generosity. Enter then the shores of His holiness - that impregnable and sanctified habitation. Rejoice then in your heart for God hath mentioned thee in His Tablet. By the righteousness of God, this is a blessing with which compareth none other that hath been created betwixt the earth and heaven. Thus have We revealed unto thee the word of truth, so that thou may follow that which thou hast been commanded by the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

The mercy flowing from the cloud of eternity rest upon ye, O people of Baha! This verily is a manifest mercy from a generous Lord.

O Preacher! In the Name of God, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal! This is a Tablet from Us to him who hath desired the countenance of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent, that he may give thanks unto God his Lord and make mention of Him amidst His heedless servants. We have created man and taught him utterance that he might make mention of his Lord between the heavens and the earths. And whoso looseth his tongue, it behooveth him to speak in praise of his Creator amidst the company of the veiled ones. All matters end in the remembrance and praise of God, yet the people are in grievous heedlessness. Hearken unto the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen, then to the cooing of the Dove which speaketh upon the branches of the furthermost Lote-Tree at the appearance of the Spirit of God, the Most High, once again with this Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Name, that there is no God but He, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have built mosques and attributed them to Our name, then placed pulpits therein that Our preaching servants might ascend them and counsel the people and advise them that they might take unto God a path. Yet they were heedless and perverted the words of God from their places, and changed God's favor unto themselves, and altered what We had ordained for them to attain unto a station of mighty glory - to such extent that they ascend the pulpits and make mention of that which God hath not permitted them. Thus have they transgressed in the matter and changed and were changed and became among the losers. And We have not heard of anyone ascending them with the mention of Truth, and they were among those who committed what they were forbidden in a Tablet mighty and preserving. And verily thou, ascend the pulpit by Our leave and be of them who make mention. Counsel the people and remind them of this Mighty News. Say: O people! The clouds have been rent asunder and the Lord of Lords hath come. Thereupon hath trembling seized all them that dwell on earth save such as have detached themselves from all things and turned unto God with power and might and sovereign authority. Say: O people! Consider within yourselves by what proof ye believed in the Manifestations of the All-Merciful in the past - bring it forth if ye be of the truthful! That I might know what is with you. Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! What ye possess will not profit you this Day. Cast it all aside, then turn unto the Most Great Scene, the Seat of your Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Beware lest ye reject the truth of God by what ye possess and deny Him in Whose grasp are the proofs of the Prophets and Messengers. Fear ye God, then have mercy upon yourselves and trust not in the vain life which will perish more swiftly than the twinkling of an eye, and ye shall return to dust with great regret and remorse. Do ye follow the desires of your souls and forsake the Best of Creators? Say: O people! Hear My words and deprive not yourselves of the outpourings of this cloud which hath been raised up in truth and from which rain down the showers of mercy and loving-kindness upon the hearts of all who turn in repentance. Thus have We inspired thee and commanded thee to convey the Cause of thy Lord with wisdom and utterance such that no mischief may arise, for He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. Then know thou that God hath ordained for thee in the Tablet a glorious and noble station if thou remainest firm in His love in such wise that the whisperings of Satan influence not thy heart, for they have appeared in every city in every form. Thus have We informed thee of the truth that thou mayest be of them who know. Shun every idolater and hold fast unto the Sure Handle - verily it will lead the servant unto the Most Glorious Ark which saileth upon the Crimson Sea by God's leave, the Creator of Names. And whoso entereth it shall behold all besides God beneath its shade. Thus hath moved the Most Exalted Pen upon the Tablet of Destiny from One All-Knowing, All-Informed. And the Spirit and Glory be upon thee and upon every discerning servant.

In His Name, the All-Wise

O Name of the Divine Glory! The call of the Lord of Names has been raised between earth and heaven. At all times He has summoned the servants to the supreme horizon and guided them to the straight path and the mighty, firm way. Yet while pure and sanctified hearts, after hearkening, turned toward the supreme horizon, heedless and doubtful souls remained bewildered and wandering in the wilderness of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Glory be to God! By what proof and evidence did the people of the earth formerly claim belief? Observe how divine verses have encompassed the world and His evidences have become manifest from all directions. Nevertheless, all remain heedless and veiled, occupied with their selfish desires.

O Hadi! Upon thee be My glory, My mercy and My loving-kindness, and upon My handmaiden who has ascended unto God, the Lord of all worlds. We make mention of her as a token of Our grace. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. O My handmaiden! Upon thee be the glory of God and the glory of those in the kingdom of names and the glory of them that circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn. Blessed art thou for having migrated in the path of God until thou didst arrive at the Most Great Prison and didst hearken unto the verses of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. He doth not suffer to be lost the reward of anyone. He maketh mention of whomsoever He willeth in such wise as shall endure throughout the eternity of names. He is verily the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Bountiful.

We make mention of him who was named Siyyid before Rida, whom thou didst mention in thy letter, and We give him the glad-tidings of this remembrance which God, the Lord of all remembrance, hath made. This is a remembrance unto which the Most Great Remembrance hath held fast, and a Tablet before which all tablets have bowed down. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord and articulate in His praise throughout the nights and days. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Wronged One Who hath come with the kingdom of verses on a day wherein the pillars have trembled. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Lord of the final end.

We make mention of Muhammad who was remembered before the Face, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. O Muhammad! We have heard thy call and have answered thee through this perspicuous Book. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of My verses and art seized by the rapture of My call, turn thy face toward My prison and say: I testify that Thou hast appeared and hast manifested what was hidden in the knowledge of God and concealed from the eyes of all else, and Thou hast borne in His path that which hath caused all things to lament. I beseech Thee, O Creator of the heavens and Lord of the Kingdom of Names, by Thy Most Glorious Name through which flesh hath crept and souls have been perturbed, to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love. Thou art indeed the Almighty, before Whose power all created things have bowed down. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the Powerful.

O Hadi! We send greetings from this spot upon thee and upon those whose names have moved My Most Exalted Pen and upon My handmaidens who have believed in the One, the All-Informed. Convey My greetings unto their faces and give them the glad-tidings of My mercy, My loving-kindness and My grace which have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. We make mention of the servant who was mentioned at the end of thy letter and We seal the Tablet with his remembrance as a token of Our grace, for verily We are the Kind, the Generous. Strive thou within thyself that there may appear from thee that which beseemeth the days of God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thyself and by all that hath appeared from Thee and shall appear from Thy presence, to ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen the reward of one who hath turned unto Thee, attained Thy presence and quaffed the cup of reunion with Thee. O Lord! Thy generosity is more manifest than the sun in the midst of heaven. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

In the name of the All-Knowing Speaker! O Muhammad, upon thee be My glory! In thy letter which Varqa, upon him be My glory, forwarded, mention was made of Nabil-i-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of Power, and likewise loving mention was made of the chosen ones, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God, by the pen of love. Each hath been honored by mention from the Most Exalted Pen, and from the clouds of grace the rain of mercy hath been showered upon hearts and minds. We beseech God that there may spring forth therefrom the flowers of divine realities and utterance. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Glorious, the Bountiful.

O Muhammad, upon thee be the glory of God and His favors! This Wronged One hath dealt with those who claim to love Him with perfect love and supreme kindness. To this testify the earth and its mountains, its trees and fruits, the seas and their waves, the sun and its rays. Yet some have broken their covenant and pledge, and severed its cord, and in the great city committed that which caused the eye of love to weep and the tears of the sincere and unified ones to flow. We beseech God to assist thee to remain firm with such steadfastness as cannot be prevented by the hosts and armies of the earth.

O Nabil, upon thee be the glory of thy Glorious Lord! During nights and days We have commanded the peoples of the world to observe justice, fairness, trustworthiness and piety, and counseled them thereto, yet most have preferred passion over guidance, and transgression and vice over righteousness and fear of God. In these days We have sent a sacred and blessed Tablet containing divine verses and tablets specifically to the Shaykh of the Land of Sad, that is, Ibn Baqir, that perchance the breathings of revelation and the fragrance of the divine presence might restrain him from that which is forbidden and attract him from that which is with him to that which is with God. Glory be to God! Verses beyond reckoning have been revealed and clear proofs have appeared before all faces. The Hour and its signs, the Resurrection and its mysteries, have become manifest.

We said: O Shaykh, if thou fearest for thy faith, preserve the Tablet in the pocket of thy trust. When God shall question thee at the gathering place about that in which thou hast believed, then bring forth the Tablet and say: By this blessed, mighty and inaccessible Book! Thereupon the hands of all created things shall be raised toward it; they shall take it and place it upon their eyes, and shall find therein the fragrance of divine favors and bounties such as none among the former and latter generations hath known.

O Muhammad, upon thee be My loving-kindness! The Cause hath appeared in such wise that proofs and evidences are humble, submissive and circumambulent. Yet the veil of deeds hath prevented all and deprived them. Beseech God that He may assist all and grant them success, that they may not be deprived in the days of manifestation from the splendors of the lights of the Sun of grace and bounty. Although in these days personal calumnies have secretly kindled the fire of sedition and hatred, God shall soon reveal that which was hidden in the breasts of the opposers.

These are the days of the appearance of that which the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur'an, blessed and exalted be His Word: "And if there be the weight of a mustard seed and it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth." Likewise it is the day of the manifestation of the treachery of eyes and that which is hidden in breasts. We beseech God to protect His loved ones and preserve them from the evil of heedless souls. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The glory of God be upon you, O concourse of chosen ones, and upon those who love you for His sake, the dawning, the luminous.

The friends of God in Najafabad! He is the One Who speaks with justice and is manifest through grace. O Ni'mat! The greatest divine bounty in the first station and primary rank has been and is His recognition, and likewise His verses are counted as bounty. All that has become manifest and apparent to the servants from the realm of His favor is recorded and inscribed as bounty. Blessed are the souls who have attained to this bounty. This is that bounty concerning which it was revealed in the Qur'an: "Our Lord! Send down to us a table from heaven." Beseech the True One not to deprive His loved ones of this bounty. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.

O Hasan! Hear the call from the direction of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Verily it has been raised in truth. Blessed is he who has attained to hearing it, and woe to every heedless and veiled one. When thou hast attained to the Tablet of God and its influence, say: "My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having given me to drink the Kawthar of Thy utterance from the hand of Thy bounty and for having reared me beneath the canopies of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee, O Illuminator of the horizons and Speaker on the Day of Meeting, by Thy Name through which discord was transformed into concord and difference into unity, to assist me in Thy remembrance in such wise that the wolves of the earth and its wicked ones will not frighten me. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."

O Pen! Make mention of him who is named Ahmad that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. O Ahmad! Be not grieved at what hath come to pass. Reflect upon what befell the friends of God in former ages and centuries from His enemies. Whenever the Daysprings of God's Cause would shine forth from the horizon of His Will, the people would arise in rejection and denial, and would strive day and night to extinguish the light of His manifestation. They have lost indeed who wished to extinguish the light of God or prevent His firm and mighty Cause. Soon shall the veils be rent asunder, the Cause appear, the light shine forth, the Word become clear, the Manifestation become resplendent, and the Will become manifest. In His grasp is the control of all things and He is the Powerful over what He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O Nuru'llah! Hear My call. There are ranks for hearing, for whosoever attaineth to true hearing - that is, heareth but one word of the divine words as befitteth - he attaineth to a station wherein all the hosts of the world find themselves powerless to prevent him. Blessed is he who hath attained to this most exalted station and supreme rank.

O Nasru'llah! Upon thee and upon thy father be My loving-kindness and mercy. We made mention of him at the time of his ascension with a mention that caused the breezes of thy Lord's mercy to waft, the ocean of His forgiveness to surge, and the fragrance of His pardon and bounty to be diffused. Thy Lord is verily the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist thee and those who have believed with the means of the heavens and earth, and to aid you to be trustworthy, truthful and faithful. He is verily the Compassionate, the Generous, the Hearing, the Responding. There is none other God but Him, the Powerful over what He willeth through His word, the Mighty, the Wondrous.

We make mention of My handmaiden and give her the glad-tidings of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech God to aid her in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and in that which will draw her nigh unto Him. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous. And We make mention of My other handmaiden with a mention whereby the hearts of the holy maidens in the Most Exalted Paradise in the crimson chambers and the chaste women in the sublime Garden have been attracted. Give thanks to thy Lord for this and say: "Praise be to Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom! I beseech Thee by the breathings of Thy revelation to ordain for Thy handmaidens that which Thou hast ordained for Thy handmaidens who circle round Thy mighty throne. Thou art verily the Powerful, the Mighty, the Great."

He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!

Praise be to God Who has recorded all things in a Book, wherein the Pen Most High has inscribed the manifestations of His power, the expressions of His grandeur, the revelations of His sovereignty, and that which none has encompassed save Him. And blessing and peace be upon the Mystery of His Book, the Secret-essence of His verses, the Sign of His oneness, and the Cause of His creation, through Whom the lips of mystical knowledge smiled in the contingent world and the decree of the All-Merciful appeared throughout the lands, and upon His family and companions who arose and strove in His path until they sacrificed their spirits in His love and in manifesting His ordinances and revealing His commands.

Glorified art Thou, O Thou Who art the Goal of all hearts and the Beloved of the souls of those who have attained to the station of unveiling and witnessing! I beseech Thee by Thy Self and by the Manifestations of Thy power and the Dawning-places of Thy signs to strengthen me in that which Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book. O my Lord! Thou seest me confessing my powerlessness and acknowledging my shortcomings. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy utterance and the lights of Thy countenance to protect me and Thy loved ones from the evil of Thine enemies. O Lord! Strengthen us through Thy power and sovereignty to remember Thee, then have mercy upon us through Thy generosity and favors.

We testify that through our heedlessness the pillars of unity have been shaken in Thy lands and the banners of detachment in Thy realm. Thou hearest, O my God, the roaring of the polytheists who have surrounded Thy dwellings, laid waste Thy lands, and usurped the territories of Thy servants. We beseech Thee, O God of the world and Goal of the nations, to send down from the heaven of Thy power that which will exalt the station of those among Thy servants who profess Thy unity and those among Thy creatures who hold fast to Thee. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Strong, the Mighty.

Thereafter - may my spirit be a sacrifice for your mention - the servant has been honored by what has flowed from the ink of your love and the pen of your will. When I read and understood it, I presented it before the Countenance and submitted what was in your letter. The Master - may my spirit be His sacrifice - said: "We beseech the Lord of all beings to strengthen whoever has acknowledged God and His signs and recognized His greatness and sovereignty, and We ask for him the best of what He has revealed in His Book. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer. We make mention of him and those with him as We mentioned him before, and We ask for them grace, mercy and blessing. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Generous." End quote.

Regarding what you mentioned about those who arrived there, they have permission to proceed to your presence. Give them this glad tiding. The servant beseeches his Lord to strengthen them in what He loves and is pleased with. He is God, the Goal of all beings and the Beloved of those in earth and heaven.

As for what you wrote concerning the apple of the eye, Husayn Effendi and Abdul-Karim - upon them be God's peace - after presenting it, the Master - may my spirit be His sacrifice - said they should hold fast to patience for a known time. End quote.

The servant presents greetings and sends salutations to the apple of the eye and to those whose names were mentioned and to all the loved ones, and beseeches God to grant them success and decree for them what will benefit them. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones.

Regarding what you wrote about the physician - upon him be 96 \[Baha'u'llah\] - a letter was sent to him before, and if God wishes, another will be sent to him again.

Peace, praise and glory be upon you and upon those who love you and upon those who have taken the Criterion with the hand of might, power and assurance, and have distinguished between truth and falsehood and between the people of unity and polytheism.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and Power!

Praise be to God Who ordained imprisonment for Himself through a wisdom known to none save His Own Self, the One Who dominates earth and heaven. Then He opened its door with the key of His Most Great Name and went forth before all peoples until the Throne was established in this garden, for which God had ordained that which pens are powerless to describe. He, verily, is the Fulfiller of what He promised aforetime in His Tablets, and hath manifested that which lay concealed in God's Books throughout the ages. He it is Who at one time spoke with the tongue of grandeur and glory, and at another time caused His Most Exalted Pen to speak, and there flowed from it that which caused hearts to be troubled and livers to be rent asunder. Blessed is he who is steadfast and firm, and who is radiant and joyous, who heard the call from the Most Exalted Kingdom and turned towards it in the name of his Lord, the Most Glorious, and who was so transported by the rapture of that call that the hosts of creation could not hold him back. Blessed is He Who stretched forth His hand from the bosom of power and delivered whomsoever He willed through His sovereign might which pervades the horizons.

And now, I have received your pen's trace and heard what your letter expressed. God knows your words brought me joy, and I gave thanks to God for this, and turned to the Dawning-Place of the Countenance and presented what was therein. Then the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, saying - and His word is sanctified above the praise of all created things: "We have mentioned him and do mention him as a bounty from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and We ordain what he desires. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the All-Wise. O My physician! Make mention of My station and My tribulation and what hath befallen Me at the hands of My servants. Thy Lord, verily, is the Instructor, the All-Informed."

For numbered years the Ancient Beauty and Most Great Name dwelt in the prison-house, sometimes in the most dilapidated of dwellings and at times in a more habitable abode. Yet always we passed our days and nights in a single room, the door of which was usually locked, until the Ancient Beauty, through the blessing of the Most Great Name, opened the prison door, as We had previously announced in the blessed Tablets. After arriving at the garden and renowned palace, which afforded some relief, news arrived from the prison-land that on several occasions the very prison itself had been dearer and more precious than what came after. Yes, the effulgences of the prison have been and will continue to be, even though We changed it for the utmost comfort and delight, and today people of insight behold it as a spacious, vast, wondrous and impregnable station.

Regarding what they wrote about the Place of Blessing, it was said that God willing their request would be carried out. O beloved of my heart! Truly those souls who have been the cause of this will surely attain their reward. I beseech God to assist all the friends in benevolent undertakings, so that from each and every one of the divine friends may appear a deed that will ensure the perpetuation of their remembrance and exalt the Cause of the Beloved One. Verily, He is the Answerer, the All-Bountiful.

In this land many different and contrary matters have appeared. In view of the gathering and heedlessness of some, from the beginning it was such that divine blessings rained down from the heaven of bounty at all times upon all, but later due to certain matters it was withheld, until we see what God wills and ordains thereafter. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the All-Knowing.

The request is that you convey wondrous greetings on behalf of this evanescent nothingness to all the friends.

O Hakim Musa, may God assist him! 11 Rabi' \[al-Awwal\] 1298

In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord! Praise be to God Who was in the eternity of eternities and will be even as He was. There is no God but He, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.

O my God! I beseech Thee by the Light that shineth forth from the horizon of Thy Will, and by the Name through which the gate of meeting with Thee was opened, to assist Thy servants and creatures in that which will cause Thy Cause to be exalted and the standards of Thy guidance to be raised amidst Thy creation. Ordain for them that which will solace their eyes and gladden their hearts. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

To continue: This evanescent servant has, on your behalf, fulfilled what was promised - that is, as requested by you, he attained the presence of the Goal of the world's peoples. Well is it with me and with you! Your letter was received. Praise be to God that you have been blessed with the bounty of health, which is the greatest of divine bounties. God willing, you will be assisted in that which befitteth this divine Day, for any deed that appeareth today purely for the sake of God, even if it be but a single word, is like unto a seed deposited in pure, good and blessed soil - it will surely bring forth lofty and wondrous ears of corn. Today is the day of sowing and planting, today is the day of planting trees. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto what God hath desired in His days, blessed is the servant who hath remained steadfast in His Cause and love, blessed is he who hath heard His call, and blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of His garment and acknowledged Him with his tongue.

I swear by the Sun of divine knowledge that if, until the end that hath no end, a soul were to continue mentioning and praising this wondrous, glorious Day, it would be seen as non-existent, null and void compared to what hath been ordained for it by the Most Exalted Pen. Unto God be the reward of the doers, unto God be the deeds of those who have turned unto Him, unto God be the praise of those brought nigh, unto God be the remembrance of those who remember Him. This Day belongeth unto God, exalted be His grandeur and the sovereignty of His might, and whatsoever is associated with Him is beloved and is the goal of the hearts of His sincere servants.

You and I must at all times beseech the All-Merciful to assist and confirm these servants in matters that will cause the people of the world to be mindful, that perchance we may be enabled to guide a soul to the gate of the Friend, or rend asunder the veil of one who is veiled through the blessed Name of the Friend. If we fail to achieve these things and the like thereof, we will have wasted our lives and departed this world with utmost regret, for that which occupieth and delighteth the people hath yielded and yieldeth no fruit, as all tongues have confessed, since its end is change, extinction and nothingness. This is a matter that, beyond hearsay, every eye hath witnessed: Where is Khosrow and his palace? Where is Shaddad and his paradise? The decree of God hath turned them to dust.

I beseech God to preserve these servants through His special grace and to assist them in that which pleaseth Him. Verily He is the Powerful, and verily He is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed. The splendor of God rest upon him who wrote thy letter, upon thee, and upon every just servant in God and His firm and mighty Cause.

In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!

Praise be to God Who hath spoken and caused all things to speak that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been in the heights of might and majesty, and the summit of grandeur and glory - He Whom the circumstances of tyrants have never frustrated nor the power of pharaohs ever daunted. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Strong, the Powerful.

Glorified art Thou, O Lord of the world and Desire of the nations! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy giving, and by those who have not broken Thy Covenant and Testament and have drunk the cups of tribulation and adversity in Thy love, to assist Thy loved ones and chosen ones to act as befitteth Thy days. Then protect them from the oppression of those who have denied Thy truth and disbelieved in Thy signs. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.

And now, O beloved of my heart, responses to thy previous and subsequent letters have been written and sent, and likewise in answer to the petitions that were enclosed with thy letter, wondrous and exalted Tablets have been revealed and dispatched. God willing, they will attain unto them. Similarly, in response to the petition of his honor M, upon him be the Glory of God, one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet in the form of a prayer has been sent down from the heaven of bounty with manifest verses. God willing, they will attain unto it and succeed in reading it. May He open before his face the gate of grace from God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and earth.

After the revelation of the prayer, this evanescent servant stood before His presence and He said: "O servant present! Write to him who beareth My Most Truthful Name, upon both of them be My Glory: The True One, exalted be His glory, hath preserved his honor M, upon him be My Glory, from grave dangers. He hath ever been under the glance of grace. Say: Be thou assured, verily He is with His steadfast, firm and active servants." And He said: "We have ordained for him that whereby his remembrance shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. It behooveth him to preserve this most exalted station in the name of his Lord, the Lord of all humanity."

In very truth, whatsoever hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen concerning him remaineth permanent and eternal, in such wise that the passage of centuries and ages shall not efface it. This mention hath ever been and shall ever be preserved in the Book of God, and its effects have appeared and shall continue to appear. Well is it with him for having attained unto this mighty station.

He further said: "We bid him to undertake - as a manifestation of service to the Cause and for the perpetuation of his name in the manifest world - that he should, with the utmost discretion, appoint a representative who would construct in the Prison Land an edifice named Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, and beside it a place for the righteous. This will benefit him in every world among the worlds of his Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful."

In truth this is a great bounty concerning him, for permission hath been granted that it be built in this illumined and sacred land. His is the praise and favor for this supreme gift. This is a gate of grace through which infinite doors shall be opened unto him. It behooveth him to thank God for this manifest favor. Since he himself sought that which would cause the perpetuation of his mention, name and station, he was therefore blessed with this supreme bounty. Through it shall appear what he desired of the favors of his Lord in this world and the next. There is none other God but Him, the Ordainer, the All-Knowing.

In the Name of God, He who is praised by His Own Beauty, the Most Glorious, the Most Holy, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Great!

O My Name! The barren lands have turned green through your arrival and presence therein, and the withered trees have yielded the fruits of divine knowledge when you turned toward them and alighted upon them. The anemones of inner realities have opened in the paradise of creation through the descent thereon of the rain of your Lord's mercy - the Educator, the Ordainer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We bear witness that you have achieved success in teaching and in what God has desired in His Most Inaccessible, Most Holy, and Wondrous Tablet.

We have heard of your encounter with Ha of the abyss. By My life, she is a deaf rock that neither drinks nor grows. By your life, the Supreme Pen does not wish to refer to her with a masculine pronoun. She does not understand what she says and speaks that which causes all created things to curse her. Your Lord is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing. She is among the most ignorant of the ignorant, knowing nothing of books except their colors, and nothing of scrolls except their decorative patterns. Would that we had found her possessed of clear certitude even in this much! By your life, she is among the idols - when you see her turbaned like a cloud. If the verses of God were to be recited to her, her head would move without her comprehending a single letter thereof. This is what God has testified to, before and after. He is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Say: O rejected one! Were all the scrolls of the ancients and the moderns to be gathered before you, each one adorned with the seal of authority, this would never suffice you. Rather, you must abandon them all and turn to Him Who speaks the truth from this exalted station. We have heard what you said regarding God's Cause and His mention, and the buzzing of that fly when it turned away from the truth and became one of the calumniators.

Know then that We have sent you the fragrances of verses from all directions, and now this perspicuous Tablet, that your heart might rejoice thereby, your eyes be consoled, and your breast be enkindled by this Fire which We have ignited at the midmost heart of the world through My Most Great Name. Your Lord is indeed the Powerful, the Mighty.

O My Name! Every fire has been extinguished save this crimson Fire that burns bright, and every water has frozen save this Water from whose flowing is heard: "There is no God but He, the Most High, the Most Great." Blessed art thou and those who have been attracted by the fragrances of revelation and have stood firm in the Cause of God and His sovereignty. They are indeed among the triumphant.

He Who is imprisoned sends greetings to those whom He sees turning toward God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: The Wronged One mentions His loved ones with that which benefits them in the kingdom of earth and heaven, and its effects shall soon appear in the world. He is indeed the Forgiving, the Generous.

Say: O My loved ones! Aid your Lord, the Most Merciful, in all creation. By God! All that you see today shall perish, but that which has been sent down to you from the Supreme Pen shall endure. This is indeed the certain truth. Blessed is he who ponders My power and sovereignty, and recognizes that which was revealed in My days and appeared through My grace. He is of the people of the pavilion of My glory - upon him be My glory, My mercy and My loving-kindness at all times.

Thus have We illumined the horizon of utterance with the sun of remembrance and explanation, that you might find the fragrance of reunion in the words of your Lord, the Mighty, the Praised. We beseech God to bring about through you in creation that which will cause His fragrances to waft forever, and to ordain for you what is better than all that has been created in the realm of origination. He is indeed powerful over what He wills, and within His grasp is the kingdom of your Lord's dominion over the heavens and earths. And may He adorn all lands through you, that the people might gather unto this firm, impregnable, and mighty Cause. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is the Mighty, the Exalted! O Letter Ra! Hearken unto the Call of God from the holy paradise, the Spot which God hath sanctified from the understanding of them that are nigh unto Him and hath made it the resting-place of His Most Exalted Foot on the Day wherein none was mentioned save God, the Lord of all worlds. Know thou that the Spirit will depart from the region of Iraq, and this hath been decreed by One Who is mighty and powerful. I have repeated the story in the soul of Husayn regarding how the claws of the oppressors seized him, and he left the Abode of Peace due to what the hands of the Muslims had wrought - they who claim Islam with their tongues while their deeds belie them at all times. When thou hearest this, grieve not but place thy trust in God, the Mighty, the Wise. Be not dismayed by the terror of that Day, neither be thou frightened by this fear which hath caused the eyes of the dwellers of the heavens and earth to weep, for in this is a matter which none of the mystics hath comprehended, and there shall appear in truth from God One Who is mighty, transcendent and glorious. After My departure, fear ye nothing and be not of them that are perturbed. Remind thou God's servants each day with wisdom and be not of the patient ones, for they who have recognized their Lord close their eyes to all else, even should all creation turn them away. Say: The Bird hath ascended from paradise and seeketh another paradise, if ye be of them that know. He feareth no one and will never fear any soul through the power of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Beware lest thou forget God's favor upon thee; then walk in My footsteps and be not of the fearful ones. Counsel God's loved ones as much as thou art able and be of them that remember, for We have made thee a remembrance for Our sincere servants that thou mayest remind them by Our command, and We are ever mindful. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon them that follow thy word by the command of One Who is wise and knowing.

He is God! Praise be to God Who hath made His loved ones the dawning-places of His decree, and this servant, at this time when all tribulations are raining from the clouds of destiny, hath been and will remain thankful to Him with every tongue and utterance, for whatever is attributed to the Beloved is surely sought after by the lover with all his heart. In any case, this servant in these days hath intended to journey to another land, and the details of this will become known. The loved ones of God must walk in the footsteps of this servant and henceforth be more firm and steadfast in the Cause, that through divine grace they may soar with these servants in the eternal realms. We have left his honor Aqa Siyyid Mahdi in this land for certain matters and We shall send correspondence to him.

He is God! We send greetings, mention and glory to all the loved ones. Blessed are they who in the divine days have attained the honor of nearness and meeting. Happy are they in having won a blessing wherein God hath ordained no portion for any besides them. If anyone wishes to send the Rights of God, let them send it to Aqa Siyyid Mahdi, as some debts were outstanding and have been transferred to him. The rest is as it was.

Know then, O concourse of the beloved! When the Sun setteth, the birds of night will surely fly in the darkness. At such time, turn not your attention to them and be not of those who incline towards them. Purify your faces for God, the Lord of all worlds. Thus have We informed you through Our grace, as a gift from Us to all worlds.

Not a single night in Mine earthly life did I find rest; not a single day was I granted repose. At one time My severed head was sent as a trophy from land to land; at another I was suspended in the air. At one time I had for a boon companion him who dealt Me a fatal blow; at another I had for a close associate him who profaned My remains. Every morn, as I arose from My bed, a fresh affliction awaited Me; and every eve, as I repaired to the solitude of My chamber, a sore trial was in store. In the succession of My woes there was no reprieve, and in the onslaught of My sorrows there was no respite.

Notwithstanding all this, I stood against Mine enemies manifest as the sun and appeared before the dwellers of the heavenly kingdom bright as the moon. Not for an instant did I seek to preserve Mine own life, and not for a moment did I pursue Mine own ease and comfort. I offered up My soul in the path of My Beloved and laid down My life for His sake. My fortress was My reliance on God, and My shield Mine attachment to that peerless Friend; Mine armour was Mine unfailing trust in Him, and My hosts Mine ardent hope in His grace.

At length My revelation aroused the envy of My foes and elicited the rancour of the malicious. O My Messenger! Wert thou to gaze with a keen and discerning eye, thou wouldst behold all things--yea, verily, even the denizens of the Realm on high--sharing in Mine anguish and sorrow. O Messenger! The oppressive gloom of satanic envy hath concealed the resplendent Morn of the spirit, and the darksome veils of malice have obscured the refulgent rays of the Day-Star of eternal holiness.

At this present hour the Ancient King hath purposed to take leave of this wayward people. Yet none knoweth whether, even after His departure, this Essence of God's mercy will be spared the sting of these venomous serpents, as was clearly witnessed after His first banishment.

O Rasul! Canst thou perceive the plight of this wronged and banished Soul Who findeth Himself sore tried by two contending peoples, and Who hath neither the pity of His foes nor the compassion of His friends? I swear by My Beauty that the afflictions I suffer at the hands of Mine enemies are a hundred thousand times easier to bear! Render thanks unto God that thou art not fully acquainted with the condition of Him Who is the Eternal King and that which He hath been made to suffer. These indeed are days whose like the eye of creation hath never seen. Strive, then, that thou mayest forsake the path of illusion and imitation and gain admittance into the realm of inner vision and the kingdom of spiritual discoveries. For in these days all are bewildered in the drunkenness of ignorance, save those whom thy Lord hath willed to spare. Some consider the fading mirage to be the billowing ocean and reckon the impenetrable darkness as the radiant morn. Others, having forsaken the river of eternal life, content themselves with a vanishing drop. Such is the state and condition of the people: "Thus have We created the souls in divers conditions."

As to thee, O Rasul, shouldst thou wish to take flight in the atmosphere of My love, it behoveth thee to soar above the kingdoms of earth and heaven and all that they contain, that thou mayest attain the paradise of the good-pleasure of the All-Glorious. Well is it with them that have entered therein!

This is a Tablet revealed for the first one who made pilgrimage to the Sanctuary of God, exalted be His Glory. He is the Mighty. O Salman! May God magnify thy reward and accept thy obedience, inasmuch as thou hast journeyed unto God time and again, and hast migrated unto God, and hast endured hardship on the path such that thou wert exposed to the heat of the sword and the cold of winter, until thou didst enter this remote prison. Neither the length of the journey nor the lack of a guide deterred thee. Well is it with thee for having been preceded by grace and encompassed by mercy, and for having entered the spot of acceptance and the station of attainment. Therefore give thanks to God, thy Creator, for having aided thee in this and provided thee with His love and the love of His friends, and caused thee to reach a station from which the hands of those who turned away, disbelieved and associated partners with God were cut off. By God! Thy name hath been mentioned in the Supreme Concourse and the most exalted Horizon, at the Tree of Eternity, and verily the denizens of the realm of might and the inhabitants of the dominion of sovereignty and the kingdom know thee even as the people of earth know thee - nay, more than that. Therefore strive within thyself to remain steadfast in thy love for thy Lord, lest thou be cut off from this everlasting, unified, eternal, perpetual dominion. Eschew thine own desires, O servant, and draw near unto the side of God, thy Lord. Grieve not over what hath befallen thee in the paths of thy Creator and what shall befall thee in the love of thy Lord, for unto Him is thy return and abiding place. With Him no deed of any doer is lost, nor the reward of any who earns reward, nor the truthfulness of any truthful one, nor the migration of any emigrant, nor the wayfaring of any wayfarer, nor the certitude of any possessor of certitude. Unto Him ascend good words and pure deeds. Thus have We imparted unto thee from the wisdom of God, Who hath perfected all things through His sovereignty and ordained therein consummate wisdom, that thou mayest thank Him in thy days and be of those who gave thanks, and persevered, and met their Lord, and sought, and attained, and aimed, and found. As to what thou asked regarding the verse of triumph, know that God, thy Lord, hath ever been and shall ever be triumphant, standing, mighty. None can frustrate Him and no affair can prevent Him. He hath been and shall ever be in the heights of triumph, power and majesty, and in the summit of might, grandeur and independence. And verily, whatsoever thou hast heard and known regarding the mention of triumph pertaineth to My servants. Soon shalt thou behold them triumphant even as they triumph this day. Hast thou not seen and heard how this Servant journeyed in His journey and migration with great power and manifest sovereignty, such that the necks of every mighty one bowed before Him and the heads of every proud one were humbled before Him, although all were Our enemies inasmuch as they turned away and opposed Us and showed pride towards God in relation to Us? Thus recognize thou the power of God, His triumph, His sovereignty and His glory. Say: By God! Through this journey the Cause of God hath been exalted. Soon shalt thou find those who turned away beneath the feet of the believers. Thus have We taught thee that thou mayest be of those possessed of certitude. And withal, by God, O Salman, We would make peace with the people of the Bayan: if they will not love Me, let them not hate Me. By God! Thou shalt find their turning away from this Light which hath shone forth from the horizons with a luminous countenance, a mighty proof and a supreme evidence. The Spirit and the light and the glory be upon thee and upon those who have recognized the mysteries of the Cause from this mighty quarter.

O Ali Muhammad in the City! He is the Ever-Abiding, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting! O Ali, bear thou witness in thy soul, thy being and thy spirit that verily He is God, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O people, this is the Beauty of God which hath appeared in truth, and this is the Proof which hath been sent down through grace unto a people who are guided. There is no God but Him - His is the creation and the command. He giveth life to whomsoever He willeth through His leave and causeth to die whomsoever He desireth through His power, and all shall return unto Him. Say: O people, believe in God and in that which was revealed in the Bayan, and transgress not His bounds. Fear ye God and break not your covenants which ye made with Him in a praiseworthy station of nearness, and forget not God's favor when He reciteth unto you at every moment from the verses of God, the Mighty, the Beloved, and imparteth unto you the gems of knowledge and wisdom, and revealeth unto you the mysteries of a hidden knowledge. Say: Verily the grace, knowledge and wisdom have all appeared in the temple of a concealed Name, Whose manifestation was veiled by His beauty in such wise that none among creation recognized Him, could ye but know it, though He moved among them all the days as one of them, as though they were veiled by their own selves and were as blind, deaf and dumb, in that they beheld not the Beauty of God nor heard the melodies of God, though all these were before their eyes morning and evening. Thus doth God withhold what He willeth through His command and extend mercy unto whom He pleaseth, for He is the Sovereign, the Single, the Exalted, the All-Powerful. Say: When the idolaters opposed Us, We opposed them and manifested Our Self in spite of those who disbelieved in God's signs. O Ali, know thou that every wise command hath appeared from this firm, mighty and manifest Cause, and every decree wherewith God hath decreed in every age and dispensation hath dawned from this great and hidden Decree. Whoso denieth this Cause hath denied God's Cause in all ages and dispensations, and whoso turneth away from it hath turned away from the Manifestations of God, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. As for those whom ye find walking in the darkness of their souls, associate not with them but shun them and turn unto God your Lord, then put your trust in Him, for in Him let the trusting put their trust. God shall soon raise up one who shall take My right from them and render them as scattered dust. Thus do We impart unto thee from the verses at which are bewildered the minds of those who ponder the signs of God. I counsel thee to turn to none else and to hold fast unto naught save the cord of God, for this is better for thee and for those who set their faces toward this Countenance. Forget not what We counseled thee before, then stand firm in thy love for thy Lord and be not of those who forgot God's covenant during My absence in these numbered days. Rend asunder the veils from thy heart's face and fear no one in thy Lord's path, then burn away the shrouds of idle fancy and be as God's sword and His might against His enemies and those in whom thou findest hatred for this resplendent, exalted, transcendent and glorious Light. Then convey Our greetings to those who are with thee, both men and women, and to thy spouse who hath believed in her Lord and remained upon a mighty extended path.

O 'Ali Muhammad ibn al-Sadiq! In the name of the meanings, I am the Manifestation of meanings. We have accepted you in all meanings, and We have given you all meanings in love of these meanings, and We have manifested you with truth at the appearance of meanings, and We have confirmed you with acknowledgment upon the temple of meanings, and We have sent down upon your heart the waters of meanings, and We have quickened you through the breaths of meanings. Thus has spoken the Creator of meanings from the Pen of meanings, and has sent down upon you the Word of meanings, and has sent it to you from the mercy of meanings.

The Supreme Pen declares: O 'Ali-Qabli-Nabil! Stand firm in the Cause of God with such firmness that all who are in the heavens and earth shall be made firm by your steadfastness. Convey to the loved ones of God a wondrous mention from the tongue of God, and then proclaim that until these days the faith of the people of faith and others was not known, for pure and illumined hearts have perceived naught save the subtle essences of the jewels of the words of Divine glory, and purified ears have not been sullied by hostile words. Therefore all souls remained concealed in their own mines, though they were and shall be visible before God. But in these days when the cawing of the polytheists has been raised and the braying of the calumniators has ascended, O loved ones of God, detach yourselves from all else but God and hold fast unto Him and seek His presence, and stand firm in the Cause of God that ye may be safe from the terror of the Most Great Fear. For those souls who were created by the hand of mercy and were known by the garments of names have disbelieved in God and associated partners with His oneness and warred against His Self and denied His signs whereby their faith had been established. By Him Who is unique in His sovereignty, then in His mercy, then in His singleness - one whom I nurtured throughout all nights and days, and showered upon him the outpourings of the seas of knowledge and wisdom, and preserved him in the fortress of power and grandeur, arose to cut down the Divine Tree. When God disappointed him in what he desired, he then arose to cause the rancor of God to enter the hearts of His servants. When he found himself disappointed in what he had intended, he opened his tongue of calumny that he might cast doubt in hearts that were not firm, and he wrote words about which any soul with the least discernment would testify to their falsity. Although all people are aware of the sovereignty of the ocean and are convinced of its outpouring, if someone, out of envy and hatred, should say "I sought to draw near to the Most Great Ocean but it did not bestow its outpouring" - is such a person truthful? Nay, by the Self of God, the Mighty, the Most High, the Great!

O 'Ali-Qabli-Nabil! God willing, through divine grace you shall remain firm in the Divine Cause and speak forth in praise of His Self in these days when most tongues have grown weary and most souls have become sick, even though people had and have no knowledge of the root of this Cause. By God! What has been heard was from this servant, and no one has yet understood. Far be it from the ignorant people! Say: O people! Open the eye of God which is deposited within you and with that deposited sign, contemplate His Cause that perchance ye may attain to its source and fountainhead. Blessed are they that attain! These are the divine melodies that were revealed from the holy tongue of the Eternal. Blessed art thou! Then peace be upon thee! Then contentment be upon thee, for thou hast been content with the good-pleasure of God, the Help in Peril, the Most High, the Great!

In the Name of Him Who was sanctified beyond mention and utterance! O servant! If thou desirest to know what befalleth Me of tribulations, reflect upon the state of the Spirit among the company of the Jews, and Muhammad among the company of the wicked, and Ali among the people of the Qur'an, and His Beloved One among the people of the Bayan who recite His verses yet deny His own Self. Then know thou that the most grievous of all tribulations is the trial of Truth at the hands of one renowned by His name, as thou witnesseth in these days that Truth hath been tried at the hands of an oppressor who hath become known for justice. This is a tribulation wherewith no one hath been afflicted before. Therefore do I weep, and the realities of all things weep, and I lament, and the Prophets lament around thy Lord's throne. Yet the people are veiled from what they have wrought and are heedless of that for which they were created. Woe unto them and unto those who follow them!

If thou desirest to help this Wronged One, help Him through mention and utterance. Then prevent the loved ones of God from warfare and disputation. Say: By God! The Ancient Beauty hath been sent with mercy and loving-kindness. Whoso associateth himself with Him yet warreth with anyone - God is quit of him and We are quit of him. Thus hath the matter been decreed in this Revelation.

Say: O people! Fear God Who created you, and commit not what ye have been forbidden, and abandon not what ye have been commanded in the Tablets of God, your Creator. For He hath ordained that His victory shall come through the promotion of His Cause. Blessed is he who helpeth his Lord as He hath commanded. Say: Your help is first to detach yourselves from all save God, your Creator. And whoso detacheth himself from all else out of love for His Beauty and teacheth the people His Cause - him shall all in the heavens and earth assist, and the hosts of the seen and the unseen. Thus hath the matter been ordained, yet the people perceive not.

Say: O people! Commit not that which would destroy God's honor amongst His servants and extinguish the fire of His Cause in the hearts of His creatures. Fear God, O people, and be of them from whom waft the sweet fragrances of holiness and detachment, and to whose sanctity the Concourse on High bear witness. These are God's loved ones on earth and His trustees in all lands. By the light of their countenance are illumined worlds which none hath discovered save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Purify thou thy heart from all save God, thy Lord. Then drink thou the Most Pure Wine in this Paradise which hath been adorned with the mention of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Highest. Then speak forth His praise in the kingdom of creation, that perchance they who slumber on the couch of heedlessness may awaken and turn, then hasten at God's call to the Most Pure and Most Glorious Wine, and be of them who have drunk the Living Waters from the hand of the All-Merciful and have said: "Praise be to God Who hath fulfilled what He promised us and given us to drink a pure drink, and honored us with the fragrances of His days, and chosen us from among His creatures for the recognition of His Self, the Dominant, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting!"

The Spirit be upon thee and upon those whom the veils of glory have not prevented from turning unto God, the Mighty, the Most High. Then know thou that this Tablet was not revealed in the manner of verses, nor in the manner of sermons and supplications and intimate communion, that it might tell of My tribulation and My trials through that which We have ordained for Our Self in the path of My Lord and My Beloved and My Master and My Sovereign and My Purpose and My Worshipped One and My Refuge and My Shelter.

In the City. O Ahmad of the people of Kaf! He is God, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious! O Ahmad! At all times have conclusive proofs been made manifest unto thee, yet thou hast remained heedless. In every season hath the heavenly stream of divine grace been made to flow towards thee, yet thou hast not partaken of a single drop thereof. Would that matters had ended there! Certain statements proceeded from thee which were unworthy. Although at the time of thy presence thou wert counseled to speak naught but the truth and to become not the cause of people's perplexity, yet didst thou utter that which caused the people to be veiled, and at no time didst thou speak the truth. This servant hath never desired, nor will He ever desire, aught from God's servants save truthfulness and fairness - God is sufficient witness unto this. Thou didst cling to vain imaginings and become detached from the firm handle of certitude. Hearken unto My call: Barter not religion for the world, and speak not according to idle fancy. We have passed over all else. Was it not evident to thee that this servant withholdeth not bread from anyone, nor hath He ever reproached any soul concerning bread, nor denied the riches of this world to any person? Nevertheless, when the letter from those people arrived containing those calumnies which they had attributed to the truth, why didst thou not speak such words as would make all people aware of the falsity of the statements they had attributed to the truth? For thou wert present and didst witness that were all the treasures of the earth to be gathered together, they would not be withheld from any soul, nor will they ever be. By God, O Ahmad! That very letter from those people completed God's proof against thee, for thou art certain they wrote falsely. Hearken, then, to the call of the True One, the Trusted One, and emerge from the darkness of fancy into the illumined realm of certitude. O Ahmad! Hearken unto My call. Consider him to whom thou didst cleave - how he hath begged from the people, writing that they give him no bread, that they have cut off his stipend, and that they have housed him in a ruined dwelling. Thou knowest that whatsoever was possible in the visible realm was never withheld from him, and after thee I never associated with him. Reflect now somewhat upon the wealth and independence thou didst witness from the Truth, and upon his base conduct in writing such calumnies and displaying such meanness. Would that he had been content with what he wrote and sent to Iraq! He hath also written to the governor of this land, complaining and begging for bread. Thou art certain that were all the peoples of the world to come unto this servant, they would forever feast at the banquet of His bounty and would never be deprived or excluded. By God, O Ahmad! If thou wouldst but reflect upon these very deeds they have committed and words they have written to various quarters, thou wouldst distinguish truth from falsehood. By God, O Ahmad! My love for thee hath caused this Tablet to be sent, else thy Lord is independent of all worlds. We hope that thou wilt soar in holy atmosphere and enter the realm of truth, becoming detached from all the world and them that are therein, and returning unto the Truth. Glory be upon thee if thou hearest what thy Lord hath counseled thee and returnest from fancy to certitude. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the Name of God, the One Who dominates all who are in the heavens and on earth. This is a letter from the Prisoner to the prisoners in the path of God. O thou who gazest toward God and art mentioned before the Throne! The letter which thou didst send to His name Jud, upon him be the Glory of God, was presented at the Most Holy Court and brought the utmost joy. The mention of you all hath ever been and will continue to be before the Wronged One. Convey My sublime greetings to the other loved ones and remind them all of these shining words from the tongue of Truth: Say: O friends! Let not slip from your grasp the eternal dominion and everlasting glory. Ye have been mentioned in the name of Truth and have been afflicted with great tribulations and mighty calamities in His path. Though outwardly despised, yet inwardly ye have been and will remain beloved. Ye have borne hardships and carried afflictions in the path of the Beloved of all possibility. How regrettable would it be now to lose these eternal bounties through imaginary concerns. Hearken unto the call of the trusted Counselor and be not content with abasement after such supreme glory. By the Truth itself, God will soon adorn the beginning of the Book of Existence with mention of His loved ones who have borne tribulations in His path and journeyed through the countries in His name and for His praise. Whoso hath attained their presence will glory in their meeting, and all that dwell in every land will be illumined by their memory. O friends! Waste not this most great station and remain not distant from eternal manifestations due to fleeting doubts. The All-Seeing, the All-Knowing counsels you not to destroy through the axe of suspicion and heedlessness the mighty edifices built especially for you by the hands of divine favor, nor to cut down with the saw of ignorance and foolishness the blessed trees of remembrance planted for you in the paradise of heavenly grace. There hath befallen you what befell the Truth, and this is a station which the concourse of the near ones and the sincere ones have yearned for and hoped to attain. Now it hath been granted to you without any merit, purely through grace and bounty. How could you be content to let this station slip away and waste your eternal, everlasting rewards? Meditate for a moment, detached from all else, that ye may become aware of the brilliant sun shining in the depths of the divine destiny and may understand the ultimate outcome of your deeds. The days have passed and what remains shall likewise pass like rushing winds, and all that is visible shall vanish. Strive ye therefore and adorn your deeds with the crown of steadfastness. This is the counsel of the Wronged One, recorded by the Supreme Pen out of pure grace and generosity. Blessed are they who are awakened! Blessed are they who reflect! Blessed are they who perceive! O thou who art immersed in the ocean of divine knowledge and soarest in the atmosphere of certitude! Impart unto them what We have imparted unto thee, that perchance the Word of God may stir them and draw them near unto Him. He is verily the Forgiving, the Merciful. Although the affairs of the loved ones of that land are not mentioned in detail before the Throne according to outward appearance, yet this Tablet hath been revealed purely out of grace, lest the darkness of worldly affairs and personal conditions deprive those souls of the enduring divine favors. Verily remembrance profiteth the believers. The letter written in the voice of Haji Abu'l-Qasim which was sent to Jud was also presented at the Most Holy Court. We beseech God to assist him to be steadfast in the Cause and to consider the consequences of all matters. He is verily the Mighty, the Forgiving.

May the honored and esteemed Nazir, upon him be 96 \[Baha'u'llah\] and His grace, take note. 152

In the Name of God alone, and blessings upon Him after Whom there shall be no Prophet. Praise, sanctified above the mention of all created things, befitteth the Dawning-Place of verses, Who through the Pen of Destiny hath undertaken the conquest of the world and hath, willingly or unwillingly, granted all kings and subjects refuge and station beneath the shade of one of His names. He hath promised His loved ones in all times the infinite bounty which is the station of reunion and presence, and hath chastised the deniers with the supreme retribution. His is the praise and favor in all conditions, and He is the Self-Subsisting, the Most High. And blessings and peace be upon the Dawning-Places of His Revelation, the Day-Springs of His Cause, the Sources of His wisdom, and the Treasuries of His knowledge, and upon Him Whose shoulder was adorned with the Seal of Prophethood among all creatures, and upon those who arose to serve His Cause and traversed the lands to exalt His Word until the banner of Divine Unity and the standard of detachment were raised upon the hills of the world - they are honored servants whom God hath described as those who speak not until He hath spoken and who act by His command.

Thereafter, this evanescent servant submitteth that your exalted letter, adorned with the mention and praise of God, exalted be His glory, and beautified with gratitude and thanksgiving to the Beloved of the world, may His favors be universal, did water the withered spirit and bestow the rains of joy. God willing, may this bounty not be prevented from being received, and may the waters of the world not extinguish this fire of love. At all times this evanescent one uttereth "Is there any more?" After perusal and experiencing happiness and joy, expressions of gratitude and praise were submitted. They said: "God willing, may they be the manifestation of divine bounty and likewise grateful and thankful." End quote. Many favors were shown, beyond reckoning, but this servant, in consideration of wisdom, hath sufficed with what was mentioned. I swear by the Sun of divine favor that in every word is concealed a world of meanings and an ocean of grace is hidden. How can this servant or any other be capable of expression or worthy of utterance? The Command is in His hand - He commandeth and judgeth, and He is the One, the All-Wise.

This evanescent servant conveyeth greetings and salutations to Aqa Mihdi, upon him be 96 \[Baha'u'llah\], and to all who serve His Holiness.

The servant, on 8 Safar 1299.

I submitted the expressions of mention, praise, gratitude and thanksgiving which that honor had shown regarding the Sanctuary. They showed infinite kindness. Aqa Mirza Shu'a'u'llah, in evening and morn, in setting and dawning, in absence and presence - nay, in all times and seasons and hours and minutes - is engaged in mentioning, crying out and calling to mind that honor. At all times a tablet is in his blessed hands; sometimes he sayeth "This letter is from the honored Nazir written for me," and then in the sweetest melody he uttereth - that is, he readeth what is in the letter - "Nazir" with a very prolonged extension, and "Karbila'i Mihdi and Fati." At times with tablet in hand he sayeth "I have written this letter to the honored Nazir" and in another sweet tone he singeth. The point is that most of his mention and thought is the mention and thought of that honor. There is no further opportunity to relate in full the details of their kindness; the completion of that will be in person, God willing.

O Mirza Abu'l-Fadl, upon him be the Glory of God!

In the name of the one true God! Praise, sanctified above mention and utterance, befitteth the Purpose of all possibility, Who with one blessed and most exalted Word weighed and judged the world by the balance of justice. From this Word at times floweth the Kawthar of eternity, and at times the breathings of the Holy Spirit are diffused therefrom. It is the River of Life unto all who dwell in the realm of possibility, and it is the Sign of the Ancient of Days amidst the peoples and the Dawning-Place of inspiration for the attraction of all beings. Exalted be its power, exalted be its sovereignty, and all-encompassing be its light through its manifestation! The trumpet was sounded and they that lay in their graves arose, and through its orientation all created things turned to the lights of the Face, and through its movement all contingent beings were moved in the precincts of the Throne.

O Fadl! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Justice. At all times in the Most Great Prison thou hast been and art remembered by the Pen and Tongue of the Ancient Lord. Praise be to God that thou hast drunk the choice wine of utterance from the hand of bounty in the name of the Lord of Religions. This is the day of assistance. Blessed is he whom neither the pharaohs of the people nor the tyrants of the age have prevented from rendering assistance. Thou art he whom neither the clamor of the barking ones nor the might of the oppressors deterred. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make thee an assistant to His Faith, a guardian of His remembrance, and one who standeth firm in service to His mighty Cause. Thus hath the Tongue of Certitude spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance, as a grace from God, the Lord of this wondrous Day.

When thou receivest My Tablet and findest from it the fragrance of My utterance, say: My God, my God! Unto Thee be glory, for having guided me unto the horizon of Thy manifestation, illumined me with the lights of Thy grace and mercy, caused me to speak forth Thy praise, and shown me the signs of Thy Pen. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom of Names and Creator of earth and heaven, by the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and by Thy most sweet utterance whereby the realities of all things were attracted, to elevate me through Thy Name amongst Thy servants. I am he who hath sought in the nights and days to stand before the gate of Thy bounty and to attain the presence before the throne of Thy justice. O Lord! Cast not away him who hath clung to the cord of Thy nearness, and withhold not him who hath sought Thy most exalted station, the supreme summit, and the ultimate end - the station wherein the atoms cry out with most eloquent utterance: "The dominion, the kingdom, the grandeur and the might belong to God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower!"

O Fadl! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Inform the friends that this is the Day of Utterance. The people of possibility must be guided by the hosts of wisdom and proof, and be led to the shore of the ocean of recognition. The Cause of God is greater than every great thing. In the Tablet of the World this most exalted Word hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen: Through the movement of the Most Exalted Pen a new spirit of inner meanings was breathed by the command of the True Commander into the bodies of words, and its effects are visible and manifest in all things of the world. This is the Most Great Glad-Tidings that hath flowed from the Pen of the Most Great Name. Blessed are they that are endued with true understanding.

When thou perceivest the breathings of revelation and art seized by the lights of the Face, say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having guided me unto the horizon of Thy manifestation and made me to be mentioned by Thy Name. I beseech Thee by the dawning of the lights of the Sun of Thy bounty and the waves of the ocean of Thy generosity to ordain in my utterance a trace of Thy most exalted Word, whereby the realities of all things may be attracted. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest through Thy mighty and wondrous Word.

In the Name of Him Who shineth forth from the horizon of the heaven of might.

Praise and glory beseem the Lord of the Kingdom of Names, Who through His all-pervading and invincible Will brought forth from nothingness, through the blessing of the Most Great Name, countless created things and adorned them with the ornament of existence, and through one drop from the ocean of His bounty adorned absolute nothingness with the garment of everlasting being. He is the Powerful One Whom the creation of the first and the last cannot prevent from His Will, and Whom the sovereignty and might of the hosts of rulers and ranks of divines cannot hinder. One flame from His Sinaitic Fire set ablaze the worlds of the seen and unseen with the heat of the love of God. Glorified be His signs, and exalted His power, and magnified His gifts and favors. There is none other God but Him.

Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God, and glory be unto Thee, O my Heart's Desire! I render Thee thanks for having drawn me nigh unto Thee and for having made known to me Thy straight Path and Thy mighty Message. I beseech Thee by the light of Thy Cause and by the fire of the Tree of Thy Manifestation to make me known by Thy Name and one who summoneth to Thy remembrance amongst Thy servants. Thou art He, O my God, from Whom none in Thy days hath been disappointed, and none hath been prevented from entering the court of Thy holiness. I beseech Thee by Thy Name which Thou hast manifested at one time through the choice wine, and at another through the Kawthar of reality, and at times in the form of the Tree of Thy knowledge in the manifestation of Thy utterance, to make me detached from all else save Thee and to hold fast unto Thy cord. Verily Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.

A mention from Us to him who hath turned to the supreme horizon and entered the seat of the throne with manifest love and heard the Call from the Dayspring of the utterance of God, the Mighty, the Wise.

O Abraham! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Mighty, the Great! We have fulfilled Our promise and sent down for thee that which hath brought solace to the eyes of them that are nigh. Say: O people of the earth, fear God and follow not your desires. Cast them behind you, turning unto the horizon of the manifestation of God, the Lord of the worlds. Beware lest the veils of the people prevent you or the might of the oppressors frighten you. Say: O party of God, cast behind you doubts and allusions, then turn ye towards the horizon wherefrom hath shone forth the Sun of certitude, by the command of God, the Ordainer, the All-Wise. Beware lest the world prevent you from the mighty Message of God or the power of creation weaken you from drawing nigh unto the One, the All-Informed.

O Abraham! Make mention of My loved ones on My behalf and convey unto them greetings from this wronged Exile. Say: Beware lest the might of princes frighten you, and beware lest the doubts of the people of error prevent you from entering the depths of the sea of the oneness of God, the Goal of the mystics. Thus have We sent down the verses and expounded them in truth and sent them unto thee that thou mayest be of the thankful ones.

Take thou the Kawthar of eternity from the hands of the bounty of thy Lord and say:

My God, my God! Unto Thee be praise for having guided me unto Thy path and illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy verses and by the mysteries treasured within Thy knowledge to aid the sovereign to turn unto Thee and to illumine him, O my God, with the light of Thy justice and to adorn him with the ornament of equity through Thy power and might and grandeur. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned unto Thee and have heard Thy most sweet call and the rustling of Thy Most Exalted Pen. I beseech Thee by Thy most great signs and by the manifestations of Thy bounty in the kingdom of creation to make me a helper of Thy Cause and one who acteth according to what Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous. In Thy grasp are the reins of all things and the reins of the first and the last. There is none other God but He, the All-Bountiful, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

In the Name of God, the Most Wondrous, the Most Impregnable!

Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou seest me oppressed amidst the people of the Furqan and those who claim to be of the Bayan. Thou knowest, O my God, that had they drunk the choice wine of inner meanings from the cup of the Bayan and recognized the Manifestation of Thy name, the All-Merciful, they would not have opposed the Beloved of all possibility and the King of all worlds, nor would they have denied Him Whose praise and remembrance the Tongue of Grandeur hath ever spoken. Thou knowest, O my God, that I desired through the Bayan naught but the purification of hearts and their preparation for this Revelation, whereby the Dove hath warbled upon the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree, and the Herald hath called out between earth and heaven, and the mysteries of Thy most beautiful names have appeared in the kingdom of creation. I know not by what countenance they who have turned away from this Revelation shall turn, or to whom they shall go, or in what valley they shall wander. By Thy glory! There is no refuge this Day for anyone save him who flees from his self unto the horizon of Thy most great signs, who forsakes what he hath and turns toward Thy most glorious horizon. Thou knowest, O my God, that I protected my brother from the vicissitudes of time and called him at all times to Thy name, the All-Merciful. I revealed unto him of Thy verses and sheltered him beneath the wing of Thy mercy, never leaving him exposed to the winds. How then hath he harmed Thy creation and wronged Thy creatures? I protected his life while he, in the most hidden of secrets, sharpened the blade of his dagger to shed my blood. I nurtured him in my days, yet he dug a pit for me. Despite my knowledge of what lay in his heart, I did not confront him until what was in his breast became manifest. I withdrew from them and departed from their midst lest there occur in Thy realm that which would sully the hem of Thy sanctity among Thy servants. Even after attaining power and authority, I did not oppose them until they plotted against Thy Cause and corruption appeared in the land. Their party in Iraq united with the oppressors who denied Thy Self and turned away from Thy beauty, until they made my family and loved ones captives from Zawra' to Hadba'. By what they have perpetrated, Muhammad Thy Messenger hath lamented in the highest horizon, and 'Ali hath wept at the Divine Lote-Tree. I know not by what proof they have denied Thee or by what evidence they have turned away from Thee. By Thy glory! Even if the idolaters were to tear my limbs asunder, I would not, through Thy power, cleave unto them or turn to them, nor would I, through Thy grace and favor, unite with them. Thou didst create me, O my God, from Thy nature before the creation of Thy heaven and earth, and I drank the wine of Thy love when I was still drinking milk from my mother's breast through Thy loving-kindness, and it shall never depart from me. I beseech Thee, O Cleaver of the daybreak and Creator of spirits, by Thy Name through which the tribes have lamented and earthquakes have appeared, to open the eyes of Thy creation that they may behold Thee seated at the right hand of might, power and majesty, and reclining upon the cushion of loftiness, glory and grandeur. Can there be one endowed with smell who cannot detect the fragrance of Thy merciful robe after its sweet-scented breezes have wafted? Can there be one with taste who cannot find the sweetness of this remembrance in Thy days? Nay, by Thy glory! Such can only be one who hath ever been deprived of Thy presence, veiled from Thy countenance, and forbidden the wine of Thy knowledge. O Lord! Purify the earth from Thy enemies, that thereby the faces of Thy chosen ones may be illumined and all may hasten to the sea, each wave of which proclaimeth: Praise be unto Thee, O Beloved of the worlds!

O Muhammad-'Ali in the Land of Alif! In the name of Him Who is manifest above all things! The Mystery of God hath appeared in truth from a holy and resplendent horizon. He hath appeared in the temple of the Youth. Blessed be God Who created Him through the sovereignty of His Command and sent Him forth in truth and dispatched Him unto all the worlds. He lamenteth within Himself at this moment and calleth out between the heavens and the earth: "O people! If ye will not believe in God your Creator, then at least be ashamed before Him and deny not Him Who was promised in all the Tablets and recorded and mentioned in the treasuries of the Sacred Scriptures. He hath come unto you with the Criterion of the Command, and around Him circle the Kingdom of God, and before Him march the hosts of the unseen in mighty array. He hath aided his Lord to the extent of His power, and He will aid Him in truth even though all existence, both seen and unseen, should oppose Him. My proof is My deeds and then My actions, if ye be possessed of knowledge. Blind are the eyes of those who have denied this bounty, after which, at His bidding, the clouds of grace were raised up and rained down upon all created things showers of mighty glory. Whoso is quickened by Him is quickened by the life of his Lord, and his name is inscribed by the finger of mighty power upon the Tablet. O people! Be fair within yourselves, then look with the eye of justice upon God's proof and that whereby He hath confirmed your faith and raised your station. Be not of those who denied Him in Whom they had believed and were turned back upon their heels. Fear God and war not against His Self, and dispute not His signs after they have filled both East and West and your own souls bear witness unto what I say. Take ye the chalice of eternity from the fingers of holiness, then drink therefrom by the leave of your Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and tarry not even for a moment. By God! Whoso turneth unto God in these days, the denizens of the Concourse on High will seek blessings from him, and whoso turneth away, his deeds are rendered vain and he returneth to his abode in the nethermost fire. Thus hath the Command been sent down from the presence of the Mighty, the Powerful. Say: Have ye heard in all creation the like of what hath appeared in this Announcement, which was promised in the Books of the Command by the Pen of Glory? Nay, by My own Self, the Truth! The eye of creation hath not witnessed its like, yet the people have denied and turned away, and for this reason the breezes of chastisement have seized them from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Wise. Fear God, O people! Deny not the Sun after its light hath illumined all who dwell in the kingdom of Command and Creation and those who abide behind the ocean of grandeur in an exalted and holy station. Cast away what ye possess and take what God hath graciously given you, then journey in the wilderness of His knowledge and tarry not even for a moment. Whoso striveth in Our path, We shall cause him to behold Our beauty and shall raise him to a station which was in truth exalted. And glory be upon thee, O servant, if thou remainest firm in the Cause of thy Lord on this Day wherein all the idolaters have dispersed far from Him. Aid thy Lord in this Beauty and fear no one, but place thy trust in Him. He will verily preserve thee in truth through His grace, and He hath power over all things. Say: In the name of God and by God! Then turn from the north of pause to the right hand of justice and pass by the people as the passing of a cloud. Thus have We commanded thee in truth that thou mayest remain steadfast in the Cause. Then glorify from Our presence the countenance of those who have believed in God and from whose faces shineth the radiance of holy splendor."

He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed

The world is illumined with the lights of the manifestation of the Pre-existent King, and the tracing of the Most Exalted Pen is raised up, and the Lote-Tree of the furthermost boundary \[...\] the delicate paradise is witnessed, and the Kawthar of utterance flows from the right hand of the Throne, and the Holy Spirit speaks "The Truth hath come," yet the servants remain heedless and veiled. Glory be to God! All acknowledge and confess the manifestation of Him Who conversed on Sinai throughout ages and centuries, giving one another glad tidings of the appearance of the Qa'im, but when the Herald of Glory spoke from the Kingdom of Grandeur saying "The Promise hath come" and the rays of the lights of manifestation shone forth from the horizon of the world, all arose in opposition and issued the decree to shed His most pure blood. The station of the divines and jurisprudents of Iran became evident and manifest to every person of insight. Until now they have not rested nor desisted. God protect us and you from the evil of these people.

O thou who gazest upon the Face \[and art mentioned\] before the Wronged One! The fire of hatred and animosity of those souls who are known by the name of 'Ali hath not yet subsided. We beseech God to protect His loved ones from the evil of those who have changed God's bounty into disbelief and caused their people to dwell in the abode of perdition. Convey My greetings to the people of God. We ask God to assist all to mention Him, praise Him and spread His verses. Say: Know ye the value of these days and hold fast unto that which is befitting. This is the counsel of the Lord of Names and the Sovereign Who doeth what He willeth, which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed are they who act and blessed are they who have attained.

Mention was made of Karbila'i Asad. We make mention of him with My utterance and We make mention of him with My verses and We give him glad tidings of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My loving-kindness. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Generous. O Asad! We have heard thy mention and have mentioned thee, and We counsel thee to observe justice and fairness and that which thou hast been commanded in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Rejoice in My mention of thee and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth! I testify that Thou didst call me and guide me unto Thy straight path. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and speaking in praise of Thy beautiful Name. The glory be upon thee and upon thy family. Give them My glad tidings and convey to their faces My greetings from the Wronged One, the Stranger.

Ye made mention of the people of Siysan. Verily We have mentioned them before and after with verses that cannot be equaled by the ornaments of the world and whatsoever the nations possess. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Mentioning, the All-Knowing. O people of Siysan! Hearken unto the call of the All-Merciful. Verily He maketh mention of you and counseleth you to observe goodly deeds as a command from the presence of One Who is commanding and knowing. Hear ye the call from the precincts of the Prison, from the Ultimate Lote-Tree - verily there is no God but Him, the Single One, the All-Informed. By the life of God! That which hath been revealed for you cannot be equaled by whatsoever is seen in the kingdom of creation. The Possessor of all things beareth witness to this in this exalted station. Blessed are ye and blessed are your ears in that they have attained unto the hearing of My call, and blessed are your eyes in that they have beheld My traces, and blessed are your hearts in that they have ruled in favor of the trust of My love, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. There hath been ordained for you from the Most Exalted Pen that which hath brought joy to the eyes of those who are nigh. Beware lest anything among all things prevent you from God, the Lord of the worlds. And We counsel you to observe wisdom and patience and forbearance and tranquility and dignity, as a command from God, the Almighty, the Powerful, Who came riding upon the clouds and calling out in His Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have heard and responded to their Lord, the Gracious, the Generous.

He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the Omniscient!

Your letter hath come before Us and We have taken note of the hidden expressions of thy love therein, and We were among the witnesses. We have answered thee with these words from which the sweet-scented breezes of holiness waft upon thee and upon all the worlds. Be thou thankful unto God for having arrived at the shore of the sea which none hath reached unto its beach, much less unto its depths. This is of the bounty wherewith God hath preferred thee above many of His servants, if thou be of them that are assured.

Therefore, beseech thou God with these words, that perchance He may bestow upon thee from His everlasting bounty in His most exalted Paradise, beneath the shadow of His Most Great Name, and may establish thee beneath the shade of the Tree of the Cause, and may detach thee from all that is in the heavens and the earth. And this, verily, is a great bounty.

Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst create all beings and didst send them down from the heaven of command unto the earth of destiny, and whereby Thou didst attract the hearts of them that have recognized Thee, and didst cause the minds of them that have professed Thy unity to ascend unto the court of Thy resplendent sanctity, that Thou withhold not from me the wondrous tokens of Thy gifts, nor debar me from the cloud of Thy gracious favor. O Lord! Return me not thirsty after Thou hast led me to the shore of Thy surging, billowing, mighty ocean. O Lord! Withhold me not from the breezes of the manifestations of Thy loving care, nor drive me from Thy door, from which none hath ever been turned away disappointed - even thus hath Thy mercy encompassed all the worlds. O Lord! Purify my soul, then my heart, then my breast, my body and my frame, that I may be worthy of the revelations of the lights of Thy glorious Oneness and befitting for the manifestations of the signs of Thy holy Unity. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the All-Compelling. Then grant me, O my God, the good of this world and the next, and preserve me from all evil and from whatsoever is repugnant unto Thy good-pleasure, for Thy mercy hath preceded all things and Thy grace hath encompassed all created things.

Thus have We taught thee that whereby God may make thee independent of all else besides Him. This is of His grace upon thee and upon His sincere servants. And if thou hearest with the ear of thine inborn nature that which the Spirit hath now cast down of the verses of God, the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Powerful, thou shalt surely find thyself detached from all things and from all who are in the heavens and on earth, and shalt attain unto that which thou didst desire in the hidden recesses of thy heart, and shalt taste the delight of them that have recognized Him.

As to thy question about going to the city, excellent is that which thou hast intended and wert among those who desire it. Hold fast unto that which was sent down aforetime unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God and Seal of the Prophets. Unto God belongeth the East and the West; whithersoever ye turn, there is the face of God. This was sent down from the heaven of God's might, the Powerful, the Omnipotent.

Strive then, O my brother, within thyself that Satan erase not from thy heart the remembrance of thy Lord. And when thou art adorned therewith, proceed to whatsoever land thou desirest, for nothing shall harm thee if thou be of them that are assured.

As to thy desire to serve me - verily, I am a servant among the servants of God and I love to serve, with my soul and my body, those who have believed in God and His signs, and God is witness unto what I say. How can one who is a servant take a servant for himself? This is a sin beyond compare, if thou be of them that know. I love to be a servant unto the loved ones of God and His chosen ones, and to lower my wing unto those who desire His face, according to His exalted Word: "And lower thy wing unto the believers." And peace be upon thee from this lonely, solitary prisoner.

He is the Most Ancient, the Most Great, the Most Glorious

The meanings have soared for a thousand years to attain unto the station of this Word which hath been uttered by the Tongue of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. The Spirit hath soared through centuries which none can reckon save God, that it might visit this Body which walketh in the Most Exalted Paradise that hath been named, by the Tongue of God, the Lord of the invisible and the visible, as the Most Great Prison. God beareth witness unto His Own Self that He hath appeared in truth and speaketh in this Castle wherein all matters have been confined to the mention of this Most Great Remembrance through which the greatest joy hath appeared in the world and every heedless and veiled one hath lamented. O youth! The Lord of all beings remembereth thee and calleth to thy mind when thou wert standing before the Presence at the gate which was opened by the finger of divine power unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thus hath the Ancient Beauty spoken in this exalted station. Behold and remember when thou didst hear the call of thy Lord and He conversed with thee with tenderness and care. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the Loving. And We remember thy father who attained unto the ornament of certitude and bore witness unto that which God did bear witness and uttered that which was recorded in My Preserved Tablet. We testify that he wavered not in this Cause and when he heard the call from the direction of his Lord, the Lord of Names, he said: "Here am I, here am I, O God of the unseen and the seen!" He heard and responded and submitted when the Command came to him from the Dayspring of the revelation of his Lord, the Lord of existence. We adorned the heaven of his heart with the luminary of My love, the Mighty, the Beloved. He attained unto the most pure wine when Iraq was My greatest horizon. He took and drank in My blessed Name, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Once he attained in Iraq and again when the heedless ones drove Us from the Land of Mystery. Thus doth the Ancient Beauty speak before the face of the world, but most of the people understand not. O Dhabih! Thy Lord remembereth thee in connection with that which befell thee in this path wherein the Guide Himself hath been guided by reason of what hath been ascribed to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. I testify that thou didst believe in God when He appeared in truth, and neither the veils of learning nor the imaginings of those who disbelieved in God, the Lord of the worlds, did hinder thee. Thou didst cast away what was with the people and took what was with God, thy Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne, and thou didst turn away from the people, advancing toward My Self-Subsisting Name, and didst abandon all things out of thy love for the meeting with God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thou art he whom the howling of wolves did not frighten, nor the barking of those who turned away from the truth, clinging to their vain imaginings. Lo! They are in manifest loss. O Dhabih! The Goal of the world hath turned toward thee and remembereth thee with that which quickeneth every mouldering bone. He remembereth thee and remembereth thy days and what thou didst utter in this glorious and wondrous path. Thou art he who took hold of the Book with the power of thy Lord and cast the book of the evil ones into the lowest hell. Thou art he who acknowledged that which God acknowledged and drank the wine of steadfastness on a day wherein the limbs of all names trembled and all who dwell in the kingdom of creation were shaken. Verily thy Lord is the All-Remembering, the Compassionate, the Generous. For God's sake thou didst hear the gloating of every oppressor and didst bear from the aggressors that which caused every just and discerning one to weep. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who draweth nigh unto thee and remembereth thee with that which the Most Great Remembrance hath uttered, through Whose name the gate of heaven was opened and the sea of names surged and the fragrance of God, the Forgiving, the Merciful, was wafted. The peace which hath dawned from the horizon of the Abode of Peace and the glory which hath shone forth and appeared from the horizon of eternity be upon thee and upon him who hath uttered thy remembrance and praise and hath visited thy grave by the command of the Ordainer, the All-Informed.

XVIII\. Say: We have caused the rivers of Divine utterance to proceed out of Our throne, that the tender herbs of wisdom and understanding may spring forth from the soil of your hearts. Will ye not be thankful? They who disdain to worship their Lord shall be of those who are cast off. And oft as Our verses are rehearsed unto them, they persist in proud disdain, and in their gross violation of His law, and know it not. As for them who have disbelieved in Him, they shall be in the shadow of a black smoke. "The Hour" hath come upon them, while they are disporting themselves. They have been seized by their forelock, and yet know it not.

The thing that must come hath come suddenly; behold how they flee from it! The inevitable hath come to pass; witness how they have cast it behind their backs! This is the Day whereon every man will fly from himself, how much more from his kindred, could ye but perceive it. Say: By God! The blast hath been blown on the trumpet, and lo, mankind hath swooned away before us! The Herald hath cried out, and the Summoner raised His voice saying: "The Kingdom is God's, the Most Powerful, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting."

This is the Day on which all eyes shall stare up with terror, the Day in which the hearts of them that dwell on earth shall tremble, save them whom thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, pleaseth to deliver. All faces have turned black except those to whom the God of Mercy hath vouchsafed a radiant heart. Drunken are the eyes of those men that have openly refused to behold the face of God, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised.

Say: Perused ye not the Qur'an? Read it, that haply ye may find the Truth, for this Book is verily the Straight Path. This is the Way of God unto all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth. If ye have been careless of the Qur'an, the Bayan cannot be regarded to be remote from you. Behold it open before your eyes. Read ye its verses, that perchance ye desist from committing that which will cause the Messengers of God to mourn and lament.

Speed out of your sepulchers. How long will ye sleep? The second blast hath been blown on the trumpet. On whom are ye gazing? This is your Lord, the God of Mercy. Witness how ye gainsay His signs! The earth hath quaked with a great quaking, and cast forth her burdens. Will ye not admit it? Say: Will ye not recognize how the mountains have become like flocks of wool, how the people are sore vexed at the awful majesty of the Cause of God? Witness how their houses are empty ruins, and they themselves a drowned host.

This is the Day whereon the All-Merciful hath come down in the clouds of knowledge, clothed with manifest sovereignty. He well knoweth the actions of men. He it is Whose glory none can mistake, could ye but comprehend it. The heaven of every religion hath been rent, and the earth of human understanding been cleft asunder, and the angels of God are seen descending. Say: This is the Day of mutual deceit; whither do ye flee? The mountains have passed away, and the heavens have been folded together, and the whole earth is held within His grasp, could ye but understand it. Who is it that can protect you? None, by Him Who is the All-Merciful! None, except God, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Beneficent. Every woman that hath had a burden in her womb hath cast her burden. We see men drunken in this Day, the Day in which men and angels have been gathered together.

Say: Is there any doubt concerning God? Behold how He hath come down from the heaven of His grace, girded with power and invested with sovereignty. Is there any doubt concerning His signs? Open ye your eyes, and consider His clear evidence. Paradise is on your right hand, and hath been brought nigh unto you, while Hell hath been made to blaze. Witness its devouring flame. Haste ye to enter into Paradise, as a token of Our mercy unto you, and drink ye from the hands of the All-Merciful the Wine that is life indeed.

Drink with healthy relish, O people of Baha. Ye are indeed they with whom it shall be well. This is what they who have near access to God have attained. This is the flowing water ye were promised in the Qur'an, and later in the Bayan, as a recompense from your Lord, the God of Mercy. Blessed are they that quaff it.

O My servant that hath turned thy face towards Me! Render thanks unto God for having sent down unto thee this Tablet in this Prison, that thou mayest remind the people of the days of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing. Thus have We established for thee, through the waters of Our wisdom and utterance, the foundations of thy belief. This, verily, is the water whereon the Throne of thy Lord hath been raised. "His Throne had stood upon the waters." Ponder this in thine heart, that thou mayest comprehend its meaning. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.

In the Name of God, the All-Knowing!

The Supreme Pen hath, in the prison of 'Akka, turned towards the loved ones in the land of Kha, that is, those souls who have been adorned with the new raiment, who are turned towards the horizon of oneness, and who revolve, through their essential, original motion, around the Will of God. Although this motion is mentioned as opposed to rest, yet it is sanctified from ascent and descent, and is exalted above vacillation and the comprehension of them that are bounded by limitations. Its effect is witnessed to be swifter than lightning and more penetrating than the winds. Nay, it is the cause and source of the appearance of the winds. These winds, if they be not mixed with carnal desires, will cause the effect of spring to appear in the realities of existence; otherwise, the effect of autumn will be manifest. The origin of this motion appeareth from the manifestations of the motion of the Primal Point, which in one station hath been interpreted as the First Mystery, the First Ornament, and the White Pearl, and from it the Fire of Oneness surgeth forth from the Blessed Tree, and the substance of burning is witnessed and concealed in all things. Exalted be God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting, Who hath created that which all who are in the kingdom of earth and heaven have been powerless to know! Those souls who today hold fast to the divine commandments and act according to that which they have been bidden - We testify that they are the ones who move by the Will of God and they are the achievers of that which the Mighty, the Generous, hath desired for them.

The time appointed for the nations hath expired, and all the divine promises mentioned in the Holy Books have been fulfilled, and the Law of God hath flowed forth from Zion, and the lands and mountains of Jerusalem have been adorned with the splendors of the light of their Lord. Blessed is he who pondereth on that which hath been revealed in the Books of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

O friends of God! Reflect, and with attentive ears hearken unto the Word of God, that through His grace and mercy ye may drink from the water of steadfastness and be firm and immovable as the mountain in His Cause. In the Book of Isaiah it is stated: "Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty." Should anyone reflect upon this very verse, he would become aware of the greatness of the Cause and the majesty of the station of the Day of God. And at the end of the aforementioned verse it states: "And the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day." This is the day when the throne of David hath been adorned by the presence of the Promised One, and this is the day the mention of which hath been recorded by the Pen of the Command in all the Books. There is no verse but it proclaimeth this Name, and no Book but it testifieth to this Remembrance, the Manifest One. Were We to mention that which hath been revealed in the Books and Scriptures concerning this Revelation, this Tablet would assume enormous proportions. All must today be confident in the divine favors and strive with the utmost wisdom to teach His Cause, that all may be illumined with the lights of the dawn of inner meanings.

O Pen! Make mention of him who attained the presence of the Throne and heard the call of this wronged exile. Verily, We have mentioned him and do mention him in this Tablet, that it may be a treasure and honor for him in the Kingdom of his Lord, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Then make mention of his brother who attained unto this station and entered beneath the shadow of the mercy of his Lord, the Generous. Then of him who attained the presence aforetime, submissive and humble before the Command of God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech God to assist all to recognize the Dawning-Place of His Cause and to draw them nigh unto the horizon of His Revelation, and to ordain for them that which He hath ordained for His chosen ones. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

We find Ourselves this day in a station wherein its very atoms proclaim: "The Kingdom, the Dominion, the Grandeur and the Power belong unto God, the Single, the One, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Praised!" Sorrows have encompassed Us from all sides through that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. The Day hath come, yet the people remain in a strange sleep. The Light hath shone forth from the horizon of God's Will, and that which was hidden hath been revealed, and He Who was promised in God's Book, the Lord of all worlds, hath appeared. Salman, upon him be My loving-kindness, came with a letter thou hadst sent to Muhammad, upon him be My Glory. He attained unto Our presence and hearkened. We have answered thee with a Tablet from whose every word shineth forth the Day-Star of God's loving-kindness, the Goal of them that know. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou didst inhale the fragrance of the divine utterance in the earliest days and didst attain unto a remembrance that shall never be erased nor followed by change, through a command from the Ordainer, the All-Wise. Arise to make mention of thy Lord with words that will attract the realities of all things. Thy Lord is verily the Mighty, the Luminous. This is the Day which God's Books have promised, both of old and more recently. Blessed is he who hath recognized its station and attained unto that which hath been manifested therein from the presence of a Mighty, Ancient Being. Say: O people! Help your Lord through wisdom and utterance, and through deeds that bring joy to the hearts of them that have recognized His unity.

Hearken in the Persian tongue and inform the people, that perchance they may find and hasten unto the path of truth. That which is needed today are deeds that draw the servants near, and virtues that cause love among the peoples of all lands. The Ancient Beauty in the days of Muharram uttereth praise of the true Sacrifice, Who sacrificed His soul, His spirit, His children, His kindred and His family in the path of God, the Lord of the mighty throne.

O Kazim, O Nasrabadi! This is a blessed name, for it is crowned with the crown of victory. Thou must manifest thyself in such wise that all may turn to the Source through thy movements, thy stillness, thy remembrance and thy praise. All this is from God's bounty unto thee. Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Will that hath encompassed all things, and by Thy Purpose that hath prevailed over all who are in earth and heaven, and by the dawning-manifestations of the Day-Star of Thy Most Great Name, and by Thy Command whereby Thou didst subdue the world, to make me steadfast in Thy service and speaking forth Thy praise. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I beseech Thee to assist me in all conditions to remember and praise Thee amongst Thy servants. O my Lord! Thou seest me detached from all save Thee and clinging to Thee and to Thy signs. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Self-Subsisting, whereby Thou didst unseal Thy Choice Wine, to make me a standard of Thy Name in Thy lands. Thou art verily the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.

We make mention at this time of thy son who was named Muhammad-Qabli-Hasan. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for him from His Most Exalted Pen the good of all His worlds. He is verily the Mighty, the All-Bounteous. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon thee and upon My loved ones and upon thy son and upon those with thee and upon those whom the might of the oppressors hath not deterred from turning unto God, the Lord of all worlds.

We have heard what thou didst compose and recite. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid thee in that which will draw the servants near unto Him and enable them to do what He loveth and approveth. He is verily the All-Merciful, the Forgiving, the Compassionate.

O Ali-Qabil-Akbar, upon him be the Most Holy, Most Glorious Beauty of God! Thy letter was presented before the Countenance and was the object of loving attention. Praise be to God that thou art adorned with the ornament of the praise and glorification of Him Who is the Self-Sufficing, and art embellished with love for the Beloved of all possibility. Blessed is the life that is spent in the service of the Truth, blessed is the tongue that speaketh His praise, and blessed is the heart that is gladdened by His remembrance. Give thanks unto God for having been enabled to inhale the fragrance of the garment of thy Lord's remembrance amongst His servants. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to strengthen thee in that which thou art engaged in, and to inspire thee at every moment with that which shall guide all who dwell in the realms of being to the Cause of thy Lord. That which thou didst mention concerning the people of M hath been observed. We beseech God, glorified and exalted be He, to aid all to turn unto the true Kaaba. How excellent is the state of those souls who, in these days, have drunk from the Kawthar of the knowledge of the All-Merciful, who have detached themselves from that which the people possess, and who have held fast unto the Truth. Upon them be the glory of their Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Strive with utmost endeavor to unite hearts and souls. He, verily, will aid thee under all conditions. He is with thee and will help thee through the truth. He, verily, is potent over all things. This land is in great turmoil, and this Wronged One is afflicted between two parties. Consider what hath befallen and continueth to befall the seventy souls in the Most Great Prison. Reflect upon those who were imprisoned with the Point for but a few hours, and likewise those who gathered with the Beloved in Tiberias. When matters became severe, they intensified and committed what they committed. Thus was it ordained and thus will it be ordained. Thy Lord is, verily, the Self-Subsisting, the Almighty, Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate in His purpose. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. That which was revealed in the Tablets sent down in Iraq and in the Land of Mystery, and at the beginning of Our arrival in the Most Great Prison, hath come to pass. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Know thou that Rida-Quli hath rebelled against God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou beholdest Thy servant, who is named Ali, who hath turned towards Thee and set his face toward Thy countenance, who hath inhaled the fragrance of the garment of Thy mercy, who hath arisen to serve Thy Cause and to aid Thy Faith among Thy creatures, and who remembereth Thee amongst Thy servants. I beseech Thee by Thy power that hath prevailed over all things, and by Thy Name which Thou hast made the Sovereign of all names, to aid him in such wise that there may appear through him that which will exalt Thy Cause in Thy lands and uplift Thy Word in Thy realms. O my Lord! Thou hast ever been powerful over whatsoever Thou hast willed, and wilt ever remain as Thou hast been from time immemorial. Ordain for him that which beseemeth the loftiness of Thy glory and the sublimity of Thy majesty. Then write down for him that which Thou hast written for the sincere ones among Thy chosen ones. Then inspire him with that which will draw men nigh unto the shore of the glory of Thy sanctification and bring them to the stronghold of the glory of Thy unity. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Forgiving. Convey My greetings to the loved ones of thy Lord in that place, then gladden them with this perspicuous remembrance, and to those who have believed among the people of Sin. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. Say: O My loved ones! While ye are in your homes, the Lord of all worlds remembereth you in the prison. Rejoice ye in the breezes of the remembrance of your Lord and in the rustling that hath been raised from the Most Exalted Pen for your remembrance, O ye who have turned towards Him. That which beseemeth you is steadfastness in this straight Path. Glory be upon you and upon those on whose faces can be seen the radiance of God, the Most High, the Most Great.

\[He is God, exalted be His glory\]

O physician, upon you be the Glory of God! Your numerous letters were received in the presence of this Countenance, and the servant present mentioned them all. As to what you wrote describing the friends in that land - We bear witness to what you have witnessed, but We counsel them to fear God, your Lord and the Lord of the worlds. For through fear of God the greatness of the Cause and the sanctification of Truth have been and continue to be made manifest among creation. By My life! If anyone were to taste the sweetness of the fear of God, they would hold fast to it all their days. This is a manifest truth. They have ever been and are before Our gaze, and the glance of Our loving-kindness has been and, God willing, will continue to be directed towards them. Those who have assisted the friends of God will soon receive the rewards of their deeds. Praise be to God that they have been enabled to attain this supreme bounty and greatest gift. Convey greetings to all.

Let Muhammad not be saddened, nor let the lack of outward means grieve him. Verily all affairs are dependent on their means. Convey greetings to Majid and the guest and her sister and their children - they are of Us. Likewise Abdullah and the others - all have been and are before Our gaze. All have been mentioned at the Throne and all are among the loved ones of God, the Mighty, the Powerful. Whatever has reached or reaches some of them should be given with the utmost humility. Verily your Lord will repay what they have spent. He is their Protector. This word suffices them, would that they understood.

Then convey greetings to the servant Rahim from this Wronged One, the Unique. Say: O servant, be steadfast in the Cause. By My life! This is a mighty Cause the like of which has not appeared in creation. Through it the atoms speak: "This is the Wonder of the heavens and earth! Through it all mention has been erased and the Tablets adorned with the ornament of the remembrance of the Lord of creation." But the people are in thick veils. Have you heard anything like what has appeared? No, by the Lord of the worlds! Blessed is he who has rent asunder the veils through the name of his Lord, the Bestower, and who has torn away the shrouds through this wise Remembrance.

Arise in the Cause in such wise that you see yourself ascendant over the servants and what they possess of the words of the opposers. It behooves one who has turned to God in this Day to leave behind all else and say: "I believe in God, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. No soul or mention or description can be associated with Him. Verily He is established upon the throne of His mighty Name."

Read what has been sent down for you and ponder it, that you may find the sweetness of the utterance which has been sent down from the heaven of grace from your Lord, the Mighty, the Generous. Blessed are you for having turned when the Wronged One was in the hands of the oppressors. Be not grieved by the intimations of those who have turned away. Leave them to their vain desires and hold fast to God, the Single, the All-Informed. We have sent down for you in every instance the verses of your Lord. By My life! They are clear proofs to all in the heavens and earth. Give thanks to your Lord for this bounty and say: "Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds."

O physician! You sent the letter of M and We learned what was in it, and We have sent down verses for each one mentioned in his letter - verses by which the hearts of the sincere are illumined. We sent them to you that you might forward them to him. Verily your Lord is possessed of great bounty. He has not left any name unmentioned - the Supreme Pen has moved to mention each one. Thus does God reward His servants who have turned to Him and His righteous loved ones. Let any soul who has not moved remain still, for this land is in motion and they are preventing. That which was hidden therein has appeared and will appear.

He is the Faithful Herald

O Land of Sad! Where are they who loved God and His chosen ones? Where are they who stood firm in His service in all conditions? Where are they who shone forth from the horizon of faithfulness like the sun rising from the horizon of heaven? Where is My trust in thee - didst thou deliver him into the hands of enemies, or did he sacrifice his spirit in the path of God, the Lord of Names? Tell Me what the people did to him through whom God's Cause was manifested among the servants and the horizon of love dawned in all lands. Be truthful with Me - where is the Most Great Trust? Where is he who circled round God, the Lord of the Throne and earth? Where is the Spirit who appeared in human temple to serve God, the Lord of Destiny? O Land of Sad! Where is the Tree of Love with its branches, boughs, leaves and fruits? It cries out, saying: "By Thy beauty, O Lord of Glory and Beloved of Ha! I cannot mention what I witnessed from the enemies. By Thy might, I am ashamed to present what the people did to their Lord, Master, Helper and Strengthener. How can I speak of that which saddens Thy heart, O Thou Desire of earth and heaven? Whenever I intend to mention it, weeping prevents me, and Thou art the Knower of both speech and whispered thought. By Thy might, O my Sovereign! If Thou were to decree my extinction, it would be dearer to me than to mention and relate before Thee that which causes grief in days Thou madest dawning-places of joy for Thy loved ones and daysprings of happiness for the people of Thy realm - and this despite my certitude in the ocean of Thy knowledge, the heaven of Thy will, the penetration of Thy purpose and the encompassing nature of Thy power. Would that I had never existed and never seen Thee grieved, O Lord of nations and Sovereign of eternity!"

O Region of Sad! Why do I see and hear thy birds and their song, but see not My she-camel nor hear her cry? Is she in the garden above the earth or beneath it? O gardens of that city! Where is the breeze of God that wafted over thee, and where is God's fruit within thee? Has it been cut off or has it fallen? By God, the people are in manifest error. They have hamstrung her after she gave them to drink the purest milk from the breast of God's wisdom, the Lord of all worlds.

O My Name Ha! We concealed thy station while thou wert in this world due to the weakness of the servants. But when thou didst ascend, We unveiled thee and revealed what thou truly wert and what God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, had bestowed upon thee. Blessed is he who loved thee, found solace with thee, heard thy call, thy remembrance and thy praise, sought thy resting-place, and turned his face toward thy countenance for the sake of God, thy Beloved, thy Goal and thy Manifestation. Blessed is every seeker who seeks thy most exalted station and thy most glorious abode, who stands before thy tomb and visits thee with what hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen and uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur in the prison of Akka. Joy be to him who remembers thy days and what appeared from thee in the love of God, thy Lord, and who relates to people what befell thee in thy Lord's Cause. By the life of God, he is among the people of Baha in a preserved tablet.

O My Name Ha! Thou wert a stranger in thy homeland, a captive in thy dwelling-place, and oppressed and alone among the servants. Blessed is the land God made the resting-place of thy body, and the city from whose horizon thou didst shine forth in thy Lord's days. It behooveth every lover to remember thee with what God hath remembered thee in His tablets. We beseech Him by thee to send down upon His loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Kind.

In His Name, the All-Knowing!

O My Name Jamal! Upon thee be the Glory of God! The Sun of Wisdom hath shone forth from the heaven of inner meanings upon the mirror of knowledge, and from that effulgence this word appeared: "Peace of mind is for the trustworthy, and fear is for the treacherous." After the grace of God and divine favors, thou hast not transgressed, nor dost thou transgress, the binding and decisive commandments that have been revealed and sent down in the Tablets from the Supreme Pen, and thou hast been and art dealing with all souls with utmost kindness, love and patience, according to His command. In such case, had thou turned to the seeker, no harm would have been done, for he would have become aware of thy intention and that upon which thou standest. Perchance the lights of truthfulness might have been reflected in the mirror of his heart. Verily thy Lord is the All-Reforming, the Trustworthy.

Strange that they have not yet understood the intention of the Lord of creation. In all matters, let not wisdom slip from thy grasp. Entry after migration and association with some were contingent and conditional upon consultation. O Jamal, fix thy gaze upon this decisive, firm and blessed word which hath been recorded by the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Book: The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with two luminaries: consultation and compassion. In all things hold fast unto consultation, for it is the lamp of guidance that leadeth the way and bestoweth understanding. Thus doth the All-Informed apprise thee. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God willing, may this blessed word ever be before thy face and fixed before thine eyes.

At present, in view of what hath occurred, turning to that land is not permitted. Your efforts for peace, reconciliation and love have, due to lack of wisdom and consideration, become known as enmity and corruption. The Perspicuous Book between heaven and earth proclaimeth "I have come to reform the world," yet ears have not yet succeeded in hearing it. The deeds of the ignorant ones of the past have become the cause and reason for doubts and suspicions. Beseech ye God that He may make the heedless souls aware of His purpose. Should they hearken unto the verses that have been sent down concerning the avoidance of conflict and corruption, all would speak the words "Verily, He is the Truthful, the Reformer, the Trustworthy."

O Jamal! The divine land is not confined to the land of Ta. If thou shouldst turn toward Hadba, thou wouldst find those nearest to God in piety. This matter is not an explicit command. In all things one must consider the known party. He is with you wherever you may be. He, verily, is the Observer, the Vigilant.

At the end of this epistle, We make mention of thy wife, who hath endured in the path of God what most handmaidens have not endured. Convey to her My glad-tidings and glorification from God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. We have mentioned her in a Tablet, and beyond it in another Tablet, and have sent them both to her as a token of Our grace. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Kind. We have also mentioned her brother in a Tablet that the treasures of the heavens and earth cannot equal. Be thou grateful and say: "Praise be to Thee, O Lord of the seen and unseen!"

Convey My glorification to the faces of My loved ones who have turned to the Supreme Horizon and have shunned every deluded deprived one. Upon them be the blessings of God and His peace, and the peace of the Concourse on High and of those who circle round the Will of their Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Glory be upon thee and upon him who hath aided the Cause of his Lord and hearkened unto what was imparted unto him from the verses of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved. And praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what will be.

CXIV

Mine eyes are cheered, O my God, when I contemplate the tribulations that descend upon me from the heaven of Thy decree, and which have encompassed me on every side according to what Thy pen hath irrevocably established. I swear by Thy Self! Whatsoever is of Thee is well pleasing unto me, though it involve the bitterness of mine own death.

He Who was Thy Spirit (Jesus), O my God, withdrew all alone in the darkness of the night preceding His last day on earth, and falling on His face to the ground besought Thee saying: "If it be Thy will, O my Lord, my Well-Beloved, let this cup, through Thy grace and bounty, pass from me."

By Thy beauty, O Thou Who art the Lord of all names and the Creator of the heavens! I can smell the fragrance of the words which, in His love for Thee, His lips have uttered, and can feel the glow of the fire that had inflamed His soul in its longing to behold Thy face and in its yearning after the Day-Spring of the light of Thy oneness, and the Dawning-Place of Thy transcendent unity.

As to me -- and to this Thou art Thyself my witness -- I call upon Thee saying: "I have no will of mine own, O my Lord, and my Master and my Ruler, before the indications of Thy will, and can have no purpose in the face of the revelation of Thy purpose. I swear by Thy glory! I wish only what Thou wishest, and cherish only what Thou cherishest. What I have chosen for myself is what Thou hast Thyself chosen for me, O Thou the Possessor of my soul!" Nay, I find myself to be altogether nothing when face to face with the manifold revelations of Thy names, how much less when confronted with the effulgent splendors of the light of Thine own Self. O miserable me! Were I to attempt merely to describe Thee, such an attempt would itself be an evidence of my impiety, and would attest my heedlessness in the face of the clear and resplendent tokens of Thy oneness. Who else except Thee can claim to be worthy of any notice in the face of Thine own revelation, and who is he that can be deemed sufficiently qualified to adequately praise Thee, or to pride himself on having befittingly described Thy glory? Nay -- and to this Thou dost Thyself bear witness --it hath incontrovertibly been made evident that Thou art the one God, the Incomparable, Whose help is implored by all men. From everlasting Thou wert alone, with none to describe Thee, and wilt abide for ever the same with no one else to equal or rival Thee. Were the existence of any co-equal with Thee to be recognized, how could it then be maintained that Thou art the Incomparable, or that Thy Godhead is immeasurably exalted above all peers or likeness? The contemplation of the highest minds that have recognized Thy unity failed to attain unto the comprehension of the One Thou hast created through the word of Thy commandment, how much more must it be powerless to soar into the atmosphere of the knowledge of Thine own Being. Every praise which any tongue or pen can recount, every imagination which any heart can devise, is debarred from the station which Thy most exalted Pen hath ordained, how much more must it fall short of the heights which Thou hast Thyself immensely exalted above the conception and the description of any creature. For the attempt of the evanescent to conceive the signs of the Uncreated is as the stirring of the drop before the tumult of Thy billowing oceans. Nay, forbid it, O my God, that I should thus venture to describe Thee, for every similitude and comparison must pertain to what is essentially created by Thee. How can then such similitude and comparison ever befit Thee, or reach up unto Thy Self?

By Thy glory, O my God! Though I recognize and firmly believe that no description which any except Thyself can give of Thee can beseem Thy

grandeur, and that no glory ascribed to Thee by any save Thyself can ever ascend into the atmosphere of Thy presence, yet were I to hold my peace, and cease to glorify Thee and to recount Thy wondrous glory, my heart would be consumed, and my soul would melt away.

My remembrance of Thee, O my God, quencheth my thirst, and quieteth my heart. My soul delighteth in its communion with Thee, as the sucking child delighteth itself in the breasts of Thy mercy; and my heart panteth after Thee even as one sore athirst panteth after the living waters of Thy bounty, O Thou Who art the God of mercy, in Whose hand is the lordship of all things!

I give thanks to Thee, O my God, that Thou hast suffered me to remember Thee. What else but remembrance of Thee can give delight to my soul or gladness to my heart? Communion with Thee enableth me to dispense with the remembrance of all Thy creatures, and my love for Thee empowereth me to endure the harm which my oppressors inflict upon me.

Send, therefore, unto my loved ones, O my God, what will cheer their hearts, and illumine their faces, and delight their souls. Thou knowest, O my Lord, that their joy is to behold the exaltation of Thy Cause and the glorification of Thy word. Do Thou unveil, therefore, O my God, what will gladden their eyes, and ordain for them the good of this world and of the world which is to come.

Thou art, verily, the God of power, of strength and of bounty.

LXXXV

These are, O my God, the days whereon Thou didst enjoin Thy servants to observe the fast. With it Thou didst adorn the preamble of the Book of Thy Laws revealed unto Thy creatures, and didst deck forth the Repositories of Thy commandments in the sight of all who are in Thy heaven and all who are on Thy earth. Thou hast endowed every hour of these days with a special virtue, inscrutable to all except Thee, Whose knowledge embraceth all created things. Thou hast, also, assigned unto every soul a portion of this virtue in accordance with the Tablet of Thy decree and the Scriptures of Thine irrevocable judgment. Every leaf of these Books and Scriptures Thou hast, moreover, alloted to each one of the peoples and kindreds of the earth.

For Thine ardent lovers Thou hast, according to Thy decree, reserved, at each daybreak, the cup of Thy remembrance, O Thou Who art the Ruler of rulers! These are they who have been so inebriated with the wine of Thy manifold wisdom that they forsake their couches in their longing to celebrate Thy praise and extol Thy virtues, and flee from sleep in their eagerness to approach Thy presence and partake of Thy bounty. Their eyes have, at all times, been bent upon the Day-Spring of Thy loving-kindness, and their faces set towards the Fountain-Head of Thine inspiration. Rain down, then, upon us and upon them from the clouds of Thy mercy what beseemeth the heaven of Thy bounteousness and grace.

Lauded be Thy name, O my God! This is the hour when Thou hast unlocked the doors of Thy bounty before the faces of Thy creatures, and opened wide the portals of Thy tender mercy unto all the dwellers of Thine earth. I beseech Thee, by all them whose blood was shed in Thy path, who, in their yearning over Thee, rid themselves from all attachment to any of Thy creatures, and who were so carried away by the sweet savors of Thine inspiration that every single member of their bodies intoned Thy praise and vibrated to Thy remembrance, not to withhold from us the things Thou hast irrevocably ordained in this Revelation -- a Revelation the potency of which hath caused every tree to cry out what the Burning Bush had aforetime proclaimed unto Moses, Who conversed with Thee, a Revelation that hath enabled every least pebble to resound again with Thy praise, as the stones glorified Thee in the days of Muhammad, Thy Friend.

These are the ones, O my God, whom Thou hast graciously enabled to have fellowship with Thee and to commune with Him Who is the Revealer of Thyself. The winds of Thy will have scattered them abroad until Thou didst gather them together beneath Thy shadow, and didst cause them to enter into the precincts of Thy court. Now that Thou hast made them to abide under the shade of the canopy of Thy mercy, do Thou assist them to attain what must befit so august a station. Suffer them not, O my Lord, to be numbered with them who, though enjoying near access to Thee, have been kept back from recognizing Thy face, and who, though meeting with Thee, are deprived of Thy presence.

These are Thy servants, O my Lord, who have entered with Thee in this, the Most Great Prison, who have kept the fast within its walls according to what Thou hadst commanded them in the Tablets of Thy decree and the Books of Thy behest. Send down, therefore, upon them what will thoroughly purge them of all Thou abhorrest, that they may be wholly devoted to Thee, and may detach themselves entirely from all except Thyself.

Rain down, then, upon us, O my God, that which beseemeth Thy grace and befitteth Thy bounty. Enable us, then, O my God, to live in remembrance of Thee and to die in love of Thee, and supply us with the gift of Thy presence in Thy worlds hereafter -- worlds which are inscrutable to all except Thee. Thou art our Lord and the Lord of all worlds, and the God of all that are in heaven and all that are on earth.

Thou beholdest, O my God, what hath befallen Thy dear ones in Thy days. Thy glory beareth me witness! The voice of the lamentation of Thy chosen ones hath been lifted up throughout Thy realm. Some were ensnared by the infidels in Thy land, and were hindered by them from having near access to Thee and from attaining the court of Thy glory. Others were able to approach Thee, but were kept back from beholding Thy face. Still others were permitted, in their eagerness to look upon Thee, to enter the precincts of Thy court, but they allowed the veils of the imaginations of Thy creatures and the wrongs inflicted by the oppressors among Thy people to come in between them and Thee.

This is the hour, O my Lord, which Thou hast caused to excel every other hour, and hast related it to the choicest among Thy creatures. I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Self and by them, to ordain in the course of this year what shall exalt Thy loved ones. Do Thou, moreover, decree within this year what will enable the Day-Star of Thy power to shine brightly above the horizon of Thy glory, and to illuminate, by Thy sovereign might, the whole world.

Render Thy Cause victorious, O my Lord, and abase Thou Thine enemies. Write down, then, for us the good of this life and of the life to come. Thou art the Truth, Who knoweth the secret things. No God is there but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.

He is God, exalted be His glory in wisdom and utterance! O Amin, upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. Praise be befitting unto the Desired One Who, through His perfect power, all-encompassing will and penetrating decree, raised up the banner of "Verily I am God" between kings and subjects, erected the pavilion of glory in the most exalted places of the earth, and through the power of the Pen and the influence of the Word took possession of the realm of hearts. Unto Him be praise and glory, unto Him be gratitude and splendor. Thereafter the Most Great Branch writes, as the servant present had no time due to excessive writing. This is of God's bounty unto thee and unto him. Tablets specifically addressed to Muhammad-'Ali and Yusuf Khan were sent - deliver them to Bahram-Abad. Beseech God that He may assist all to truly turn to Him and drink from the ocean of the utterance of the All-Merciful. The sum that you collected was received and sent to Khadra. Do not forget about the teacher's cloak - if a good Na'ini cloak can be found it would be better and more suitable. The Tablet for the prince was sent, but act according to the consultation of Varqa, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness. In these days special favor was shown to Aqa Siyyid Faraj'u'llah, upon him be the glory of God - that is, manifest verses were revealed and sent to him. Mention was made of you and the friends of that land and the companions at the gate of Isfahan whom you had mentioned in His presence - this flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed art thou, O Amin! Unceasingly hast thou mentioned the friends and loved ones of God and sought for each that which hath no likeness. Likewise specifically for Aqa Zaynu'l-'Abidin in the great city a Tablet was revealed and sent. Aqa Hashim Aqa Qadir from the land of K also sent a letter in the name of God expressing his intention to pay the Huquq. It was commanded that it be given to Aqa 'Ali-Haydar who would deliver it to you - act as previously mentioned and deliver it. O Amin, the glance of favor is ever directed toward \[the poor\]. Whatever arrives and is commanded, surely deliver it. In this divine age some of the wealthy ones have, praise be to God, been successful, but some have been deprived. Blessed is he whom God has enabled to serve His Most Great Cause and His Mighty Announcement. Convey greetings to the loved ones of God wherever they may be. Say: Know ye the value of these days and in this spiritual age and divine century adorn yourselves with goodly deeds and praiseworthy character, and arise to serve the Cause of God for which all have been created. We send greetings to Varqa, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, and likewise to Abu'l-Fadl, upon him be the glory of God. Replies to Varqa's petitions from before and after will arrive, and We likewise make mention of the other loved ones of that land and give them the glad-tidings of God's favor, exalted be His glory. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Wherever you meet \[Jinab-i-'Ayn-Ba\], upon him be the glory of God, convey greetings and give him the glad-tidings and assurance of God's favor. And whatever you can deliver to them in these days is very beloved, acceptable, praiseworthy and rewarding. We beseech God to assist thee and him to serve His mighty Cause.

He is the One speaking from the Supreme Horizon! O people of Ha and Mim! Blessed are ye for having attained unto the Day of God and His manifestation, and for having heard His call and turned toward the Mount when He Who converseth appeared, and toward the Tree and Him Who speaketh therein. Ye have turned toward Him on the day of rejection and acknowledged Him after the denial of the wicked ones, and directed yourselves unto Him on this mighty day. We make mention of you at this hour while the Faithful Spirit in the Supreme Paradise sayeth: "Happy are the people of Baha whom God remembereth in His mighty station!" Know ye your stations, then thank God, the Lord of the House and the Educator of all in the heavens and earths. A letter hath come before the Wronged One wherein was your mention. We have remembered you with words the like of which the ear of the world hath not heard, nor have the eyes of nations seen their like. Praise ye the Lord, the Possessor of great bounty and wise command. O Nabil-i-Akbar! Hear the call once again that it may render thee detached from sorrows. Verily God is with thee - He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Be not grieved by worldly events. In all matters place thy trust in God, exalted be His glory. He will protect thee as He protected thee before. The world hath ever been the place of vicissitudes, yet its passing away is the cause of joy and the source of gladness. Its changes and variations testify to its impermanence. Therefore it is not mentioned nor considered by those souls who have tasted of the heavenly food and eternal bounties. O Muhammad-Rida! Thou hast attained unto My mention which no other mention equalleth, nor the treasures of the righteous or wicked. Thank thy Lord for this manifest bounty. The Glory be upon thy father and upon thee and upon everyone steadfast and firm. O Muhammad-Baqir! Previously in that land occurred that which caused the eye of justice to weep and equity to lament, and there befell the Wronged One from the heedless one that which the Pen is powerless and unable to mention. Likewise in Kurdistan the heedless one at last cast the fire of passion upon the leaves of the Tree. Glory be to God! Despite divine counsel and heavenly admonition some acted in such manner as caused the Concourse on high and the company of the sincere to cry out "I seek refuge in Thee, O God of the worlds!" And even greater than that hath appeared in these days in the great city. By the life of God, it burned hearts and consumed livers! The oppressor who claimed love, when the desire for treachery emerged from his greed and covetousness, abandoned God, glorified be His majesty, allied with His enemy and assailed His friend. Thus do We recount for thee what befell Us from him who rent the veil of trustworthiness, chastity and fidelity. When he saw a believer he said "I believe in God," and when he saw an idolater he denied God, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Blessed art thou for having attained unto My mention on this night. Remember My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad-tidings of God's tender mercy, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. O Muhammad-'Ali H.S.! Upon thee be the eternal Glory of God! Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having strengthened me, made me know Thee, guided me to Thy path and illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee by Thy power which hath encompassed all created things and by Thy will which hath prevailed over all contingent beings, to make me of those who have quaffed the choice wine of utterance from the hand of Thy bounty and the Kawthar of knowledge through Thy grace and favor. O Lord! Thou seest me gazing toward the heaven of Thy mercy and awaiting the rain-showers from the clouds of Thy grace. Ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of this world and the next. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.

O thou who art immersed in the gulf that brancheth from the Most Great Sea and gazeth toward the horizon gleaming and resplendent with the lights of the Morn of Eternity! Know thou that We have adorned thy letter which thou didst send to the servant who standeth present with the glances of thy Lord's loving-kindness, and We have become aware of what thou didst desire in thy open and private commune. We found thy remembrance like the songs of lovers in their longing and yearning. At one time thou didst behold the Beloved with thine eye and didst mention Him in such wise that We perceived from it the fragrance of coquetry and boldness - though this beseemeth not the Beloved Who hath been manifested upon the horizons with the lights of this Effulgence. And at another time thou didst turn to Him with His own eye and didst describe Him in such wise that We perceived from it the fragrance of detachment and thy arising to serve God, the Lord of the beginning and the end. It is as though in these two mentions in the two stations thou didst desire naught but the hearkening of the Lord of Names. Therefore We loved not to answer thee with the utterances of the people of allusions among the followers of religions. Blessed art thou for having drunk from the two chalices the wine of remembrance in the mention of the two Most Exalted Names on this Day which God hath made the Lord of Days. O thou who advancest toward the Supreme Horizon! Be moved by the motion apparent from the heat of God's compelling Word, which God hath made sanctified from the three motions which are the six and what is above them of the motions mentioned in the books of the people. Thus doth the Lord of all beings command thee. And this motion, though it revolveth around itself, yet it hath motions which none knoweth save thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. At one time thou seest it controlled by stillness, for We have made the most powerful thing to control it, and at another time stillness itself appeareth from it. Exalted be God, thy Lord, the Powerful, the One Who prevaileth over opposites! The contingent hath ever been within the bounds of contingency, and creation in its places, and the Truth is He Who cannot be known through mention and utterance, nor through wisdom and examples. Be thou a station of stillness and expansiveness. As for stillness, it controlleth the motion produced from the Word as mentioned before, and as for expansiveness, that I may build upon thee a house for My remembrance according to what I desire. When thou knowest the purpose, say: "Praise be to Thee, O Lord of the servants and Ruler over the lands!" If thou wert to know what We intended for thee in the depths of these allusions, joy and longing would seize thee to a station wherein thou wouldst find thyself detached from all directions. If thou wert to reflect upon the very act of advancing and thy journey unto the Self-Sufficient, the Transcendent, thou wouldst recognize what was mentioned in thy letter through witnessing and vision. We shall aid thee in this. Verily thy Lord is the Powerful, the All-Choosing. We desired to sanctify thee from what is with the people and make thee a herald of this Mention that dominateth over all in creation and a bearer of glad tidings of this Most Great News among the nations. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Then know thou that at the time when thou didst advance toward God, thou wast created anew from the water of the spirit. Beware lest thou mention this clear water as mean - the first was ordained for the former ones, and the second for whoso advanceth toward the Dayspring that was luminous with the lights of the Countenance. Verily thy advancing is itself receptivity, and it was verily a divine bounty deposited by the Truth within thyself by thyself, and entering into thee not as a thing entereth into a thing. When the appointed time came, it appeared from thee - preserve it thus! Thus doth thy Lord command thee, He Who was sanctified from entering and leaving, from this station that was raised up in the name of God. And thus did We call out to thee from the right side of the luminous Spot, that thou mightest thank thy Lord and arise to serve His Cause with joy and attraction. Verily the glory be upon thee, O thou who advancest toward God in the final goal!

In the Name of Him through Whom the Herald hath called out from the supreme horizon! O Husayn, upon thee be My glory! The gates of utterance have been opened to the people of creation through the key of the name of the All-Merciful, and the gems of existence have attained to that which was mentioned in the divine Books of the past and future and recorded by the Pen of bounty. Well is it with thee for having drawn nigh and attained the presence and heard and seen that for which most of the peoples of the world yearned and hastened to the supreme companion. We beseech God to assist thee to drink from the wine of divine mercy in the name of God and to bestow it upon the company of lovers. Praise be to God, thou hast attained to that which is greater and more beloved than all things with God, and that is the knowledge of Him. Thou hast attained the honor of attaining His presence and found thy way to the Kaaba of the intended goal. If thou wert to offer praise and thanksgiving for the duration of the kingdom and the heavenly realm it would not be mentioned before the ocean of His grace. We beseech God to assist His loved ones there and give them glad tidings of His mercy that hath preceded all created things. He is the Revealer of verses and the Exalter of ranks. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O Shaykh Kazim, We have heard thy call and have mentioned thee with this blessed and exalted Word. Beware lest anything keep thee back from God, the Lord of the kingdom of names. Hold fast to His cord, be detached from all else, be attracted by His verses, be enkindled with the fire of His Cause, and act according to what He hath revealed in His wondrous Book. We counsel thee and the friends to wisdom and to such conduct and deeds as attract hearts. Glory be upon thee and upon him who is named 'Abdu'l-'Ali. We send greetings upon him from this exalted station.

O servant of 'Ali, servitude to God is more excellent than servitude to the world. Through God's infinite bounty thou hast attained to the recognition of the Dawning-Place of revelation and the Source of verses. This is the exalted station of servitude, the degrees of which have been sent down in the books of utterance from the Pen of the All-Merciful. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath attained unto this mighty station. We beseech Him to record for thee the reward of attaining His presence. He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

O 'Ali-Akbar, the Wronged One mentioneth thee from the Most Great Scene and saith: The Promised One hath come. Today the Gospel calleth out to the peoples of the world saying: "The Glory hath appeared and He Who was mentioned by My tongue and concealed in My heart and hidden in My breast hath come. Turn ye unto Him, O people, and be not of the heedless."

O Yahya, take hold of the Book with the power of God, the Lord of the mighty throne. Then give thanks to Him night and day for having caused thee to attain His glorious and luminous Day.

O Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali, the Sun of Truth speaketh and the Kingdom of utterance bestoweth its bounties at all times, yet most of the people of the world are debarred and veiled from it. Their deeds have kept them back from the light that shineth and is manifest. Blessed is he who hath drunk the choice wine of knowledge when the All-Merciful was seated upon the throne of His mighty Name.

O Husayn-Qabli-Quli, We counsel thee and the friends in that land to fear God and to that which behooveth His holy and mighty Cause. Associate with one another in spirit and fragrance and assist God through praiseworthy deeds and conduct. By the life of God, these hosts are the most powerful hosts in the world in the estimation of the Lord of ancient days. He speaketh the truth and guideth to the way, and He is the Mighty, the Beautiful. Glory be from Us upon you and upon My loved ones there and upon every discerning knower.

In My Name, He Who is established upon the Throne of Utterance!

O Husayn, upon thee be My peace and My glory! The effulgences of the Sun of Grace have encompassed the world, and God, exalted be His glory, hath appeared with the banner of "He doeth whatsoever He willeth" and the standard of "He ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth." All the monotheists, the sincere ones, and the angels drawn nigh are standing present before the Throne. Yet the people of the world remain veiled and deprived. By God's life! At all times the waters of wisdom and utterance flow from the Pen of the All-Merciful, yet there is no thirst. O Husayn, upon thee be My glory! Ancient matters have arisen; smoke hath overtaken the realm of the Bayan and deprived eyes from beholding the Most Exalted Horizon. They make mention of corruption; vain imaginings have appeared in new garments. The people of the Bayan are seen to be more lost than the previous party, though they have witnessed the fruits of the deeds of the previous thousand and two hundred years. The scratching of the Most Exalted Pen and the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing are raised at all times, yet ears capable of hearing are very rare, as scarce as red sulphur. Convey My greetings to the friends in the land of Shin. Each one hath been mentioned in the Most Holy Court. "We have made some to excel others." Soon that which hath been ordained from My Most Exalted Pen shall be made manifest. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Answering One. Say: O people of God! Consider the fruit of the deeds of the party of the Shi'ites. "Take ye heed, O people of insight!" Throughout ages and centuries, in mosques and from pulpits they were occupied with the mention of the Qa'im and were expectant of His days. Yet when the horizon of the world became illumined and resplendent with the Light of Manifestation, all arose to extinguish the divine light. Both learned and ignorant engaged in cursing, and finally they issued the decree for His execution and shed His blood. Now the people of the Bayan are in evident loss. We beseech God to protect His loved ones from the evil of deluded souls. He is powerful and mighty over all things. His honor 1111, upon him be My glory, hath been and is mentioned before the Countenance and hath attained special favors. Soon he shall behold that which hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen. Likewise mention thou on behalf of this Wronged One Muhammad B.H., upon him be My glory, and all the loved ones of that land. We beseech God, exalted be He, to strengthen them to remain steadfast in His Cause in such wise that neither the doubts of the divines nor the might of the powerful shall move them. O people of God! This Day is your day. Take the chalice of steadfastness in the name of the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness, then drink thereof in spite of the divines of the earth and its jurists who have pronounced judgment against God without any clear proof or Book. His honor Ism-i-Jud (the Name of Bounty), upon him be My glory, forwarded your letter to the Most Holy Court. We saw and heard it, and this Tablet was sent down from the heaven of Will in reply, that thou mayest inhale from it the fragrance of thy Lord's utterance, the All-Merciful, and be of the thankful. We have sent wondrous and sublime Tablets, equal in number to the Most Great Name, especially for the loved ones of Nayriz. Forward them to his honor Mulla Shafi', upon him be My glory, that he may deliver them. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who have quaffed the choice wine sealed from the hands of the bounty of My Name, the Self-Subsisting, and were among the successful ones.

In the Name of the Everlasting Speaker

O 'Attar! Upon thee be the Glory of My Name, the All-Forgiving. The fragrance of thy faith hath been diffused and wafted throughout the cities of mention, utterance, wisdom and exposition. Blessed art thou, and blessed is he who is with thee, and he who loveth thee for the sake of My hallowed, mighty and luminous Countenance. Convey My greetings to all the kindred. This is the Day of joy and expansion. All must, each day, partake of the waters of divine love and strive mightily to exalt the Word of God. Praise be to God that the friends in all regions are holding fast to the Cause and clinging to the Will of God, even as the martyrs in the land of Ya attained martyrdom without transgressing against anyone, for the hands of might and power were bound by the cord of divine restraint. Blessed are they who have held fast to the Will of God, detached from their own desires.

Mention was made of Aqa Khan Kirmani. He is known for things without parallel - among them they say he can perfectly copy anyone's handwriting. After his arrival in this land, bounty was bestowed according to possibility. However, those who cling to every plant and turn to every face are not and were not worthy to enter this arena. For mankind there have been and are endless paths - some show love to both friends and enemies. We beseech God to protect you and Us from such as these, and We ask Him to help them return unto Him. He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

In any case, regard all save God as non-existent. We beseech God to aid you and all the friends to love and unite the hearts of His servants. He is the Mighty, the Bestower. And We beseech Him, exalted be He, to open before your faces the gates of mercy and blessing. He is the Mighty, the Generous, the Lord of Great Bounty, of Supreme Grace, and of Greatest Favor. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Effusive. And We beseech God to forgive, through His bounty, him for whom thou didst seek forgiveness. He is the Most Merciful of the Merciful.

The Glory shining forth at this hour from this luminous Beauty be upon thee, O Abu'l-Qasim. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to forgive thee through His sovereignty and to cause thee to enter, in the highest Paradise and loftiest Heaven, the presence of His Prophets' mercy, and to send down upon thee His enduring and sublime blessings. He is the All-Giving, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O 'A Aqa! We mentioned thee before, and We love to mention thee at this time, as My Branch was present and desired thy mention. We have sent down for thee that from which the near ones perceive the fragrance of eternity, and the sincere ones the sweet scents of glory, pardon and bounty. Verily thy Lord is the Lord of all mankind. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.

O Gh! Verily My Most Exalted Pen desired to mention thee on this day wherein God hath sent down from the clouds of His mercy the rains of His bounty upon His lands. When thou findest and hearest this, say: "Praise be to Thee, O Lord of the worlds, and glory be to Thee for having mentioned this servant who hath attained to turning unto Thee in Thy mighty and wondrous Day."

O Muhammad-Qabli-Ha! The 'Ayn and Ta have mentioned thee. We have sent down for thee that which hath caused the breath of utterance to be wafted throughout creation and the fragrance of the All-Merciful to spread through all lands. Exalted is the Generous One, possessed of supreme grace, Who speaketh at this hour - verily He is God, the Lord of all the worlds.

O Haji Kazim, upon him be the Glory of God! In the name of the All-Knowing, All-Seeing Lord. O Kazim 'Ali-Akbar! Your letter, and the letter concerning the Pilgrim House, have been received and achieved the honor of being heard before His presence. Praise be to God that you have been favored with His grace and adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Your mention has been and continues to be before the Wronged One. We beseech God to assist you in that which He loves and is pleased with, and to aid you with the hosts of the seen and unseen. Verily He is the Lord of the world and the Ancient Sovereign. There is no God but Him, the Strong, the Triumphant, the Mighty, the Powerful.

You made mention of what the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur'an. Yes, the Wronged One bears witness that it is the truth in which there is no doubt. However, for the "fresh and withered" there have been and are many meanings. The primary meaning of "fresh" refers to utterances that draw man closer to the Truth, that is, bring him nearer to God, while "withered" is that which removes him from His straight path - namely the divines and theologians of the earth whom you see today lying prostrate as if they were hollow palm-trunks. They acknowledge the Book yet turn away from the Mother Book. They have ever been the cause of preventing the servants from the supreme horizon. Their own actions testify to this. Though they acknowledge the greatness of the Cause, yet they remain heedless and withered. In every age and era, rulers have acted according to the verdict of the divines. That at which the Pen lamented and the Tablet wept!

Some time ago, in a Tablet to one of His loved ones, this exalted Word was revealed: In Our childhood We would hear that a certain divine was discoursing about the word "Qa'im", saying that according to traditions, on the Day of His manifestation He would utter a word from which even the most learned would flee. O company of the ignorant! This is that Word - He now declares "He" in the garment of "I", and the Hidden One speaks as "I am the Manifest One." Say: This is that Word at whose might all have trembled save whom God has willed. By "divines" in these passages is meant those souls who have prevented people from the shore of the Divine Unity. Otherwise, the learned one who acts upon his knowledge and the just sage are as the spirit to the body of the world. Blessed is the learned one whose head is adorned with the crown of justice and whose temple is adorned with the ornament of equity.

O Kazim! In another Tablet too, some reference was made to "fresh and withered". Knowledge is with God. Today the purpose is that if someone truly attains the honor of acceptance, he should exert his utmost effort to extinguish the fire of hatred and animosity that blazes between the peoples of the world. Supplicate God, exalted be His glory, by night and day, to protect His servants. O Kazim! The divine religion has ever been for unity, concord, fellowship and love, yet ignorant servants have made it the cause and reason for hatred. This is the world-consuming fire. We beseech God to quench this fire with the water of wisdom and utterance, that all the world may find repose beneath the shadow of His grace. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

If you find any friends, convey Our greetings. We counsel all to spiritual qualities and goodly deeds, and that whereby man's station is exalted in the contingent world. Verily He is the Counselor, the All-Knowing.

O Zaynu'l-'Abidin, upon thee be the peace of God, Lord of all worlds! What hath befallen thee hath grieved Me to such an extent that for several days I laid down My pen. God knoweth, and thou knowest, that My counseling pen hath never ceased. It hath revealed that which was the cause of the upliftment of existence and the exaltation of souls. From the heaven of every Tablet hath shone forth the Sun of justice, and We have enjoined upon all to observe it and to practice fairness, from which the near ones perceive the fragrance of bounty and favors. Among the people are those who have hearkened to the call of the Wronged One and counseled others through their deeds and character, and among them are those who have cast counsel behind their backs. Glory be to God! The Pen is bewildered and the Tablet is bewildered as to what to mention and what effect will appear. Great is this Day, the Day whereon the secrets shall be tried. Its witness and testimony are the secrets of hearts and breasts, "the treachery of the eyes and that which the breasts conceal." This is the description of this Day. We beseech God to adorn His servants with the raiment of fairness and to illumine their hearts with the lights of love and fellowship.

In all the Books, both past and future, He hath commanded that the unitarians and those who have turned towards Him should prefer others over themselves. They should make their paramount concern the vindication of truth and the elimination of falsehood, and should choose for their brethren what they choose for themselves.

In any case, thy grief hath added to Our griefs. However, since bearing hardship and tribulation in these days, and likewise patience and steadfastness under afflictions, are accounted before God as among the most excellent and most praiseworthy of deeds, there is no cause for concern. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee under all conditions, to reinforce thee with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, and to ordain for thee that which beseemeth the heaven of His bounty and the ocean of His generosity. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

Thy verses and prose have been presented and heard. From every letter We have detected the fragrance of thy love, thy steadfastness, and thy patience in what hath befallen thee. Verily, God is the All-Patient, and He hath commanded His servants to observe gracious patience. A bountiful reward for the patient ones hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in God's Book.

Today is the day of utterance and exposition, and the day of unity and harmony. Had the loved ones held fast to the counsels recorded in the Tablets, they would now behold the world adorned and illumined with the light of justice and fairness. Some deeds act as barriers and veils. We beseech God to assist all to return and repent, and to arise to make good what hath escaped them. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Answering.

Peace be upon thee, upon thy beginning and thy end, and upon those who have cast away the forbidden and taken hold of the good which they were commanded to observe in the Book of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. Praise be to Him, for He is the Goal of them that know and the Beloved of the hearts of them that long for Him.

Let the honored brother, Jinab-i-Aqa 'Ali-Akbar, upon him be God's peace, take note.

He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power

Praise be to God Who hath, through His grace and bounty, bestowed upon us the gift of recognition and sent down from the clouds of His generosity the table of utterance. And peace and blessings be upon the Point of Existence and the Manifestation of the names of our Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, through Whom the Book of Divine Unity was adorned and the Point of Detachment appeared, and upon His family and companions who cast away vain imaginings and attained the lights of certitude and arose with their spirits to serve the Cause of God, the Master of the Day of Judgment.

To proceed: Your letter was like unto a hoopoe bearing glad tidings of your good health. A hundred thousand thanks to the Goal of the world's peoples, Who hath singled out His loved ones with His special favors. After it was read before His presence, He said: "Let them place their trust in God in all matters and occupy themselves with their work. O 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar! The fruit of the tree of insight and wisdom is consultation. Take counsel in matters, and when thou hast decided, place thy trust in God, the Single, the Strong, the Almighty. It is well that thou shouldst engage alone in an occupation. Blessing lieth within His mighty grasp. Be not remiss in thy work. His grace and confirmation have reached thee and will continue to reach thee. And if something else should appear from consultation, \[it\] is acceptable before His presence. We beseech God, glorified and exalted be He, to grant \[thee\] success and confirmation. Be thou confident in God's grace and mercy, and be among the steadfast."

Today the tongue of favor in the Kingdom of utterance beseeches imperishable bounty for all. Should God will it, the friends of God shall attain unto it, for generosity is His attribute and grace is among His characteristics. If a suitable location is found, this would be and is closest to piety, but consultation is necessary, as was told to you in person. Engage in business, for He ordaineth what He willeth for whomsoever He willeth. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O God of existence and Educator of the seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by the trials of the Manifestations of Thy names and attributes, and by the afflictions of the Dawning-Places of Thy Cause and the Daysprings of Thy Revelation, to ordain for me that which shall make me content with Thy good-pleasure and with what Thou hast ordained for me through Thy generosity and grace. O my Lord! I am he who hath fled from all else save Thee, turning unto Thee and standing before the door of Thy will. I beseech Thee to make me among those who have held fast to Thy will, turning away from their own wills and desires. Thou art He Who hath ever been the Helper of the servants, their Provider, their Protector and their Succourer. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Books and Thy Scrolls and \[Thy Tablets\] and by \[the ocean of Thy knowledge\] which none hath comprehended save Thyself, to send down upon me a blessing from Thy presence and \[a bounty from Thy side. Verily Thou\] art the Munificent, the Generous.

Praise be to God, you are blessed with His grace. Be \[occupied with work\]. Profit has come and will come. Consultation with the gentlemen, may God's peace be upon them, is beloved in every matter, and surely they are trustworthy and speak with justice, fairness, trustworthiness and piety. All your relatives are safe and at ease, adorned with the ornament of good health. The apple of our eye, Aqa 'Abdu'l-Husayn, is engaged in study with the new teacher. God willing, may he be successful and at rest beneath the shadow of His grace. Peace be upon you, and God's mercy and blessings.

In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord

Praise be to God Who has appeared and caused the Tablet and the Pen to appear, and taught man what he knew not. He is the One manifest among the nations and known by the Greatest Name. When He desires to subdue the world, He breathes into His Most Exalted Pen, whereupon the princes are thunderstruck and the poor, who were seized by the stupor of abasement in the kingdom of creation, awaken. At times He moves it and at times He withholds it, in accordance with His wisdom. He is verily the Ruler, the Seizer, the Giver, the Forgiving, the Generous. And I pray and send peace upon those who have attained His days, heard His call and arose to serve His Cause. They are servants whom the denizens of Paradise and the dwellers of the precincts of nearness serve. This servant beseeches his Lord to enable him to love them, befriend them and remember them. He is verily the Protector of the doers of good.

O my beloved! Your letter which you had sent several months ago reached this evanescent servant. It brought joy and gladness, and later at a suitable time it was presented before the Countenance of the Beloved. He said: "God willing, through the key of the Most Great Remembrance the doors of the hearts of the servants will be opened, that all may behold and observe with the eye of heart and spirit the splendors of the Sun of meanings."

O Ali-Qabli-Akbar! The servant came with your letter and presented it before the Wronged One. We found from it the fragrance of your love and the sweet-scents of your sincerity towards God, the Lord of the Throne and earth and the Master of all beings. We have remembered you with this Most Great Remembrance that you may be of the thankful ones. Say: "Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who caused me to hear Thy call, showed me Thy beauty, cast upon me Thy love, acquainted me with Thy Balance and taught me Thy Straight Path! I beseech Thee to preserve me in all conditions within the precincts of Thy most great mercy, beneath the shade of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. Then cause me, O my God, to be content with Thy good-pleasure and to be annihilated in Thy Will and Purpose. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Branches to ordain for me \[...\] in every world of Thy worlds. Verily Thou art the One with power over what Thou willest and in Thy grasp are the reins of all names. There is no God but Thee, the Strong, the Mighty."

Another matter: regarding what you wrote about the blessed skullcap - truly it was a sign of favor towards you. Praise be to God, you attained with utmost joy and delight. Praise be to God, and the skullcap which you sent by post arrived and attained the most great honor. This is glad-tidings that brings joy to heart and soul and spirit. Blessed art thou for having attained the grace of thy Lord, and blessed are those who have attained the knowledge of God, the Lord of the worlds. And regarding your apology for the delay, He said: "There is no harm. The purpose was to show favor, and praise be to God, you attained unto it." Glory be upon you and upon your wife who has believed and attained unto God, the Lord of the mighty Throne.

This evanescent servant is grateful and \[...\] to God, exalted be His glory, that out of His supreme grace He adorned you with the ornament of His remembrance. Blessed art thou and the handmaiden of God who is with thee. This servant's request is that you convey to all the friends the Most Great, Most Sublime, Most Holy greeting. Glory be upon you from God, the Mighty, the Wise.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most Powerful!

Praise be to God, the Single, the One, the Unique, Who hath taken unto Himself neither counselor nor peer. He hath sent forth the Messengers and revealed the Books testifying that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been established upon the throne of power, might and majesty, and will continue to abide in the heights of loftiness and sovereignty. The conditions of nations have not frustrated Him, nor have the manifestations of the world rendered Him powerless. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful.

Thereafter, the servant received your letter. When I opened it, read it and understood it, I approached the Most Holy Court and presented its contents before His Countenance. Thereupon the tongue of the Beloved uttered that which caused the fragrance of utterance to be diffused throughout all possibility. He said: "May he, God willing, be blessed with divine favors and be assisted in that which He loveth and is pleased with. In truth divine confirmation hath become his companion. They must, through the grace of the All-Merciful, protect him."

O Taqi! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He remembereth thee from this station both near and far, and giveth thee glad tidings of His remembrance of thee. We beseech God, exalted be He, to ordain for thee the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily He is the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens.

And remember ye the Lord of the world with this prayer. He is the One Who calleth from the horizon of utterance:

"Glory be unto Thee, O Thou before Whose oneness the most ardent lovers of Thy unity have proved powerless, and around Whose exalted station the most accomplished among them who have recognized Thee circle in adoration! Through Thee the gate of knowledge and utterance was unlocked, and by Thy Name the light shone forth from the horizon of creation. Through Thy manifestation the breezes of holiness were wafted, and by Thy will the Pen of the All-Merciful moved, and through Thee the fragrance of the garment was diffused throughout the world, and the ocean of pre-existence surged through Thy Most Great Name.

I testify that Thou hast fulfilled what Thou didst promise in Thy Book and hast manifested the Day which Thou hast attributed to Thyself. Blessed is the servant who hath recognized and hastened with his heart to Thy horizon, and the face that hath turned unto Thy countenance, and the seeing one who hath beheld the Most Great Sign, and the hearing one who hath heard Thy sweetest call.

Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Beloved, and glory be unto Thee, O my Master, and radiance be unto Thee, O my First and my Last, for having made known unto me the Dayspring of Thy manifestation, and caused me to hear the call of Sinai, and removed from before my face the veils of glory which had prevented the servants from turning towards the station of might, nearness and beauty.

By Thy glory, O Lord of all horizons and Manifest One on the Day of the Covenant! Were I to praise Thee with all the tongues of the world and glorify Thee in the oceans of knowledge through Thy Most Great Name, it would not equal a single one of Thy gifts or any of Thy favors which have encompassed me from all directions.

By Thy glory, O Sovereign of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen! I am ashamed to make mention of Thee, and whenever I desire to remember Thee, I am held back by the evidences of Thy greatness and the manifestations of Thy might and power. I beseech Thee, O Creator of the heavens and Lord of Names, to ordain for me from the Supreme Pen that which will draw me nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.

O my Lord! Thou seest my poverty, my powerlessness, my tribulation and my need. Have mercy upon me, O my God, through the wonders of Thy mercy. Then preserve me from all that may keep me back from drawing nigh unto Thee. Furthermore I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of bounty and generosity, to grant me the Most Great Steadfastness, the description of which hath proved beyond the power of all created things. Verily Thou hast power over whatsoever Thou willest. Thou withholdest and Thou givest. Verily Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous."

In the name of God, the One, the Incomparable!

Today the Daystar of the Word of God is dawning above your horizon. The Pen of Utterance is shining and resplendent, and through but one of its rays the hearts of the peoples of the world are being illumined. Today the enkindling fire of love is manifest and evident in the world. Say: O high priests! The Ocean of bounty is surging before your eyes. Forsake your idle fancies and fix your gaze upon the horizon of the luminary of certitude. Lead them that have gone astray unto the tabernacle of the recognition of Him Who is the Desire of all mankind. Ye have been called into being for the purpose of serving this Day of Victory. All the holy books and scriptures have announced unto all the glad-tidings of this blessed Day and rejoiced at its advent. Through the power of trust and detachment, strive ye to attain this exalted station, and deprive neither yourselves nor mankind from its life-giving water.

O Husayn! Thy letter arrived and was read in Our presence. The Ocean of Grace hath turned towards thee from the direction of the prison, and every wave thereof proclaimeth this exalted word: May the eye of the world and its peoples be illumined, for the preamble is manifest in the conclusion and the light that was hidden from the faces is evident. Every servant during these days must renounce three things in order to attain three things. The three things that must be renounced are covetousness, idle fancy, and selfish desire, and the three things to be attained are recognition, acknowledgement, and certitude. These are the secrets of Him Who is the All-Sufficing, which have been set forth in the heavenly Tablets and guarded and preserved in the treasury of divine infallibility. Make mention of Bahram of old, the ruler of mankind, and impart unto him the hidden secrets which are being revealed today from the treasuries of the Pen and Inkwell. We beseech God to assist him that through divine power he may suffer the high priests to attain the original intention. Say: Today is the day for service and rising up, not for sitting down and dreaming idle dreams. Tear asunder, then, the veils and dispel the obscuring mists from your midst that the peoples of the world may be informed of the Hidden Secret, discover the one Beloved, and attain His presence.

O Husayn! The call is uplifted at all times. Blessed is the ear that is sanctified from the tales of the peoples of the world and hearkeneth unto the summons of the Lord of all names. Send My greetings to the loved ones in that land. Say: Today, when heaven is adorned with the Sun of God's providence, hasten ye unto the hearts that haply ye may discover and apprehend the reason and purpose for the manifestation of existence. Today all the treasures of the world are not equal to one drop of the Ocean of true understanding.

When thou hast received My Tablet and quaffed the choice wine of utterance from the chalice of My favor, say: O God, my God! Illumine the hearts of Thy servants with the light of Thy knowledge. Suffer them to enter beneath the shadow of the tabernacle of Thy grandeur and the depths of the ocean of Thy unity. O Lord! Thou seest me turning towards Thee, anticipating the wonders of Thy bounty and Thy grace unto myself and Thy creatures. I beseech Thee by the power of Thy Finger, through whose movement all existence, both visible and invisible, hath been set into motion, to unlock before the faces of Thy loved ones the gates of Thy gifts and Thy blessings, Thy exaltation and Thy might. Assist them that they may take hold of Thy Books, Thy Scriptures, and Thy Tablets. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, clinging to Thy cord and turning towards the ocean of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me that which Thou hast sent down in Thy Book and ordained for Thy chosen ones. Thou, verily, art the All-Powerful, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. No God is there but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.

He hath revealed unto Qasim Khan of Sirjan. In the Name of God, the Mighty, the Great!

Hearken unto My call from the direction of the Prison, that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been one God, Single, Self-Subsisting, the Eternal, and will forever remain as He hath been. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Generous.

O people! Dispute not concerning the Cause of God. Unite in His love and good-pleasure, then walk in the path of truth - this is indeed the straight path. Follow God's laws and ordinances, and be not of the transgressors. Purify your hearts from the allusions of those who have disbelieved, even should they come with the books of the ancients. Say: Today no soul's faith shall profit it unless it believeth in God in this Most Great, this Mighty Manifestation. Turn wholly unto God, then detach thyself from the doubtful ones who claim faith in Ali aforetime, yet when their Beloved came unto them they denied Him. The curse of God be upon the liars!

Grieve not at anything, but place thy trust in all matters in thy Ancient Lord. Say: O people! That which ye were promised in the Bayan hath come to pass. It behooveth you therefore to render thanks unto God at all times, yet ye are struck with terror in your souls. Alas for you and for those who have denied God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Powerful! Open your eyes that ye may behold the lights of your Lord's countenance shining forth from this manifest Horizon. Fear ye God, and commit not that which they committed who denied God from time immemorial and were deprived of Paradise after its gates were opened unto all in the heavens and earth.

O people! He hath appeared with the signs of Ali, the proof of Muhammad, the evidence of the Spirit, the testimony of Moses, the traces of the Friend, and the proofs of all the Prophets and Messengers. Think not of Him as ye have thought of God's Messengers of old. Follow your Lord, the All-Merciful, then cross the path through My Name and sovereignty, and be not of them that hesitate. Say: He hath been tried before all religions, and behind them the people of the Bayan and their leaders whom We nurtured in those days and protected from the harm of the oppressors.

O people! I have reached such a point in affliction that the very essence of affliction weepeth for My soul, were ye but to know. The evil ones of the Bayan have united with the evil ones of the Furqan to violate My honor, until I was prevented from mentioning God. Woe unto them! Then burning fire be upon them for having committed that which the oppressors never committed. At every moment they plot in God's Cause, but God is more subtle in His plotting. Soon will He seize them with His might, for He is the severest of avengers. Thus hath befallen the Youth in this Prison from His servants, yet the people are in grievous heedlessness.

Thou, therefore, aid thy Lord with all thy power, and follow not them that have disbelieved and associated partners with God. Follow thy Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. He sufficeth thee against all who are in the heavens and earth, and He is the Protector of the sincere. Fear no one in the path of thy Lord. Protection is in His hand - He protecteth whom He willeth by His command. There is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Wise. Occupy thyself with His remembrance and praise amongst His creatures, then shun the hosts of Satan. And may the Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of the Cause be upon thee and upon Our assured servants.

He is the Imprisoned Youth Who was imprisoned in the path of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling

O Hasan! Hearken to the murmuring of the waters of inner meanings which flow in the paradise of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. By God! Through its murmuring the hearts of the Concourse on High were attracted and the hearts of those who drank the choice wine of the Most Glorious from the Youth Who was named with Our Most Exalted Name were set ablaze. We sent Him in truth and made Him a mercy to all the worlds. Say: He who was barred from this Revelation had not drunk of the Kawthar of the All-Merciful from the hand of the Point of the Bayan, and should he claim this, all who are in the heavens and earth would give him the lie. Say: He manifested Himself solely for My firm and wondrous Cause and came unto you only for My revelation and sovereignty, as attested by what We revealed unto Him, if ye be of those who perceive. Whoso hath believed in this Revelation hath verily drunk of the rivers of the Bayan from the hand of his Lord, the All-Merciful, and was among the triumphant. Say: Were it not for My remembrance, the Bayan would not have been revealed nor would the Beloved of the worlds have offered up His life.

Know then that thy letter hath come before Us and We have learned of its contents. We beseech God to draw thee nigh unto Him with a nearness after which no remoteness followeth. Verily He hath power over all things. Blessed art thou for having attained unto this Cause whereby the Names and their kingdoms were overturned, and the quaking of the Command and the might of divine wrath seized them all save whom God preserved through a sovereignty from Him and upheld through His grace. Verily He is the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

Make mention of My imprisonment and tribulation among My creatures that perchance they may make good what hath escaped them in this wondrous and exalted Cause. They who soared in the atmosphere of My nearness and ascended to the heights of My Cause - a single hair of one of them is better than all previous peoples combined. He who hath not cast behind him all who are in the heavens and earth shall never be able to turn toward My shining and luminous countenance. And whoso turneth toward it, the dwellers of Paradise turn toward him and the angels drawn nigh circle round about him.

Say: O people! Purify your tongues from mention of these base ones and sanctify your hearts from remembrance of these transgressors who have taken their passions as a god besides God and disbelieved in Him in Whom they had believed. And when it is said unto them by what proof do they adduce what the peoples of old adduced, say: By God! Ye and what ye possess and that whereby ye seek to prove shall never be mentioned before God, and ye are now among the lowest of the low. Verily he who hath recognized this Revelation placeth his foot upon their heads and leaveth them to themselves, turning instead to Him through a mere gesture from Whose servant's finger the veils were rent asunder, the allusions were erased, and every lofty and towering mountain was crushed.

Rejoice thou in My love and grieve not save at My grief. Thus doth the Pen of My Command enjoin thee and the Tongue of My mercy and favor give thee glad-tidings, and We were ever watchful over thee. Know then that the Wanderer in the realm of Oneness was with Us, swimming in the depths of glorification and sanctification, and the Sun of Beauty dawned upon him from the horizon of grandeur with manifest radiance. And since he is now in another land, God sends greetings from him to thee and to thy wife and children, and to those who have believed in God, the One, the Peerless, the Unique, the Incomparable. Convey My greetings to My loved ones and kindle them with the heat of the mention of thy Lord's Name, the Most High, the Supreme, Who speaketh in all things saying: "There is no God but Me, the Ever-Abiding King, the Just, the All-Wise."

O Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin! When thy letter came before the Divine Throne wherein thou didst inquire about those who were martyred in the path of God, who fulfilled their Covenant and were among the martyrs, We have answered what thou didst ask of God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forebears. We have sent down for each one of them decisive verses and radiant words, one letter of which cannot be equaled by all that hath been created in the realm of invention and fashioned in the kingdom of creation, if thou be of them that understand. We have ordained for each one of them in the Supreme Horizon an exalted and glorious station. By God the Truth! The eye of God beholdeth them and there descendeth upon them mercy after mercy, then bounty after bounty. Thus doth God send down wondrous bounties upon those who were martyred in His path, and He shall resurrect them once again in truth and make them leaders over all created things. These are they who shall inherit the kingdom from God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Glorious. They shall rule over the earth by the command of God, thy Lord, and shall speak that which the Spirit uttereth in their illumined and crystal hearts. O Zaynu'l-Baqa! Shouldst thou meet any of their families, magnify God before his face and inform him of that which hath been ordained concerning him by the Pen of God, the Munificent, the Bestower, the Just, the All-Wise. And shouldst thou ask God to forgive all who are in the heavens and on earth, He would answer thee. Thus have We distinguished thee with this bounty that thou mayest thank thy Lord and be of the thankful. Be thou steadfast in the Cause through the power and might of God, then convey unto the people the message with which We have commanded thee. Rest not within thyself, and be not of them that are at ease. Dost thou wish to take thine ease while the Ancient Beauty is beneath the claws of the hateful ones? Regard the people and what they possess as but a handful of clay which a child fashioneth into the likeness of a seal, then casteth upon it a handful of dust. Thus regard all save God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds, except those who have held fast unto the cord of God and turned their faces purely to the face of God, the Almighty, the Most High, the Most Great. By God the Truth! Those who have remained firm upon the seat of recognition in this Cause which hath appeared from the horizon of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting - upon them do the realities of the Prophets and Messengers shower their prayers. And were We to find one who hath attained maturity, We would impart unto him that which We have concealed from all who are in the heavens and on earth since the beginning that hath no beginning. But since We found the servants veiled and heedless, then in weakness and frailty, We have therefore concealed the mysteries and that which is better for them than all that hath been and shall be created, if thou be of them that know. And thou, on this day, behold naught save My beauty, hear naught save My melodies, and turn to none save My direction which God hath sanctified from all directions and quarters and preserved from the gaze of the idolaters. Were the people to become aware of what they have wrought against their own selves, they would flee from their homes and strike their heads and wail until their spirits depart from their bodies, for they have deprived themselves of a bounty the like of which hath never appeared in creation, yet they perceive it not within themselves and are of them that rejoice. And glory be upon thee and upon them that have believed in God, the Most High, the Most Great.

He is the Mighty, the Everlasting

O Breeze of Paradise! Waft upon all created things even as the breezes of holiness have wafted upon thee from this transcendent, mighty and luminous Quarter. Fear no one in the Cause of thy Lord, but place thy trust in God, the Omnipotent, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Remind those who have believed of that wherewith We have reminded thee from behind the Mountain of the Spirit, the Spot of God, the All-Knowing, the Generous. Pay no heed to the people and what they possess, for they have clung only to a coarse rope. Thus do We cast upon thee from the verses of innovation according to the nature of God, the Supreme, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Impregnable. Close thine eyes to all who are in the heavens and on earth, save those whom thou findest upon the straight line in this crimson Thread. Beyond this, turn not to anyone, but remain in a mighty sanctity. And if thou findest a pure, holy and luminous heart, cast upon it that which God hath cast upon thy heart, and inform it, in the inmost mystery, of this Most Great, Most Upright News concerning which most of the servants differ, and thereby return to the lowest fire in the depths of hell. And if thou findest not such a one, make no approach to anyone, for God is independent of the knowledge of these people and of all the worlds. Say: O people! Deny not the verses of God after they have been sent down in truth, and be not of those who turn away. Say: Did We not take from you a covenant in the atoms of the Furqan, and before it in the Gospel, and before it in the Torah, and in the atoms of the Bayan, that ye should not change the favor of God nor oppose His verses nor wax proud against them, if ye be of those who know? Yet ye broke your covenant and cast the testament of God behind your backs, and were of those who believed and then disbelieved, and were a most evil and lost people. By Him Who sent down the verses in truth! Were I to utter today but a single letter of truth, the heavens and earths would be rent asunder. But We were patient before and shall be patient hereafter, that what was sent down in tablets of exalted glory might be fulfilled. And We have ordained for thee from the good which none can reckon save God thy Lord, that He might bring forth the people from the darkness of fancy and cause them to enter the pavilion of assured dignity. Thus have We given thee glad tidings in truth, that thou mightest rejoice in thy soul and that all in the kingdom might rejoice therewith. Then remind the letter Jim from Us and give him glad tidings of a holy, preserved tablet which We have sent down unto him, a single letter of which cannot be equaled by all that hath been created in the realm of Lahut, then in the realm of Jabarut, then in the realm of Malakut, then in the heavens and earths. It shall reach thee when God willeth and desireth, for He is verily the Ordainer, the Giver, the Raiser, the Single, the Transcendent, the Forgiving, the Generous. Then glorify on Our behalf all in whose heart thou perceivest the fragrance of the All-Merciful and in whose countenance thou beholdest the radiance of paradise. And from those who emit not the breezes of love, turn away and face them not, but turn thy face toward the face of God thy Lord. He is with thee wheresoever thou art, and My Self sufficeth as a witness unto that. And the spirit and glory and splendor be upon thee and upon those who are with thee every morn and eve. If this Tablet be concealed from those who are not worthy of it, it would be most fitting, for the truly blind one is not capable of beholding the spiritual Sun, and the truly deaf one is not worthy of hearing the divine melody.

In the Name of the Friend and the Beloved of the soul! O divine friends! Having adorned the food of glory and submission with the spices of unity and sanctification, enter into the verdant, joyous shallow waters of the Beloved Lord, veiled with the veil of light. Drink the wine of divine love with the countenance of the holy, eternal Beauty's manifestation. Make your dwelling in the shallow waters of the stream of glorious Paradise and the flowing of the holy Salsabil of submission, so that, intoxicated and bewildered by the exhilaration and rapture of the wine from the vessels of divine knowledge, you may find relief from the vanities of this transient earth and the defilements of this dusty realm.

From the beginning that has no beginning, the lights of the glory of divine unity have shone forth without pause or delay, and the radiant gleams of the divine Sun have ever appeared and will continue to appear without concealment or diminution. The chains of His glorious power have ever been lifted from the branches of created things, until in these days when the Mount of knowledge, by the command of the Creator Who says "Be!" and it is, has appeared raised up beyond measure upon the peaks of contingent being. Through the sprinkling of grace and the outpouring of glorious bounty, it has become adorned and illumined like the garden of divine unity with all manner of flowers of truth through the wondrous plants of knowledge and wisdom. The precious jewels of mysteries and the holy, exalted pearls have shone forth from that Mount neither of the east nor of the west like the sun, manifest and evident. None among contingent beings has been or ever shall be cut off from the mountain of His consummate wisdom and the pools of His unceasing grace, that eternal Sovereign. Rather, in all successive ages and consecutive days, the entire creation from the beginning that has no beginning has been commanded to turn to this Source of glorious bounty, and the divine Herald has ever called and will continue to call the servants from estrangement in transient, passing homelands to draw near to the glorious, eternal abodes. However, since ears that are not pure have become covered with veils of falsehood and curtains of polytheism, they have therefore been deprived and forbidden from hearkening to the blessed Word of Unity, remaining lost and veiled in the bare wilderness of the heavenly realm and the desert of heedlessness.

O servants! The outpourings of mercy have ever rained down and the showers of grace will continue forever to descend. Therefore, trust in the Truth in all conditions and, turning toward the right hand of divine unity, seek to draw near. Praise be to God that all unceasing effusions culminated in the comprehensive, transcendent Word in the concealed, known year, and through Its blessed, infinite Name, the chalices of grace and bounty appeared manifest and evident from the wine of unity like wondrous red colors in crystal clear glass, such that every possessor of the sense of smell has discovered through the nostrils of the grace of knowledge the straight path of His flowing Paradise, and every blind one has found the way to that glorious wine-cellar of praise. O servants! If you are blind, enter the divine realm through the fragrance of this sweet scent and the diffusion of this holy, eternal musk, for every lost one who intends it reaches this exalted goal, every deaf one who wills it hears these sweet, beloved melodies, and every mute one becomes speaking.

In brief, O weak servants! From the ruined, transient, limited houses, seek refuge in the mighty pillar of unity, and shunning darknesses above darknesses, hold fast and cling to manifestation above manifestation, radiance above radiance, and light above light.

In the Name of the Beloved of the Worlds, O Rahim!

Thy letter was present before the Lord, the All-Bountiful. Praise be to God that through divine grace thou didst attain the Most Holy Court and didst hearken repeatedly unto the divine call and didst drink of the Kawthar of utterance from the Hand of bounty of the Dawning-Place of bestowal. Well is it with thee and with whosoever hath attained unto this supreme bounty.

As to what thou didst mention regarding thy wife, that when she attained unto serving thee, We did absolve her of her misdeeds and clothed her in the robe of forgiveness. Verily thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Most great is the station of the friends of God. Whosoever attaineth unto serving such souls, even though outwardly they may not have attained unto the bounty of faith, yet in the presence of the All-Merciful their deed shall not be lost. The grace of thy Lord hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. We bid thee to show kindness and consideration unto her.

And as to what thou didst mention regarding him who is named Zaynu'l-'Abidin, We have accepted thy intercession on his behalf. We beseech God to aid him to turn wholly toward Him and to bestow upon him this most subtle, most holy and wondrous nectar.

And as to what thou didst mention regarding the wife of him who is named 'Abdu'r-Rahim, convey My greetings unto her and give her the glad-tidings of My mention of her in this perspicuous Tablet. Praise be to God that she and her children are all honored by and have attained unto these days. They must be so enkindled with the fire of the love of God that they may become the cause of enkindling heedless souls. Convey My greetings unto all, both men and women.

From this station We make mention of Our servant who is named Ghulam-Rida. He is among those who attained Our presence when We were dawning from the horizon of Zawra' and We revealed for him in the Book that which shall immortalize his remembrance forever. Verily thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the All-Kind. We counsel him to remember and praise God and to remain steadfast in the Cause of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

We make mention of him who is named Muhammad-Husayn who entered the Most Great Prison and attained repeatedly unto the presence of God, that he may rejoice in My remembrance and be of the thankful ones. O Rahim, convey My greetings unto him on behalf of God and say: The souls who have turned toward the court of the Divine Unity are remembered. The breezes of the All-Merciful are at all times directed toward such souls. Glory be unto him and unto his mother from the presence of God, the Knower of things unseen.

Make mention with wondrous praise of all the loved ones, both those who have attained unto Our presence and those who gaze toward the paradise of God's good-pleasure, and convey unto all of them greetings from God, that all may be set ablaze by the fire of divine remembrance with the warmth of love and may remain wholly steadfast in His Cause. All the names thou didst mention in thy letter have attained a great reward and have been honored by the glorious mention of God.

Finally, We counsel thee to prevent the loved ones from turning toward the Most Holy Court. All must gaze toward the horizon of His good-pleasure and act according to His command. This hath been and shall ever be among the most exalted stations. None is permitted to turn toward it save those whom the All-Merciful hath given leave. Blessed are they who are intoxicated with the wine of His good-pleasure and who are filled with eagerness and joy.

We beseech God to assist His male and female servants to remember and praise Him and to ordain for them the reward of those who have attained unto His presence on this Day which God hath made the sovereign of all days and the source of bounty for all people. Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

O Mirza 'Abdu'llah, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the One dawning from the horizon of the heaven of bounty. Blessed be this Day wherein hath appeared what was promised in the Torah and the Gospel and in the Psalms and the Qur'an - the Day wherein the All-Merciful hath sent down that which the perceivers failed to perceive and the reckoners failed to reckon its station. O peoples of the earth, rejoice within yourselves, for the Mother Book hath appeared and speaketh before the faces of the loved ones. The Kingdom and the Dominion belong to God, the Lord of Lords. Beware lest ye be frightened by the buzzing of flies or the barking of those who have denied God, the Lord of all men. This is the Day wherein the Call hath been raised from all directions and He Who was hidden from sight hath appeared. We beseech God to open before your faces the gates of His bounty and to give you to drink of the Kawthar of His utterance - he who drinketh thereof shall not be frightened by the might of any oppressor, nor weakened by the power of any tyrant, nor saddened by the deed of any denier who hath disbelieved in God, the Lord of all beings.

O My handmaiden! O Sultan! Thy letter was delivered by 'Abdu'llah, upon him be My glory, by the hand of the Most Pure Branch to the Most Great Horizon, and it was read before the Face. We make mention of thee with that which its fragrance shall never cease to endure throughout the kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Powerful. Rejoice thou in this most great bounty. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.

We have desired to make mention of him who ascended to the Supreme Companion, having turned to God in His days. Blessed is he and joy be unto him. We testify that he acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur did utter, and We were present at his ascension. The Concourse on High and the denizens of this exalted station bear witness to this. When his name was mentioned by My Most Exalted Pen, the ocean of forgiveness surged and the fragrance of the bounty of his Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful, was diffused. We beseech God to send down upon him mercy from His presence and grace from His own Self. He is verily the Ruler, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thus did My Most Exalted Pen move at his mention, as a token of grace from Us and mercy from Our presence. Verily there is no God but Him. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.

And We make mention at this time of Haji Qubl Baba who aimed for the Ultimate Goal and the Supreme Summit, traversing lands and mountains until he arrived at the Most Exalted Paradise before the face of his Lord, the Lord of all beings, and heard His sweetest call, and drank from the hand of bounty the wine of immortality. We testify that he attained unto that which was inscribed in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds. His deeds were accepted and there was sent down for him that which attracted the hearts of the knowing ones. We make mention of his wife and those with her, and the village which God adorned with the presence of him who ascended and the appearance of My friends therein. And I am the All-Knowing Rememberer, the Kind, the Mighty, the Generous.

O 'Abdu'llah! Convey My greetings to all. Blessed are My servants and handmaidens whom nothing whatsoever hath prevented from turning to the Most Exalted Horizon. Today the Mother Book speaketh and His bounty hath encompassed all. The eternal Kawthar hath been and ever shall be His mention. Blessed is the soul that hath attained and drunk thereof. Woe unto the heedless! Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is the Wondrous One! This is a leaf that tells of the sighs of my heart and the tears of my eyes and the raptures of my melody and the paleness of my countenance by reason of what the hands of those who disbelieved and associated partners with God have wrought, and who were far removed from the good-pleasure of the Cause. O My loved ones! If you were to hearken with the ear of innate nature to all things and to them, you would hear their wailing and their crying out in My grief. Thus do We inform you, that you may be numbered in the Mother Book among those endowed with knowledge. O My loved ones! I was under the sword in My days, and none among creation was aware of this, and the True One Himself is witness to what I say. If, then, you desire to help your Lord, the All-Merciful, emerge from the veils of self and passion, then remind the people of what the Most Glorious Beauty has taught you, that your words may influence every pure-hearted hearer. Know that victory consists in preserving yourselves from that which you have been forbidden, your eyes from gazing upon aught but God, your hearts from remembering aught but Him, your faces from turning to anything besides Him, your hands from possessing the property of others, and your feet from walking in any path save His good-pleasure. Thus does the tongue of might teach you with knowledge. By My life! Whosoever is characterized by what We have mentioned in the Tablet will be a helper to his Lord's Self in His Cause, which was decreed in the Mother of Tablets. Say: O loved ones of God! Have you forgotten the days in which God's melodies were raised up among you and His countenance shone forth upon you with lights that encompassed all the worlds? Beware lest you erase from your hearts the wondrous remembrance of Me, or from your breasts the manifestations of My love, or from your souls that which dawned from the dawning-place of the Most Exalted Name. Be steadfast in the Cause and differ not in your love for the Youth. By God! This is better for you than all that is on earth together. And if the earthquake of tests and the thunderbolt of trials seize you, be not troubled, but hold fast to the cord of might and glory. Soon you shall find the people fleeing to the right and to the left, and this is what We informed you of in radiant and holy days. When We entered Iraq, We informed some of you of secrets that lay behind the veils of destiny, closely guarded. Among these was what We told Our servant Muhsin and certain other numbered souls - that this station of this Youth is a paradise that has no shade, and were there to be shade therein it would be more exalted than the suns of the former and latter generations. Thus was the decree witnessed from the horizon of the Spirit. Thus have We related to you tidings of the unseen, that you might know the Ancient Beauty and be steadfast in the Cause, and ascend to a station that is raised above recognition. O Mahdi! Cast this exalted Tablet which has proceeded from the Wondrous Pen upon all the Arabs of the City of God and others who are present. But O Mahdi, recite it with a divine spirit and a merciful melody. This is not possible except through detachment from all that exists among the servants, that perchance some souls may become intimate with the private chamber of divine glory and not be deprived of the divine sanctuary. Otherwise, thy Lord is independent of all that is in the heavens and earths. And if Tablets that have been sent are recited in gatherings to the extent that does not cause weariness, this is beloved, that perchance thereby a fire may be kindled in hearts. And convey to all most holy greetings, sanctified above limitation, from this Lonely Stranger.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power

Praise befits the people of faithfulness who are holding fast to the Covenant and clinging to the Pledge. Blessed is the soul that has attained unto God's Covenant and His Testament - such a one is mentioned as the most exalted of creation before the Truth and is recorded in God's Book. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by the fragrances of the hearts of them that know Thee and by the burning of the livers of the sincere ones in their separation and remoteness from Thee, to assist Thy Afnan in that which Thou lovest and approvest. Then raise them at all times through Thy grace, Thy power and Thy loving-kindness. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.

May my spirit be a sacrifice for you. Your esteemed letter arrived and brought the utmost joy and delight - a joy before which all the joys of the world fade into nothingness. After it was presented before the Blessed Beauty, He said: "God willing, may they ever drink from the inexhaustible stream of God's loving-kindness and remain seated firmly established upon the throne of certitude and assurance."

Although outwardly there is distance between this land and that land, yet God knows they are present before Us and are mentioned in the Most Holy Court. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, again and again that they may attain the honor of His presence and drink from the ocean of reunion.

Regarding what was written about Aqa Mirza Muhammad Ibrahim, the receipt was sent - let them send it. And the reply to some petitions from those parts is being sent - they should forward them with utmost haste. The reply to the letter of the honored Afnan, his eminence A. and H., upon him be the Glory of God the Most Glorious, has been submitted and is being sent. I convey to him greetings, praise and glory, and I beseech God, exalted be His station, for the loftiness and elevation of his rank. Verily He is the Generous, the Benevolent, and He is the Giver, the Kind, the Merciful.

To his eminence the honored Afnan-i-Kabir, upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God, I convey my utter servitude and nothingness. And likewise to the shining star, his eminence the Afnan whom God has blessed, I send greetings. To the holy, blessed Leaf, may my spirit be a sacrifice for her steps, and to the honored consort, upon her be all God's most glorious Glory, and to the honored ladies, the Leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree, upon them be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness, I convey glory and greetings. God willing, may all attain unto that which God loves and approves, and drink again and again from the cup of reunion and meeting.

To the apple of our eyes, his eminence Aqa Mirza Mustafa, upon him be the Glory of God, I send greetings. God willing, may he be in perfect health and wellness and remain steadfast in service. To the beloved of the heart, his eminence Aqa Muhammad Mustafa, and the honored beloved, his eminence Haji Muhammad Rida, upon them both be the Glory of God, I send greetings. Praise be to God, they are firm in the Cause and speaking in remembrance and praise. In all conditions I seek confirmation and success for them. To the spiritual friend, his eminence Haji Husayn and all the friends in that land, I send greetings. Peace, mercy and glory be upon the good, pure and blessed Leaf, and upon you and those with you and those who love you and those who hear your words concerning God's Cause, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what will be.

To His Honor Aqa 'Ali, upon him be the peace of God

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power

Praise befitteth and is worthy of that intended Lord Who made the hearts of His loved ones the treasury of the pearls of His love and affection. In truth, each one is a treasure house of divine knowledge and a repository of praise of the All-Merciful. Praise be to God, they are adorned with the ornament of unity and are known for their love of the chosen ones and the pure ones.

O my God, my Lord and my Goal! I beseech Thee by the Lord of the world through Whom Thou didst guide the peoples to Thy straight path and made known to them Thy mighty message, and by His family and companions whom neither the veils of the polytheists nor the clamor of the transgressors prevented, who conquered lands in Thy name and raised therein the banner of Thy Cause and the standard of Thy justice - O Lord, I beseech Thee by them and by Thy Prophets and chosen ones to assist Thy loved ones in Thy remembrance and praise. Then send down upon them from the heaven of Thy bounty a blessing from Thy presence and a grace from Thee. Thou art He to Whose generosity all created things have testified and to Whose munificence all contingent beings have borne witness. Disappoint not him whom Thou hast named 'Ali in the Kingdom of Names from that which Thou hast ordained for those who have drunk from the ocean of Thy good-pleasure and hastened to that which pleaseth Thee. Verily Thou art the Compassionate, the Generous. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

The letter of that honored one arrived twice, and on each occasion it attained the honor of being heard by the Master, may our spirits be a sacrifice for Him. He revealed that which is the cause of hope for all who have turned towards Him. The pens of the world cannot reckon this bounty, the tongues of nations fall short of mentioning it, for most of the world's people are polytheists towards each other, save one party, and even they are afflicted among the parties. Each day they seize and carry away. We beseech God to protect the people of unity and deliver them from the evil of the oppressors. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.

As for the matters of which you wrote, after they were presented He said there was and is no harm in it. The work is for God and its end will surely be for the greatest good. Sorrow has no place; grief and anxiety will be transformed by God's will. What you wrote about Muhammad, upon him be peace and glory - it is the truth without doubt. Indeed they have borne that which became the cause of unity and harmony, and this unity and harmony spread like lightning, nay swifter, throughout all the lands of Iran. In any case, whatever they now deem advisable that will bring immediate reform, let them carry it out with joy and fragrance. O 'Ali, grieve not over anything. He is with you and with His righteous servants. Nothing escapes God's knowledge. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist you with the hosts of grace and favors. Verily He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer prayer.

This servant at all hours and minutes, nights and days, beseeches God - exalted be His glory - on behalf of that spiritual friend whatsoever will bring the greatest joy, that his heart may be illumined with a light from which the world and the hearts of nations may derive brightness. This is not difficult for God. Peace and remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.

In the name of the one who breathed spirit into the bodies of the words by means of the holy and illumined spirit.

Praise be to God that the invisible springs of life that were concealed behind the divine veil are now abundantly flowing from the reality of the Word by virtue of the confirmations of the exalted holy spirit. Yes, the renowned fountain of life, in search of which some have set out, was said to bestow physical life. But the spring of life that flows unseen in the words of the All-Praised grants eternal life and holy spirit. The origin and site of the former fountain is the gloom of the earth. The genesis and cause of this spring is the tresses of the beloved.

For the houri of meaning had been concealed from all eternity behind the pavilions of divine purity. Then she sought permission from the holy court of the sovereign to depart from the chambers of spiritual solitude and enter the compassionate, divine assemblage, and to shed upon the worlds of holiness and unity one of the hidden rays of epiphany. At that point, a crier from the source of the most great divinity and the treasury of the most grand lordship called out, saying that no creature who would accept this effulgence and radiance could be seen. Therefore, the command was given that a new creation and an unprecedented handiwork be brought into being. All the people of the concourse on high and those who dwell beneath the canopies of eternity were stricken with bewilderment, wondering from what element this new creation would be fashioned, and from what reality it would take its being.

Then the breeze of the holy east wind blew from the Sheba of true paradise, bearing a fine, perfumed mist from the locks of that spiritual houri. At that moment, several droplets of luminous wine from the spring of the beauty of the All-Merciful condensed in that mist, and the hand of immortal power became manifest from the hidden treasury of sovereign grace. It kneaded that numinous mist into the sweet water of light, then breathed a pre-existent breath into it. Behold, a new creation arose. Were any one of them to glimpse from the corner of his eye the people of the heavens and the earth, they would, one and all, be obliterated, and would be inverted, and would be returned to pre-existent nothingness.

An irresistible decree now went forth that the people of the pavilions of grandeur, the people of the veils of power, the assemblage of cherubs, and the pure realities must embellish the garden of immortality with the lights of beauty, and must carpet it with brocade and sacred silk embroidered with calligraphy. Then the permission to come out arrived from the heaven of manifestation, and that houri of the spirit emerged from behind the most great curtain, bestowing true spirit upon those who dwell among the people of the heavens and the earth. She stood upon the brocade carpet and began to move. Her movements tossed her hair, causing a few black droplets to be distilled on the embroidered silk upon the ground, bespeaking that resplendent darkness. These wondrous words were embellished by those few droplets, and the river of love was concealed beneath the dark depths of the spring of these words.

Then, O birds of the sacred skies, do not deprive yourselves, by virtue of your concentration upon this ephemeral world, of this immortal fountain. Possibly you will receive permission to enter the eternal chamber of audience with the glorious beauty. Thus do we make mention to you of the mysteries, insofar as what was referred to in all the tablets as the water of life was hidden from your intellects and your hearts. Perhaps you will attain to the water in that spring after severing yourselves from all who are in the heavens and on earth, and will return to the wonders of his overflowing grace.

The Melodious Song of Attraction by Khadijih Khanum, upon her be the Glory of God - Let them take note

He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious

Praise befitteth and is worthy of the Beloved of the world Who, through the blessing of the Most Great Name, hath quickened the dead and revived the withered ones, and through His blessed primal Word which dawned from the Orient of the mouth of the All-Merciful, caused His chosen ones to ascend to the most exalted station and returned the wretched to the most miserable abode. The people of paradise drank from that blessed Word the water of life, while the denizens of hell consumed the deadly zaqqum. Blessed is the soul who is today detached from all save Him in His remembrance, and who with perfect steadfastness speaketh His praise.

And then, several letters were received from you, and since for some time the dispatch of correspondence had been delayed, no reply was sent until now. However, mention of you was ever made in the Most Holy Court. May you ever be blessed with God's infinite favors. This is a day when all the Concourse on High are occupied with the remembrance and praise of God. Say: O handmaidens of God and leaves of the divine Tree of Love! Enter into the paradise of the recognition of the Beloved. Chant wondrous and sublime melodies in His remembrance and praise. Consider the world as non-existent and fix your gaze upon the ocean of joy. Strive that ye may not be deprived of the outpourings of the ocean of bounty. Associate with one another with the utmost sanctity, purity, truthfulness, sincerity, trustworthiness and righteousness, in such wise that its sweet fragrance may be diffused and its gentle scent may be inhaled by every discerning soul. Say: Every deed hath had and shall have its fragrance, and that fragrance informeth all people. God willing, may all be gladdened in perfect unity by the praise of the Peerless Friend.

Furthermore, convey the expressions of servitude, humility and submissiveness of this evanescent servant before the countenance of the Most Great Leaf, Her Holiness the Sister - upon her be the Most Glorious Glory of God. And furthermore, this servant giveth you the glad tidings that the petition you submitted to the Most Holy Court, this servant presented it. He saith - and His sweetest and all-compelling utterance over all things is this:

"O My handmaiden! Give thanks for having been mentioned before the Throne and that the Ancient Beauty hath turned toward thee from this noble prospect. Rejoice that thy name hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen and thou hast been honored in the days of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Hold fast and cling to the cord of grace and the hem of God, the Powerful, the Sublime, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed."

God willing, may you be occupied at all times with the remembrance of the Friend, free and detached from all else, and say:

"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of eternity and Beloved of the world, for having caused me to know Thee and honored me and given me to drink of the choice wine of Thy mercy which hath preceded all created things. I beseech Thee to preserve me in all conditions through Thy bountiful grace."

Make mention of Me to thy sister and say: Grieve not, for thy Lord is verily the Forgiving, the Merciful. Say: Let her not be sorrowful but hold fast to the cord of steadfastness. And if in these circumstances she remaineth firm in the love of God, her deed is greatest in the sight of God, for despite association with that heedless one she hath not been deprived of the ocean of grace. Say: In the name of the Lord of the world, drink at all times from the Kawthar of divine love, despite those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds. That which shall profit thee hath been ordained for thee. Thy Lord is verily the Bearer of Glad Tidings, the All-Knowing.

In the Name of the All-Merciful! All praise, sanctified above mention and description, befitteth the Holy One, Who brought the contingent world to life and bestowed vitality through the breaths of divine knowledge, and raised aloft in the most exalted station the banner proclaiming that "there is none other God but Him" - glorified be His grandeur and mighty His proof, and there is no God but Him. Blessings and peace be upon His Light through which He illumined the world and made him the Seal of His Messengers and Prophets, choosing him from among His servants to manifest His Cause and exalt His Word, and through him guided the monotheists to His straight path and His mighty Message, and upon his family and companions whom God made the standards of His victory throughout His lands and the banners of His power amidst His creation - blessings that shall never fade nor be forgotten, for He is the Mighty, the Bestower. There is none other God but Him, the One, the Chosen.

Your letters arrived repeatedly before, but nothing since then - although "nothing" itself contains much meaning, as it possesses the "h" with two eyes, the "y" adorned with two dots, and the "j" with three dots. In truth, all is concealed and hidden within nothingness.

As for what prompts the writing of this letter: first, mention of you and news of your health and wellbeing; and second, at this time they instructed me to inform you that this year sufficient wheat has not been obtained. What was acquired will not, God willing, suffice for the travelers and residents, and funds are not available. We tried to borrow from some but were unsuccessful. His honor Mirza Majdu'd-Din, upon him be God's peace, the Lord of all worlds, is aware of the situation and will explain. Therefore, as instructed, it would be appreciated if you could send whatever amount possible from the requested funds, so that pure and desirable wheat might be obtained. In this matter, it would be best if there is no delay. You yourself are aware of the gatherings and the coming and going of travelers. This matter truly carries great reward and recompense.

As for your mother, upon her be God's peace, she is occupied day and night in remembrance of God, seeking for you glory, wealth, blessing and bounty. God willing, the time of nearness and meeting will soon arrive and the remaining matters will be discussed in person.

Other matters: First, send the shared cows. Second, regarding payment for Mustafa's mare, you were supposed to pay five liras and he would pay the remaining five liras after 6 months, but neither you paid nor did he. Now send your portion as there has been much delay. Also, I had previously requested ten liras from you to be sent, but you neither sent the funds nor replied to the letter. This time do not act as before - write your reply and send the funds. You must this time arrange all matters according to what is desired.

Furthermore, peace be upon you and upon God's righteous servants. Also remember and glorify the honored friend Mirza Dhikru'llah and tell him no funds have yet been received from him. Peace. ?iya. Dated 12 Rabi' I.

Let him regard \[this letter\], His Holiness the beloved of \[my\] heart, Agha Siyyid Yahya, upon him be the peace and favors of God.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power

Praise be worthy and befitting that Intended One Who favored one of the parties of the world with His special favors and honored them with the adornment of recognition and unity. His mercy has encompassed the world and His grace has adorned all with the wondrous and lofty blessings of wisdom and utterance. Great is His generosity, supreme His bounty, and mighty His bestowal. There is no God but Him. And blessings and peace be upon Him through Whom the world was adorned with the light of recognition, and through Whom was opened the gate of Names in the Kingdom of Creation and the gate of Attributes to those in earth and heaven, and upon the brilliant stars and radiant manifestations and exalted words - namely His family and companions through whom the breeze of the All-Merciful wafted over all possibility and the fragrance of His garment diffused among all religions, and through whom His authority appeared and His blessing descended and His banner was raised - blessings whose mention has no end and whose termination cannot be seen.

And then, O beloved of my heart, your letter arrived speaking of your love and your remembrance and your praise and your turning to God and your trust and your resignation and your submission to God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the Throne and earth and the Possessor of greatness and glory. After its reading and \[my\] joy and delight, I approached the Most Great Spot and presented it. He said: "Convey to him My glad-tidings and My greetings." You are ever mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. God is witness and the Book testifies that We have beseeched for you from the ocean of His grace and heaven of His generosity that which endures by the endurance of His most beautiful names. We beseech God the Exalted to send down upon him and upon His loved ones there mercy from the heaven of His grace and rains from the clouds of His generosity. Verily He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer.

This evanescent servant testifies that mention of that beloved of the heart and other beloved ones has ever been and is upon this carpet. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, not to deprive the world, that is its people, of fairness and to grant them a portion from the ocean of truthfulness that all may attain to what He loves and is pleased with. In all cases I beseech joy for those who believe in divine unity. Verily He is the Reliever of supreme anguish and the Remover of harm through His name, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

Regarding the countenance of the spiritual friend, His Honor Haji Muhammad Husayn, upon him be God's peace and favor, in accordance with that beloved's mention, thirty-two bento and one Ottoman \[coin\] arrived previously. In truth, he acts above the human station and tells of the Kingdom of giving. From beginning until now, whatever he has done has been crowned with acceptance. This is another blessing. We beseech God to strengthen him and aid him and enable him to do what He loves and is pleased with.

I convey greetings to the friends of that land and the loved ones of that quarter, and I beseech for them the favor of the True One, exalted be His glory, and His mercy and bounty and generosity. And He is the Bestower, the All-Bountiful, the Generous. There is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Peace and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is the Mighty, the Everlasting, the Exalted, the Glorious, the Most Glorious

The remembrance of God in the Divine Tree in the spot which God hath blessed above all places on earth. God, there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He hath created creation out of nothing by His power and ordained for them through His knowledge whatsoever He hath willed and desired. This is a bounty from His presence and a grace from His court, did ye but know. He sent unto them Messengers and revealed with them the Book lest His servants go astray on earth and that they might be guided thereby. He hath detailed all things in the Book as guidance and mercy for people who believe. Say: O people, fear ye God and spread not corruption in the land, and be not of those who are not guided by God's guidance. Be not like those who mention God with their tongues yet are veiled from the Beauty of the One remembered, and who worship God in cloisters and mosques yet flee from the countenance of the Worshipped One in His days. When asked "Who is your God?" they will say "God", yet they turn away from His presence and His signs. It is as though they worship names for which God hath given no authority, and thus do they cleave to idols within themselves while perceiving not. They mention God without His authority being manifest to them, yet when it is manifested they turn back on their heels. Thus do ye recognize these people, O people, then turn away from them. Turn ye with all your being unto God, then thank Him for having chosen you from among His creation and aided you in His Cause and made you know the Manifestation of His Self and taught you the paths of glory and piety and sheltered you on the sacred shore beyond the Sea of Spirit in the holy and beloved spot and rent asunder the veils from you and purified you from allusions and raised you to a station wherein ye heard holy melodies from the tongue of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and sent upon you the fragrances of His days for which honored servants died in longing. By God, were we to possess a thousand souls and a thousand bodies and sacrifice them in His path it would be little compared to His bestowals, did ye but know. Thus have We related unto you spiritual tales that ye might know God's grace upon you and not separate yourselves from this glorious and beloved Cause, and that ye might stand firm in the love of God and the Manifestations of His Self such that the evil whisperings of your souls mislead you not, nor the blame of the blamers veil you from this luminous and extended Path which hath been raised in the divine Paradise in the name of God, the Exalted, the Transcendent, the Witnessed. O people of the Bayan! Remember within yourselves what We have mentioned unto you in truth from this hidden and luminous Pen, and grieve not over anything, and turn not to the world and its ornaments and all that pertaineth to it and is in it and upon it, but turn to what is with God for that is better for you, if ye approach the shore of this counsel with the foot of detachment. Thus do We expound the verses unto you in truth and reveal unto you that which will bring you to the divine Ridvan wherein ye shall enter by God's leave and wherein ye shall rejoice. Be not veiled, O people of the Bayan, from this bounty which hath descended from the holy heaven while ye witness it with your own eyes. Beware lest ye deny it as did nations of old who denied God's signs. And the Spirit be upon you and upon those who follow God's laws.

To his honor Aqa 'Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God. On 22 Dhi'l-Qa'dih 1303.

He is God, exalted be His station of grandeur and power!

A wondrous mention and a new adornment and a fresh thought and boundless knowledge is He Whom our praise cannot reach and our glorification is not worthy of. Description and characterization, whether above or below that, belongs to the world of creation and should be mentioned within creation's bounds. However, praise befits the people of fidelity who hold fast to the cord of unity and cling to true love and harmony. The clamor of the ignorant does not prevent them from the highest horizon, nor does the uproar of enemies veil them. These are the hands of the Cause in the world of creation and the servants of the Lord of existence among His creatures. Their praise flows from the Supreme Pen and is recorded in every Book. Blessed are they and theirs is a goodly return.

Thereafter, the letter of that honored brother arrived like water reaching the thirsty. Praise be to God, the fragrance of the love of Truth wafted from it and divine mention and praise were evident therein. In these days the pens have attained their lofty stations. All things have received the breezes of the grace of the Beloved of possibility according to their measure. Pens are racing in the field of mention and praise, and likewise the tongue of remembrance. These two are outwardly heard and perceived by the external ear, but by the life of our Beloved and your Beloved, the true ears hear the praise of all things and are gladdened thereby. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to cause these servants to ever attain these two most exalted stations. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.

After perusing the letter of that honored brother, it was presented before the Countenance and fully submitted. He said: "O 'Ali-Akbar! Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto true unity and hast heard from the rustling of the leaves of the garden of inner meanings the words 'Verily there is no God but Him.' Darkness hath encompassed the world. The friends must shine forth like light that perchance the darkness may be dispelled and return to nothingness. Regarding what thou didst write about affairs, in all conditions they should fix their gaze upon the highest horizon, and if they are in debt to anyone they must certainly pay it, whether through compensation or otherwise. That honored one should rest assured in God's grace and hold fast unto Him. And what thou didst mention regarding partnership with the two Most Exalted Names was accepted before the Countenance. The welfare of the friends hath ever been mentioned. In all matters they should consult with the two Names and act according to what becomes apparent. This is a bounty from God, for consultation removes obscuring veils from the face of understanding and reveals that which is befitting. We have mentioned and continue to mention all the friends of that land, and We beseech God to increase the light of certitude in each one at every moment. Verily, He hath power over all things."

This evanescent servant also conveys greetings to each one and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, for the success of all. He is the Bestower, the Kind. In closing, peace and mercy be upon you and upon God's righteous servants. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is the Dawning One from the horizon of utterance, a remembrance from Us to him who has turned to the Supreme Horizon and drunk the Choice Wine sealed from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Lord of Names, on a Day wherein the greatest terror seized all mankind except whom God, the Lord of Destiny, willed - He Who summoned all in the Most Great Prison unto God, the Lord of the world, and before that in Baghdad and other lands. Thus was the matter decreed from God, the Lord of the worlds.

O Ashraf, O thou who gazest upon the Most Great Scene! Remind the people and acquaint them with what was sent down before regarding the mention of this Day, which was named the Day of God in the Scriptures of God, the Mighty, the Powerful. Say: This is the Day wherein mankind has arisen unto the Lord of the worlds, and this is what the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur'an - to this testifies every just and informed one. Say: O people of creation! By God, the All-Merciful has come, Whose advent every Prophet and every trustworthy Messenger heralded. Say: Open your eyes and follow not those who followed vain imaginings until they turned away from the All-Informed One. Say: Die in your wrath! Your Lord has come with the angels rank upon rank, and this is the Day whereof God, the King, informed that "the Kingdom on that Day shall be God's" - be fair, O people of the earth, and be not of the wrongdoers. This is the Day wherein none is mentioned save God alone. Read ye the former Books that ye may discover this Treasure, through Whose appearance the tribes of the earth have lamented, the daysprings of vain imaginings were terrified, and the hearts of the idolaters were troubled. O people of the earth! Dispute not the signs of God after their revelation, and follow not every remote ignorant one.

Blessed art thou for having turned, heard, and answered thy Ancient Lord. The Supreme Pen testifies that thou art the star rising from the horizon of steadfastness in this heaven which was raised up through this Most Great Name. Soar in this atmosphere and speak forth His Name, through Whose manifestation all on earth and in heaven were thunderstruck, save whom God, the Mighty, the Powerful, willed. It behooveth thee to convey the Cause of thy Lord with spirit and fragrance - this is among the most excellent deeds with God, the Goal of the worlds. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist thee in helping the Cause of thy Lord and to enable thee to do what befitteth this glorious and wondrous Day.

Convey My greetings to the faces of My loved ones and give them glad tidings of this Remembrance, through Whose appearance all things proclaimed: "The Kingdom belongeth to Him Who hath come with manifest sovereignty." Say: This is the Day of steadfastness, did ye but know. Say: Beware lest the doubts of those who have disbelieved in God and His signs, and denied this grace to which all the Books of the world have testified, hold you back - verily they are among the abased ones. They have cast the ordinances of God behind their backs and taken what they were commanded by every dubious ignorant one. Arise to promote the Cause and illumine hearts with the lights of thy Lord's countenance, and acquaint them with this Straight Path. Say: With Him is not what is with you, nor doth He walk in your ways. He hath appeared and manifested what He desired through His sovereignty over all in the heavens and earth. Grieve not at the people and their clamor. Rather, rejoice in that thou hast been mentioned before the Truth in this Clear Tablet. The glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who hear thy word regarding this Cause whereby the earth was rent asunder, the heaven was cleft, and every lofty and towering mountain was scattered. And praise be to God, the Mighty, the Wondrous.

The Ancient and Most Great, My remembrance of My servant who soared in the atmosphere of the love of his Lord, the Most Merciful, with spirit and fragrance, and was so seized by the attraction of the Call that he turned to the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven, and entered the luminous spot wherein his Lord, the Most Glorious, calls out "God, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise." We have found the fragrance of thy love, O Beloved of the horizons, and We are aware of what is in thy heart. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Be thankful for His having enabled thee to attain His presence and hear His mighty and impregnable utterance.

He calleth thee from the horizon of the prison, "Verily there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise." Blessed art thou for having attained the presence of the Beloved and for having entered, appeared, and heard the call of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Impregnable. By God! If thou didst find the sweetness of the utterance of the Most Merciful in this Tablet, which God hath made the Dawning-Place of His remembrance in the contingent world, thou wouldst soar with longing and speak forth His praise amongst the worlds. O Nabil! Rejoice in God's remembrance of thee, then aid Him with such steadfastness as shall cause the servants to stand firm. Thus doth the Lord of the mighty Throne command thee. Return to thy homeland by God's leave and command, then make mention of those who have arisen to serve the Cause of thy Lord, the Self-Subsisting, the Mighty, the Powerful. We have sent down for each one of them clear verses and We have sent them in truth, if thou be of them that know. We make mention of him who makes mention of his Lord and speaks His praise - the denizens of Paradise who circle round the pavilion of grandeur and majesty. Thus doth He inform thee in Whose grasp is the kingdom of the heavens and earth. Blessed be thy heart for having turned, and thy face for having been directed toward the spot wherein the Beloved is imprisoned for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We had given thee leave to attain Our presence aforetime, therefore thy name was mentioned among those who were moved by the Will and who turned with permission toward the Qiblih of those near unto God. Give thanks to thy Lord for this and be thou of the thankful. Convey My greetings to each one of My loved ones who dwell in thy land. We behold them in their condition. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing. O Samandar! Blessed art thou for having turned to the Most Great Scene and attained the recognition of the Lord of Destiny, and for having arisen to serve Him and been among those who arose. Thou hast fulfilled God's Covenant and discharged His trust. He shall fulfill even as thou hast fulfilled, for He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. My gaze hath been directed toward those who have attained the lights of the Countenance and who were among the firm ones. Grieve not over anything, for thou hast drunk from the ocean of joy which appeared through this Great Name. Call the people with wisdom and utterance. Thus hath the Most Merciful commanded thee in various tablets. He is the Ruler over what He willeth. Blessed are ye for having attained what God desired. We testify that ye have turned and attained and were among those who turned. Ye are of Us, therefore We counsel you with that which befitteth the days of your Lord, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Acquire ye the attributes of God, then walk ye in the straight path that His Cause may be sanctified among His servants and His Being glorified among the worlds. Thus doth the Tongue of Grandeur counsel you while in the midst of the malicious ones. We have desired for you that which nothing can equal. He is the Protector of the doers of good. Verily the glory be upon you and upon those with you, every male and female who have turned with their hearts and attained the lights of His impregnable countenance.

In His Name, He Who is established upon the throne of 'He doeth what He willeth'

Glory be to Him Who speaketh at the heart of the world and calleth all peoples to the eternal, everlasting Law through which He quickeneth all worlds and aideth whomsoever He willeth through His sovereignty and confirmeth those who have turned to the Dayspring of His Cause. He is, verily, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.

We have sent down verses for every occasion that are unequalled by all that hath been created in the heavens and earth. Blessed is he who, when hearing, ariseth, and he who, when attaining unto hearing, speaketh forth this wise remembrance. They who have been set ablaze by the fire of the Word among all creatures - these are the people of Baha in the kingdom of creation, as doth testify unto this the Lord of Names in this mighty prison.

Blessed art thou for having been touched by the breezes of revelation and drawn nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Give thanks for Our causing thee to hear this Call, for the hearing of which the ears of the Prophets and Messengers were created. By God! Were it not for this Call, ears would not have been created, nor would the eyes of the mystics have been opened. Hold fast to the cord of steadfastness in such wise that through thee every doubting soul may become steadfast. Then protect the Cause from the allusions of those who have denied God and the veils of every sinful polytheist.

Thy letter was present before the Throne and was honored with the glance of the loving-kindness of the Lord of existence. Praise the Beloved of the worlds that thou hast been and wilt continue to be mentioned in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is among the great bounties of thy Lord. Today what is incumbent upon all is to protect people from the conditions of self and passion, and the steadfastness of all in the love of the Beloved of all possibility. Ye must educate the loved ones of God in such wise that they remain not deprived of the Lord of the worlds by the cry of the cawers, for from every direction the cry of haste hath been and will be raised. They consider all things nonexistent and void. They should not be deceived before the completion of a thousand years, as hath been expressly revealed in the Tablets, but should remain so firm in the Cause that they regard all else as perishing. This is among the most mighty matters, that the Cause of God may be established in all else. God willing, ye must be occupied with utmost endeavor in service to the Cause. Most people are ignorant; it is necessary that steadfast souls be educated by the hands of training. We beseech God to assist thee in all conditions and make thee among those who have aided the Cause of God by their own selves. He is the Helper of the helpers.

Blessed art thou, O My Name, then blessed art thou, O My Name, for having attained unto that which most of the servants have not attained, and for having drunk the wine of life from the cup of the favors of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Unto this doth thy Master testify at the heart of Paradise. This is a treasure for thee in His dominion, a light for thee in His kingdom, and a glory for thee in His human realm. Thy Lord knoweth what thou art upon. He is, verily, the All-Wise, the All-Informed.

In recent years, a number of the loved ones have inquired about certain divine ordinances. Due to divine wisdom these were deferred until this year when various petitions from the people of different lands were present before the Throne. Therefore the mighty Tablet which is in truth the cause of the order of the world and the life of nations was sent down from the heaven of will. Perchance God will send it afterwards. He is, verily, the Ruler over what He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Powerful.

Convey greetings from the True One to all the loved ones, both men and women, and keep them enkindled with the fire of the Word. The glory be upon thee and upon those who love thee for the sake of God.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most Powerful

Praised be God! In some stations the mention of abandonment is sweeter than taking possession, nay, in one station man beholds himself in the ocean of detachment through mention of it. Blessed is this station and joyous is this station, as the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an through His blessed and exalted words: "I have abandoned the ways of a people who believe not in God and who deny the life to come." In truth this verse is specifically for the sincere ones and those near to God. The meaning of "ways of a people" in the first degree refers to the principles of the polytheists, and in another station refers to the adornments of that people, and likewise their occupations, and in one station all that they had clung to without God's leave is included therein. Through the grace of God, exalted be His glory, that true Beloved and eternal Friend hath drunk from this ocean. In all conditions they are detached from all else but God and are cleaving and clinging and trusting in Him. When the sun of resignation dawns from the horizon of the words "I resign my affair unto God - He verily is our Guardian and Provider and the One who causes us to die and gives us life and resurrects us, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen." And blessings and peace be upon Him by whose grasp the seed spoke, and before whose face all things bore witness, and from the wellspring of whose knowledge and wisdom flowed the water of life, and upon His family and companions through whom were opened the gates of generosity in the world and God's Cause was established among the nations - blessings from which those near to God find the fragrance of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds. And then, the letter of that beloved of the heart arrived. It contained firm proofs and likewise conclusive evidence of that beloved one's love and affection and devotion and detachment. And after it was presented before His face, He said: "O Muhammad, upon thee be the peace of God and His loving-kindness. Despair not of God's Spirit and mercy." From these blessed words flow the Euphrates of mercy and the breezes of loving-kindness waft, and within it is concealed the book of compassion. Blessed is he who preserves its station and raises its standards. In all conditions thou art mentioned before the Wronged One and art present before His face. His grace hath not deprived the polytheists and the opposers, how much less the monotheists and those who have accepted, how much less those who are detached and sincere. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist you with the hosts of grace and bounty and to ordain for you what He hath ordained for His chosen ones. He is verily the Lord of creation. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Most Exalted.

Praise be to God! You are remembered as a daily blessing and are adorned and embellished with the outpouring of utterance. A hundred thousand praises be to the Goal of the world's peoples, that in such days as these He hath made firm the fellowship of His loved ones and hath regarded the connection between them. He is the Composer of hearts and the Promoter of affairs. We beseech Him for that which befitteth His generosity and grace. Verily He is the Generous, the Gracious. Convey my greetings to each of the gentlemen of that land. God is witness and aware that you have ever been and are remembered in my heart, and I seek confirmation for each one that they may arise with utmost outward and inward resolve to set right affairs. Assistance is from God and success from Him and mercy from His presence. He is verily the Strong, the Trustworthy, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones.

In the Name of the Counselor! God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His is the creation and the command; all worship Him. God testifieth that there is none other God but Him; all bow down before Him. God testifieth that there is none other God but Him; all seek Him. God testifieth that there is none other God but Him; all act according to His command. God testifieth that there is none other God but Him; all turn unto Him. God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and whoso desireth to attain His presence must detach himself from whatsoever preventeth him from treading His manifest and evident path. God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and whoso desireth to be mentioned must needs till the soil of certitude that the ears of divine knowledge may grow therefrom. Thus hath the decree been ordained in a preserved Tablet.

O servant! Hearken unto the call of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Be not heedless of the fruit of existence, nor occupy thyself with fruits that are produced by the tree of limitation. Plant thou the divine tree of explanation in thy heart, then water it with the living waters of the mention of My Name, the All-Merciful, that it may yield thee the fruits of inner meanings which shall endure, while that with which thou art occupied shall perish and profit thee not save in the measure that is ordained. Art thou occupied with the outward earth while heedless of the holy, blessed and goodly earth wherein whatsoever groweth proclaimeth: There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Best-Beloved?

We created thee that thou mightest cultivate the earth of divine knowledge wherefrom grow the ears of divine unity. Beware lest thou be veiled from that for which thou wert created and be among the heedless ones. By God the Truth! Should anyone purify his ear and hearken unto the call of God from the direction of the Prison, he would detach himself from whatsoever hath been created between earth and heaven and would offer up his soul in the path of this Prisoner.

If thou occupiest thyself with teaching the Cause of God, We shall assuredly plant for thee, by the hands of divine will in goodly soil, that which shall profit thee throughout the eternity of God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Glorious, the Most Loving. Hearken unto My words, then speak forth in praise of thy Lord - this is better for thee than what thou possessest, if thou be of them that are certain. Beware lest thou burn the enduring trees with perishable ones. Fear God and be of the God-fearing.

Occupy thyself with affairs to a known measure, in such wise that thou wilt not be in need. Be independent through His Name, the Self-Sufficing, then put thy trust in Him in all affairs. Verily thy Lord loveth those servants who earn their livelihood, but only to such measure as their earning preventeth them not from the remembrance of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Thus have We counseled thee in truth and chosen for thee what We have chosen for honored servants.

Cast behind thee whatsoever preventeth thee from mentioning thy Lord, then make mention of thy Lord amongst Our heedless servants, that they may arise to serve the Cause and glorify their Lord and be of the penitent ones. Verily He is independent of all mention and praise, and all things bear witness to His sanctification, yet none hear it save the hearing ear. That which We enjoin upon the servants is a bounty from God unto them, but few among His servants know this and render thanks.

Aid thy Lord through utterance and associate with those who make mention of God in private and in public, whose hearts are set ablaze by this Fire from whose sighing is heard: "He is God; there is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting." Convey Our greetings to the faces of those who have sought the Most Great Sanctuary and have detached themselves from the idolaters. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who have passed over the Bridge. By God! They are honored servants.

The Green City. Nabil before thou. Say: Upon him be the Glory of God! He is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath appeared in truth is indeed He Who was mentioned in former ages and inscribed by My Most Exalted Pen in the Scriptures of old. He is the Hidden and Treasured Name through Whose remembrance the pages of creation were adorned, through Whom the Fire spoke forth from the Mount, and through Whom the Throne was established upon the earth of manifestation. Whoso turneth unto Him hath turned unto the ocean of My knowledge and the heaven of My wisdom and faced the lights of My countenance. And whoso hesitateth for less than a moment hath denied My Self, turned away from My proof, disputed My signs and rejected My favor which hath been sent down from the heaven of My bounty that hath preceded all in the heavens and earth.

O thou who gazeth toward My horizon! Hearken unto My call which hath been raised from the precincts of My prison, then thank thy Lord for having turned unto thee and revealed that whose fragrance shall never be cut off throughout the eternity of His most excellent names. He is verily the Compassionate, the Generous.

We were seated upon the Throne and heard what the earth related of its tidings when the servant who standeth before the Face presented himself with a white leaf and submitted what was inscribed thereon in the presence of God, the Lord of all worlds. When We heard thy call and thy cry in the love of God and His meeting, We answered thee with this Tablet from whose horizon hath shone the sun of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Most High, the Most Great. Blessed be thine ear for having hearkened unto My call, and thy tongue for having uttered My praise, and thine eye for having turned toward My luminous horizon. We made mention of thee on a day We perceived from thee the fragrance of My love, in the Crimson Scroll by My Most Exalted Pen, in such wise as cannot be equaled by all the treasures of the earth. To this beareth witness He Who proclaimeth in every state that there is none other God but Me, the Manifest, the Brilliant, the Mighty, the Wondrous.

Thou art he who took hold of the Book with strength from thy Lord after the learned, the mystics and the princes turned away therefrom, save whom God pleased, the Lord of this mighty Command. Blessed is the scholar who arose to serve My Cause, made known unto men My path and guided them to the ocean of My mercy and the heaven of My loving-kindness. He is indeed among the most exalted of creatures in the Book of God.

Say: O concourse of princes! Beware lest the veils of the world withhold you from the Lord of all men. That which ye possess shall perish in less than a moment and ye shall find yourselves in manifest loss. Leave behind that which the tongues of men testify is perishable and hold fast unto that which endureth with God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. From this most exalted Station We send Our greetings unto those who have quaffed the wine of immortality in My Most Glorious Name, and We counsel them to observe supreme steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of men have slipped save those whom God, their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing, hath willed.

Say: O servants of the All-Merciful! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of all religions. Verily it hath been raised through grace and commandeth you to that which hath been revealed in the Book from the presence of One mighty and powerful. Thus have We sent down the verses and illumined therewith the horizons of the hearts of those who have cast away idle fancies, clinging to the cord of certitude.

Glory be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon them that have acted in accordance with that which they were bidden by God, the Mighty, the Praised. Grieve not for what hath befallen thee. He verily consoleth thee in truth and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. There hath been built for thee by the hand of power that which shall not be touched by extinction throughout the eternity of My most excellent names. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing.

The eye of creation hath never witnessed His like - to this testifieth He Who walketh and speaketh that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Bestower. Say: O heedless ones! By God, He Who was recorded in the Books of God hath appeared, He Whom His chosen ones, His trusted ones and His messengers heralded - to this testifieth He Who hath spoken that which the Scriptures and Tablets encompassed. O peoples of the earth! I desire naught from you. I summon you for the sake of God, the Lord of Names, unto the Most Exalted Horizon. Fear ye God and be not of those who went astray and led others astray. This is a Day wherein all things cry out: blessed be the ear that heareth, and woe unto him who followeth every doubting ignorant one. O peoples of the earth! Fear God, then turn unto the horizon of certitude and follow not those who disbelieved and denied by following the manifestations of idle fancies. O 'Ali-Akbar! He Who was wronged remembereth thee from the precincts of His Most Great Prison, by reason of that which caused the fragrance of the All-Merciful to waft throughout creation and the river of life to flow among the people of divine knowledge. Exalted is He Who hath appeared with the truth and manifested through His power whatsoever He desired. We have heard mention of thee and witnessed thy turning and orientation toward the Dayspring of Revelation on a day wherein hatred appeared from all directions. We verily delivered thee through the truth and saved thee from the depths of idle fancies and taught thee that which most lands were veiled from, and We heard thy lamentation and cry in the love of God, the Lord of the Final End. O 'Ali! He hath appeared that all who are in earth and heaven might attain His presence, yet the oppressors have interposed between Us and them - they are indeed among the wayward. Blessed is the land which His feet have trodden, and the habitation wherein the fragrance of His raiment hath been diffused, and the city wherein His call hath been raised at morn and eventide. We called them unto life while they called Us unto death. What aileth these people that they comprehend neither utterance nor Book? The first to deny God and His party were the divines of the age who broke God's Covenant and His Testament and disbelieved in Him when He came to them with the standards of light and the banners of verses. Days passed and We withheld the Pen from thy mention, in wisdom from Us. Verily thy Lord doeth what He willeth and shall not be asked of what He pleaseth. He is indeed the Powerful, the All-Choosing. When the appointed time came We released it by Our command and revealed for thee that which delighted the eye of the world and drew the righteous nigh. Blessed art thou for having held fast to the Most Great Handle when the Lord of all came, and woe unto every denying infidel. Remember thou on behalf of the Wronged One God's friends and loved ones, and give them the glad-tidings of My mercy and My loving-kindness and the lights of My countenance whereby the horizons were illumined. Say: O My loved ones! This is a Day wherein from the waves of this Ocean is heard that which the ear of Moses heard on the Mount of Knowledge and the Beloved on the Night of Ascension. Say: Seize ye the opportunity in the days of God and hold fast to that whereby your mention shall endure throughout ages and centuries. Thus did the ocean of the All-Merciful's loving-kindness surge, as a grace from Him unto thee. Be thou thankful and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the beginning and the end! The light shining from the horizon of the heaven of My prison be upon thee and upon those who attained unto the Choice Wine when its seal was broken by the finger of might and power.

By Him Who is the Great Announcement! The All-Merciful is come invested with undoubted sovereignty. The Balance hath been appointed, and all them that dwell on earth have been gathered together.

The Trumpet hath been blown, and lo, all eyes have stared up with terror, and the hearts of all who are in the heavens and on the earth have trembled, except them whom the breath of the verses of God hath quickened, and who have detached themselves from all things.

This is the Day whereon the earth shall tell out her tidings. The workers of iniquity are her burdens, could ye but perceive it. The moon of idle fancy hath been cleft, and the heaven hath given out a palpable smoke. We see the people laid low, awed with the dread of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.

The Crier hath cried out, and men have been torn away, so great hath been the fury of His wrath. The people of the left hand sigh and bemoan. The people of the right abide in noble habitations: they quaff the Wine that is life indeed, from the hands of the All-Merciful, and are, verily, the blissful.

The earth hath been shaken, and the mountains have passed away, and the angels have appeared, rank on rank, before Us. Most of the people are bewildered in their drunkenness and wear on their faces the evidences of anger. Thus have We gathered together the workers of iniquity. We see them rushing on towards their idol. Say: None shall be secure this Day from the decree of God. This indeed is a grievous Day. We point out to them those that led them astray. They see them, and yet recognize them not.

Their eyes are drunken; they are indeed a blind people. Their proofs are the calumnies they uttered; condemned are their calumnies by God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. The Evil One hath stirred up mischief in their hearts, and they are afflicted with a torment that none can avert. They hasten to the wicked, bearing the register of the workers of iniquity. Such are their doings.

Say: The heavens have been folded together, and the earth is held within His grasp, and the corrupt doers have been held by their forelock, and still they understand not. They drink of the tainted water, and know it not. Say: The shout hath been raised, and the people have come forth from their graves, and arising, are gazing around them. Some have made haste to attain the court of the God of Mercy, others have fallen down on their faces in the fire of Hell, while still others are lost in bewilderment. The verses of God have been revealed, and yet they have turned away from them. His proof hath been manifested, and yet they are unaware of it. And when they behold the face of the All-Merciful, their own faces are saddened, while they are disporting themselves. They hasten forward to Hell Fire, and mistake it for light. Far from God be what they fondly imagine!

Say: Whether ye rejoice or whether ye burst for fury, the heavens are cleft asunder, and God hath come down, invested with radiant sovereignty. All created things are heard exclaiming: "The Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."

Know thou, moreover, that We have been cast into an afflictive Prison, and are encompassed with the hosts of tyranny, as a result of what the hands of the infidels have wrought. Such is the gladness, however, which the Youth hath tasted that no earthly joy can compare unto it. By God! The harm He suffereth at the hands of the oppressor can never grieve His heart, nor can He be saddened by the ascendancy of such as have repudiated His truth.

Say: Tribulation is a horizon unto My Revelation. The day star of grace shineth above it, and sheddeth a light which neither the clouds of men's idle fancy nor the vain imaginations of the aggressor can obscure. Follow thou the footsteps of thy Lord, and remember His servants even as He doth remember thee, undeterred by either the clamor of the heedless ones or the sword of the enemy....Spread abroad the sweet savors of thy Lord, and hesitate not, though it be for less than a moment, in the service of His Cause. The day is approaching when the victory of thy Lord, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful, will be proclaimed.

Most mighty ambassador, most noble minister,

Allow me to say that the tribulations of these servants have reached such a point that pen and ink are powerless to record them. During these (last) few years, I have (addressed myself?) to the officials of the Ottoman government. Whatever has befallen me, I have endured it patiently, relying on God, nay I have been contented and grateful. The one God is witness that I have at all times expected martyrdom, but since I observed that a number of poor ones occupied with the mention of God and detached from all save Him were oppressed and downtrodden in every land, both men and women, young and old, I felt compelled to speak. And this despite the fact that, in the sixteen years from my arrival in Baghdad until now, no offense has been committed by anyone.

Your excellency will have heard that, before those sixteen years, this sect did not endure oppression, but took revenge. I forbade all (to do so), so that they were put to death in every land, yet opposed no one. It is now sixteen years that, although members of this sect have been killed, they have not shown opposition, despite the fact that they are stronger than before and are greater in numbers in every part of Iran. Nevertheless, whatever oppression has befallen them, they have remained and remain silent and patient, and are the most oppressed of the people of the earth.

It is, therefore, incumbent on me to present the plea of these oppressed ones before the King of the World. I pray he may show such grace that men will behave towards these downtrodden ones as they do towards others and may not transgress the basic laws of the nations. It befits the sun to rise up and shed its light, and it behoves the cloud to pour down rain. It is, therefore, necessary for his highness the King to look after the interests of an oppressed people.

In these days, the case of these prisoners has become extremely serious. Hour by hour, the severity of our condition increases. They have imprisoned nearly seventy individuals, all of whom are in discomfort and ill, yet they will not allow anyone to go out to obtain medicine or food, nor have they yet given us even a dinar for our expenses. A few days ago, a pasha came to my son and said they had telegraphed to say that some (of us) would be given one franc per day, others half a franc. It seems that the purpose of this was to bring dishonour on me.

Some time ago, I sent a report of what had happened to the Austrian ambassador. If he should pay heed, things will improve, for there has been no fault on our part. They have never proved legally that this sect has committed wrong, nor have they explained the reason for this affliction. Undoubtedly, your excellency will pay attention to our affairs as far as lies within your capacity. The one God is witness that your excellency has shown the greatest favour, to such a degree that you remembered me at such a time. That, in truth, is in itself sufficient, and it shall never be erased from my memory. I pray that God may increase your life and glory and prosperity every day.

I remain obedient to your command.

It has been ordained for you to fast for God for three consecutive days, and at noon each day to turn toward the Qiblih in the presence of the Light of Identity and supplicate God with these verses, that He may through His bounty forgive you and expiate your evil deeds and guide you to the straight path:

In the Name of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Compelling!

Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou art He Who created the heavens through the Pen of Thy creation and the earth through the breaths of the Tablets of Thy invention, and formed between them from the formations of Thy Identity according to the measures of Thy eternal craftsmanship, and turned upon them from the cycles of Thy Lordship that which Thou didst specially ordain for them from the essences of the manifestations of the might of Thy sovereignty. Thou didst send the winds of love from the right hand of Thy will and cause the rains of providence to descend from the clouds of the bounty of Thy generosity, and didst mix this living, life-giving sweet water with this holy, luminous earth. Then were the hearts of all existent things stirred within the vestures of Thy creation, and the bones of all created things were quickened by the wonders of Thy power, and the hearts of them that are nigh unto Thee were bewildered by the essences of Thy grace, and the minds of the sincere were attracted by the melodies of Thy rapture. Then did the signs of Thy power appear in all things according to their ranks and capacities, that the corrupt might be distinguished from the good in their turning toward Thee or away from Thee. Thus did sanctified souls turn toward the Sun of Thy Beauty while darkened hearts turned away from the Kaaba of Thy Being and the sanctuary of Thy grandeur.

Thereafter didst Thou cause this water to descend from the heaven of Thy leave upon the earth of Thy decree, and didst nurture it in the treasuries of Thy protection and the repositories of Thy power, until through Thy bounty Thou didst manifest me and through Thy mercy raise me up, and didst nourish me from the milk of Thy generosity and feed me from the blessings of Thy good-pleasure and give me to drink from the rivers of Thy favors and the seas of Thy glory. And I grew to maturity for the manifestation of Thy power and the revelation of Thy might. Then didst Thou raise me to the clouds of the heaven and the Lote-Tree of the uttermost boundary, until Thou didst honor me with Thy beauty and cause me to know the Manifestation of Thy Self and the Sun of Thy guidance and the stars of Thy exaltation, and didst bring me to the station of nearness and beauty and cause me to attain unto the degrees of union and majesty. Thereafter didst Thou honor me with Thy supreme bounty and settle me in the precincts of Thy most exalted mercy and shelter me beneath the shadow of Thy most beautiful names.

Yet in all this was I heedless of Thy remembrance and far removed from the gardens of Thy nearness and forgetful of the wonders of Thy tenderness and the essences of Thy loving-kindness, until I did what I did and earned what I earned, such that I transgressed against Thee in a manner whereby I showed no shame in Thy presence and no embarrassment before Thy beauty, and committed that which befitteth not Thy sovereignty, and grew heedless of Thy love and occupied myself with that which Thou hadst forbidden to Thy servants. Alas for me and for those who are like me and who walk in my path! It is as though I disobeyed Thee with every disobedience, O Thou in Whose hand is the dominion of forgiveness and pardon! In all this was I occupied with myself and heedless of Thy Self, turning toward my own desires and turning away from Thy desire and will, until I reached a station wherein I went astray from the paths of Thy guidance and the ways of Thy commandments.

Then, O my God, did I return from all this unto Thee, disappointed, in loss, remorseful and abased, and I beseech Thee by the Sun of Thy Oneness and the Light of Thy Eternity and the Pavilion of the glory of Thy concealment, that Thou show mercy unto me and forgive me and pardon me and take me not to task for that which Thou hast reckoned from me and that which Thou hast witnessed of my deeds. Verily Thou art the Merciful, the Forgiving, the Bountiful, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Compassionate.

Thus hath the star of joy risen and the cup of gladness circled round in these days wherein sorrows have encompassed Us through that which the hands of the transgressors have wrought. Blessed art thou and blessed is thy letter which testified to that which thou dost manifest in the Cause of thy Lord, the Most High, the Great.

My grief is not for that which hath befallen My own Self. By God! The Ancient Beauty doth not shrink from tribulations. Indeed, He hath found solace in them in the path of God, the Almighty, the Powerful. But observe, then mention that We had forbidden all from shedding blood, as all the Tablets bear witness, and thou art among those who know. Wickedness hath reached such a degree that the Pen of the Most High suddenly cried out with the most exalted call between earth and heaven, after the doors of attainment to His presence were closed: "The necks have been stretched forth in hypocrisy. Where are Thy swords of vengeance, O Destroyer of the worlds?" When the verses were sent down, all things were shaken. Therefore We took hold of the reins of power with authority from Our presence. Yet there leaked what leaked and appeared what appeared. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp of power lie the reins of the worlds.

O My Name! We forbade all people from such matters. The fire of wickedness became so inflamed that there occurred what occurred in numbered years. Continuously We kept those vile souls protected beneath the cloak of protection. Yet they found no rest, manifesting corruption and sedition each day. The matter reached such a point that We withdrew from all and closed the doors of association. The angels of divine wrath seized them suddenly and made them a lesson to the worlds. The All-Merciful did not have mercy on their graves. This occurred suddenly. Were you to hear the details, you would testify that the Hand of God's power seized them - no one else had any part in it, nor will they. Pure power was manifested from the presence of a Mighty, Powerful One.

Thou didst mention the captives of God. Their letter came into the presence of the Face. We found the fragrance of the garment of the Name of thy Lord, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, from the direction of Khartoum. They have always been and will continue to be before Our sight. Remember them on My behalf and convey My glory to them from this Wronged One, this Stranger. In these days more than this is not permitted. If stability is achieved in this land, We shall send to them what thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the Wise, hath desired.

Convey My glory to Javad. We have sent to him what was previously revealed for him that he may find from it the fragrance of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Then mention him who is named Muhammad and give him the glad-tidings of the remembrance of the All-Merciful, that he may be among those who rejoice. There hath come into the presence of the Most Great Scene what was sent to thee from Shin and Jim. We beseech God to make them among those who guide others to His remembrance among the worlds, and manifestations of steadfastness among creation, and dawning-places of righteousness among creatures. He is verily the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Wise.

As for what thou didst explicitly inquire about regarding Jula, say: He hath returned to the lowest depths, by the Lord of the worlds! But the difference between them is not slight. The first Jula who was before and about whom the example was struck was truly wretched, wretched. But the second one is accursed, accursed. The glory of God be upon thee and upon those whom God hath aided to His firm and wise Cause.

Baha'u'llah's Tablet Commemorating the Anniversary of the Declaration of the Bab

He is the Ever-Abiding, the Most Great, the Most Exalted!

Lo! The Tongue is calling aloud and the Word hath lifted up its Voice, proclaiming: The Kingdom is God's, the Creator of the heavens, the Lord of Names; yet the generality of mankind is sunk in heedlessness. All creation hath been carried away by the sweet melody of the All-Merciful and the realms of sanctity are redolent of the fragrance of His raiment and the Most Great Name hath shed the splendour of His effulgent glory upon all the dwellers of the world; but the people are obscured by a palpable veil.

O Pen of Glory! Raise thou the tune of the celestial strains, for We inhale the sweet savours of reunion, inasmuch as the Day is at hand in which the kingdom of names is embellished with the ornament of Our Name, the Most August, the Most Exalted -- a Name which no sooner was it mentioned before the Throne than the Maids of Heaven broke into songs of divine melody and the heavenly Dove warbled its wondrous notes and the Tongue of the Merciful Lord proclaimed that which hath enraptured the souls of the messengers, of the pure in heart and of them that enjoy near access unto God.

This is the Night from the orient of whose Day the Morn of Eternity hath dawned and the whole world hath been illumined by the splendour of its light, shining forth above this radiant Horizon.

Say, verily this is the Day in which God hath entered into a covenant concerning Him Who proclaimeth the Truth when He sent forth the One bearing unto mankind the tidings of this Great Announcement. This is the Day in which His mighty Sign hath appeared, magnifying the glory of this inestimable Name; the Day in which the entire creation hath been enravished by the reviving breeze of the Verses of God. Happy is he that hath recognized his Lord and is numbered with the blissful.

Say, He is the most perfect Balance amongst nations. Through Him the measure assigned unto everything hath been revealed by virtue of the Will of the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Men of discernment, inebriated with the choice wine of His utterance, have rent the veils asunder through the sovereign might of My Name which pervadeth all mankind.

He consecrated the Bayan as a leaf unto this Garden and adorned it with the praise of this incomparable Remembrance. He hath exhorted men not to withhold themselves from the Day-Spring of Ancient Glory, nor to cling unto such tales and traditions as are current amongst them at the time of His appearance. Thus the decree was fulfilled in conformity with what He hath enunciated. Unto this beareth witness He Who proclaimeth the Truth: Verily, no God is there besides Me, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.

They that turn away from the Latter Manifestation have indeed failed to recognize the First One; thus hath it been ordained by the Causer of the causes, He Who is now manifest in this glorious raiment. He did herald the tidings of this Root amidst you, wherefore they who have deprived themselves by reason of the twig are truly numbered with the dead. The twig is that which people set their hearts upon and thus turn their backs to God, the Supreme Ruler, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised.

He conditioned everything He hath revealed by My good pleasure and made every commandment subservient unto this irrefutable, this undoubted Commandment. Had it not been for My sake He would not have uttered a single word, nor would have He manifested Himself before the gaze of the dwellers of heavens and earth. How often did He lament over My captivity, My imprisonment, My tribulations! That which is sent down in the Bayan doth amply testify unto this; would that ye know it. Powerful indeed is the man who through the might of God hath severed himself from all else but Him and powerless is the one who turned away from His face when He did appear, invested with manifest dominion.

O people of the earth! It behooveth you to magnify the Name of God in this Day -- the Day in which the Spirit hath unloosed His tongue and the souls of such as were brought into being through the operation of the Word of God, the Mighty, the Exalted, eagerly yearn to wing their flight.

It beseemeth everyone in this Day to rejoice with exceeding gladness, to attire himself with exquisite garment, celebrate the praise of his Lord and yield thanksgiving unto Him by virtue of this great favour. Blessed is he that hath apprehended the purpose of God and woe betide the heedless.

Since this Tablet hath been revealed in this Night, We fain would wish to send it unto thee as a token of Our grace, that thou mayest be of the grateful. Once thou hast perused it, recite it in the presence of the loved ones of God, that they, one and all, may hearken unto that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered and may be of them that act accordingly. Thus have We singled thee out and attired thee with that wherewith the temples of the pure in heart are attired.

All glory be unto God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is the Comforter, the Consoler, the Exalted, the Most Glorious

Glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the King of names, for that Thou hast converted joy into vexation, and pitched the tent of sorrows during Thy festival of Ridvan. I swear by Thy glory! I repine not at that which hath befallen Me in Thy path. By Thy name, O Thou Who art the Lord of all names! Tribulation borne for love of Thee is, verily, My cherished wish, the goal of My desire, and the solace of Mine heart; yet do I long to announce unto the world that from the Lote Tree of Fidelity the Most Exalted Fruit hath fallen, inasmuch as it was compassed by tempestuous winds blowing from the right hand of Thy decree, and smitten by the assault of Thine appointment as inscribed by the Pen of Thy behest. O My Lord! The sea of troubles hath surged during the days of Thy happiness, and the fragrance of sorrows hath wafted even in the day of Thy blissful joy. Hath the refulgent orb of Thy Name Ha' set beneath the horizon of Sad, or is he still in the clutches of the enemies, who have cast away Thy Testament, O Thou Who art the Possessor of all names? O Land of Sad! Doth My Name yet walk upon thy surface, or hath there reposed within thy womb a trust from Me? O insensate land! How canst thou be still, when the very ocean is concealed within thee? And how canst thou be illumined, when the refulgent orb hath set beneath thy horizon? O Land of Sad! Where is thy lamp, and where thy straight path? Where is God's overflowing fount within thee, and where the Lote Tree whose shade God had made a shelter unto all that resorted thither, or sought it out, or chanced upon it in their travels? I swear by God! O My Name Ha'! By reason of thine agony the Pen of the Most High hath halted; the dwellers of the Cities of the Names of God have lamented; and the hearts of His chosen ones have melted. Thou art he who accepted not a ransom in the love of God, the Lord of this world and of the next; and repeatedly craved of God that which actually befell him. Thou art the Most Great Ransom in the Crimson Book. Did the people think that they had gained by their transaction? Nay, by Him Who is the King of Names! God is My witness that they suffered a loss such as hath had no equal in the knowledge of God, the Lord of the throne above and of earth below. The Tongue of Grandeur testifieth that it is thou who hast gained by this transaction. Nay by My life! All gain is thine, inasmuch as thou hast quit the earth, whose every atom beareth witness unto its evanescence; hast set thy face towards the dawning-place of eternity; and hast yielded thy life in thy yearning for the love of God, the Creator of the heavens and the Lord of all names. By thy life, O My Name! By reason of thine agony the afflictions of the saints have been effaced, and the eyes of God's chosen ones and the Celestial Concourse have run down with tears. It hath reached such a pass that He Who is the Manifestation of God's Ancient Beauty among the nations hath been sorrowed. Wert thou present before this Wronged One in thine outward temple, and didst behold in what condition the Pen of the Most High recounteth thine afflictions, thou wouldst wail even as a bereaved mother in the kingdom of creation. Alas, alas, O My Name Ha'! And again alas, alas, O My Name that shineth above the horizon of fidelity! And yet again, alas I cry, with a fervour such as to cause oceans to well forth from the eyes, and the hearts and souls to melt. Thou art he through whom the tale of the Sacrifice (Ishmael) hath been retold, and that which had been hidden in the knowledge of God, and written in His Mighty Book, hath come to pass. O Land of Sad! Speak true, I prithee, and tell Me, Where is the She-Camel of God, that trod thy byways and grazed in thy fair pastures? Doth she still graze today, or hath she been hamstrung by the enemies of God, and by the enemies of His chosen ones and His servants? Then tell Me, did she drink and ascend, or did she suffer martyrdom whilst parched, and so ascend unto the Abha Horizon and the realms above? Then tell Me, left she anyone behind to guard her home; to gather together her kin; to calm their trepidation; to fortify their hearts; to comfort them in their distress; and to console them in their grief and sorrow? Thou must needs in such a case, and at this very moment, repeat: The Kingdom is God's the Lord of the worlds! Verily, we are God's, and unto Him shall we indeed return.

He is the Speaker in the Kingdom of Utterance!

We have come for the sake of remembrance, and Our remembrance is to remind the servants toward the One Who is remembered. When We turned from the most exalted horizon toward the realm of creation, We opened the gates of counsel with the key of wisdom and reminded all of that which is the cause and means of lofty stations. Blessed is the soul who has purified itself from the desires of self and passion with the Kawthar of counsel of the Lord of Names, and has aimed for the supreme height and ultimate goal. One must strive for the reformation of the world and purification of the nations. In the early days We showed the people of the earth the way and guided them to the straight path and the mighty announcement. Some, upon hearing the call, turned immediately to the most exalted horizon, sanctified from all that is unworthy of God's days, while others remained afflicted with the chains of idle fancies and vain imaginings. We beseech God not to deprive any from the ocean of His mercy and to aid them as befitteth. Verily He is powerful over all things. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, the All-Informed.

O friend! God willing, thou shalt be enkindled with the heat of divine love. Today is the master of days. Ask God to aid thee in a deed whose mention shall endure in God's Book. The Trustee, upon him be My glory, mentioned thee, and likewise the friends of that land. Therefore the Supreme Pen turned from the direction of the Prison and adorned each one with the ornament of remembrance. O Baba! Praise be to God that thou hast turned to Him in days when most of the people of the earth have turned away from the Sun of Truth. Say: My God, my God! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned to the ocean of Thy grace and the horizon of the heaven of Thy bounty, and I acknowledge Thy oneness and Thy singleness and what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. I beseech Thee by Thy light wherewith Thou hast illumined the world and guided the nations to aid me in all conditions to remember Thee and praise Thee and serve Thy loved ones. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.

O Sha'ban! Thy name was present before the Wronged One. God mentioneth all and commandeth what is right, and hath counseled and doth counsel to trustworthiness and godliness and praiseworthy character and goodly deeds and that whereby the station of man is exalted. Blessed is the soul who hath heard the call and acted upon what was commanded, and is recorded among those who have turned to God in His Book. Say: My God, my God! I have turned to Thee. I beseech Thee by the Manifestations of Thy sovereignty and the Daysprings of Thy might and the Sources of Thy Command and the Rising-places of Thy verses to make me steadfast in Thy love and gazing toward Thy horizon and holding fast to Thy mighty cord. There is no God but Thee, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O Ali! Give thanks to God that thy name hath flowed from His Most Exalted Pen, which calleth out with the most great call between earth and heaven: The gate of meeting hath been opened and the Lord of Names hath come with clear authority. Praise the Goal of the world Who hath aided thee and guided thee to His straight path. Thy mention is remembered and thy name is recorded. God, exalted be His glory, hath been and is aware. Ask Him for steadfastness and be occupied with serving His loved ones. Verily He heard what thy tongue uttered and saw thy turning to Him. He turned to thee and remembered thee with this clear remembrance. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the Name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Holy.

The purpose of the assistance mentioned in all the Tablets hath been and still is well known to the loved ones of God. The Truth, exalted be His mention, is sanctified above this world and whatsoever is therein, and by assistance was never meant that anyone should contend or dispute with any soul. The King of Glory hath committed the kingdom of earth, both land and sea, unto the kings, for they are the manifestations of divine power, each according to his degree. Should they enter beneath the shadow of the True One, they will be accounted of God, otherwise thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. That which God - exalted be His mention - hath desired for Himself are the hearts of His servants, which are the treasuries of His mystical revelation and the depositories of His divine love. The eternal King's everlasting purpose hath been to cleanse the hearts from the promptings of the world and all that is therein, that they may become worthy to receive the effulgent splendors of the sovereign of names and attributes. Thus no stranger should be allowed admittance into the city of the heart, that the Friend may hasten to His own abode - that is, the effulgence of His beauty, and not His essence or reality, for that hath ever been, and shall ever be, sanctified from ascent or descent. Therefore, to assist God's Cause in this day doth not and shall never mean to engage in opposition and contention or conflict with any soul. Rather, what is preferable is that the cities of men's hearts should be conquered through the sword of wisdom and of utterance, and not through the sword of iron. Thus should anyone desire to assist the Cause of God, let him first conquer the city of his own heart with the sword of spiritual truth and of expression, cleanse it from all things save God, and then turn towards the cities of others' hearts. This is the meaning of assisting God's Cause that hath dawned from the horizon of the finger of the King of Names. Corruption hath never been pleasing and never shall be, and whatever occurred in the past happened without God's leave. In brief, in this day the loved ones of God must appear among men in such wise that through their deeds they may guide all to the good-pleasure of the Lord of Glory. By the Sun of the morn of sanctity! Never have the Truth and His loved ones who are attributed to Him regarded, nor will they ever regard, the earth and its transient riches. For had the purpose been to take possession of the earth, He was assuredly able and powerful enough and could have conquered the whole world with a single word. But He hath given sovereignty to sovereigns, wisdom to the discerning, knowledge to the learned, and reserved for Himself the love of the hearts of His servants, and naught else doth He regard, nor will He ever regard aught else. And this too is by virtue of His supreme grace, that perchance mortal souls may be cleansed from earthly conditions and attain the everlasting station which is the paradise of divine unity. Otherwise, that Pre-existent King hath ever been, in His own Essence, independent of all things. No benefit accrues to Him from the love of contingent things, nor can any harm befall Him from their enmity. All emerged from earthly places and unto Him shall all return, while that Ancient Beauty remaineth in His own station, alone and single, sanctified above place and time, mention and description, indication and allusion, exaltation and abasement. None knoweth this save those endowed with insight and perception.

Your letter reached this servant and after being presented, the Most Exalted Tongue spoke these lustrous words: That which you saw in your dream was mentioned in the presence. As for what you mentioned about seeing in heaven flowers, blossoms and stars - these indicate the manifestations of your Lord's favors and the expressions of His power. Soon their signs will appear on earth such that mention of your Lord's name, the Most High, the Great, will encompass it. And what you drank from the cup - it was connected to the Most Great Ocean which has no end. This is evidence of your Lord's grace toward you, and He has ordained for you from this ocean that which will never be exhausted, throughout the duration of your Lord's kingdom. Just as you drank and found no end to it, blessed are you in what has been ordained for you of that ever-flowing, enduring, remaining, mighty, impregnable Kawthar. Soon God will give life through what has flowed from it to the hearts of His servants and will draw them near to Him and cause them to recognize the Dawning Place of His Essence, Who speaks with truth: There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. As for what you saw of Our turning toward the mosque - this indicates the latter manifestation and the spreading of your Lord's verses and the gathering of people unto what He desires, even though in these days veils of idle fancies have covered the people and the Word has been lost through what was earned by the hands of those who have left God's party - your Lord and the Lord of the worlds. But soon will come a day when the melodies of the Dove of Utterance will be raised with the most wondrous tunes and the loftiness of this Cause which has been exalted in truth will become manifest. Verily your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

They have submitted two petitions which were not accepted at all. From the Land of Mystery they have repented nine times and it was accepted, yet they have not become aware. They have ever been engaged in hypocrisy, but in these days their veils have been rent asunder through what they have earned by their desires from among the idolaters. Convey greetings from Us to Mansur and then to Husayn - upon them be the glory of God, the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful. God willing, regarding what you have been commanded concerning teaching, when its time comes We shall instruct you about it. Act with the utmost wisdom and let not a single word contrary to this issue forth from your tongue. Thus have you been commanded in truth - be among those who act accordingly. End.

I convey infinite greetings to all. God willing, you are and will continue to be in the utmost joy. A quatrain was mentioned for all - God willing you will recite it and never forget it:

O you who in separation have life upon your lips

With hosts of remembrance of the Friend within your frames

And in the shell of your breast keep pure

Love for the Friend's face through days and nights

In the Name of the Peerless Lord!

Your letter reached this Wronged One in the Most Great Prison and was seen. The Cause of Truth has ever shone like the sun from the horizon of glory - the eclipse of people's vain imaginings has not and will never overtake it. Colocynth has never been confused with honey. Every possessor of hearing and smell can perceive the song of the nightingale and the fragrance of the rose. You wrote that your letter went unanswered and was delayed. Know this much: the purpose of this servant is that all on earth should gather together in perfect love and unity at the divine stream of His Cause. Pride and vainglory have no place here. For God's sake have We spoken what We have spoken, and for His sake have We been afflicted with countless imprisonments and tribulations. If you would reflect a little on what has come to pass, you would testify to what is recorded in this leaf. And as for what you wrote about this servant considering those not his followers to be polytheists - God forbid! Rather, those souls who are heedless of Truth and turn to other than Him are, by the testimony of the divine Books, polytheists and ever shall be. Consider what the All-Merciful has revealed in the Qur'an that you may be assured I speak only what God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, has spoken. You also wrote that if the matter rests on imitation, Abu Dharr and Salman the Persian are more worthy of being imitated since their excellence is universally acknowledged. If you follow this reasoning, you should not go beyond the scroll of Adam and cling to him, for all peoples - Jews, Christians, Muslims and most of the world's communities - accept him. And after him you should cling only to Moses and the Torah, for most people on earth have agreed upon them. But as for Salman and Abu Dharr, none but the Islamic sect accepts them. Now consider by what proof you passed beyond that which all agree upon - what was that proof and which path did you take? We say no more. He has said: "An hour's reflection is better than seventy years of worship." This is the Day of the appearance of the blessed Word that says: "Say: God; then leave them to their vain discourses." Hear the counsel of this Wronged One Who speaks for God's sake and has no purpose save this, for most of His life He has been afflicted and has sought no helper save God. Were you to turn to things with the ear of innate nature, you would hear their sighing, their crying and their weeping. Reflect on the state of the world and its changes and extinction. Ask God to guide you to a matter whose traces will endure permanently on earth. Be not distressed at the delay in reply. Affairs have their appointed times. Moreover, no obligation rests upon a bird imprisoned in a cage. God willing, you will rend asunder the veils of fancy and attain the station of certitude. This is the station where the imagined is effaced and the known appears. The Cause is in His hand - He gives what He wishes to whom He wishes and withholds from whom He wishes what He wills. He is verily the Protector, the Mighty, the Transcendent, the Glorious, the Praiseworthy.

In the Name of the one God! The letter of that faithful friend arrived. Since it conveyed your health and well-being, it brought joy. We beseech God to assist you in that which will endure and persist.

Regarding what you wrote about the burning of books, you are right. The greatest error that occurred in the world was the burning of books, for books are as the eyes and ears of the world - through them humanity sees and hears. In truth, they deprived themselves of seeing and hearing. We testify that they are among the heedless.

You also wrote that after the Sassanians, the star of the fortune of the Zoroastrians set in the west of extinction. Outwardly it is as you wrote, but today is the Day illumined by the Sun of Truth. The fragrance of His utterance is diffused and the breeze of His grace is wafting throughout all regions. He is seated upon the throne of justice and established upon the seat of manifestation, speaking with the word "I am the Wronged One." Though possessed of ultimate power He appears weak, and though having complete might and ascendancy He is oppressed. Today the Zoroastrians circle round the Manifestation of the command of the All-Merciful. The meaning is the same as before though the word has changed, the way is the same though the name has been transformed. This change and transformation has appeared due to the change of the world and the requirements of the time.

You mentioned the world conquest of ancient kings. Their sovereignty was and is acceptable in the sight of the Lord of the world. The kings of Persia who existed in times of old ruled for centuries, ages and eras with perfect forbearance and piety, and each shone like the morning star in the heaven of greatness, and from the rays of the sun of justice the world was, according to its capacity, illumined and radiant. For the kings of the world there has not been and is not any helper mightier than justice and wisdom. Some time ago this utterance was recorded by the Pen of truth in a heavenly letter in the Arabic tongue: "O concourse of rulers! There is no force in the world mightier than justice and wisdom. Blessed is the king before whose face marcheth the standard of wisdom and behind whom standeth the host of justice. He is indeed of the people of Baha and hath been in the Crimson Book recorded by the Supreme Pen in truth."

O friend! The pavilion of the world's tranquility is upheld by these two pillars: justice and wisdom. Say: O people! Wisdom is like unto heaven - its sun and moon are forbearance and piety. Whosoever possesseth these two hath all good.

O friend! In these days when the bird of knowledge is caught in the talons of the ignorant, and the lights of the sun of fairness are hidden behind the veil of tyranny, where is there opportunity for speech or station for expression? Today concealment is necessary, for the birds of night are beyond counting and all seek darkness. In such case there is no station or rank for light. But the hand of divine power is manifest and supreme - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful.

The book also arrived and was seen. Praise be to God, you executed it well. It contains exhortations, counsels, wisdom and morals. We beseech God that it may remind souls and grant them awareness. God willing, may the Lord assist you to serve His Cause and attain the enduring fruits of the Tree of His mention.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Mighty

Your letter arrived. Praise be to God that we dwell beneath the shade of His grace and are blessed with the fruit of His bounty. God willing, may you ever ascend to the heaven of holiness and stations of intimacy, and remain seated and at rest upon the throne of love for the Peerless Lord and the Beauty of Glory. And then, certain statements were heard from the people of that land which caused me great astonishment, for if someone makes mention of this servant, this should not cause discord, since it is clear and evident that this servant has no mention or command of his own. Rather, discord is removed through this servant, as happened this year. I had supposed that the friends there, due to this great tribulation that befell me, would demonstrate perfect friendship and love, not that because of the words of a lying accursed one who has believed in no Lord, all these vain and meaningless statements would be made and repeated. Although the Book of Light was sent, they did not even read it once to become aware and thus avoid making such statements. Now all must become aware, and this lowly, insignificant servant who has been imprisoned several times, been seized, and finally become rejected by the servants and banished from lands, can no longer bear the transgression of the companions. After all, some measure of mercy and justice should be found in the world. I swear by God that never has there been nor is there any thought except servitude. However, since matters have now reached this point, mention must necessarily be made so that it may cause people to become aware. As for the verses revealed in the Book of Light, His Holiness Himself sent all of them to Mirza Rida-Quli, may God's blessings be upon him. Among them is this: "God has ordained much good for thee and preferred thee above those who have believed in God's signs, that thou mayest be well-pleased with God thy Lord and recite what God reveals unto thee," etc. And in another place He says: "We have commanded those who have believed in God's signs to follow thy word in thy Lord's Cause, and We have made thee a warner from Our presence that thou mayest cast knowledge and wisdom into the hearts of these," etc. And there are many more such verses. Now judge fairly - were these statements proper that were made in gatherings and spread among people, even though in all of Light there is no mention of anyone from among the divines and martyrs except this servant? God willing this will be seen. My purpose in this argument is not to establish rank, and I swear by God that I am not worthy of such mentions, but I say this that perhaps the servants may become mindful and not make statements according to the promptings of self. The choice is yours. And peace be upon whoever follows guidance. If they would only understand these two verses, it would suffice for all in the heavens and earth. Otherwise the solid rock can never perceive or touch the Holy Spirit. Since whatever occurs in that land is seen through your eyes, as you have authority over all of them, therefore these few words were ventured. Please forgive me.

O Mulla 'Abdu'r-Razzaq, in the Qaf

In the Name of God, the Most Wondrous, the Most Wondrous

This is a Book which hath been sent down in truth, that through it the light of God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful, may shine forth in the hearts of them that have believed. O servant! Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the direction of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, that through thy Lord's revelation there may arise that which will establish thee in the assistance of God and His remembrance, and sever thee from them that have disbelieved and joined partners with God and were among the heedless. By God! Whoso hearkeneth today unto the words of his Lord with the ear of his heart will be so attracted that he will never turn to the world and all that is therein, nor will aught but the remembrance of God, the True King, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, ever rest within his soul. Ascend the ladder of inner meanings unto that station which none hath entered save he who hath witnessed the sovereignty of his Lord and His all-encompassing power over all worlds. Purify thy soul and heart from those who affirm their faith in 'Ali through what was revealed unto him of the verses of God, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, yet when His verses are recited unto them once again, they object to them and are not among those who perceive. Soon will the clamor of the idolaters be raised in that place, and shouldst thou hear their uproar, be not perturbed in thy soul, but turn away from them and set thy face toward the sanctuary of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and be not of the perplexed. Drink the Kawthar of steadfastness and assurance from the wellspring of thy Lord's words, that it may attract thee to a station wherein the souls of the agitated find peace. Say: O people! By God, the entire Bayan was revealed in My remembrance and praise. Be ye ashamed before God Who created you by His command and gave you glad tidings of this resplendent, luminous Beauty. Fear God, O people, and deny not Him Who hath come to you from the direction of the Spirit with a most great, mighty Name, and Who summoneth you at all times unto God, your Creator, desiring from you no recompense, for His reward is with God, the Powerful, the Most High, the All-Knowing. O people! Be fair in the Cause of God and deny not His verses, and follow not the ways of the oppressors who utter falsehoods against God, then proclaim within themselves that they may cause the matter to appear dubious unto the servants, and thus do they plot at every moment and instant. And thou, O servant, purify thy sight from gazing upon aught except Me, and sanctify thy heart from turning to anyone besides Me. Beware lest thou exchange the choice wine of My loving-kindness for scalding water. Leave the idolaters to themselves, then ascend at all times unto God, and verily He is with thee and heareth and seeth thy condition, and He is the Friend of the righteous. Then make mention from Us of thy brother Mahdi and give him the glad tidings of Our remembrance of him, that he may be of them that rejoice. Say: O servant! Whenever thou findest thyself in thy native land, remember this Exile in this strange land. Then convey Our greetings unto thy other brother who is named 'Abdu'llah, that he may remember within his soul and be among them that are firmly established in the Cause of Him Who hath appeared with the truth, from Whom every wicked sinner hath turned away. We beseech God to assist thee and them both in praising His Self and to nourish you from the fruits of the Tree of His loving-kindness and shelter you beneath the shade of His mercy which hath preceded all worlds. And the spirit and glory and splendor be upon you and upon your father and upon whoso is with you in your house, and verily when the breezes of holiness blow from the direction of grace, they take hold of everyone, young and old. And praise be to God, the Creator of all beings.

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted! This is a noble Book sent down in truth from the presence of One mighty and all-knowing. Verily it is the Spirit of the Command through which the hearts of them that know are quickened, and verily it is the Lamp of God between the heavens and the earths, and verily it is a mercy and remembrance for all the worlds. O Mim, hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, from the direction of His Name, the Most High, the Most Great. He calleth thee from the prison at a time when entrance and exit are forbidden, due to that which the hands of the transgressors have wrought. Soon shall the prison door be opened - thus doth thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, apprise thee. He loveth tribulation in the path of His Lord even as they that are sincere love the countenance of their Lord, the Dawning, the Luminous. Sorrows have not prevented Us from remembering the name of Our Lord, the All-Merciful, nor shall the might of the oppressors prevent Me. Remember Him at all times and summon the people unto Him - thus hast thou been commanded by One mighty and powerful. O Ha', hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the Most Glorious. Arise to serve the Cause, then remind the people of this momentous News, that perchance they may arise from the slumber of vain desires and turn towards the supreme horizon in these days wherein the Sun of the beauty of thy Lord hath dawned upon all created things with manifest sovereignty. Be thou of such constancy that the vicissitudes of time prevent thee not from the direction of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, that thy face may shine amongst Our heedless servants. Confine thy affairs to His remembrance and praise, then gather the people unto the Most Great Ocean - thus hath the Tongue of Revelation commanded thee from this remote prison. O Mim, hearken once again unto the call of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. He speaketh the truth: "Verily I am God, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Bestower." Arise to serve the Cause, then stand firm and say: "O people! The heaven hath been folded up, and the moon hath been cleft asunder, and the All-Glorious hath come upon the clouds of divine knowledge. Fear God and break not God's Covenant and Testament. Hasten to the Kawthar of grace - this is better for you than all that hath been created in existence." Behold those who were unjust of old - their traces have been effaced, their roofs have fallen in, and their couches have been rolled up until the flames encompassed them. Soon shall the breezes of torment seize these who have denied God. Verily thy Lord is severe in punishment, and He is the Mighty, the Help in Peril. O Letter Dal! Call the people with wisdom and utterance - thus have We commanded the servants in all the Tablets, yet most of them understand not. They cast the Command of God behind their backs until sedition seized all regions, and thy Lord witnessed what they did. Had they followed God's Command it would have been better for them than what they desired. Soon will He raise up His Cause as He pleaseth - there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Make mention of My loved ones on My behalf, then bring them beneath the shadow of thy Lord's mercy, the Mighty, the Loving. Say: O My loved ones! The Pen hath been prevented from remembrance, and behind Me are an oppressive people - otherwise I would have sent down for each one of you verses from the All-Merciful from this praiseworthy station. Be ye united in the Cause of your Lord, then hearken unto him who remindeth you by Our leave, and hold fast in all conditions to the Sure Handle, and trust in Him at all times. He is with you and will aid you with His sovereignty, and with Him is the knowledge of all things, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Make mention of the worshipper on Our behalf - his name was mentioned at this moment before the Throne, therefore hath the Pen inscribed his name. Thy Lord is possessed of great bounty. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most High!

This is a Book from Us to him who has turned to his Lord, the All-Merciful, in these days wherein all who dwell in the realm of possibility have been shaken, save those who have cast away vain desire and taken unto themselves guidance, in the name of their Lord, the Possessor of Names, Who hath come from heaven with manifest sovereignty that the fragrances of the verses may draw him to the summit of names and attributes and bring him to a station wherein he ariseth to aid the Cause of his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Wise.

Arise to serve the Cause by thy Lord's leave, then guide the people in His Name, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Beware lest anything prevent thee from that which thou hast been bidden by One powerful and ancient. Say: O people! The call hath been raised from the Divine Lote-Tree, and that which ye were promised in the Tablets from the Cleaver of Dawn hath appeared. Turn with your hearts toward the direction of the Beloved - this is better for you than all that hath been created in the heavens and earths.

Say: He was hidden in His Essence, but when He desired its manifestation He revealed the Manifestation of His Self and sent forth the Dawning-Place of His Cause, through Whom the horizon of utterance was illumined and the Dove sang upon the branches and the Spirit cried out from the heart of Paradise: "The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Inaccessible!"

Turn not unto those who are moved by their desires. We testify that they are drowned in the ocean of vain imaginings, and every informed one doth witness this. They are as dead before God, the Lord of the First and the Last. Leave them in their idle fancies and hold fast unto the Cord of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Beautiful.

Arise to serve the Cause through God's might and power. Say: O people! Obey him who calleth you unto truth and follow not the footsteps of Satan. Aid ye the All-Merciful through utterance and turn unto Him Who hath arisen amongst the servants to exalt the Word of your Lord, the Master of the Day of Judgment. Be fair - by what proof can your faith be established if ye deny? They are indeed confuted, unless they return and repent. Verily thy Lord is the Ever-Forgiving, the Pardoner, the Merciful.

Thus have We sent down the verses that thine eyes may be solaced thereby and that thou mayest stand firm in thy Lord's Cause in such wise as to summon the servants through this Great Name. Say: By God! All things have spoken in praise of the Lord of Names, and the Ocean of Pre-existence hath surged with this wise Remembrance. Cast aside all peoples, for the Lord of all peoples hath come with mighty sovereignty.

Gird up thy loins to serve God and remember Him. He will verily aid thee through the truth. He is, in truth, powerful over all things. From the heart of whoso desireth to make mention of Him this day shall flow springs of wisdom and utterance. Verily thy Lord, the All-Merciful, ordaineth what He pleaseth for whom He pleaseth and decreeth what He willeth for whom He desireth.

Confine thy affairs to the remembrance of God and the promotion of His Cause. This will profit thee in this world and the next. Thy Lord is, in truth, knowing of all things. It behooveth him who hath turned toward the Point of Existence to cast behind him all that is in the hands of men. This is the truth, and beyond truth there is naught but manifest error.

Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Intended One and believed in God after every froward polytheist turned away. Give thanks unto thy Lord for having sent down unto thee that which shall immortalize thy mention throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. This is indeed a great bounty.

Make mention of thy son from Us and convey unto him the greetings from this lonely Wronged One, that he may be stirred by the breezes of thy Lord's loving-kindness and become of the sincere ones. And upon thee and thy family be the glory of thy Lord, the Speaker, the True, the Mighty, the Trusted One. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the Name of God, the Most Mighty, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!

This is a Book from the presence of Baha to him whom God hath preserved in these days from the fire of self and passion, and hath aided to recognize His Self, and hath made him to be numbered among those who are assured in the Tablets, and hath detached him from all else save Him, and hath given him to drink of the cup of everlasting life from this Countenance which hath been illumined from all eternity with the lights of God. Blessed art thou, O servant, inasmuch as the breath of God hath quickened thee and the breezes of the Spirit have stirred thee and turned thee from the left hand of fancy to the right hand of certitude, and hath provided thee with the fruits of the Tree which was manifest in the form of man in very truth. Thus doth God preserve whom He willeth of His servants and aid those who seek His help through a sovereignty that encompasseth all worlds. And thou, O servant, give thanks unto thy Lord for having bestowed upon thee that which made thee independent in His recognition from all who are in the heavens and on earth, and caused the dove of longing to warble in thy breast, and brought thee nigh unto a holy and exalted shore. Know thou that they who opposed God prevented thee from that which thou didst desire in His path, and this was an injustice from their own selves against the Self of the All-Merciful - and My Self, the True One, is witness unto what I say. Grieve not thou at this, but be content with what God hath ordained in His Cause. Then aid Him as thou art able, and tarry not in His aid even for a moment. Place thy trust in all things in God and sorrow not for aught, for He shall manifest whatsoever He willeth and desireth, and He is indeed the Observer of all things. And when sorrows intensify upon thee, remember My sorrows. By God, the Truth! I have borne what was heavier than the weight of the heavens and earth, yet I did not become impatient in God's Cause but endured according to My power and bore according to My strength. Thus do We impart unto thee the word of truth that thou mayest be informed of what befell the Ancient Beauty from those who disbelieved and associated partners with God, after they had imagined within themselves that they had ascended in faith to a holy and lofty station. By God, the Truth! They committed against their own selves what none before them had ever committed, wherefore the word of wrath was fulfilled against them from the presence of One mighty and wise. Were We to mention unto thee what befell Us from him whose mention We had exalted in those days, thou wouldst surely lament and weep within thyself, nay thou wouldst detach thyself from all things and flee unto the summits of lofty mountains. Would that he had been content with what he did! Nay, he attributed unto God that which he witnessed within himself, and by this were consumed the hearts of the Prophets and Messengers, while he rejoiceth within himself as though he had committed no sin. Thus did vain imaginings delude him and drive him from a holy and wondrous paradise, after We had raised him to the kingdom of names to a station beneath which stood the angels of heaven, and We named him in every heaven with one of Our most beautiful names. And after his ascension to the most exalted stations, We commanded him with a command whereupon he waxed proud against God Who created and fashioned him. Therefore did We cast him from the heaven of Command unto the earth of his self and made him a warning unto every discerning one who seeth. Thus have We acquainted thee and imparted unto thee some of what hath befallen Us. Soon shalt thou know that which We have concealed, and thou shalt be informed of what hath befallen the Truth. And the Glory rest upon thee and upon him who hath believed in God and remained steadfast in the Cause.

Beirut. O Mirza Asadu'llah, upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness.

Ramadan 1302. He is God, exalted be His station in greatness and power.

The more the hope of attaining union grows stronger, the more intense becomes the fire of longing. Therefore a strong body is needed to bear it, not this weak one, for this weak one would collapse at the slightest flame. The hearing and the union must occur in a single moment, that perchance the spirit may be granted victories and recall the records of separation, for the more His fire becomes manifest and evident, the more it adds to the rank and station of the Presence of Union, which is the station of the Divine Presence. Praise be to the Peerless Intended One Who invited and guided all the people of the mortal realm through the blessed word "Pilgrimage to the House is incumbent upon all." His path is clear and His proof is evident. Reflect upon the power of this blessed word: from the day of its revelation until now, the people of the Covenant from all regions and directions have been and continue to be oriented toward it with utmost longing and yearning. They have borne all afflictions, calamities, hardships, injuries and difficulties of every kind on the path as they hastened toward the Friend. Glorified is He Who guided all to His House and His straight and manifest path. And the prayer dawning from the horizon of His loving-kindness be upon him by whose light the Hijaz was illumined and through whom appeared the decree of the Real and the metaphorical, by which the hidden door and treasured mystery were opened, and upon his family and companions, the banners of guidance and brilliant lights and evident signs and manifestations of oneness among creation - those servants whom God the Exalted described in His words: "honored servants who speak not until He hath spoken, and who do His bidding."

Thereafter, the sublime letter arrived. In truth it was a messenger from the realm of inner meanings that intended this evanescent one. After its reading and review it was presented before the Face. The Master said: "We beseech and hope from God, exalted be His Glory, that He will assist them and adorn them with His loving-kindness. May He not withhold the heavenly feast and true bounty from them for a single moment." End quote.

God willing, through divine grace they will attain with utmost joy and delight to that which was intended. I beseech and hope from God that He will protect the pilgrims to His House from the heat of summer and other illnesses, for in some years in those regions the air changes due to the actions of the heedless and eventually plague breaks out. In any case, what can I say? I ask God Himself to set things right and enable His servants to do what He loves and is pleased with. I send greetings to the honored lady, upon her be Baha'u'llah, and Mirza Inayatu'llah and Mirza Aminu'llah, upon them be Baha'u'llah, and the other lady, upon her be the peace of God, and I beseech God, exalted be His Glory, for assistance. I convey greetings to Siyyid Asadu'llah, upon him be Baha'u'llah. God willing, they will attain their goal with utmost joy and fragrance. Regarding the journey of that beloved one and others, it was decided by lot and consent that, in accordance with wisdom, they should travel gradually, for if all travel at once it will not be free of talk. Peace be upon you and upon the servants of God.

He is God, exalted be His glory in wisdom and utterance! O Amin, upon thee be My Baha! In these days, time is like unto a rare bird or the most great elixir in the eyes of the people of the world. Nevertheless, this blessed morning We went from Bahji to Junayn, and after taking tea We were occupied with thy mention. Many lofty buildings are in view, and most excellent gardens, but in this earthly dust-heap it is most difficult to lay an enduring foundation. Although the palace of utterance hath a firm foundation and an impregnable structure which no earthly commotions can move nor change throughout ages and centuries, yet souls worthy of this most exalted station are very few. Therefore its construction and building have been postponed. In any case, it is morning, and in the words of the Arabs, "May God grant you a good morning." Until now We have mentioned you repeatedly and have sent word. We beseech God to assist thee in all conditions. Verily He is with thee and He is the Present, the Hidden, the Speaking, the Silent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. By silence is meant spiritual silence, otherwise the Pen moveth with such swiftness that its reckoning is beyond comprehension. O Amin! What is necessary and acceptable before God is to show consideration to the son of the martyr of the people of Kaf, Haji Mirza Jani. The people of Kaf in every city should give him four tumans and send a receipt. The honored aunt and Haji H.S. and Aqa Siyyid Faraj'u'llah and other friends must ensure this sum reaches him in every city. Glory be upon him who hath preceded in what God, the Lord of the worlds, hath desired. We beseech God to assist His loved ones in that which will cause their mention to endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven, and to aid them in serving the Cause, and to ordain for them the reward of what they have wrought in the path of God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. As for the son of the deceased Haji, wisdom is needed. Act as you deem advisable. The honored martyr was for some time in the presence and accompanied Us on the great journey. Blessed is he and his brother Dhabih who was not prevented by the doubts of his other brother Ahmad nor the hints of any suspicious soul in the world. He rent asunder the veils in the name of his Lord and turned and hastened until he reached the seashore when the Wronged One was captive in the hands of the ignorant. The oppressors came between Us and him until he attained the presence in the bath-house and won the grace of his Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. And previously he had won the presence twice, once in the land of Taff and again in Zawra. Thus was the matter decreed by God, the Lord of the worlds. O Amin! Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the friends in every land and every place. Give glad tidings to God's loved ones in the land of Ta and the land of Kaf and the lands of Alif and Ba and other countries - give them all glad tidings of the lights of the Day-Star of God's grace, exalted be His glory, and adorn them with the ornament of mention. The answer to Mulla Raj and Mulla Ghulam-Rida of Taft hath been sent down from the heaven of grace and dispatched to the land of Ya. By the life of God! Its fragrance hath perfumed the horizons, its utterance hath adorned creation with the ornament of inner meanings. The eye hath been created for it and the ear hath appeared especially for it.

He is the One Who speaks with truth and is manifest through grace! O Haydar-'Ali, upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. The Book of Certitude is being reviewed and corrected according to the command. I complain unto thee of those who attribute themselves to Me yet commit that which causes My lamentation, crying and wailing to rise up. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to raise up souls worthy of serving this Most Great Cause and Mighty Announcement. The Shi'ih world was administered through lies and calumnies, and now after the removal of the veils of glory and the veils of error, such calumnies have emerged that no ear in creation has heard their like. The Greater Afnan, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness - that is, the honored Uncle - while in Iraq asked certain questions in My presence, and that which was revealed in response became known as the Epistle to the Uncle, and later as the Book of Certitude. The journey and exile of the Wronged One is mentioned therein. Nevertheless, in the Land of Sad \[Isfahan\] it is reported that some of the followers of the tyrannical Dawlat-Abadi attributed it to another station. Fie upon them and those who followed them without any proof from God, the Lord of the worlds! Some time ago, through the Afnan, a telegraph message reached Our presence from 'Ali, upon him be My glory, requesting your journey to the Land of Shin \[Shiraz\], and from the Source of bounty it was granted. However, after arriving in that land you must act with the utmost wisdom, in such way that none will find cause to speak. If you meet the loved ones, convey to them the greetings from the Wronged One. In these days Shaykh Salman requested certain Tablets and forwarded petitions from some believers. Replies were revealed and sent. Jalal of Nayriz attained Our presence and was blessed with bounty. We beseech God to assist all to do what is befitting and worthy. The petitions of Rafi'-i-Badi' and 'Abdu'l-Hamid and another, upon them be the glory of God, reached the Most Holy Court. God willing, replies will be sent. We beseech God to assist them to serve the Cause and manifest what befits My days with wisdom and utterance. He is the Mighty, the Bestower. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to Nabil of Qa'in, upon him be My glory. O Haydar-'Ali, that which has been ordained for the steadfast and devoted souls is such that the tongues of all created things are powerless to describe. Soon they shall witness that which the Tongue of Grandeur spoke forth while seated upon the throne of prison through what the hands of the oppressors had wrought. Ghulam, upon him be My glory, is remembered in the Most Holy Court. He has migrated and hastened until he arrived and attained. This is My testimony for him. We beseech God to assist those who have arisen to help His Cause and exalt His Word, and to confirm them in that which will elevate them in all His worlds. Verily, He is powerful over all things. If you meet the people of Nun and Ra, upon them be My glory, convey greetings. The devoted ones must know their station and preserve it in the name of God, for if today something is lost, its recovery will be most difficult. We beseech God to make them enkindled with the fire of His love, detached from all else, and holding fast to His Most Strong and Mighty Cord. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord! O beloved of my heart! The responses to your letters were written, but due to postal limitations were not sent this time. Your letter number five dated the first of the revered month of Sha'ban arrived. That which you wrote concerning the mention and service of the friends of God, especially regarding the honored friend J.L.H., may the glory and favors of God rest upon him, and his intention, as well as the payment of the Rights of God by all, was presented at the Most Holy Court. His blessed and exalted Word: "Praise be to God, they are blessed with His favors, steadfast in service, speaking His praise and turned toward His face. However, since they are engaged in service and their station is that of the friends and wayfarers, the payment of the Rights depends on their own will. In any case, they are mentioned before God and blessed with His favors. Give them these glad tidings from thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous." Regarding what you wrote about Nasir and the arrangement you made with him, it is acceptable before the Throne. We beseech God to make him steadfast in constancy, remembrance and praise. Excellent is what he has done in the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. End quote. According to the Command, gatherings in that land are not permitted.

However, one side of the tablets of arrival must be erased as previously commanded from the Source of the Command. Blessed are they who act accordingly. Convey greetings and praise to all the friends in that land. Give them the glad tidings of God's favors, exalted be His glory, and I beseech Him to assist all to achieve unity and harmony and to be successful in wisdom and utterance, that all may be illumined by the light of the Cause and be assisted in the mention and praise of the Intended One of the world. The letter from the beloved of my heart, His Holiness 'Ali-before-Akbar, may the glory of God, the Lord of Power, rest upon him, also arrived. Convey greetings and praise to him. God willing, may they arise as befits them, that perchance the heedless souls may become aware of the lights of the Luminary of utterance and turn with illumined hearts to the supreme horizon. The Command is in His hands. He doeth what He willeth and decreeth what He pleaseth. He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Glory be upon you and upon God's friends and chosen ones who have held fast to His Covenant and Testament and are detached from all else but Him. That which is being sent this time: Tablets of arrival numbering the Name of Wahhab (14), the revealed scripture especially for the sons of Khalil, and the Tablet for the Leaf of the land of Q. The responses to the letters, God willing, will be sent next time, as well as the remaining tablets of arrival. The Servant On the 27th of the revered month of Sha'ban 1304

O Muhammad-Rida! God willing, mayest thou be favored with the loving-kindness of the Beloved of the worlds and drink of the choice wine of His utterance. Time and again hath thy call been heard, and whatsoever thou didst privately and openly supplicate from God, exalted be His glory, hath been manifest and evident in the mirror of divine knowledge. This is a Day wherein all must speak for the sake of God, turn unto Him, and arise for His Cause. Hearken thou unto the call of the One True Speaker and hold fast unto that which will cause the exaltation of the Cause of God. All created things summon the people of creation to the most sublime horizon, and yet earthly temples remain occupied with vain imaginings, turning away from and heedless of the Lord of Lords. Today the fragrance of the divine raiment is diffused and the call of God is raised. All must regard the time as precious, for a single minute of these days cannot be compared with the centuries of bygone ages. Know thou the value of this supreme gift and occupy thyself with service to the Cause. Say: O friends of God! The Promised One hath appeared from the horizon of the world, manifest and visible to all, and the Mother Book hath been sent down from the heaven of bounty. Verily, He hath appeared with the truth and walketh not in your ways and paths. He hath appeared and made manifest His straight path. This Day hath no peer or likeness. Say: Strive ye, that while the Sun of Truth is shining, the heaven of grace is raised high, and the ocean of bounty is surging, ye may attain unto your portion. All that ye behold shall soon return to nothingness, save the Word that hath been sent down from the Supreme Pen - it shall endure as long as endureth the kingdom of earth and heaven. Say: O friends! Waste not your time. Turn ye unto the horizon of God's Cause. Today all must fix their gaze upon the Will and Purpose of God, not upon that which they themselves possess and desire. That which I have asked of God, thy Lord, for thee - verily He ordaineth what He willeth. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He knoweth that which profiteth His servants, and with Him is the knowledge of all things in a perspicuous Book. Grieve not over anything. Put thy trust in God - verily He is with His servants who trust in Him. Blessed is the one who hath not squandered these moments which are more precious than the rarest crimson ruby, and hath attained unto service to the Cause. And service to the divine Cause, in its primary degree and first station, hath been and shall ever be mention of Him with wisdom and utterance. Hearken thou unto the call of the Wronged One and convey unto the friends that which He hath commanded. O Muhammad-Qabli-Rida! This is the Day of steadfastness - whoso attaineth unto it hath attained unto all good. If thou hast attained unto the divine tablet and inhaled the fragrance of the divine raiment, turn thy face toward God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O my God! I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou hast made it to exercise dominion over all that hath been and shall be, to write down for me by Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit me in every world of Thy worlds. I testify that I know not what profiteth me. The reins of knowledge are in Thy grasp. Thou art verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. I moreover beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy Cause. I testify unto that whereunto the Tongue of Thy Greatness testified before the creation of the heavens and the earth. Thou didst say - and Thy word is the truth - "Verily My Cause is mighty, mighty - none hath comprehended its might save God, the Single One, the All-Knowing."

To Mirza Mahdi, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the Speaker, the Manifest One, the Attracted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Praise be to God Who has subdued the world through His sovereignty and attracted the nations through His signs, before Whose grandeur and power all things have acknowledged, and Whose glory, grandeur and bounty every tongue has confessed. Remembrance, praise, glorification and splendor be upon the Hands of His Cause who have traversed the lands to exalt His Word, spread His traces, and manifest that which draws them near to Him and teaches them His straight path and His mighty Message.

O Mahdi! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. We have mentioned thee before with the verses of God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We heard thy call and answered thee, and saw thy turning and turned toward thee from the direction of My mighty Prison. Blessed art thou for having shattered the idols of vain imaginings with the arm of wisdom and utterance, and turned to the light when it shone forth from this manifest horizon. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make thee the cupbearer of the Kawthar of proof in this glorious and wondrous Day, to attract thee through His verses, aid thee through His sovereignty, and draw thee nigh unto Him through His mighty and great bounty.

O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! The Trusted One, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of the worlds, hath mentioned thee time and again. He loveth thee for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

In the Persian tongue, hearken to the call of the true Wronged One: Throughout ages and centuries the heedless faction - that is, the Shi'ih - have occupied themselves with mention of successor, guardian, Shaykhi and fourth pillar, to such extent that they remain heedless and veiled from true unity. Glory be to God! Through names they are deprived of their Owner and Creator. The fruits of their deeds became manifest and evident on the day of the appearance of the Beloved of the worlds - their ranks and stations were seen to be the most remote, ignorant and lost of all the peoples of the world, for like wolves they sought to destroy the Eternal Beloved and Everlasting Goal. At first they engaged in cursing and reviling, and in the end they issued the verdict for and carried out the shedding of His most pure blood.

Say: My God, my God, and my Lord, my Lord, and my Sovereign, my Sovereign! I beseech Thee by Thy Lamp which the winds have assailed, and by Thy Name which Thou hast made the key to the door of grace and prosperity, to make me and Thy loved ones among those who have sacrificed their souls and their wealth in Thy path. O Lord! Aid us to achieve such steadfastness as cannot be shaken by the onslaught of the aggressive ones nor prevented by the oppression of the oppressors. Verily Thou art God, the Lord of the worlds and the Master of the Day of Judgment.

Convey My greetings to the loved ones in that land. We beseech God to aid them to achieve such steadfastness as names cannot cause to slip nor turn aside from the straight path and the mighty Message. A petition was sent to the Most Holy Court by his honor 'Attar, upon him be the glory of God, the Mighty, the Chosen One. An answer was revealed and sent. God willing, may they attain to that which will cause the exaltation of the Word of God. In all conditions all must hold fast to wisdom, lest the clamor of the calumniators and the treacherous be raised. Command and judgment are in the hand of God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon those who have not broken My covenant and My testament, and upon thee and My loved ones there and in its surroundings who have drunk the choice wine of My utterance from the cup of My bounty and have said: "Praise be to Thee, O Beloved of the mystics and Goal of the hearts of them that are nigh and sincere!"

In the Name of the One God! The Mother of the Bayan speaks and declares: "The Sovereign has come - dominion belongs to God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting!" The Mother of the Furqan cries out with the most exalted call: "By God! He Who was hidden and treasured in the stronghold of infallibility, concealed from the eyes of men, has appeared!" And the Mother Book exclaims: "By God! He Who sent Me down has come, and He Who exalted Me has been made manifest! Fear God, O peoples of the earth, and deny not Him Who has come from the heaven of Manifestation with the standards of proof and evidence, and be not of the heedless ones!"

O Mother of My Name! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness! In her age and time, the servants awaited the days of the Manifestation, as all bear witness. When the world was illumined by the lights of the Day-Star of Manifestation, the divines engaged in abuse, the false ones in cursing, and men arose in opposition. Finally they pronounced the verdict for His death. Praise the Desired One of the world that He delivered thee by the hand of power and might from the darkness of heedless souls and confirmed thee in turning to Him. How many men are deprived and veiled by their own imaginings, and how many handmaidens have attained the honor of recognition and turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon! One believing handmaiden is preferred in the sight of God above many souls. Blessed is the handmaiden who has turned and attained, and woe to the servant who was heedless and was among the opposers!

O My handmaiden and My leaf! Hearken to My call from the direction of My prison - verily there is no God but Me, the All-Merciful, the Gracious. We make mention at this time of thy daughter who was named Maryam, whom the Tongue of Grandeur has remembered in this exalted station. We give her glad tidings of My remembrance of her. We beseech God to confirm her in steadfastness in this manifest Cause. We make mention of thy other daughter who ascended to God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We purified her at the time of her ascension with the rains of mercy and grace, and We caused her to join the Supreme Companion. We made her hear the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and showed her My Most Glorious Horizon - a bounty from My presence, for I am the Forgiving, the Merciful. And We make mention of her son Muhammad who has at this time attained to My wondrous remembrance. O Muhammad! Agitation has seized the inhabitants of earth by reason of what has come from the Dawning-Place of Revelation with the banners of inspiration. Say: Fear God, O people, and be not of those who denied God's proof and evidence, and disputed His verses - these are assuredly among the most lost in God's Book, the Lord of lords!

O Nasru'llah! The Wronged One mentions thee from the prison precincts with that which every possessor of smell perceives therefrom the fragrance of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Lord of creation. When the clamor is raised, arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as will cause the limbs of names to quake. Thus does the Mother Book teach thee from His presence. And We make mention of thy sister who spoke in praise of her Lord with remembrance whose fragrance shall never cease throughout the duration of God's names, the Lord of the Return. O My leaf! Thank thy Lord that thou hast attained unto God's verses and tablets while men were in doubt and dissension. Blessed art thou and thy sister who turned and believed in God, the Lord of all beings. We have remembered you and sent to you what God has made a light for the lands and a treasure for His servants. The glory shining from the horizon of My utterance be upon you both and upon you all and upon those who have arisen saying "God is our Lord and the Lord of the Throne and earth" - these are indeed the manifestations of My Name, the Powerful, among the servants.

O Siyyid Husayn! Hear the call of this Wronged One Who hath been afflicted at the hands of the servants, and sought no help from anyone save God, the King, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. He hath detached Himself from all who are in the heavens and on earth, and hath spent His soul in the path of thy Ancient Lord, such that no hour hath passed over Him except there befell Him that which caused the eyes of the Maids of Heaven to weep in their chambers and the hearts of them who are nigh unto God to bleed. He desired naught on earth save what His Lord desired, and preserved not Himself in the face of tribulations - to this all things bear witness, if thou be of them that hear. He spoke between earth and heaven what the Spirit spoke within His breast, and delivered the Cause of God, His Lord, unto all the worlds. Among them were those who denied Him and rejected the signs of God, and were of the idolaters. And among them were those who rose up against Him in hostility, who disputed with their own selves, who associated partners with His Being, and who objected to what was sent down from God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Wise. Were We to recount unto thee the tales of what hath befallen Us, thou wouldst detach thyself from thine own self and all that thou hast, and flee unto the mountain peaks, lamenting as lament the bereft. Therefore have We concealed it from thee, lest grief overtake thee in these times, thus protecting thee and those who have believed in God and His signs and were of the faithful. Beware lest thou forget Our remembrance or occupy thyself with that which would remove thee from the shore of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, and render thee among the heedless. Remember within thyself at all times, then remind the servants of what We have imparted unto thee in truth, and be thou of them who remember. Beware lest thou be impatient within thyself or follow them who have denied and associated partners with God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forebears of old. Strive within thyself that the signs of God may be made manifest in thy land and thy face may shine with the lights of certitude. Beware, beware lest thou be heedless of thy Lord's Cause. Aid it with what thou art able and be not of the patient ones. His aid is to teach His Cause among the servants with wisdom and utterance, and naught else befitteth any assured seer. Then remind from Our presence those servants who have detached themselves unto God and who have been seized by the holy fragrances from this hallowed, mighty and luminous Quarter. Say: Fear God and follow not your desires. Follow what the Spirit imparteth unto you - this is better for you than all that hath been created between the heavens and earth. Adorn your tongues with the remembrance of your Lord, the All-Merciful, and turn not unto the world and what is therein, for it shall perish while sovereignty remaineth with God, the Protector, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say: Beware lest ye commit that whereby the honor of the Cause would be lost. Be steadfast in the love of your Lord and be not of the heedless. Sanctify yourselves from all that would remove you from God, then draw nigh with your hearts unto the court of sublime glory. Commit not that which would cause the servants to object, for thereby souls are disturbed and the feet of the believers slip. Strive within yourselves that the signs of God may be made manifest in the kingdom such that the servants may find from you the fragrance of God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful. Thus have We commanded thee - act according to what thou hast been commanded in the Book and be of them that act.

He is the Glorious, the All-Glorious. O handmaiden of God! Now hear in the Persian tongue, in the most wondrous and sweetest of divine melodies, and know that in this Day naught but My remembrance is acceptable and naught but My love is approved in the sight of God, and ever shall be. For all that hath been established between earth and heaven - be it the deeds of the doers, the knowledge of the knowers, the diverse religions and infinite laws - all have appeared from and return to the Manifestations of My Self, and all have appeared from God. And the reason that deeds performed in a previous Dispensation are not acceptable in the sight of God is that deeds have ever been and shall ever be dependent upon recognition of God, and this recognition of God dependeth upon recognition of His Manifestation. Should anyone in this Day remain veiled from Him Who is the Manifestation - He round Whom circle all the divine commandments - no deed whatever would benefit him, even were he to perform the deeds of all created things. Just as recognition of a house doth not suffice without recognition of its owner, likewise the deeds of the doers suffice not without recognition of their Revealer and Establisher. And if in this Day one should forsake all deeds but attain unto recognition of the Truth, there remaineth for him hope of salvation; but should he, God forbid, be veiled from the Truth while occupied with all manner of deeds, there is no escape for him and he shall be reckoned by God among the people of hell, negation and fire. And thou, O handmaiden of God, hearken unto the holy, divine melodies, that through hearing them the Holy Spirit may be raised up in thy heart and the Spirit of Power may speak in thy breast. And when thou attainest unto this station, thou shalt become detached from the world and all therein, and shalt ascend to the most exalted paradise and the most holy horizon, attaining unto the station of "Know God through God" which is the ultimate homeland of the knowers and the final goal of them that are nigh unto God. In this station thou shalt see no proof save the Self of the Friend and seek no evidence save the beauty of the Beloved. Thou shalt regard His Manifestation as proof of His existence and His dawning as evidence of His Self. Thou shalt behold all created things in the grasp of His power like a handful of clay, and shalt observe all existing things limited and confined within His mighty hand. Therefore strive thou to purify thy heart from the outpourings of the allusions of them that are veiled, and to sanctify thy breast from the darkness of all else besides God, that thou mayest be illumined by the light of His manifestations in such wise that all who dwell in the heavens shall be illumined by thee. Marvel not at the power of the King of inner meanings Who is established upon the throne of divine eternity. I swear by the Sun of the Most Glorious Horizon that were all upon earth to become sanctified from the darkness of vain imaginings and purified from the veils of idle fancies, thou wouldst behold in all of them the lights of the manifestation of the divine Sun of Glory. Rend asunder the veils of darkness and abide within the pavilion of holy light. Stand firm in the love of God and strive according to thy capacity to remember God and to spread His remembrance among the handmaidens of God, for in this Day whosoever speaketh in remembrance of the Beloved shall be confirmed by the Holy Spirit. Thus hath the matter been ordained by the All-Wise, the Ancient of Days.

Write in reply to the letter of the Name Ha, upon him be all My most glorious glory. This servant forwarded thy letter to the Most Holy Court where it was illumined and blessed by the lights of the Most Great Countenance. These exalted words shone forth from the Dawning-Place of utterance, the Source of verses:

O My Name Ha! Blessed art thou for having fulfilled God's Covenant, remained steadfast in His Cause, spent what thou hadst in His path, soared in the atmosphere of His love, drunk from the cup of His good-pleasure, spoken His praise, attained unto His days, turned toward His face, entered the Kingdom of faith through His Name and the Heaven of certitude through His grace, and testified to that which God Himself hath testified - that there is none other God besides Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

Thy letter which thou didst send to My Name Mim hath been honored, and We have mentioned thee with this mention whereby all things proclaim that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Beloved. Convey My greetings unto those servants who have attained the lights of faith and believed in God, the Mighty, the Loving. Say: O loved ones of God! Beware lest the affairs of the world veil you or the whisperings of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, extinguish you. Rejoice in My Name and take the cups of certitude through My command, then drink therefrom the water of life in My days. Remember what hath befallen Us at the hands of Mine enemies who cast the ordinances of God behind their backs and followed their own idle fancies and vain imaginings. We counsel you with that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in His Tablets. Beware lest ye follow any ignorant reprobate. Reflect upon God's grace and favors, how He mentioneth you with verses whose fragrance hath perfumed the world and whereby God hath quickened them that lay dead in their graves. Be thankful and praise Him in all conditions, saying:

"Praise be unto Thee, O Dawning-Place of favors, and glory be unto Thee, O Lord of creation! We beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name not to deprive us of the outpourings of Thy days. Send down upon us at all times that which befitteth Thy generosity and favors. Make us steadfast in Thy Cause and ordain for us what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Verily Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Everlasting, the All-Sufficient, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."

As for what you wrote about that person, God willing his reply will arrive. In these days, due to recent events in this land, certain matters have been delayed. It is hoped that another time that person's reply will be sent. For nearly two years these regions and their surroundings have not been free from disturbance, and they have seized some people's letters due to certain suspicions, for these people have secretly caused corruption in the sublime realms in various ways and continue to do so. For this reason, for a long period no Tablet was sent from the Most Holy Court to any region, even the reply to Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin (upon him be 96 \[Baha'u'llah\]), though it was revealed, was not ordered to be sent for some time.

Regarding what you wrote about the war between the two powers, all that was revealed in the Tablet to Ra'is has come to pass - God, the Most High, the Most Great, speaketh the truth. After reading it you will become informed of these matters. However, concerning the victor, certain statements have been revealed from the heaven of knowledge indicating that he too will not maintain this power. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power

The traces of the Pen of love and purity have bestowed purity upon the world and removed the dust of events from hearts and souls. It was a clear proof and a crying herald. It mentioned thirty-hour journeys which were like thirty years. The length of this journey nearly caused the sweetness of nearness to be erased from the heart, but divine grace provided assistance and the true sea showed generosity. And after being presented in the court of His presence, a word was revealed that transformed every remoteness into nearness and every separation into union. Therefore the luminary of hope for nearness has risen from the horizon of the heart. We hope that soon the meeting will be attained and union will open a new book. "Without the help of the people of truth and the chosen ones of truth, even if one be a king, his page is black."

In all conditions we hold fast to the cord of His grace and cling to the hem of His generosity. We have no other sorrow. Surely the sorrows of the world cannot darken this station, nor can the events of nations scatter it. Although outwardly dispersion is apparent, inwardly we are united and watchful. The loved ones, wherever they may be, are beneath the pavilions of His grandeur. This heaven is but one dome of that royal tent. Whatever we are, we are from Him, and wherever we are, we are with Him. The effulgences of the Sun of grace have shone forth in such wise that the learned one of creation can neither describe nor mention it. The world of existence appears as but a span, nay less, before the expanse of His generosity.

Praise be to God, again praise be to God, for awareness comes from His grace and knowledge from His endless bounty. With one word He kindled the fire of His love in hearts and souls until all, without intention, ran toward Him and found rest in His shadow. This fire was reserved for the hearts of those near and sincere. Glory be to God! His jealousy is such that He accepts no rival. This is why the world appears frozen. Were He to lift the veil, new souls would gather in such wise as to make the space too narrow for the former friends. Nay, by His very Self! The blessed word "The foremost ones are the foremost ones - these are they who will be brought near" has ever been and will ever be established and realized. Every person of insight bears witness and every hearing ear attests.

Better now to leave this theme and turn to mention the Afnan of the Blessed Tree and the loved ones, upon them be God's peace. The honored presence of the most great Afnan, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty, has ever been and is remembered. The days of his presence are witnessed and observed. Repeatedly his mention was heard from the tongue of the Master, may our spirits be sacrificed for Him, especially in these days. Furthermore, I convey greetings and nothingness to both luminaries - the brilliant star, his honor Afnan, and the honored beloved, his honor Haji, and the spiritual beloved, his honor Muhammad Mustafa, and likewise his honor Aqa Mirza Mahdi and all the other loved ones, upon them all be God's peace and praise. Praise be to God, they are mentioned and present before His face. Peace and praise and remembrance and glory be upon you and upon God's sincere servants.

16 Jamadiyu'th-Thani 1305

He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power

The praise of those who praise, the remembrance of those who remember, and the description of those who describe are in truth directed to creation, for their source of manifestation is from creation, while the Truth is sanctified and exalted above these. However, since He has granted permission for praise and remembrance, therefore the praise of the world and the remembrance of nations are directed to His most holy, most exalted and most mighty Presence. We beseech Him, since He has granted permission, to accept, and since He has commanded, to receive. And blessings and peace be upon the Point of Existence through whom all contingent beings appeared and for whose sake all created things were brought into being, and upon His family and companions through whom the limbs of polytheism trembled and the hearts of the wicked were disturbed.

And then, O beloved of my heart! Your mention has ever been and continues to be in the most holy and exalted Presence, and we implore God, exalted be His glory, to assist that beloved one at all times in improving the affairs of His servants. Yesterday, which was Monday the fifteenth of the month of Jamadiyu'th-Thani, a letter arrived from Aqa 'Ali, may God assist him. After it was read and reviewed before the face of the Lord, He said: "We beseech God, the Lord of the Throne and earth, to send down upon them the rain of His mercy at every moment and His blessings and favors at every instant." And then, according to His command, his honor my brother Aqa Mirza Husayn, upon him be the peace of God, set out for the presence and the sum was sent. This matter should remain confidential. He said that beloved one should consider what is conducive to the manifestation of trustworthiness in that land, meaning that whatever was sent should be used to pay debts. Beyond that, whatever that beloved one deems advisable may be done. If this sum is given to the creditors, it will surely cause confidence and also strengthen creditworthiness, and afterwards the means for its return will be easy. In all cases, consideration of creditworthiness, trustworthiness, the exaltation of the Word, and the glory of the Cause is necessary. He is the Helper in all conditions, outwardly and inwardly. He has bestowed and continues to bestow His favors. They should consider with utmost care and act upon whatever is beneficial for the Cause.

Another matter is that the honored Afnan, his honor Aqa Mirza Aqa, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, is traveling to that direction. Their purpose is to acquire a location in Port Said for trade, and his honor Haji Mirza Hasan, upon him be 9 66 \[Baha'u'llah\], had written to the Name about this matter that they would assist in whatever way possible. Now the honored Afnan is traveling for this purpose. Showing respect to them is incumbent upon all, as they are counted as being of the Tree. His honor Haji Mirza Hasan should come to Alexandria to discuss and consult with them. Whatever is decided through consultation should be acted upon. Also, one person is needed to stay with them for some time to become familiar with affairs. In any case, consultation should take place in that land and this matter should be arranged with order and firmness. I beseech God, exalted be He, to assist all in what He loves and is pleased with. And peace, remembrance and glory be upon your honor and upon those who love you and upon God's righteous servants.

He is God, blessed and exalted!

Praise be to the Most Glorious Goal of all the worlds, sanctified above mention and utterance and exalted beyond the comprehension of all beings, Who with a single drop from the Kawthar of His presence made the world intoxicated, that they might attain to the hearing of the Word "Am I not?" and be enabled to make reply. This drop increaseth wisdom rather than drunkenness. Light shineth forth from it, and joy and gladness and delight and exultation are made manifest thereby. In truth, that drop bestoweth eternal joy and everlasting delight. Well is it with you, O people of faithfulness!

And now, the letter of that honored friend was in truth a messenger bearing the pearls of love and affection. It brought joy and dispelled sorrow and grief. Exalted is God, the Lord of eternity and the Goal of all nations, Who hath deposited within the words of His loved ones that which is the source of joy and the dawning-place of gladness.

After its reading and perusal it was presented before the Face. He saith, and His word is the truth: "O beloved! Upon thee be My peace and My glory! We have heard thy call and have answered thee with that whose fragrance shall never cease to endure throughout the eternity of My most excellent names and supreme attributes. We beseech God, exalted be He, to make thee a key to hearts and minds, that through thee their doors may be opened, and to ordain for thee the good of the hereafter and of this world, and to send down upon thee from the heaven of His will a blessing from Him and a bounty from His presence and a wealth from His side. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Generous, and the Possessor of great bounty. There is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."

Convey My greetings to all the kindred, both male and female, young and old. They have been and are remembered in the presence of this Wronged One. The non-mention of names hath been due to the requirements of consummate wisdom.

Praise be to God that thou hast attained to the mention of the Goal and art adorned with His favors. Thy letter, as well as the letter thou didst send to thy honored and respected father, were all read and, praise be to God, were the cause of joy and gladness. In these days the Leaf, that is, thy mother, hath received a promise that, God willing, we shall go and partake of food in remembrance of thee. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to gather us upon one carpet and in one place where we may hear and speak.

His Holiness the Master and His Holiness Aqa Mirza Muhammad-'Ali - may my spirit be a sacrifice for them both - have expressed their love and kindness. Praise be to God, all are remembered and are recipients of favor. The circling ones, both men and women, have mentioned and continue to mention you, and they beseech from God that which hath had and hath no likeness or equal. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.

His Holiness Badi'u'llah hath repeatedly mentioned thee and continues to do so, and hath repeatedly read thy letter and beseecheth God to change remoteness into nearness. O honored friend, mention this Prisoner to the honored Aqa Rida and convey greetings to him. We beseech God to honor the Leaf, thy mother, and thy sister - upon them both be the glory of God - and to sustain them with His manifest and hidden bounties.

Glory and mention and praise be upon you and upon all who are in the house, from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Praise, glory, remembrance and splendor belong to the most holy and exalted court of that Beloved One who brought the world and its peoples to life through the breezes of revelation and adorned them with the ornament of eternal existence. He is the One with power, upon whose acceptance or rejection depend the deeds of all created things and the actions of all contingent beings. If a soul from the beginning that has no beginning to the end that has no end were to remember and worship the Self-Sufficient, Exalted Lord in wilderness, plains, mountains and hills, yet the fragrance of His good-pleasure does not emanate therefrom, it was not and is not acceptable. At a time when the Seat of the Throne of Utterance was in a certain place, someone described and mentioned a servant who was occupied night and day in remembrance of the Goal of all existence and in communion with the Fulfiller of needs. We responded that if one who keeps vigil at night and remembers by day has gained His good-pleasure, it is surely accepted and beloved before God; otherwise it bears and has borne no fruit. Indeed, in such matters the known and unknown, piety and transgression, are judged the same. The Mother Book testifies to this, and verily He is the Truthful, the Trustworthy. O thou upon whom be the glory of God, Lord of all beings! In the days of the Manifestation, pure and holy deeds and spiritual, pleasing character are beloved. Deeds are accounted before God as fruits of the Blessed Tree. Blessed are they that act, both men and women! However, their excellence depends upon permission; otherwise they have no station or mention before God, the Remembering, the All-Knowing. At this dawn there descended from the heaven of will this decree: Break thy fast, O leaf of My Tree, for fasting when harmful yields and has yielded no benefit. Say: My God, my God! Thou seest Thy leaf clinging to the Tree of Thy Cause and holding fast to the hem of Thy grace. I beseech Thee to confirm her in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. By Thy might! I have taken Thy good-pleasure, severed from the world's good-pleasure, and have turned to Thee, turning away from all who are in the heavens and earth save what Thy Will hath willed and Thy all-compelling Purpose hath desired for every small and great thing. O My leaf, O My leaf! Take thou the chalice of eternity in the name of God, the Sovereign of the Kingdom of Names, then drink therefrom in His name, the Commanding, the Powerful. Verily I say, fasting and prayer have a great station before God, but their excellence exists in time of health, and when weakness comes, observance thereof is not permitted. Such is the decree of Truth - glorified be His majesty - before and after. Blessed are they that hear and act, both men and women! Praise be to God, the Revealer of verses and the Manifester of clear proofs! Glory be to Thee, O God, O Goal of all contingent beings and Beloved of all created things! I beseech Thee to protect the people of Thy household from the harm of those who have broken Thy covenant and testament, denied Thy right, and disbelieved in Thy signs. Then send down upon them from the clouds of Thy mercy the rains of Thy bounty and grace. Then write for them by Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will exalt them in Thy name amongst Thy servants. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great. The resplendent and shining Glory that dawns from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty be upon you, O people of the household, and upon those who are with you and love you and circle round you, and upon those who have taken for themselves a station in your vicinity. Verily He is the Confirmer, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Generous.

In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!

Praise and thanksgiving in truth belongeth on this Day - which hath been mentioned in the Books of God as the Day of God - exclusively to the friends of God, glorified be His majesty, namely those who have hearkened with their inner ear to the Most Great Word and who are seated firm and steadfast upon the throne of certitude. This is that Word through which whosoever attaineth unto it, neither the doubts of the world nor the allusions of the peoples shall debar him from the Ancient of Days. This is the Dawning-Place of certitude and the Rising-Point of the Sun of assurance. This is that Word which draweth man unto the ocean of inner meanings and freeth him from the kingdom of names. This is the gate of power and might, and the straight path of God amongst His servants. This is the ornament of divine wisdom and heavenly knowledge. This is that Word which is as a sword against the idolaters, for it rendereth null the sorcery of the sorcerers and the calumnies of the transgressors. Whoso holdeth fast unto it, he is indeed among the most exalted of creation in the sight of God, Our Goal and the Goal of all mankind.

And that Word is the blessed Word "He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth." This Word closeth the door of objections raised by the idolatrous souls and rolleth up the realm of self and passion. Glory be to God! Until now they have not inhaled the fragrance of this blessed Word. They speak but understand not; they utter words but perceive not. Should any soul attain unto this blessed Word and drink from the hidden ocean contained therein, he would find himself independent of the mention of that which is unseemly and of hearkening unto it. But the fire of jealousy and hatred ever inflameth the idolaters and atheists. They are tormented in the fire yet perceive it not. Woe unto them!

We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist His party that all may hold fast unto the blessed Word and be freed and detached from all else besides it. Glory be unto Thee, O my God, my Goal, my Beloved, Beloved of the world, my Lord and Lord of all nations! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the Hour and its signs, and the Resurrection and its tokens, were made manifest, to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty upon Thy Afnan that which beseemeth Thy glory, Thy power, Thy generosity, Thy grace and Thy might. O Lord! Thou seest him in all conditions standing in service to Thy Cause and speaking Thy praise. He is the one who turned unto Thee on the day when they who dwell on Thine earth turned away from Thee and they who inhabit Thy lands rose up against Thee. He spent whatsoever he possessed for the exaltation of Thy Word, the manifestation of Thy Cause and the spread of Thy verses. By Thy glory, O my God! Should this servant attempt to mention that which hath proceeded from him in Thy days, his pen would prove powerless and his tongue would falter. I beseech Thee, O Thou Goal of the hearts of them who are nigh unto Thee and Beloved of the hearts of the sincere ones, by Thy Most Great Signs and by Thy Most Exalted Self, to cause his deeds in Thy verses to appear from the horizon of bounty and favors that all may witness their manifestation and their lights even as they witness the sun and its effulgence and its lights. I ask Thy forgiveness, O my God, for mentioning this station which Thou hast made to be above my station. I beseech Thee by the light of Thy oneness, from which Thy servants are held back, to assist him at all times in that which he was. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Helper. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

In the Name of God, the Render of Veils! God makes mention of His servant that he may be gladdened through His grace. Say: Through His remembrance hearts are purified from doubt and misgiving, and therein is kindled the fire of the love of God, and they speak forth that there is no God but Him and that He Who hath come with the truth is indeed a manifest sovereign. Say: O people! Do ye doubt the Cause of God after He hath appeared with the truth with a mighty proof? Look ye at the proofs of the Prophets of old - have ye heard of an Appearance greater than this Appearance which hath appeared with the truth? Ponder, then be fair, that ye may take the Beloved as a friend unto yourselves. Cast doubt behind you and misgiving beneath your feet, that ye may soar on the wings of detachment in the atmosphere of your Lord, the All-Merciful. This is better for you than what ye possess, and God is witness unto this.

O servant! We behold thee wavering between two paths. Hearken unto the call of thy Lord and say: In the Name of God and by God! Then turn to the right. Thus have We ordained for thee in a Tablet which was mighty in truth. Beware lest thou deprive thyself of that which hath been ordained for thee. Seek thou in the days of thy Lord a way unto Him.

Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by the waters of Thy bounty which flowed from the clouds of Thy mercy and the heaven of Thy favors, whereby Thou didst purify whom Thou didst will from the dust of disobedience, that Thou mayest purify my heart from all doubt and misgiving, that I may detach myself wholly from all else save Thee and turn toward the sanctuary of Thy good-pleasure. O Lord! I have laid hold on the cord of Thy bounty and clung to the hem of the robe of Thy favor and grace. Deprive me not in these days of the fragrant breezes of Thy contentment, nor from hearing the warbling of the Dove of Thy Cause. And distance me not, O my Beloved, from the shore of the ocean of Thy nearness and presence. Verily Thou art He Who hath ever been God before all things and will be God after all things. Thou didst create all contingent beings through Thy power and sovereignty and didst clothe them with the garment of existence through Thy command and decree. Then Thou didst cast upon them Thy most exalted Word as Thou didst ordain in the heaven of destiny. Thereby were the pillars of Thy servants shaken and their faces were transformed. Thereupon Thou didst raise Thy right hand and didst take the hands of certain of Thy servants through Thy sovereignty and power, according to what their hands had wrought before, and Thou didst leave other servants through Thy constraint and might. Those whom Thou didst preserve, Thou didst make them helpers of Thy Cause, turning unto Thy face, drawing nigh unto the sanctuary of Thy union and presence, circling round the Kaaba of Thy beauty, and drinking from the choice wine of Thy bounty and gifts in the days wherein the Hidden Mystery and Thy treasured Secret were made manifest, whereby appeared that which had never appeared in creation. Exalted then be this bounty which hath encompassed all worlds! And those whom Thou didst leave, Thou didst make them manifestations of negation and dawning-places of polytheism, and Thou didst make them accursed in this world and the next, deprived of every good thing and far removed from the gardens of nearness and reunion. Therefore, O my God, I beseech Thee by this power which Thou hast extended over the worlds, that Thou make me not to hesitate in Thy Cause. Strengthen me through Thy sovereignty that I may pass over the Bridge through Thy might and power and bounty and grace, that my face may shine between earth and heaven and I may be mentioned among the Concourse on High as one of the people of Baha. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest and Thou art encompassing all things and knowing and seeing Thy servants.

He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most High

A mention from Us to him who hath turned his face toward the Countenance when most of the servants turned away from it, that it may draw him nigh unto God and strengthen him to make mention of this Remembrance whereby earthquakes have appeared and mountains been leveled. O Sadra! Hearken unto the Call from the direction of 'Akka, the seat of His manifestation whereby the earth hath been illumined and the horizons made bright. Leave mankind behind thee and turn with the ear of thine inmost nature that thou mayest hear the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree which hath been raised up in the Kingdom of creation by the command of God, the Lord of Names. Thus doth the Wronged One command thee, Who hath summoned all unto God, the Lord of existence. We have heard thy call and have answered thee through this Tablet whereby the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath been wafted throughout all possibility. Arise to serve the Cause through God's might and power, and remind the people with wisdom. This is among the most meritorious of deeds in the sight of the All-Compelling, the All-Bountiful. Beware lest the veils of humanity hold thee back from the Most Sublime Vision. Say: By God! The Hour hath come and the moon been cleft asunder and the All-Bestowing hath come in the shadows of the clouds while ye are in wondrous intoxication. Be thou in all conditions firmly attached to the cord of wisdom which God hath sent down in the Scriptures and Tablets. This is not the day to pause. By the life of God! The rock hath hastened unto the Lord of creation and the mountains have soared unto the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. The Wronged One hath come with proof and evidence, yet the people are in doubt and schism. They have cast aside the Self-Subsisting and taken hold of vain imaginings. Say: Take ye heed, O ye who are endowed with insight! Glory be upon those who have cast away the world, holding fast to the Most Great Cord - these are the people of Paradise in the sight of God, the Lord of Lords.

O Sadra! Strive that thou mayest attain unto that which is acceptable in the sight of God today. The most excellent of deeds hath been and shall be the teaching of the Cause, yet with wisdom and utterance. This word hath been revealed in most of the Tablets lest anyone should be heedless and transgress it. Walk ye toward God and place your trust in God and speak for God's sake. Pay no heed to the objections and opposition of lifeless souls. Reflect upon the Seal of the Prophets, how many objections were raised against that Sun of Truth by the clay figures of the world who appeared and moved about in human form. The pagan priests, and the Jewish and Christian divines, have committed the very things which the divines of the age, in this Dispensation, have committed, and are still committing. Nay, these have displayed a more grievous cruelty and a fiercer malice. Every atom beareth witness unto that which I say. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and occupy thyself with service to the Cause. Strive that thou mayest attain in this Day, which is the Lord of all the days of the world, such a station whose mention shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Today every good deed is more exalted and more excellent and more beauteous than all the deeds of the world. Hold fast unto truth and fix thy gaze upon Him. By My life! The traces of every soul that ariseth today shall remain on earth as long as the divine names and attributes endure. All that is witnessed today shall vanish save those matters which are related to truth and which have appeared in His path. Beware, beware lest the clamor of the world sadden thee or the conditions of creation veil thee from the Lord of Eternity. Thus doth command thee He with Whom is the knowledge of the Book. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the lights of the countenance of their Lord, the Revealer of verses.

The Baker of Oneness, his honor Rida, who hath attained - He is the Most Holy, the Most Great. A mention from Us unto him who hath attained the presence of the Wronged One time and again, and hath heard the Call, and entered the Spot round which circled the Faithful Spirit. O Rida! My tongue and My Pen and those around Me and he who writeth the verses before My face have testified for thee that thou hast turned toward the Supreme Horizon and attained the recognition of God, the Fashioner of the heavens. By My life! The treasures of the world cannot equal this testimony, if thou be of them that know. Wert thou to discover what hath proceeded for thee from the Most Exalted Pen, thou wouldst soar with longing. Thus do We expound for thee that thou mayest be of them that rejoice. Thou didst enter the White Spot by the leave of God, the Lord of all men. This is from the bounty of thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. When thou didst arrive and present thyself and hear and see, return thou in the name of thy Lord, the Protector, the Mighty, the All-Wise. When thou beholdest My loved ones, proclaim My glorification upon their faces, then recount unto them what hath befallen Us in this remote Spot. Say: By God! The wolf hath devoured a piece of the Virgin and the Messenger Joseph. Thus was the matter decreed in the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Say: The people of the Furqan have cast the commandments of the All-Merciful behind their backs and committed that which hath caused all creation to lament. Every fair-minded and insightful one beareth witness to this. By God! The dwellers of Paradise have been shaken by their deeds, and the Virgin hath wailed in the Most Exalted Paradise at what their hands have wrought, and the Messenger crieth out saying: "Fie upon you, O company of wrongdoers! Ye make mention of Me night and day, yet ye slay him who was the consolation of Mine eyes and the joy of My heart and the dilation of My breast through his remembrance. What aileth you, O company of the ignorant!" The leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree have turned yellow through your tyranny, and still the clouds weep while ye remain heedless. Thus hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen that which hath caused the eyes of them that are nigh to shed tears. O My loved ones! Hearken unto My call in these days wherein the fire of oppression hath been kindled and the face of justice hath been veiled. There is no God but I, the Wronged One, the Unique. We have seized him by whom all things have lamented, with an authority from Us and a power from Our presence. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Powerful. And We shall seize those who have acted unjustly without clear proof or illuminating Book. O ye who drink the wine of divine mercy! Though the dark cloud of oppression hath prevented the Sun of Justice from shedding its radiance, yet the divine power prevaileth over all and standeth above all. Be not grieved by the fire of the souls of the polytheists. Fix your gaze upon the light of the Face of the One. Verily, He preserveth whom He willeth and ordaineth for whomsoever He desireth that which profiteth him in every world of His worlds. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Powerful. Soon shall the Hand of Divine Power seize the oppressors and polytheists and requite them for their deeds. He, verily, is the Requiter, the All-Wise. It behooveth you to rejoice in the remembrance of your Lord, the All-Merciful, and to be of them that are steadfast in this Cause whereby the feet of the learned and the mystics and the jurists and the men of letters have slipped, save whom God, the Peerless, the All-Informed, hath willed. And We send greetings to the handmaidens of God in that land. Each one hath been mentioned before God according to what she hath been enabled to achieve in His path, and hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in God's Book. Blessed is she who hath attained in the days of her Lord, the Mighty, the Unique.

In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord

May my spirit be a sacrifice for Your Presence. The intensity of the heat this year affected my body and caused weakness, but the water of life from Your Presence, which flowed from the Pen of love and favor, provided the most excellent remedy for it. How pleasant and refreshing it was for me! When I drank from each cup of Your favors and each goblet of Your kindness, it so intoxicated and enraptured me that I was transported, ascended, entered, attained presence, and made my supplication. When Your prayer was offered before the face of our Beloved and your Beloved, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke forth that which diffused the fragrance of His favor, mercy and kindness toward your honor, and He said, exalted be His glory:

O My Name Mahdi! Praise be to God, thou hast attained to divine favor. This most exalted Word was previously revealed in the Crimson Book. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto the Word of God in His days, for that Word hath been and shall ever be like a lamp before his face in all the worlds. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto this most exalted station, this highest rank and ultimate goal.

Praise be to God, you have attained, time after time, nay limitless beyond reckoning by century, age, epoch, eternity or pre-existence, to divine verses, signs, allusions, expositions, tablets and scriptures. Even if but a single word appear in a single moment, it is not and never shall be bounded by temporal limitations, for a single word shining forth in less than a moment from the Mouth of the Will of the King of Oneness manifests its radiance, its decree and its revelation clearly and evidently in all worlds, and like an artery in a body, it appears and moves through all times from the beginning that hath no beginning to the end that hath no end. Blessed is the soul that hath drunk from this ocean and gained knowledge of this Book. Likewise this blessed word appeared from the Dawning-Place of the Tongue in the Kingdom of Utterance - exalted be His glory:

God willing, divine favor, mercy and blessing are directed toward you, and He will grant you deliverance from troublesome and wearisome matters. Every difficulty is easy for Him and every hardship simple. Verily He is the Powerful One Who doeth what He willeth in creation and judgeth as He pleaseth through His firm and mighty command. During this utterance the table was spread, and mention was made of your honor while partaking of what was present: Give thanks unto thy Lord, the Generous Giver.

The Glory be upon your honor and upon those who have attained to what God desired when He appeared in truth through His wise command. Regarding Haji Mulla Ali, upon him be 966 \[the glory of God\], if it does not conflict with wisdom or cause notoriety in that land, there is no objection. The letter of Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, which was sent to that beloved one, has been forwarded. If your honor writes anything, please convey greetings of evanescence and nothingness from this ephemeral one. It is repeated that the letter was sent.

O Nabil-i-A'zam, upon him be the Glory of God, He Who dawns from the horizon of utterance! God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who speaketh in the Most Great Prison is verily the Object of all tribulation and harm, and the Recipient of afflictions. There hath befallen Him that which hath caused the Concourse on High to lament, and the dwellers of the pavilions of Grandeur and Majesty to weep. Blessed is the soul that hath heard His call and hath arisen to serve His Cause and aid it through wisdom and utterance, and woe unto him who hath denied the proof of the All-Merciful and was among the heedless ones. O thou who soarest in My atmosphere! Hearken unto My call, for verily I am in the ocean of sorrows and I make mention of thee with that which causeth the spirit of life to stir within the body of contingent being. Thy Lord is verily the All-Merciful, the Bountiful. We have heard thy call time and again, and thy letter was read before the Wronged One repeatedly, and We have answered thee with this Tablet, which when it was sent down, all the tablets of the world bowed down before it. Rejoice thou and be of the thankful ones. And We have heard thy sighs in the love of God and witnessed thy tears in separation from Him. To this hath testified what thou hast presented in this Station before which every station hath prostrated itself and around which every House attributed to God, the Lord of the worlds, hath circled. Thus hath the Tongue spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance that the rapture and longing may seize thee to such a degree that thou wilt cry out among the concourse of names through this Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Be thou vocal with that which will cause the spirit of the world to soar and the hearts of them who are nigh to be attracted. Warble upon the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree with diverse melodies that the followers of all religions may be set ablaze thereby. By My life! For this wast thou created and for this wast thou commanded at this time wherein the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

God willing, through divine favor you will appear and speak in such wise that frozen hearts and cold souls and cast-out stony temples will attain unto a new spirit and fresh vitality. O thou who hast turned thy face toward My countenance and gazed toward My horizon! The Surah of Wisdom which was specially revealed for thee from the divine Kingdom of utterance is in truth like unto a treasure, and precious pearls lie concealed within each word thereof. Should anyone recite it, with each reading he will behold a door opened. That honored one must recite this perspicuous Tablet for the friends with the most wondrous melodies. By My life! It guideth the people unto the truth and maketh them to recognize the Balance that calleth out betwixt earth and heaven, "Verily, I am the Distinguisher, the All-Knowing!" Speak ye with My words that will bestow the essence of life upon every particle of dust and grant the wings of assurance, that they may soar in the atmosphere of the love of the All-Merciful with the utmost joy and attraction. Previously this word was revealed from the Most Exalted Pen: Different effects are witnessed from words in the kingdom of names and attributes. Thus hath it been ordained from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Therefore that honored one must at all times be occupied with educating the servants through wisdom and utterance. Verily He is with thee and will aid thee to make mention of Him and praise Him and serve His Cause, the Mighty, the Perspicuous. And We make mention in this station of My loved ones in that land who have cast aside all else save Me and have taken hold of that which they were commanded by One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy wife. Verily We make mention of her and of My handmaidens who have turned toward God, the Lord of all worlds.

In the Name of God, the Wondrous!

Blessed be thy days which have been joined to the Days of God, and blessed be thine ear in that it hath heard wondrous melodies of glory. Blessed be thy faithfulness in that thou didst associate with He Who beareth My name, Who came unto you in days when every upright man was shaken. Through thee was the name of faithfulness adorned. Moreover, thou art he who gave shelter to the Manifestation of Our name, the All-Bountiful, when He came unto thee in grievous days. Say: God did verily deliver Him through the truth and aid Him with a sovereignty from His presence when He was in prison, and brought Him forth through His grace, and preserved Him through the hosts of heaven and earth, until He caused Him to enter the seat of a mighty throne. He attained the presence of the Countenance, and the lights of Beauty shone upon Him from the Dayspring of Glory. Thus doth God single out whom He willeth through His grace, and He, verily, hath power over all things.

Say: O people! We forewarned you aforetime of the tribulation that would occur in the days of adversity, that your souls might not be troubled at its appearance. Thus was the matter decreed in the Tablet. Say: The Spirit - were it not to be sacrificed in the path of God, would it profit you in aught? Nay, by His very Self, were ye but to know. Blessed is he who hath sacrificed himself in God's path and ascended unto a sublime heaven of glory. They who were not corrupted and were martyred - these have attained the heights of the Ridvan and say: "Praise be to God Who hath fulfilled His promise to us and made us inherit Paradise, and hath severed us from every remote polytheist." Were We to lift the veil, the people would assuredly be drawn away from their souls in their longing for the Concourse on High, and God is witness to this.

Say: O people! Mock not those who have been afflicted with trials in God's path. These are among the most exalted of creation, and through them doth mercy descend upon the peoples of the world, were ye but to know. Is one who eats and sits at ease like unto him who lieth under chains and fetters in God's path? Nay, by your Lord, the Mighty, the Most High! To this doth every just and discerning one bear witness. Say: O people! Consider ye the story of 'Ali, when he came with the truth and delivered My messages, until he was martyred in My love with manifest joy. Then look upon those who believed in him - among them were those who were slain, those who were imprisoned, and those who forsook wealth and children and took unto God a path. All of these did We favor with Our favors, and We caused the believers to attain unto the most exalted and wondrous station of glory. Such hath been Our way in the past and in the future, and no change wilt thou find in Our way. Say: We desire that which ye flee from, as doth every informed and certain one.

Blessed art thou, O youth who sittest upon the throne of love! Then mercy be upon thee from the presence of One mighty and wise. Whoso hath love for the Youth in his heart is young though a thousand years should pass over him, while he who is deprived thereof is in the depths of age though he be in the prime of youth. Thus hath the Most High Pen inscribed upon this snow-white tablet from the presence of One all-knowing. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, then convey unto the people that which thou hast been commanded in the tablets from the presence of One wise. Be thou assured in thyself - by God, thou art with Me in a praiseworthy and glorious station. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon thy sons and thy daughter and those who are with thee. By My life! They are none other than in a garden of delight.

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious! Blessed art thou, for thy letter hath come before Our presence in this mighty prison. Whosoever calleth upon God after the Ancient Beauty hath entered the Most Great Prison, the Supreme Pen recordeth for him that which the people of creation cannot reckon. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. This is the Day of remembrance and utterance. Blessed is he whose letter cometh before the face of his Lord, the All-Merciful, and who is adorned with the ornament of faith. He is, verily, on a straight path. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for having enabled thee to attain unto this. This is indeed a manifest grace. Be thou so steadfast in the Cause that through thee may be made steadfast those servants who are perturbed and hesitant in the Cause of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Proclaim the Cause of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, with wisdom and utterance. Thus doth the Beloved of the worlds command thee. Drink thou the pure water of immortality from the word of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. He who drinketh thereof, neither the allusions of all who dwell on earth can deter him from the Lord of Names, nor the veils of the people of idle fancy from drawing nigh unto the kingdom of his Lord, the Most Glorious. Cast behind thee that which occureth to the minds of men and turn thou unto the Most Sublime Vision. Thus doth the Ancient of Days command thee. Verily thy Lord is the Commander, the All-Knowing. Say: O concourse of divines! Hold your pens, for by God the Supreme Pen moveth upon the Tablet of Destiny. Therefore keep silent about that which ye mention, for lo, the Tree beyond which there is no passing speaketh the truth. Turn ye unto it and be not of the heedless. Are ye occupied with your words? Open your eyes, O company of evil ones! The King of Words hath appeared from the heaven of utterance on the part of One All-Knowing, All-Wise. Say: Leave ye the barking of dogs, for the Dove warbleth upon the branches in diverse melodies upon the twigs of the Tree of Manifestation with such strains as draw unto them the hearts of all on earth. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is witness unto what I say. Say: Abandon ye the pond, for lo, the Most Great Ocean hath appeared, gathered from the Kawthar which flowed from the Source of the letter "H" that endeth in the Sovereign of Names. Thus doth the All-Informed apprise you. Say: Do ye imagine that He desireth aught for Himself? Nay, by the Lord of the worlds! He hath sacrificed Himself for your life. How strange that those who have drawn the swords of passion against the countenance of Him Who desired to admit them into the kingdom of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Wise! We desired immortality for the people of creation, yet they have gathered to slay Me. Soon shall they find themselves in manifest loss. We have nurtured thee for My help and have cast upon thee the Word from the tongue of grandeur that thou mayest arise to make mention of Me amongst My servants and bring them nigh unto the heaven of My loving-kindness and cause them to enter My hallowed and exalted Kingdom. It behooveth thee to be stirred by My will. By this will God exalt thee through a command from His presence. He is verily the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Adorn thy temple with the ornament of servitude in such wise that the servants who slumber upon their couches may thereby be awakened after the Summoner hath proclaimed: "The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the All-Praised!" Through this shall the Cause be established and that which thy Lord, the Lord of all worlds, hath purposed shall be confirmed. Grieve not because of those who have disbelieved and acted unjustly. Turn thou unto God under all conditions. Arise and say: O people! The Self-Subsisting hath come from the Orient of the Will of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Fear ye God and be not of the mischief-makers. Verily thy Lord will protect thee through the truth and will send down upon thee from the heaven of His bounty that which will gladden thy heart. He is verily the Mighty, the All-Wise. And glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee.

O 'Attar, upon whom be the Glory of God! He is God, exalted be His station in wisdom and utterance. The Most Great Branch was present before the Wronged One and presented your letter, which attained the honor of being heard. Praise be to God, the fragrance of sincerity wafted from it. We testify that you have attained to that which was mentioned in the Books of God, Lord of the worlds. You were present, heard, and beheld the Horizon of Revelation with your penetrating vision. O 'Attar, you have been and are remembered before the Wronged One. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to manifest through you that which will draw the servants near unto Him. Verily, He is powerful over all things.

Regarding what you mentioned about Mirza Husayn, convey to him greetings from the Wronged One and say: You and God know, and all things bear witness, that the one mentioned has ever been behind a veil. Whenever upheaval appeared, he departed to another city, while this Wronged One stood firm before all faces. When by divine power the effulgences of the Luminary of the Merciful's utterance shone upon every city, the deniers emerged from behind the veil and committed that which caused the denizens of the highest Paradise to weep and lament.

Say: O Husayn, hearken to the call of the Wronged One. Verily, He draws you near and guides you to the path of God, Lord of the mighty throne. Say: Cast aside your desires, then follow the command of your Lord. Unto Him is your return and your abode. Hasten to His good-pleasure, then read what hath been sent down from the kingdom of His utterance. Beware lest the imaginings of those who have broken His covenant and testament prevent thee. Look with thine own eyes and listen with thine own ears. By God's life, another's eye will not suffice thee, nor will another's ear save thee, nor will thy imaginings guide thee, nor thy conjectures elevate thee, nor will what thou possessest profit thee. For the sake of God do I counsel thee, and for the sake of God hearken thou unto what will enrich thee beyond all else save thy Lord.

The Cause is more manifest than the sun. Say: Would you be content to be afflicted anew like the previous party, and for helpless souls to be afflicted? Hear the call of the Wronged One. Rend asunder the veil of vain imaginings with the arm of certitude, shatter the idols of names with the power of the Creator of heaven, and be of the fair-minded. For years We protected that soul - he, his family and children all remained safe and present. Not a single blow befell him in God's path. Then at another's instigation he attempted harm against the Wronged One. We departed and never confronted him. We forgave him after Our power and concealed his evil deed after Our knowledge.

Hear the call of this Wronged One. Entrust not thy hearing and sight to others, and be not content with mere listening. For God's sake, arise and journey to the island. See and hear with thine own faculties, that the matter may become evident to thee. Then present thyself in this Most Great Prison to hear what no ear hath heard. Were it not for the Glory, who would manifest the Cause? Were it not for Him, who would stand before the faces of the divines and princes? Be fair and be not of the heedless. We beseech God to aid thee to return. Verily, He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful.

O 'Attar, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Chosen One. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to all the kindred, and likewise to the loved ones. At this time each hath been honored with a Tablet from the Supreme Pen. Blessed are they and joy be unto them.

Another section in answer:

That which His Holiness the Exalted One - may the spirit of all existence be sacrificed for Him - has ordained regarding inheritance is thus: Whatever remains from the deceased should be considered as two thousand five hundred and twenty portions, for this is a number whose foundation is from nine, and in its final digits that same nine appears, which is the numerical value of the Blessed Name Baha, and it contains nine fractions, namely: one-tenth, one-ninth, one-eighth, one-seventh, one-sixth, one-fifth, one-fourth, one-third, and one-half. The children's portion is nine-sixtieths, the spouses' portion eight-sixtieths, the fathers' portion seven-sixtieths, the mothers' portion six-sixtieths, the brothers' portion five-sixtieths, the sisters' portion four-sixtieths, and the teachers' portion three-sixtieths.

This was what was intended by the Book of Ta, Ha, Za, Vav, Ha, Dal and Jim. And in this Dispensation, since the Ancient Beauty, out of pure grace and bounty, has designated the children's portion, which was nine-sixtieths, to be eighteen-sixtieths, and has reduced nine-sixtieths from those other six categories, now the division must be made in this way: from each of those six categories of heirs, one and one-half sixtieths should be reduced, which totals nine-sixtieths. The spouses' portion, which was eight-sixtieths, becomes six and one-half sixtieths, which equals three hundred and ninety. The fathers' portion becomes five and one-half sixtieths, the mothers' portion four and one-half sixtieths, the brothers' portion three and one-half sixtieths, the sisters' portion two and one-half sixtieths, and the teachers' portion one and one-half sixtieths. When all these numbers are added together, they equal that same hidden number which is two thousand five hundred and twenty.

The year has been fixed at nineteen months, and each month at nineteen days. All of these total three hundred and sixty-one. Since the solar year has three hundred and sixty-five days, and in some years three hundred and sixty-six, there are five extra days. It has been ordained that these five days, which are called the Days of Ha and the Days of Giving that precede the Fast, should be placed before the month of fasting, and the month of fasting is the last month of the year, while Naw-Ruz is the first day of the year.

As for the names of those nineteen months, they are as follows: First, the Month of Splendor; Second, the Month of Glory; Third, the Month of Beauty; Fourth, the Month of Grandeur; Fifth, the Month of Light; Sixth, the Month of Mercy; Seventh, the Month of Words; Eighth, the Month of Perfection; Ninth, the Month of Names; Tenth, the Month of Might; Eleventh, the Month of Will; Twelfth, the Month of Knowledge; Thirteenth, the Month of Power; Fourteenth, the Month of Speech; Fifteenth, the Month of Questions; Sixteenth, the Month of Honor; Seventeenth, the Month of Sovereignty; Eighteenth, the Month of Dominion; Nineteenth, the Month of Loftiness.

Likewise, these nineteen names are also applied to the days of each month. For example, the first day of each month is the Day of Splendor, the second day of each month is the Day of Glory, and the third day of each month is the Day of Beauty.

As for the names of the week, they are as follows: Saturday is the Day of Glory, Sunday is the Day of Beauty, Monday is the Day of Perfection, Tuesday is the Day of Grace, Wednesday is the Day of Justice, Thursday is the Day of Majesty, and Friday is the Day of Independence.

A Tablet Revealed by Baha'u'llah in Commemoration of the Ridvan Festival

Lo! The beauty of His hallowed countenance hath appeared resplendent from behind the veil. This is indeed a strange happening. The flame of divine attraction hath caused the souls of men to swoon away. This is indeed a strange event. Having been revived, they winged their flight unto the pavilion of holiness, beneath the dome of His heavenly throne. This is indeed a strange mystery.

The Maid of Eternity hath removed the veil from her face. How glorified is the peerless, the wondrous beauty of her countenance! From the earth below the beaming brightness of her face hath shed its radiance upon the clouds. This is indeed a strange light. And there flashed the darts of her glances, like unto the darts of meteors. This is indeed a strange dart.

Every name or title hath been consumed by the flame of her face. This is indeed a strange accomplishment. She directed her gaze toward the people of dust upon the earth below. This is indeed a strange glance. Thereupon all beings vibrated with joy and passed out of sight. This is indeed a strange extinction. Then her jet black locks were revealed, even as the beauty of the spirit eclipsed by impenetrable darkness. This is indeed a strange colour.

From her person there wafted a sweet savour laden with perfume. This is indeed a strange musk. In her right hand she held a goblet of crimson wine and in her left a fragment of her broken heart. This is indeed a strange bounty. Her hand was tinged crimson with her lovers' blood. This is indeed a strange thing. And she bore round cups of the wine of immortality. This is indeed a strange fountain of living water.

To the accompaniment of harp and lute she chanted melodies in the glory of the Best Beloved's Name. This is indeed a strange melody. Thereat the hearts, set ablaze by the fire, were melted. This is indeed a strange love. And she granted the infinite, the incalculable bounty of beholding the beauty of her countenance. This is indeed a strange bounty. With the sword of her captivating charm she dealt blows at the necks of men. This is indeed a strange blow. Whensoever her face wreathed in smile, the pearls of her teeth did flash forth. This is indeed a strange pearl.

Thereupon the souls of them that are endued with understanding cried out a bitter cry. This is indeed a strange withdrawal. And every conceited doubter turned away from her. Who else but a strange disbeliever could this be? When she became aware of this she retired to her mansion, sorely grieved and lamenting. This is indeed a strange grief. Repeatedly did she appear, then retraced her steps. How glorified is her appearance and her retreat. This is indeed a strange decree.

And from the depths of her being she groaned with so vehement a cry that it might have caused the entire creation to perish and disappear. This is indeed a strange sadness. Then the fountain of living waters gushed forth from her lips, uttering words of admonition and rebuke. This is indeed a strange river of eternal life. Why repudiate Me, O people of the Book? she exclaimed. This is indeed a strange thing. Are ye of those that are guided aright? Regard ye yourselves as the loved ones of God? By the righteousness of the Almighty! This is indeed a strange imposture.

We will not return unto you, O concourse of the companions. This is indeed a strange return. We shall guard the secrets of God that are enshrined in His Scriptures and Books. This is indeed a commandment that the Almighty, the All-Bountiful hath ordained. And ye shall not find Me until the Promised One will have appeared on the Day of Return. I swear by My life! This is indeed a strange abasement.

O Hasan-i-Qabli-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God!

In His Name, the Ever-Abiding, the All-Sufficient!

For every matter there is an appointed time. When its hour comes, it appears with the truth and nothing can prevent it. Thus has it been ordained in a guarded Tablet. Can anyone outstrip it? No, by His binding Command, the Mighty, the Wise! Nothing escapes His knowledge, nor can the might of the oppressors frustrate Him. He does what He wishes by His sovereign authority and decrees what He wills. He is, verily, the Omnipotent, the Powerful. His Cause is not limited by the bounds of idle fancies nor by the vain imaginings of the doubtful ones. Can the veils of allusion prevent Him from what He desires? No, by His Beauty that shines upon all the worlds! His Cause has been sanctified from the laws of the people and what they possess. Blessed is he who recognizes the \[new creation\] in this wondrous Creation through which all in the heavens and earth were created anew. Were anyone to understand the meaning of new creation in this Revelation, he would soar with longing toward God, the One, the Peerless, the All-Informed. Say: This is the Remembrance that no remembrance can rival, and this is the Creation that no thought can encompass. Thus has the matter been decreed by the Pen of your Lord, the Chosen One, which We made the Herald of this Great Name. Those who have detached themselves from all else - these are they who have a portion of the knowledge of this most exalted, most mighty, most wondrous, most novel Station. Blessed is he who beholds My Cause with Mine own eyes - he is of those who know. Whoso gazes upon aught else or clings to what My creatures possess - he is far from My nearness and is debarred from knowing Me - he is of the perishing ones. O My loved ones! It behooves you to empty your hands of what the people possess. Thus have you been commanded in the Tablets from One All-Knowing, All-Wise. I created ears to hearken unto My call, hearts to turn to the Kaaba of My knowledge, and eyes to behold My luminous horizon. Will what they possess profit those who have been heedless of this Cause? No, by thy Lord, the Mighty, the Generous! Will what they cling to avail them this Day? No, by My beautiful Beauty! We shall show them wandering in the wilderness of error while punishment hastens after them, yet they are of the heedless ones. Those who have drunk the choice sealed wine from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Self-Subsisting - these are they whom nothing can prevent. They are indeed the triumphant ones. Through them was adorned the Tablet of Creation and beautified the Temple of Knowledge with the ornament of certitude. They are indeed the sincere ones. Say: O people! Seize these days! Beware lest what you possess prevent you from beholding the perspective of your Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Reflect on what will come upon you hereafter, that the circumstances of this world and what is therein may not grieve you, and that you may turn to the Dayspring of your Lord's grace, the Most High, the Most Great. Say: We counsel you for the sake of God. Your acceptance profits Us not, even as your rejection harms Us not. He is indeed independent of all created things. O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Give thanks to thy Lord for having aided thee to recognition in this Revelation wherein the Mount has proclaimed: "The Kingdom belongs to God, the One, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Inaccessible!" At all times do We remember the loved ones of the All-Merciful purely for the sake of God. Blessed is he who has found the fragrance of remembrance and is of the steadfast ones. Be not grieved by the hardships of the age. The greatest joy lies before you. With Him is the knowledge of all things, yet most people are among the ignorant. Thus have We adorned the crown of thy knowledge with the ornament of remembrance and its temple with the decoration of the Tablet. Thy Lord is verily the Forgiving, the Merciful.

He has revealed this for one who has ascended to the Supreme Companion, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The ocean of generosity has surged when the Supreme Pen moved in remembrance of one who ascended to the Most Glorious Horizon, as a grace from God and a mercy from Him. Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Through My remembrance the breeze of forgiveness has wafted from the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who has been mentioned and attained this Most Great Remembrance, at whose appearance all other remembrances bowed down. O Ahmad, upon thee be the glory of God and His mercy. Rejoice in what We have revealed for thee at this time, by which the Concourse on High and the dwellers of God's dominion, the Mighty, the Bestower, were attracted. Then give thanks for what We have sent down to thee, by which the inhabitants of the Kingdom soared in the atmosphere of loving-kindness and favors. By My life, whenever remembrance emerged from the mouth of the Divine Will in this Most Exalted Station, the ocean of grace surged and the fragrance of the mercy of the Lord of Lords was diffused. The hidden Light in Our Name, the Generous, and the treasured Spirit in Our Name, the Merciful, be upon thee, O thou at whose calamity the Tongue of Grandeur uttered the Most Great Word whereby were created creatures known to none save God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. I testify that thou didst drink the choice wine of understanding from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and didst turn to the horizon of Manifestation and didst hear the call of Him Who conversed on Sinai when most of the servants turned away. Through thee the fragrances of love were diffused and a gate of the gates of Paradise was opened when the Tongue of God, the Mighty, the Bestower, spoke thy name. I testify that thou didst believe in God when the Light shone forth from the horizon of Manifestation and didst acknowledge what was sent down from the Pen of Revelation in the Scriptures and Tablets. Thou didst hold fast to the Handle of Utterance such that the manifestations of pride and transgression, who cast the Command of God behind their backs and spoke that which caused the hearts of the people of understanding to lament, did not prevent thee. We bear witness that thou didst attain the light of certitude when the people were in heedlessness and perturbation. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the days of God and for being mentioned by His Most Exalted Pen when thou wert in Paradise with His chosen ones at eventide and at dawn. It behooveth every soul to say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God, O God of Utterance and Goal of all creation! I testify to the sanctification of Thy Being and the detachment of Thine Essence, and by Thy might and sovereignty and greatness and power, I beseech Thee, O my God, by the spirits that have ascended to the heaven of Thy grace and by the lights whereby the horizons of the hearts of Thy chosen ones were illumined, to ordain for Thy lovers that which shall gladden the hearts of the sincere ones among Thy friends and whereby the eyes of those who are near unto Thee among the Hands of Thy Cause shall be consoled. Then I beseech Thee by this treasure wherein Thou didst deposit a trust from Thee, and by his tomb and his love and his remembrance and his praise and his turning unto Thee and his submissiveness and his humility when reciting Thy most great verses and beholding Thy mighty signs, that Thou forgive me and my father and my mother, then open before my face the door of Thy mercy with the lamp of Thy grace and send down upon me from the heaven of Thy bounty the rains of Thy loving-kindness. O Lord! Thou seest me clinging to one of Thy loved ones whose mention was sent down from Thy Most Exalted Pen in Thy days and who heard Thy sweetest call from the horizon of the heaven of Thy Manifestation. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of the wonders of Thy grace and mercy which Thou hast ordained for those who hastened to the field of martyrdom, yearning to enter the precincts of Thy glory and to attain the court of Thy holiness. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.

Praised be Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by them who have circled round the throne of Thy will, and soared in the atmosphere of Thy good-pleasure, and turned with all their affections towards the Horizon of Thy Revelation and the Day-Spring of Thine inspiration, and the Dawning-Place of Thy names, to aid Thy servants to observe what Thou hast commanded them in Thy days--commandments through which the sacredness of Thy Cause will be demonstrated unto Thy servants and the affairs of Thy creatures and of Thy realm will be set aright.

I testify, O my God, that this is the Day whereon Thy testimony hath been fulfilled, and Thy clear tokens have been manifested, and Thine utterances have been revealed, and Thy signs have been demonstrated, and the radiance of Thy countenance hath been diffused, and Thy proof hath been perfected, and Thine ascendancy hath been established, and Thy mercy hath overflowed, and the Day-Star of Thy grace hath shone forth with such brilliance that Thou didst manifest Him Who is the Revealer of Thyself and the Treasury of Thy wisdom and the Dawning-Place of Thy majesty and power. Thou didst establish His covenant with every one who hath been created in the kingdoms of earth and heaven and in the realms of revelation and of creation. Thou didst raise Him up to such heights that the wrongs inflicted by the oppressors have been powerless to deter Him from revealing Thy sovereignty, and the ascendancy of the wayward hath failed to prevent Him from demonstrating Thy power and from exalting Thy Cause.

So highly didst Thou exalt Him that He openly delivered unto the kings Thy messages and commandments, and hath never for one moment sought His own protection, but striven to protect Thy servants from whatever might withhold them from approaching the kingdom of Thy nearness, and from setting their faces towards the horizon of Thy good-pleasure.

Thou seest, O my God, how, notwithstanding the swords that are drawn against Him, He calleth the nations unto Thee, and though Himself a prisoner summoneth them to turn in the direction of Thy gifts and bounties. With every fresh tribulation He manifested a fuller measure of Thy Cause, and exalted more highly Thy word.

I testify that through Him the Pen of the Most High was set in motion, and with His remembrance the Scriptures in the kingdom of names were embellished. Through Him Thy fragrances were wafted, and the sweet smell of Thy raiment was shed abroad amongst all the dwellers of the earth and the inmates of heaven. Thou seest and knowest full well, O my God, how He hath been made to dwell within the most desolate of cities, so that He may build up the hearts of Thy servants, and hath been willing to suffer the most grievous abasement, that Thy creatures may be exalted.

I pray Thee, O Thou Who causest the dawn to appear, by Thy Name through Which Thou hast subjected the winds, and sent down Thy Tablets, that Thou wilt grant that we may draw near unto what Thou didst destine for us by Thy favor and bounty, and to be far removed from whatsoever may be repugnant unto Thee. Give us, then, to drink from the hands of Thy grace every day and every moment of our lives of the waters that are life indeed, O Thou Who art the Most Merciful! Make us, then, to be of them who helped Thee when fallen into the hands of those Thine enemies who are numbered with the rebellious among Thy creatures and the wicked amidst Thy people. Write down, then, for us the recompense ordained for him that hath attained Thy presence, and gazed on Thy beauty, and supply us with every good thing ordained in Thy Book for such of Thy creatures as enjoy near access to Thee.

Brighten our hearts, O my Lord, with the splendor of Thy knowledge, and illumine our sight with the light of such eyes as are fixed upon the horizon of Thy grace and the Day-Spring of Thy glory. Preserve us, then, by Thy Most Great Name, Which Thou didst cause to overshadow such nations as lay claim to what Thou hast forbidden in Thy Book. This, verily, is what Thou didst announce unto us in Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets.

Cause us, then, to be so steadfast in our love towards Thee that we will turn to none except Thee, and will be reckoned amongst them that are brought nigh to Thee, and acknowledge Thee as One Who is exalted above every comparison and is holy beyond all likeness, and will lift up our voices amongst Thy servants and cry aloud that He is the one God, the Incomparable, the Ever-Abiding, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.

Strengthen Thou, O my Lord, the hearts of them that love Thee, that they may not be affrighted by the hosts of the infidels that are turned back from Thee, but may follow Thee in whatsoever hath been revealed by Thee. Aid them, moreover, to remember and to praise Thee, and to teach Thy Cause with eloquence and wisdom. Thou art He Who hath called Himself the Most Merciful. Ordain, then, O my God, for me and for whosoever hath sought Thee what beseemeth the excellence of Thy glory and the greatness of Thy majesty. No God is there but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.

O Jalal who has attained the presence and gained the victory! He is the One dawning from the horizon of the heaven of utterance. This is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down for those on earth, that He might acquaint them with His path, guide them to His evidence, and teach them that which will make them trustees and preserve them from the wretched ones. Thus was the matter decreed in the Book of Names by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O concourse of creation! The Promised Day hath come and that which was promised in the Books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, hath appeared. We have sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs, yet most of the people are in evident doubt.

O Jalal! Hearken unto the call of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, which hath been raised from the Prison. Verily it draweth thee nigh unto Him in all conditions. To this testifieth He with Whom is the clear Book. Thou didst turn to My horizon and attain My presence after My permission in numbered days, and at this time the command hath come from the Ancient Ordainer for thy return to thy home, that thou mayest remind the servants of the verses of thy Lord and acquaint them with His manifest and luminous path.

Say: O party of God! Be not grieved by the vicissitudes of the world, nor be ye disturbed by the might of the polytheists. Beware lest the veils of the heedless prevent you from turning toward God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: The world and its ornaments and favors and whatsoever hath been ordained therein shall pass away, but there shall remain for you that which hath flowed from the Pen of God, the Most High, in this exalted station.

Be thou eloquent in My praise, gazing toward My horizon and holding fast to My strong cord. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to adorn His servants with the ornament of virtues which hath been honored with the glory of acceptance and distinguished by the good-pleasure of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We make mention of My party and My loved ones who have circled round My Cause and cast aside all else besides Me and heard My sweetest call from My most exalted horizon and acted in accordance with that which they were commanded by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O My loved ones! Be as light in brightness and as a mountain in steadfastness and as a spirit, swift to soar in this atmosphere wherein wafteth the fragrance of My wondrous utterance. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken as a token of His grace, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. We desire for you naught save that which shall draw you nigh unto a station wherein the atoms proclaim that there is none other God besides Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty.

Beware that ye dispute not with anyone or contend with any heedless and remote soul. We counsel you with that wherewith God counseled His servants in the earliest days concerning trustworthiness and godliness and that whereby your stations shall be exalted among the peoples. To this testify My Books and My Scriptures and My Tablets and this luminous Tablet. God hath created you for the betterment of the world. To this doth testify this Lamp which proclaimeth at all times that there is none other God besides Him, the Powerful over what He willeth, the Protector of those in the heavens and on earth.

We make mention of thy mother and give her the glad-tidings of My remembrance of her. We beseech God to inscribe within her heart by the Pen of His handiwork: "This is a handmaiden of God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, and the Sovereign of His Day, the Mighty, the Wondrous." And We make mention of thy sister who hath ascended to the Supreme Companion. We beseech God to adorn her head with the crown of the words "Verily I am God's, the Lord of the Mighty Throne" and We beseech God to strengthen her and assist her and send down upon her the food of utterance at all times. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones.

The glory that hath dawned from the ocean of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon the servants of God who are steadfast and His steadfast handmaidens.

O Muhammad Isma'il Burunjani, in the name of the one loving God. Your letter was present before the Face and was honored by the glances of the Lord of Names. Blessed is the soul whose letter attained the presence of the Throne after being prevented from turning to it by what the hands of the oppressors had wrought. A word was observed in your letter which is in truth the perfect word, and ever shall be - if one succeeds in acting upon it, they will comprehend all good. And that is: "O my Lord, O Guide of my purposes, Thy good-pleasure." Ask God that you may remain firm in this word. Blessed is the one who drinks from this cup and is of those who know. The generosity of God is limitless and His grace endless. Never has there been, nor shall there be, any interruption in the outpouring of the All-Bountiful One. He has answered and will answer the needs of all. If in some instances there has been delay, it was for the good of that soul - assuredly they will attain to what is better than what they asked for. However, for those souls who truly hold fast to His good-pleasure, another station is ordained. Blessed are they, again blessed are they.

And in your letter was: "I see the heaven and the earth and the sea" etc. "all of them are signs of Thy power, like writing flowing from Thy pen; therefore there is no need for me to beseech Thee to send Thy writing." End quote.

Yes, in one sense this attribute can be and is applied to all things - that is, in all things the movement of the divine creative Pen is manifest and visible, and those possessed of insight behold it with both outer and inner vision. However, the existence of all things depends upon the movement of the Most Exalted Pen, and the nobility of all things lies in their relationship to it. Therefore all have been and ever shall be in need. The true believer in divine unity is one who sees all things as manifestations of God's primal sign, and beholds in all things the expressions of His names and attributes, while seeing that sign as sanctified above all things and sovereign over all things - how much more so the Truth Himself, exalted is He above being associated with His creation or known through aught else. If relationship were removed from existence, it would be sheer nothingness - how then could manifestation be attributed to it? All exists through Him and subsists by Him, while He is sanctified and exalted above all. There is no God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.

We counsel you, O loved ones of God, regarding the Most Great Trust among My servants and My creation. For through it the Cause of God is exalted among all else, and the sanctity of His Cause becomes manifest throughout the worlds. Be trustees among the servants - thus have We counseled them in the Tablets. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: Place your trust in all matters in the Truth, the All-Forgiving. Verily He gives to whomsoever He wishes whatsoever He wishes, and withholds from whomsoever He wishes what He desires. He is indeed the Powerful, the Mighty. Let not the affairs of the world grieve you. That which has been ordained for you is incomparable to anything else in creation, were you of those who know. Be steadfast in the Cause in such wise that the winds of those who lead astray will not cause you to slip.

He is God, exalted be His station in greatness and power!

By God! The essence of utterance confesses its powerlessness to mention our Chosen Lord. Neither hearts nor eyes can comprehend Him. We bear witness that there is no God but Him, acknowledging and confessing that which the Tongue of Eternity spoke before the creation of the world - that there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And peace, manifest from the Abode of Peace, and light, shining from the horizon of the heaven of the favor of the Lord of all beings, be upon His Prophets and His chosen ones, through whom were opened the gates of knowledge and understanding in the contingent world, and every heedless one turned toward the ocean of certitude; and upon Him by whom the Frequented Temple was adorned and the horizon of manifestation was illumined; and upon His family and companions, through whom every seated one arose, every foundation was strengthened, every mystery appeared, and every wise command was revealed.

The servant beseeches his Lord to assist all to achieve what He loves and is pleased with in this Day wherein the unity of religion has been scattered and the pillar of certitude has been shaken, inasmuch as the servants have violated God's Covenant and His Testament, denied God's favor and His Cause, and disputed His signs and His authority.

Glory be to Thee, O Thou at separation from Whom the eyes of them that are nigh unto Thee have wept and the hearts of the sincere ones have yearned! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy grace not to look upon them and what they have wrought in Thy land, but rather to the heaven of Thy generosity and the sun of Thy bestowal. O Lord! Aid Thy servants to act in accordance with what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book and with what will profit them in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Munificent, the Bestower, the All-Generous.

Thereafter, your letter has been received time after time. Until now, whatever has been seen has been answered despite lack of opportunity. Praise be to God, you have attained to His bounty and are occupied with His mention and praise. God willing, you shall remain steadfast in service under all conditions, in such wise that earthly concerns and their vicissitudes shall not prevent you nor hold you back from good deeds. Be thou in all circumstances turned toward the Most Sublime Horizon and placing thy trust in God, the Lord of all mankind. This evanescent servant beseeches the True One, exalted be His glory, to cause you to attain that from which the fragrance of eternity may be inhaled. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Powerful, the Almighty. He heareth the call of His servants, and He is the Hearing, the Answering.

One day they said that Abu'l-Hasan, upon him be His glory, should observe the good-pleasure of the Afnan. This is what We previously commanded him. End. Praise be to God, all that hath proceeded from you thus far hath been acceptable in the presence of the Countenance. All the parties of the world are seen today to be heedless, save whom God willeth. Blessed art thou, for thou hast drunk from the cup of bounty and attained unto the Goal. Well is it with thee and with everyone who hath attained that which is mentioned in His Mighty Book.

Convey greetings and felicitations to the honored gentlemen. God willing, may it be accepted. Convey greetings on behalf of this evanescent one to the loved ones of that land. God willing, may all act as befitteth and be occupied with and gladdened by the mention of the True One, exalted be His glory. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings.

Praised be Thou, O my God, that Thou hast been true to what the Pen of Thy Revelation hath inscribed upon the Tablets sent down by Thee unto them Whom Thou hast chosen above all Thy creatures, and through Whom Thou hast unlocked the doors of Thy mercy, and shed abroad the radiance of the light of Thy guidance. Glory to Thee that Thou hast laid bare what had from eternity been wrapped up within the Tabernacle of Thy majesty, Thine omnipotence and glory, and through which Thou hadst decked forth the heaven of Thy Revelation and adorned the pages of the book of Thy testimony.

And when the Pledge was fulfilled and the Promised One appeared, He was rejected by such of Thy servants as profess to have believed in Him in Whom Thy Godhead was manifested, Whom Thou didst ordain to be the Herald of this Revelation, and through Whose advent the eyes of the inmates of the sanctuary of Thy unity were cheered.

I know, O my Lord, neither their reasoning with which they have acknowledged Thee and believed in Thy signs, nor their argument whereby they have repudiated Thy sovereignty. Every time I call them to Thee and say: "O people! Consider the utterances of the Lord your God which are in your possession and those that have been sent down from the heaven of His will and power," they cavil at Thee, and turn their backs to Thee, though -- as Thou art aware --each of the words that have gone out of the mouth of Thy will sheddeth the fragrance of the breaths of Thy mercy.

Some have chosen to cleave to him who is counted unworthy to converse with any of Thy servants that watch at Thy door (Mirza Yahya), how much more to enter into the court in which the Tongue of Thy majesty speaketh. Cleanse Thou their hearts and their eyes, O my Lord, that they may see with their eyes and understand with their hearts, that haply they may be attracted by Thine utterances to the Day-Spring of Thine inspiration, and draw nigh unto the soft-flowing stream of Thy knowledge.

Thou art He, O my Lord, Who hath, in every line of Thy Book, entered into covenant with them for me, and made it so sure that none of Thy creatures can any longer evade it. Thou didst say -- and Thy word is the truth: "One single letter from Him excelleth all that hath been sent down in the Bayan."

Thou dost consider, therefore, O my God, how they have transgressed against Thy Cause, and beholdest what their hands have wrought in Thy days. They have so grievously wronged me that the Lote-Tree of Thy Revelation moaneth, and the inmates of the Tabernacle of Thy majesty and the dwellers of the cities of Thy names lament. I know not, O my God, for what reason they have risen up to oppress me, and by what proof they have turned aside from Him Who is the Day-Spring of Thy signs. I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of all names and the Creator of the heavens, to aid them to act equitably in Thy Cause, that haply they may discover the sweet smell of the robe of Thy mercy, and set their faces towards the horizon that shineth with the brightness of the light of Thy face. Weak are they, O my Lord, and Thou art the Lord of strength and power. They are but paupers, and Thou art the All-Possessing, the Most Generous.

Thou art well aware, O my God, that throughout my life I have sought no advantage for myself. I have offered up my spirit and my whole being for the exaltation of Thy word amidst Thy creatures and the glorification of Thy name among Thy servants. Thou didst send me with such a Testimony that they Who are the Exponents of Thy Revelation and the Day-Springs of Thine inspiration were stirred up with vehement longing. Through it, Thy proof was established, and Thy bounty fulfilled, and Thy Cause perfected, and Thine utterances released, and Thy clear tokens uncovered.

Thou knowest, O my God, that I have wished only what Thou hast wished, and desire what Thou dost desire. Were I to speak forth before Thy servants the things wherewith Thou didst, through Thy bounty, inspire me and which Thou didst command me to utter amidst Thy creatures, the oppressors among Thy people would cavil at me. And were I to hold my peace and cease to celebrate the wonders of Thy praise, all the limbs of my body would be stirred up to extol Thee. I know not what the water is with which Thou didst create me, or what the fire Thou didst kindle within me. I swear by Thy glory! I shall not cease to mention Thee, though all that are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth rise up against me. Thee will I magnify, in all circumstances, with a heart wholly rid of all attachment to the world and all that is therein.

Praised be Thou, the Well-Beloved of the hearts of all such as have recognized Thee.

He is the Mighty! This is the Book of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. It hath been sent down in truth from the presence of One mighty and well-beloved, and it speaketh the truth in the kingdom of eternity and in the heaven of heaven that there is none other God but Him. He quickeneth whom He willeth through His grace, and unto Him shall all return. His is the creation and the command, and all things are preserved with Him in a guarded Book. O Ha' before Sin! Hearken unto the call of Him Who summoneth thee from the heaven of divine command, and be not of those who are not guided by the signs of God. Say: By God the Truth! The veil of holy garments hath been rent asunder and the Youth of the Spirit hath appeared with the beauty of God, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Beware lest thou consort with those from whom thou canst not detect the fragrance of love from this diffused and manifest musk. Leave them to themselves, for they are blind to the Cause and deaf to the Word, and they perceive not. Say: By God! Ye have dwelt behind the veils of fancy in your days, such that ye understood not God's purpose in His hidden Tablet. Thus do We expound the verses unto thee lest the opposition of those who have disbelieved and joined partners with God and who have turned back on their heels should turn thee aside from thy Lord's path. And thou, seek refuge in God thy Lord, then suffice thyself with Him apart from all else, for He will suffice thee against all who are in the heavens and the earth and against all that was and will be. He will preserve thee as He preserved thee before, and will provide thee with that wherewith He hath provided none save those who turn toward the holy precincts and who direct themselves to the sacred quarter. Thus doth God exalt whom He willeth and aid whom He willeth through His grace, for He is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. And when thou seest the Sacrifice who hath come forth from prison, glorify Him on Our behalf, then give him glad tidings with a remembrance from Us, that he may be of those who rejoice in God's glad tidings. Say: O servant! Give thanks to God thy Creator for having delivered thee from prison, then strive not to enter another prison and be not of those who abide eternally imprisoned within themselves. Say: We observed thee aforetime in mighty delusion such that thou didst appear before God thy Lord yet wast unaware of it and wast among the heedless. Therefore did We veil Our face from thee and conceal it behind a thousand veils lest thou and the eyes of the weak should discover it. Say: O servant! Rend asunder the veils of fancy, then emerge from behind the veil with manifest sovereignty. And if thou art powerless to do this by thyself, then seek help through My Name, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. Then in the beginning of the matter, deliver thyself, then the servants of God, and be God's herald among His creatures and remind them with thy loudest voice and fear no one, but put thy trust in God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Say: O people! Be fair with yourselves before God and be not among the opposers. Then recite unto them what was revealed unto Muhammad the Messenger of God in a clear Arabic tongue. None dispute concerning the signs of God save those who disbelieve. Thus was it sent down in truth from One mighty and beautiful. O people! Fear God and dispute not concerning His verses when they are sent down through grace, and be not among the prodigal. Thus doth the Dove of Holiness teach you and counsel you with truth lest ye be among the heedless.

In the Name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Holy, the Most High, the Most Exalted. This is a Book from the Prisoner to him who believed in the Spirit in His days and was quickened by the Most Great Word whereby all who are in the heavens and earth were terrified, except the servants of God, the near ones, whose faces shine between the heavens and earth even as the face of the sun shineth from a horizon of manifest glory. These are servants whose faces were not changed on the Day when the faces of those who hesitated in God's Cause, the King, the Mighty, the Great, were darkened. These are servants the like of whom the eye of creation hath not seen, and through them the clouds of inner meanings were raised up and rained upon the breasts of the chosen ones that which purified them from the allusions of the deniers. Know then that most of the people of the Bayan rose up against God and denied Him in Whom they had believed, and were among the losers. Say: O people, do ye imagine within yourselves that ye believed in the Revelation of 'Ali (the Bab)? Nay, by His Self, the All-Knowing, the Wise! For had ye believed in Him, ye would not have denied these verses which have descended from the heaven of mighty glory. Say: Fear God and wrong not the Manifestation of His Cause. He hath indeed come to you with the truth and calleth you unto it, desiring naught save to draw you nigh unto God, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old. Fear God, O people, and dispute not about the verses of God after their revelation. Purify your ears from that which ye have heard that ye may hearken unto the melodies of God, the Mighty, the Wondrous, the Inaccessible. Say: O people, do ye adduce God's verses to prove what is with you, and then slay His very Self? What aileth you, O heedless ones! And thou, O servant, hearken unto the words of thy Lord, then detach thyself from all else besides Him, then thank Him at all times for having caused thee to recognize the Manifestation of His Self and made thee one of the sincere ones. Then convey the Cause of thy Lord with wisdom and utterance, that perchance the people may remember the mention of their Creator and be of the steadfast. God hath prescribed unto everyone the duty of teaching His Cause. Verily there is no Commander but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all are preserved with Him in a mighty Book. Grieve not over any matter but place thy trust in all things in Him. He sendeth down what is ordained for every soul, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Not an atom's weight escapeth His knowledge, and with Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earths. Remember thy Lord throughout all days and be not veiled from Him. Indeed His remembrance is better than whatsoever hath been created in the realm of existence, wert thou of them that know. Through His remembrance souls find peace and the hearts of them that remember are gladdened. Then remember this Prisoner and what hath befallen Him from those who circled round Him at eventide and at dawn. Thus hath God revealed what was hidden in their breasts before His servants who seek Him. He who prided himself on My name and whom We taught throughout days and nights hath pronounced sentence of death against Me out of hatred for God Who created him and created all things by His firm and mighty command. And if thou findest the loved ones of God, remind them from Me, then glorify God before their faces, that perchance through this glorification they may turn with their hearts to the court of their Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate, and that they may remember My tribulation and My grief and My imprisonment and My trials at the hands of these oppressors. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have laid hold on the Sure Handle in the days of God, the King, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. And praise be to God, the Beloved of them that know.

O Mulla Baqir! In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Exalted, the Most High! This is an epistle from the Prisoner unto him who hath believed in God and hath been numbered among those who profess His unity in the Tablets. O servant! Hearken unto the call of this Wronged One from the precincts of thy Lord's throne, the All-Merciful, that He may purify thee from the allusions of the peoples of the worlds, and sanctify thee from the manifestations of Satan, and cause thee to turn toward the countenance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, and enable thee to soar in an atmosphere which God hath sanctified from the winds of every malicious polytheist. Say: O people! By God, the Truth, the Most Great Treasure of God hath appeared, and the Primal Point hath been detailed, and the dominion of God hath been manifested with sovereign might and majesty. Fear ye God, O people, and be God-fearing in this Cause. If ye believe not in Him, oppose Him not, nor be ye tyrannical and wretched. He hath sacrificed His soul for all who are in the heavens and on earth out of His love for God Who created all things by His command - thus hath it been sent down in tablets of mighty, impregnable glory. Say: Verily the Sun of the Primal One hath risen in truth from this Most Glorious Horizon and calleth out to you: O people! Be ye ashamed before My beauty and deny not Him of Whom We informed you in all the Tablets - but for Him I would not have revealed a single letter nor uttered a single word, and God is witness unto this. Say: When He appeared in truth, the polytheists opposed Him and spoke concerning Him that which those who disbelieved before had not spoken, and were rebellious against their Lord's command. Know then that God created the tongue for remembrance and utterance - emerge thou from behind the veils of silence and speak in praise of thy Lord. He will verily protect thee through hosts of the unseen with mighty power. We have forbidden the servants from discord and corruption and commanded them to unity, yet they have abandoned that which they were bidden and committed that which they were forbidden in a mighty tablet. Say: O people! Fear ye God and commit not that which ye have been forbidden, for God hath sent Me to gather you upon an ancient shore of glory and draw you nigh unto the Self of the All-Merciful and bring you to a station wherefrom the Sun of utterance was witnessed from its horizon. I desire naught from you, for My reward is with Him Who sent Me and commissioned Me with the truth with manifest sovereignty. And thou - arise thou in the Cause of God and His remembrance, leave all else behind thee, and place thy trust in Him. He will suffice thee against all who dwell on earth. Say: O concourse of polytheists! Die in your wrath! The clouds have been rent asunder and the Youth hath come with the hosts of divine inspiration with a white radiance that shineth with truth. Those who have denied these verses while claiming to believe in what was revealed in the Bayan - by God, the Primal Point curseth them and all things laugh at them, and none denieth this save one whose heart is aflame with the fire of hatred and hath taken Satan as his path. I complain unto thee of those who have wrought corruption in the earth without leave from Us, and for this reason have We withheld the Tablets from being sent to every discerning believer. Be thou assured by thy Lord's grace, then gaze upon thy Lord's countenance, the Most High, with penetrating vision. Thus have We cast upon thee the word of truth that thou mayest be at peace within thyself and stand firm in the truth. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who have detached themselves from all else and have ascended to a luminous and glorious station.

In the name of God, the Most High, the Single, the One, the Powerful.

This is a Book sent down in truth. Verily it is a remembrance for all the worlds, wherein floweth that which shall quench their thirst with the Living Waters that stream forth by the command of God, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Compelling.

O people! Hear My call from the right side of the Divine Throne, the Spot from which hath appeared all goodness from time immemorial and from which shall appear every wondrous command unto the end that hath no end. God commandeth you to be submissive before His Most Great Gate and forbiddeth you from committing unseemly acts. Fear God, O people, and cast not My ways behind your backs, and be not of the heedless. Remember Me at eventide and at dawn, then at morn and at sunset. All things are quickened through His remembrance, were ye of those who know. Dispute not about any matter, but rather convey the Cause of your Lord, the All-Merciful, unto both the lowly and the noble. This hath been prescribed for every soul, if ye be of those who act. Convey the Message, O people, in a spirit of joy and fragrance. Beware lest ye dispute with anyone or be among the violent. Whoso guideth a soul through the Books of God shall have the recompense of one who hath striven in His path and been among the martyrs.

Blessed art thou, O Ashraf, in that thou hast been honored once again and hast entered the Garden of Paradise time after time, and art among the successful ones. God hath ordained for thee abundant good, and verily He rewardeth whomsoever He willeth with a goodly reward, and He is the Fulfiller of the recompense of those who turn unto Him.

Muhammad Baqir in the letter Kaf, son of Aqa Muhammad 'Ali - He is the Mighty. This is a Book wherein is mentioned every good thing detailed from God, the Exalted, the Great, and wherein every soul receives its portion according as it is, if ye be of them that understand. Blessed is he who withholds not from himself that which is ordained for him and is of them that are detached. We beseech God at all times that He shut not the gates of mercy before his face and cut not off from him that which descendeth from the heaven of mighty, resplendent glory. Thus have We commanded the servants from a beginning that hath no beginning, and thus do We command them now, if ye be of them that understand. Then know thou that thy letter hath come before Us and We have learned what was therein, and We were among the witnesses. We have ordained for thee as recompense therefor in the heaven of holiness abundant good which none among the worlds can reckon. Thus have We shown favor unto thee even as We showed favor unto Our near-serving servants, that thou mayest rejoice in thy soul and be steadfast in the love of thy Lord. Verily there is no God but He and He is the protector of the doers of good. We have learned in thy letter how thou hast made for Us a couch of woven damask and desired to send it unto Us, that thou mightest be of them that send gifts. Know thou that We have accepted it from thee and We beseech God to recompense thee from Us with a goodly recompense and to bestow upon thee the knowledge of His Self, and this is better than whatsoever is in the heavens and earths. However, after accepting it We have bestowed it back upon thee, for We have desired to sit upon the earth in this remote prison, and silk carpets befit not the imprisoned one, if ye be of them that understand. And if thou art not content with this, then send it to Our name the penitent one that he may do what is intended. Thus have We commanded thee in this Tablet that thou mayest be of them that act. Remind thyself and then thy father not to be heedless of that which the Spirit cast upon him when he was seated before God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful, and not to doubt what We have revealed unto him, that he may be of them that are firmly established. Say: By God, thou hast attained unto that which none in all the worlds hath attained, for when people came before God they knew Him not, and therefore attained not unto that which thou hast attained according as thou wert, and thus none shall surpass thee if thou be of them that are certain. Be thou steadfast in thy love to such degree that were all who are on earth to draw swords against thee and the Samiri to call thee to all that is on earth with every manifest deception, thou wouldst stand against them through God's power and sovereignty and God's might and glory in such wise that thou wouldst neither be troubled in thy soul nor would thine eye turn away from this blessed and luminous Face. And when thou art adorned with what We have cast upon thee of the comprehensive Word, thou wilt be able to soar with Me in the realms of eternity, a station unto which neither the birds of hearts nor minds of the unitarians can soar. Thus have We inspired thee and taught thee and cast upon thee that which will preserve thee from the darts of satans. Preserve thou this Tablet and recite it most days lest thou become heedless of what God hath willed for thee therein and be of them that are detached. And the Spirit and Glory be upon thee and upon thy father and upon all who have believed in God and His signs, whether female or male, young or old.

May His honor 'Ali-Qabli-Nabil, upon him be the Glory of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Resplendent, take note:

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious! The luminous leaf that was adorned with the ornament of divine love, and from whose sublime and lofty words the fragrance of your sincerity for the sake of God, the Lord of Lords, was inhaled, reached this servant of the Lord of creation with wondrous joy and boundless delight. Praise be to God, it was observed to be a firm sign and most perfect and unerring proof of your degrees of love and self-effacement and nothingness and steadfastness in the Cause of the Ancient King. By the Most Holy, Most Exalted Being I swear that there is no station greater than that all should manifest utter nothingness and pure servitude, and arise with complete dedication to serve the Cause. Praise and glory be to Him that you have been and continue to be aided and blessed by God with this supreme gift and mighty favor. That which has ever been pleasing in the sight of God and the means for servants to ascend to the Kingdom of righteousness and their rising to the heaven of the providence of the Lord of creation, has been that the sincere servants should in no aspect, whether outward or inward, be focused on themselves, but rather should in truth observe themselves in all degrees to be utter nothingness and pure evanescence, so that all souls may, through the training of these sanctified beings, turn from the left hand of selfish desires and human inclinations to the right hand of piety and the Most Glorious Horizon. If these souls who have quaffed the purest wine and are mentioned as the first of creation before the Truth were to be conscious of self even less than can be imagined, they would surely be deprived of the hidden divine favors and forbidden the endless fruits ordained for them in the worlds of the divine Command. These souls must move among people in such wise that none would imagine they possess life, much less any other stations. We beseech God to aid all to attain this station in such wise that we may be utterly detached from ourselves and speak with every tongue and every utterance and every melody in His mighty, exalted remembrance.

Furthermore, the petition that was submitted to the threshold of the Divine Throne was presented before the Ancient Beauty. Perfect bounty hath shone forth from the Dayspring of grace. God willing, an answer will hereafter be revealed and sent according to the behest of the sovereign Will. The Branches of the Divine Lote-Tree, may my spirit be sacrificed for the dust of their sacred feet, remember you with wondrous, exalted mention and with sublime greetings, and likewise those who circle round the manifest Throne all send their greetings. Ever write the details of affairs in full, for although they are visible before the Throne, yet We ever desire that you describe your circumstances in detail outwardly, that it may gladden the heart of this evanescent one. Furthermore, convey to his honor your father, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, limitless expressions of sincerity and most wondrous, elevated and sublime greetings from this ephemeral servant. Likewise remember with endless divine praise all the loved ones of God who have drunk from the chalice of steadfastness and independence in the Cause of the King of grandeur and majesty and who in all conditions look to the Lord of beginning and end. Verily the glory be upon you and upon them.

He is the Remembering, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed

O Abu'l-Fadl! Hearken unto what the Wronged One mentions to thee from the direction of the Prison, and calls thee to God, the Single, the All-Informed. This is a Day wherein none is mentioned save God alone, as testified by the Tongue of Grandeur in His Mighty Book. Blessed is the soul that hath not been veiled by the doubts of the divines nor been prevented by the intimations of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the worlds. Verily those who have violated the Covenant of God and His testament have no portion of this Sea, from whose waves is heard: "There is no God but Him, the Single, the All-Informed." Bear thou witness to that which God hath witnessed, detached from all who are on earth. Thus doth He Who speaketh at all times teach thee that there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

In the Persian tongue, hearken! This Day is the Day whose mention hath been recorded and inscribed in all the divine Books, and that which is specially reserved for this Most Great Revelation hath been repeatedly revealed from the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book. Every soul must behold with his own eyes and none hath any excuse today regarding that which proceedeth from the Ancient Tongue. The Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - declareth: "I have taken an essence in His mention, which is that He cannot be indicated by any indication, nor by what hath been revealed in the Bayan." Were anyone to meditate on this decisive utterance, he would attain unto a drop from the ocean of knowledge. By the life of God! All the seas of the earth together cannot equal that drop, yet most of the people are heedless. Say: O people of the earth! He Who was promised in the Books of God hath come. Cast aside what ye possess and take hold of what ye have been commanded by an All-Knowing Ordainer. Say: He hath no need of mention of the past or future to prove His Cause, and when He citeth certain expressions of the past and utterances of the chosen ones in certain instances, this is a grace from Him, for He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous. None hath ever been acquainted with the root of this Cause. By the life of God! Whosoever hath claimed such knowledge is recorded among the liars in the Clear Tablet. Thou thyself art aware that every matter hath appeared from this Dawning-Place and unto it doth return. Beseech ye God - exalted be His glory - to grant the servants sight and bestow upon them a portion from the ocean of fairness, that all the peoples of the earth may become aware and bear witness unto that which God hath ordained. God willing, thou shouldst summon the people of the contingent world to the horizon of the All-Merciful with the utmost joy and fragrance, wisdom and utterance.

Say: Beware, O people of the earth, lest the veils of names prevent you from the Creator of the heavens. Cast behind you your vain imaginings, then approach with radiant faces the Most Exalted Horizon, and be not of the heedless ones. Say: Know ye the value of this wondrous Day. This is a Day wherein man is able to acquire that which shall endure throughout the kingdoms of earth and heaven. We counsel all to steadfastness supreme, for the hateful ones and the treacherous lie in wait. Therefore ask thou God to protect His servants from the evil of those who have turned away from God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.

He is the Consoler, the All-Merciful, the Generous

O My handmaiden and My leaf! Upon thee be My glory! We have heard thy call and have answered thee with this luminous Tablet which We have made the bearer of My grace that hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. We make mention of the leaf whom We named 'Azziyyih, who attained Our presence and won victory in the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. We make mention of her and of those handmaidens who have believed in God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. We make mention of all My handmaidens at this hour wherein the tongue of grandeur hath spoken before the faces of the people that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of the leaf who heard My call and responded, who beheld My verses and turned unto them. We testify that she believed in God and His verses, acknowledged that which hath been sent down from His presence, and confessed His manifestation, His emergence and His sovereignty. We testify that she was attracted by the call of God in the earliest days, responded and was set ablaze by the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree in such wise that the reins of her free will were taken from her grasp. We have heard her crying out in the days and her yearning in the morning hours.

O My Pen! When thou desirest to make mention of her and to visit her, turn thy face toward God's loving-kindness and say: The first light that shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of bounty and the first utterance that was voiced by the Tongue of Grandeur - upon thee, O leaf of the Tree of Faithfulness! I bear witness that, due to thy remoteness from the court of nearness, thy liver was consumed, thy joy was turned to sorrow and great was thy calamity. Blessed art thou, O My handmaiden and My leaf, and blessed is the handmaiden who draweth nigh unto thee and visiteth thee, by virtue of that which the Most Exalted Pen hath spoken on this dark night. We beseech God to ordain for all who visit thee the reward of him who hath winged his flight from his homeland, seeking the most exalted homeland beneath the canopies of the grandeur of the Lord of all men. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee!

We testify, and the near ones and the sincere ones bear witness, that separation hath consumed thee, such that thy sighs have ascended and thy tears have fallen in the nights and days. The heat of love hath encompassed all thy limbs. Thou art she who hath taken the cup of love and drunk therefrom in the name of God, the Possessor of Creation. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon thee at every moment a mercy from His presence and a blessing from His own Self. He is verily the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

O My handmaiden and My leaf! Thou art in the Most Exalted Paradise while the Lord of all men maketh mention of thee in the prison of 'Akka. By the life of God! Through My remembrance of thee the ocean of thy Lord's mercy hath surged and the fragrance of loving-kindness and favors hath wafted - a bounty from God, the Possessor of this sublime station. Joy be unto thee, O My handmaiden, and peace be upon thee, O My leaf, and mercy be upon thee, O thou whose liver was melted in separation from Me! We beseech God to inscribe for thee in the Tablet, by the Most Glorious Pen, the reward of attaining His presence. He is verily the Creator of the heavens and the Possessor of the Kingdom of Names. There is none other God but Him, the Hearer, the Answerer.

Glory be unto Thee, O my God and the God of all names, my Goal and the Goal of all who are in earth and heaven! I beseech Thee by the resplendent Light and by Thy firm, penetrating Command to forgive me and my parents. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the blood of the lovers in the land of Ya and by their patience and steadfastness in Thy good-pleasure, and by this most pure Shrine, to fulfill my needs and the needs of Thy servants who have turned unto Thee and have taken hold of Thy Book. Thou art verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the All-Wise, the All-Eloquent

O Jamal, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High! Repeatedly hath thy mention been made, verses revealed, evidences manifested, and the Sun of loving-kindness hath dawned from the horizon of bounty and the light of grace hath shone forth. Glory be to God! The Sun of certitude is shining from the highest horizon of the world and the Dove of Utterance is warbling upon the loftiest branches. Nevertheless, the people are occupied with calumnies and speak forth falsehoods. The lies of the past have come forth and what was rent asunder hath been replaced by that which is even more grievous. The unfair Dawlat-Abadi hath turned from the sweet and flowing waters to fetid pools, and hath clung to calumnies instead of the revealed verses. Unwittingly he hath done what the former party never did. At every moment some discord appeareth and some cawing is raised. The former party for years had beseeched and yearned for His manifestation from God, exalted be His glory, yet when they found the gates of meeting opened, consider what they did and what they said. In truth the pen and tongue are ashamed to mention it. And this heedless man, namely Dawlat-Abadi, speaketh and uttereth the vain imaginings of that party. He hath again afflicted these ignorant servants with the calumnies of the past and continueth to do so. It is not known by what proof he professeth belief in the Primal Point while turning away from the path of God. In any case, heedless souls were not and are not worthy of mention. We beseech God to assist the loved ones to accomplish that which will cause the exaltation of His blessed Word. We ask God to open upon thy face and upon those who love thee for the sake of God the gates of loving-kindness, ease, grace and bounty. Verily He is the Lord of all names and He is the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: My God, my God! Thou seest me standing before the door of Thy grace, seeking the wonders of Thy generosity and bounty. I beseech Thee by Thy Cause through which Thou didst send down the heavenly table to Thy servants and caused the rain of Thy mercy to shower upon Thy creation, to send down from the clouds of the heaven of Thy generosity upon this servant of Thine a blessing from Thee and a bounty from Thy presence and a mercy from Thy side. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

Convey My greetings to him who was named Husayn who attained Our presence and won the victory when the Wronged One was in the Most Great Prison through what the hands of the heedless had wrought, and to My loved ones who have not broken My covenant and My testament. We make mention of thy family in this station and give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness - the greatest loving-kindness and the most mighty bounty concerning her was that the Hands of the Cause of God, exalted be His glory, assisted and aided her and caused her to attain His presence. It behooveth thee and her and him who was named ?ubu'llah to thank your Lord night and day. Verily He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. The honored Ibn-i-'A??ar and Buzurg, upon them be My glory and loving-kindness, have attained and circle round My throne in My days, entering by permission and departing by permission. Blessed are they both. We beseech God to assist them to stand firm in this mighty Cause. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon whoever heareth thy words concerning this Most Great Cause whereby the limbs of the nations have quaked. Verily thy Lord is the Speaker, the Rememberer, the Expositor, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O beloved of my heart and joy of my soul! The gift arrived - praise be to God, praise be to God! And all benefited from it - thanks be to God, thanks be to God! You wrote about its good and bad qualities with detailed criticism. God forgive! God forgive! Then God forgive such extensive criticism!

Once His Holiness David wished to meet a thankful person. He observed someone who had taken some wheat and barley mixed together and ground it between two stones until it became like flour. Then he kneaded it and made a loaf, and made a fire from some straw. After the flames died down, he placed the loaf on the embers. When it was partially cooked, he took it off and placed it in his lap. Taking the first morsel, he said: "In the name of God and by God! O Lord, my God! How can I thank Thee? I did not plant this wheat, nor did I know of it. I did not tend its cultivation, nor was I aware of its harvesting. Yet Thou bestowed it upon me through Thy special favors and bounties. I eat that for which I have not labored in the least. This is naught but Thy boundless generosity." In such case, how can this evanescent one mention a blessing that appeared before him without any effort on his part and from which he partook? Even favorable mention would cause embarrassment, let alone anything else. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to count these servants among the thankful ones.

Once this exalted word was heard from the tongue of the Lord of Names. He said that one of the chosen ones asked a mystic: "How are you faring?" He replied: "When we find food we eat, and when we lack it we are patient." He said: "This is the way of our dogs - when they find food they eat, and when they do not they are patient." The mystic asked: "How then do you and your friends fare?" He replied: "When we find something we share it, and when we lack we give thanks."

In such case, one melts away at the mention of anything that carries the slightest scent of unacceptability, let alone stating it explicitly. This is a station where allusion has no place and investigation falls short. However, for the sake of expressing truth and teaching and learning, the truth must be told, which is that your bread was somewhat blackened on the surface, redolent of the fragrance of the loved ones of the world. And since it was adorned with the ornament of patience, it became somewhat excessive - sourness overcame it, lest it harm those of bilious temperament. Furthermore, like the nobles of Iran it had substance - that is, it was heavy and weighty. In any case, we thank God and we thank you, for He says "If ye thank Me, I will thank you." When God renders thanks, His servants are even more worthy to thank one another.

In brief, these were the minor incidents regarding the bread that were mentioned. The detailed account shall await the time of presence. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings.

O Khalil who hath attained Our presence and won the crown of victory, upon him be the Glory of God. He is the Hearer, the Answerer.

O Khalil! Upon thee be My glory and the glory of them that have turned towards God, the Lord of all worlds. We were seated upon the Throne when We heard the call from the right-hand side saying that Khalil maketh mention of thee. Thereupon did My tongue speak thy praise at this hour wherein the Sun of Utterance hath shone forth from the horizon of the Divine Will, as a token of My favor unto thee and unto them that are with thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.

We have made mention of thee before, and of the days thou didst spend beneath the canopies of grandeur. Verily nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Thy letter hath come before Us and We have heard that wherewith thou didst call upon God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. We have answered thee with verses which God hath made the ornament adorning the brocade of the Book of Divine Unity, which hath been sent down from the heaven of the Mother Book in this most exalted station. By My life! There hath been ordained for thee from My Most Exalted Pen that which nothing in all creation can equal. Verily thy Lord is the True One, the Faithful.

We beseech Him, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for thee that which will exalt thee through His Name, and cause thee to drink from the Kawthar of life at all times, and to inscribe for thee from His Most Exalted Pen that which shall be as a light before thy face in every world of His worlds. He is verily the Mighty, the All-Bountiful, the Powerful.

O Khalil! Hearken in the Persian tongue unto the call of the Wronged One. Today that which was hidden in the breasts and concealed in the eyes hath become manifest and visible. In the great city there appeared that which was concealed from all. Verily He hath revealed what He willed, that the people might know the stations of those who denied the Day of Judgment. Every day, through the deception of the Isle, they have attributed and continue to attribute treachery to the dawning-places of trustworthiness and assurance. They have unjustly consumed the substance of the people and have uttered that which none before them had ever uttered.

Say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me unto the city wherein Thy call was raised, Thy clear tokens were revealed, and Thy verses were sent down. Thanks and glory be unto Thee for having given the glad-tidings unto Thy loved ones of the appearance of Thy mighty Message and Thy Cause that dominateth all who are in the heavens and on earth. I beseech Thee by Thy light that hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy grace, and by the Fire through which Thou didst deliver Thy Cause and manifest the oneness of Thine Essence, to ordain for me that which I have desired from the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy bestowals. O my Lord! Thou seest Khalil clinging fast unto Thy firm and mighty cord, and holding to the hem of Thy mercy, O Lord of all worlds. I beseech Thee to ordain for him that which shall endure as long as Thine own names endure, and shall be immortalized in Thy Books and Thy Tablets. Moreover I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Ordainer of all things and their Sovereign, to assist the heedless to return unto the gate of Thy mercy and to arise before the court of Thy pardon and bounty. Verily Thou art the Almighty over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of God's mercy be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and upon them that love thee and hearken unto thy word concerning this mighty Cause. At this moment We make mention of him who hath been named 'Abdu'l-Karim - upon him be the Glory of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise - that he may rejoice in My remembrance of him and find assurance through the loving-kindness of his Lord, the Most Generous. We give him the glad-tidings of Our favor unto him and Our remembrance of him from this quarter of Our mighty Prison. Glory be upon him and upon them that are with him and have acknowledged that which hath appeared and shone forth from the horizon of God's Will, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.

O Muhammad-Rida, upon thee be the Glory of God! He is the Rememberer and the Helper, He is the All-Loving and the All-Bountiful. O Muhammad-Rida, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of all beings! Thy letter which thou hadst sent to Aqa Muhammad, upon him be my Baha, was brought before Us by Badi'u'llah and was heard. Praise be to God, from every word thereof wafted the fragrance of divine love, and from the horizon of every letter shone forth the light of affection. O Muhammad-Rida, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Names! Know thou with absolute certitude that thou hast attained unto that which hath no peer or likeness, and that is the Word of God, which it was and is. Time and again from the treasury of the Most Exalted Pen have pearls of wisdom and utterance been revealed especially for the loved ones. Whosoever hath attained unto these and remained firm in the Cause hath attained unto all good. God shall soon exalt his mention in the world and his name among the peoples. We have mentioned thy father before in such wise that through it the fragrance of the garment of utterance was wafted throughout all creation. Through My mention of him the ocean of forgiveness surged and the sun of pardon and bounty shone forth from the horizon of the world. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for this great favor. And We have mentioned thy brother as a grace from Us. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Convey on behalf of the Wronged One greetings to the kinfolk. Each one is blessed with the effulgences of the light of the Sun of divine favor, exalted be His glory. Give them glad-tidings from Me and remind them of My verses. The loved ones of that land are remembered in the presence of the Wronged One. By the life of God! That which no treasures or riches can equal hath been ordained for them. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. Say: O people of God! This day is your day. Be as fire in your love for the Chosen One, as light in your mention of Him Who conversed on Sinai, as mountains in your steadfastness and firmness, and as the Kawthar in giving life to the dead. This behooveth him who hath laid hold on this mighty cord. In these days the letter of the spiritual youth, upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness and My mercy, arrived, and likewise the letter of Ahmad, upon him be My Baha and My grace, and they were heard. We beseech God to aid them and enable them to assist His Cause through wisdom and utterance, and to send down upon them from the heaven of bounty that which will draw them near unto Him in all conditions. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Say unto Abdullah Ahmad: Hearken unto My call from the precincts of My prison. Verily there is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We counsel thee to be forbearing. If thou shouldst hear an unseemly word from thy brother, thou must conceal it and prefer forgiveness over retribution. Consider what hath befallen him in this Cause. Verily he hath heard in the path of God that which caused the denizens of Paradise to lament. In all matters, silence and quietude concerning him are most fitting and beloved. This is what the Wronged One hath decreed in His mighty prison. Thou didst mention Ali and his mother, upon them both be the Glory of God. A Tablet hath been specially revealed from the heaven of grace for him. Deliver it unto him that he may rejoice and be among the thankful. If the Right of God is found in that land, deliver one vahid to the mother or the son. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you and upon My servants and My handmaidens who have quaffed the choice wine of revelation from this manifest ocean.

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious!

May my spirit and being be sacrificed for Thee! Praise be to God that the darkness of separation was illumined by the light of thy letter, which shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of divine love. It brought endless joy and boundless delight. If half a letter equals half a meeting, thy letter was like a complete reunion. My happiness and joy have always come and will come from the loving fragrances of God's loved ones. After the petition thou didst submit reached the Most Holy Court, this servant presented it in its entirety before the Sacred Presence as commanded. God knoweth what shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord's utterance for thee. I am powerless to mention what I heard from the Tongue of Grandeur and Power. He is the All-Knowing, the Almighty.

If this servant were to recount the tribulations that have befallen him, it would not be possible, and none but God can enumerate them. Nothing shall befall us except what God has prescribed for us. Praise be to God that you met my brother and became aware of his conduct and the details concerning him. By God, besides Whom there is none other God! Whatever you have heard about the matter was all from this servant, and no one knows of it except Mirza Ahmad, who has met with you, and another one of the brethren known as Kalim who is present in this land. These two deemed it wise to mention and spread his name, for this servant was well-known and most of those in authority were fixed in enmity. Therefore his name was mentioned, and how much was written and spoken in his praise, all under the name of the Primal Point. Beyond these stages, how much effort and endeavor was expended in teaching, nurturing and protecting him, yet in times of tribulation he remained hidden and in moments of ordeal he fled, while this servant was afflicted among the enemies. You have heard how much tyranny and oppression I endured. By God! Not for a single night did I rest in peace and tranquility, and God is sufficient as witness. Surely you have heard of the gathering of the people of Iraq and the divines of Persia, how they arose in opposition until, by God's grace, the hand of divine power brought them all to naught and We arrived in this land. When my brother felt secure in himself and saw this land at peace, he secretly commissioned one of the servants to kill me. When God revealed what was hidden in his breast, he became agitated, denied it, and attributed it to that servant himself. Some letters in his handwriting appeared which still exist. Thereafter this servant withdrew from all and, trusting in God, resided in seclusion. Nevertheless the fire of his wrath was not quenched. He wrote tablets and sent them in all directions, attributing to this servant that which he himself had done, for he is confident that the ignorant masses of the earth will accept as true and established whatever he says, although they have properly understood this matter, as most have not seen him and whatever they have heard was from this servant. Still they have risen to war against the Beauty of Divine Unity. Fie upon them and upon those whom they have taken as lords besides God! Any person of insight can discern his station from what he has written. In brief, he has committed acts that no one has ever committed. I pour out my anguish and grief unto God alone. We hope, God willing, that you may abide beneath the shade of the Tree of the Cause, detached from all else. And peace be upon you and those with you.

Regarding what you wrote about Haji Mirza Ahmad - may God reward you with a goodly reward that shall not be followed by change, for verily He has power over all things.

He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power

Praise be to God, Who was and Who will be as He has been, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. Praise befits the Lord of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and unseen, Who has so attracted pure and holy hearts, free from worldly attachments, through the magnet of His Most Great, Most Ancient Name that they have transcended the world of being and all within it, hastening with heart and soul to the path of the peerless Friend. These are souls who have drunk from the pure wine flowing from the Supreme Pen and who have been adorned among creation with the coloring of God - which is sanctified above all colors - namely, the coloring of His commandments and laws and whatsoever is pleasing to Him. Blessed are they and upon them be glory! These are they through whom the dwellers of Paradise and the denizens of the holy precincts seek blessing, and upon whom the Concourse on High and the near-stationed angels pray morning and evening.

And now, the letter of that friend reached this evanescent servant. It was read and the fragrance of loving meanings was inhaled therefrom. God willing, may you ever drink from the wine of love for the eternal Sovereign, morn and eve - such a draught that worldly sorrows and troubles will not keep you from the remembrance of the Lord of Names. May you always attain manifest joy. Praise be to the Pre-existent Beloved that mention was made of you and your family at certain times in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, and the glance of favor was directed toward you. This is that treasure for which many sincere ones and near ones have given their lives, and with utmost humility and supplication have begged it from the Self-Sufficient Lord. The Most Great Remembrance (may my spirit be sacrificed for Him) says that all exists so that one might be mentioned but once in the presence of that Luminary of pre-existence, exalted be His majesty and glory. God willing, may all the friends not be deprived of this divine bounty and eternal good, and may they taste its sweetness. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Giver, the Bestower, the Generous.

As for your request for permission regarding the mother of Inayatu'llah, He said that this year, due to certain considerations, it is not advisable. God willing, they are and will be content with whatever is advisable and willed. Convey greetings and praise on my behalf. Convey most wondrous, most exalted, most glorious praise from this evanescent servant to the people of the true Kingdom who outwardly are children but in reality are truly great. God willing, may they be confirmed with both outer and inner confirmations. To his honor the beloved friend Aqa Ghulam-'Ali I send heartfelt praise. Ever has his mention been in my heart and his face before my eyes. Likewise to the spiritual friend his honor Aqa 'Ali-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God. God willing, may he ever dwell and find rest beneath the shade of the eternal Tree of Grace. Glory be upon you and upon your household and upon them both and upon every steadfast, firm and upright servant.

In the Name of God alone, and blessings and peace be upon Him after Whom there shall be no Prophet. Praise be to God Who with the arm of power has shattered the idols of evil imaginings of those who cast the Book of God behind their backs and followed the dawning-places of vain fancies. Praise be to God Who sent down the Furqan in the month of Ramadan, wherein He prescribed fasting for all peoples. Blessed is he who holdeth fast unto it and unto whatsoever commandments and ordinances were revealed therein from God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid them and confirm them in that which will exalt the Cause of God amidst all peoples. Verily He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Protector over what is and what hath been.

And then, O thou who art mentioned in the heart of this servant! The cooing of the dove of thy praise hath awakened me and raised me up to remember those days wherein we dwelt together beneath the pavilions of our Beloved and yours, our Goal and yours. When I received and read and understood, I turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon and presented it before His countenance. Thereupon the Kingdom of Utterance spoke forth that which diffused the fragrance of the All-Merciful. He spoke - and His word is the sweetest - saying: "We have mentioned him with that which nothing on earth can equal, and We have adorned him with the robe of Our favor. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid him and prosper him in all matters and conditions. Verily He is the Single, the One, the Hearing, the Answering." And We send Our greetings upon him and upon his wife and children who have drunk from the Kawthar of reunion from the hand of this Wronged One Who hath called all unto the Self-Subsisting, the Most High.

My spirit be a sacrifice for your remembrance. This servant doth acknowledge and confess his shortcoming or failing, but your heart beareth witness to my love and sincerity toward you. My occupation hath prevented me from mentioning you. By the life of the Beloved! Had I found opportunity I would have mentioned you night and day. I have sent to the honored physician, upon him be the Glory of God, in response to his letter which was sent from you. And I give you glad tidings of the two Most Great, Most Holy, Most Pure Tablets according to your request. I beseech God, exalted be He, to honor them with a visit from you. Verily He is the Protector of those who remember Him and the Answerer of those who call upon Him.

This servant sends greetings to the loved ones of God in Zawra and to the imprisoned one, upon him be the Glory of God, who was mentioned in this station. This evanescent one beseecheth his Lord to aid him and confirm him and cause him to speak that whereby the servants may be mindful. By Him Who caused all things to speak forth His praise! This servant desireth to mention him and send unto him every month that which would demonstrate my love for him, but two things have prevented me: occupation with writing and what we have been commanded regarding wisdom. I seek forgiveness in all conditions from the friends of God and His chosen ones who speak not until He hath spoken and who act according to what they have been commanded in His Wise Book. Praise be to God, the Most High, the Most Great.

Glory be upon you and upon the apple of all eyes and upon her who hath attained to serving you in this Day wherein the raven of unbelief and Islam hath croaked in manifest weakness. Peace and greetings be upon my beloved heart's friend, the helper, and upon every beloved one through whom the face of the Cause hath been illumined and who hath followed God's command in His Ancient Book.

O servant! Hearken to the call of thy Lord, the Most High, from the right hand of the Spot of Eternity, that thou mayest become aware of this Wronged One Who hath been imprisoned in this mighty prison, and beyond imprisonment hath been cast by the idolaters into this dark pit whose depths none can fathom save whom thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praised, willeth. If thou art able, let down the rope of trust and faithfulness that perchance the Youth may be drawn up thereby and the worlds be illumined by the light of His countenance. Know thou that were the Dove of Baha to speak of what hath befallen It, all existence, both seen and unseen, would cease to be. Therefore hath It concealed the mysteries of the Cause within Its breast, yet the people remain heedless. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear God and contend not with Him with Whom should anyone contend, all who dwell in the highest Paradise and the realities of the Prophets and Messengers would curse him. Say: Were ye to look with the eye of God, ye would witness how the Temple of 'Ali rent the garment of patience, how the Reality of Muhammad fell prostrate upon the dust, and how the Holy Spirit crieth out at what ye have wrought, O ye who are wrapped in veils! Do ye make mention of 'Ali while slaying Him Who sent him with the truth? Fie upon you, O heedless ones! Do ye deny Him Who created the Spirit through a movement of the Pen moved by the fingers of Power? Woe unto you, O idolaters! By God! Through what hath proceeded from the Breath of the All-Merciful at the heart of all creation, the realities of the Prophets and the hearts of the Messengers are gathered together. Then ye who, though ye should soar with the wings of detachment for seventy thousand ages, could never attain to the heaven of their knowledge, how much less to their innermost reality, the inaccessible, the exalted, the transcendent, the holy, the mighty, the impregnable. Blind are your eyes, O ignorant ones! The Sun of Eternity hath shone forth from the Most Glorious Horizon, yet ye have not been illumined by Its radiance, though both worlds have been enlightened thereby. Say: Think ye that ye can prevent the clouds of holiness from their rain, or the winds of grace from their wafting, or the breezes of God from their blowing? Nay, by the Self of God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Great! Should ye and all who are on earth deny, not a hair would be diminished from My servants who have prostrated themselves before My face, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Say: Fear God, O people, and exchange not the good for the evil, nor light for darkness, nor the Spirit for what ye possess of satanic imaginings. Thus have We commanded thee that thou mayest remind the people with the words of thy Lord, the Most High, that they may turn towards the holy precincts at the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, and hearken to what the Dove singeth upon the twigs of exalted glory. Should they hear thy word, good shall return unto them; otherwise, turn away from them and turn not towards them. Put thy trust in God, thy Lord, and He shall suffice thee against all the worlds. Be thou assured by the grace of thy Lord, then stand firm upon the carpet of steadfastness and independence, and fear no one, for He shall protect thee from the harm of devils. Thus do We mention thee and command thee to act according to what thou hast been bidden by the Ancient Sender. And the Spirit be upon thee, O servant who gazeth toward the holy precincts, and upon those who have believed in God in these days wherein all have opposed Him in Whom they took pride, and thereby their names were inscribed among the idolaters.

O Afnan, illustrious branch! Upon thee be all the most glorious and resplendent Glory! He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Most High!

O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath ascended to the loftiest heights, and say: The first fragrance that wafted from the garment of thy Lord's mercy, the Lord of all names, be upon thee, O thou star shining from the horizon of heaven! I testify that through thee the Most Exalted Horizon did shine forth, the Divine Lote-Tree did speak, the Most Great Word appeared, the Luminous Pearl and the Primal Point were made manifest - through which the hidden Secret and the treasured Symbol were revealed, the knowledge of what was and what would be was detailed, the breeze of God wafted throughout the world, the proof was perfected for all peoples, and the bounty was completed through the diffusion of the fragrance of the Bayan in celebration of the Most Great Name.

I testify that through you the seas surged, the rivers flowed, the trees brought forth leaves, the signs appeared, the mysteries emerged, the faces of the righteous were illumined, and in you the ocean of knowledge surged, the fragrance of the All-Merciful wafted, and the gates of Paradise - around which all gardens circle - were opened. In you dawned the Daybreak whereby the lamp of idle fancies was extinguished, the Sun of Revelation shone forth and the Moon of inspiration gleamed. Through you the Living Waters overflowed to quicken all contingent beings.

I bear witness that in you was raised the standard of "There is none other God but I, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting" and was hoisted the pavilion of "Verily I am God, there is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved." The nightingale of divine knowledge warbled in the Kingdom of utterance: "The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Loving." He is indeed the Most Great Book, the Most Exalted Word, and the Greatest Sign. Through Him appeared God's pervading Will, His all-encompassing Power, His enduring Sovereignty and His all-prevailing Might. He is indeed the Countenance that shone forth from the horizon of eternity after the passing of all things. Through His appearance, the Maidens of inner meaning emerged from the palaces of the Bayan, the mysteries deposited in the Qur'an were revealed, the signs became manifest, and every stone bore witness to the Revealer of verses.

He is indeed the One at Whose appearance the mountains passed away and all things spoke in remembrance of God, the Lord of grandeur and might. Through Him every poor one turned toward the Kingdom of wealth, every bewildered soul toward the lights of guidance, and every thirsty one toward the Kawthar of eternity. I testify that in you appeared the Known Beauty, the Speaker before the Self-Subsisting spoke forth, the Sealed Wine was unsealed, and every destined matter was fulfilled.

I bear witness that thou art he who was assured of meeting thy Lord, the Lord of all names, and wast illumined by God's lights when the Most Great Luminary shone forth from the horizon of Zawra - a station none among all created things have surpassed save whom thy Lord, the Creator of the heavens, did will. Thou art he who didst drink the choice wine of certitude while people were in doubt and discord, and didst attain the meeting of that Day which the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur'an - His word is the truth - "The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds." Blessed art thou for having fulfilled the Covenant when the people of the earth broke it, and for having turned to the Countenance when the limbs of the servants trembled from the assault of the people of hypocrisy. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who visiteth thee, by virtue of what hath flowed from the Pen whereby the Bridge was erected, the Balance was set up, the Hour appeared, and the Bayan was sent down.

O Nabil-i-Akbar of Qa'in, upon whom be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious!

In My Name, which speaketh before all faces! We have desired to send unto thee from this Spot the ocean of utterance - this Spot which God hath made the point of adoration for the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise - that the greatest joy may take hold of thee through the remembrance of God, the Lord of Destiny. He hath turned unto thee with a face whereby the earth and heaven were illumined, and the Bird of Proof, warbling upon the branches, proclaimed that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And We desired to send unto thee from the breaths of revelation that thou mayest remind the people of My verses and give them glad tidings of that which hath appeared from My Kingdom, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Verily He changeth sorrow into gladness and grief into delight. We beseech God to make known unto His servants what He hath desired for them from His all-encompassing grace.

There hath befallen thee what befell those who drew nigh unto God from those who denied God's proof and testimony and disputed His verses which have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Say: O people, fear God! Abandon what ye possess and take what ye have been given from One Who is All-Seeing, All-Bountiful. Cast aside the idle fancies and vain imaginings ye possess - they shall profit you not, as doth testify the Book of God, the Speaking, the Commanding, the Mighty, the Wise.

That honored one hath ever been and still is mentioned before this Wronged One. Blessed are they who gaze with divine sight and hearing. By the life of God! Their eyes and ears shall profit them not, nor what they possess of the whisperings of those who have denied the Day of Judgment. That honored one and the company of the fair-minded bear witness that this Wronged One hath at all times enjoined upon the peoples of the earth in general such counsels and wisdom as would extinguish the fire of hatred and sedition, conflict and corruption; and particularly hath given to the people of Baha counsels which, were they to be cast upon the rock, it would cry out and proclaim; and were they to be cast upon the earth, it would be stirred in attraction and circle round; and were they to be cast toward the heaven, it would be moved and would exclaim: "O people of creation! Be fair in the cause of God, then consider what hath appeared in truth. Deny not His favors, neither reject His signs, nor turn aside from His loved ones. Present yourselves and hearken unto that which will draw you nigh unto God and acquaint you with the path of justice and teach you His Cause whereof ye were promised in His Books and Scriptures. Be not of them that remain patient."

We beseech God to assist all, that ye may hear from thee what We have imparted unto thee in this Most Great, Most Mighty, Most Ancient, Most Powerful Cause which dominateth every small and great thing. That honored one must, in the nights and days, with wisdom and utterance, make the people aware, that all may arise to serve, detached from all else that beseemeth not the days of God, and hold fast unto that which is befitting. Today the land and sea, nay all things, are raising their call and summoning the servants unto that which is meet. We beseech God to bestow attentive ears that all may hear and hold fast unto that which they are commanded.

Thy letter was received and the fragrance of thy praise and remembrance hath been diffused throughout the cities and regions of the fair-minded. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist thee with the hosts of knowledge and wisdom that thou mayest draw the people nigh unto Him. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Should anyone resolve upon it, the Book shall be sent. The Glory be upon thee from Us and upon whomsoever heareth thy word in this manifest Cause.

In the Name of the One God, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing!

O Haydar! Your call hath been heard time after time, occasion after occasion, and moment after moment. If the Most Exalted Pen remained silent for a time, that is, made no response, there was and is no harm in this. Verily thy Lord doeth what He pleaseth and ordaineth what He willeth. This knowledge hath been and shall ever be established in the most exalted station through the blessing of the Most Great Name. Blessed art thou and blessed are they who have cast away their desires and taken hold of that which exalteth the religion of God and His Cause among His servants.

O Ali! We have accepted countless afflictions and borne in God's path that which no pen can recount nor ink record, that perchance some souls might be cleansed from the defilement of idle fancies and attain unto everlasting tranquility. The choice wine of unity and the living waters of fellowship flow from the two fingers of the Lord of creation, yet all wander in the wilderness of perplexity and discord. O Ali! Beseech God - exalted and glorified be He - to send forth a breeze from the paradise of sanctity, that it may dispel the offensive odors of discord. If a person today should, for God's sake, show deference to another, would this detract from his station? Nay, by My true Self! Rather would he be exalted and God Himself would raise him up.

O Ali! God is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. Whosoever today becometh the cause of unity and shattereth the idols of discord through the Name of God shall be mentioned in every tongue and recorded in all the Tablets. Say: O friends! Hearken unto the voice of Him Who hath been wronged and hold fast, for the sake of God, to the cord of fellowship and cling to the hem of unity. Exert your utmost endeavor in this matter, that perchance the lights of concord and agreement may illumine all regions.

The captives in the land of Sad who have been kept far from their homes and native lands for the sake of God are all remembered in the presence of the Countenance. By the life of God! That hath been sent down for them which hath caused the Concourse on High to lament and those who circle round My mighty Throne to weep. God willing, they must soar on the wings of joy, inasmuch as whatsoever befell them was for God's sake. Soon will there appear in the realm of being what God hath ordained for them in His Preserved Book. Convey to all My greetings and gladden them with the divine favors. If, outwardly, nothing specific was sent for each one, this was due to wisdom. The atoms themselves bear witness to My remembrance of them, My turning toward them, and My bounty to them. Thus hath My Pen spoken, and My Tongue, and My Servant who standeth before the Countenance recording that which hath been sent down from the kingdom of My knowledge and the heaven of My novel utterance.

If for some reason they should return to their homelands, there is no harm in this. Beseech God - exalted and glorified be He - that those devoted souls who have drunk from the cup of tribulation and adversity in the path of the Lord of Names may shine forth with the utmost joy and radiance from the horizon of the heaven of steadfastness. Convey My glory to those who have turned to My countenance, who have stood firm in My path and held fast to My mighty Cause. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

O handmaiden of God, mother of him who was named at the Divine Throne 'Abdu'l-Baha! In the name of the One Bestower! This is a letter from the King of existence to one of His handmaidens, that she may be gladdened through God's favor and be detached and free from creation. O handmaiden of God! This is a Day wherein all relationships have been severed and all parties have become separated. Whosoever has turned to the Truth and has drunk from the Cup of Life in the days of the All-Merciful is reckoned as being of God, and all others are recorded in the Most Great Vision as being among the people of hell-fire. Give thanks to the Ancient King that through His all-encompassing grace thou hast attained the honor of recognition and hast drunk from the Cup of Certitude. What bounty is greater than that the Tongue of Grandeur should mention thee from the Most Great Prison? Be thou therefore grateful unto thy Lord for this manifest grace. Be not grieved concerning thy brethren. Whosoever has turned to the Truth is thy brother and is of thee, and whosoever has been deprived of this supreme honor is separate from thee. By My life! My Name, the Most Glorious, sufficeth thee and those like thee, for the ultimate purpose is the recognition of God and steadfastness in His Cause. Whosoever has attained this station has been and shall ever be accounted before God as the most exalted of all creation and its essence. The reason some souls were prevented from entering the Divine Law was the reprehensible deeds of certain believers, for in the early days of the Cause some were engaged in actions contrary to His good-pleasure while imagining God was pleased with them. Thus some souls, upon witnessing such actions, hesitated in accepting the Self-Sufficient Lord's Cause while others arose in opposition. Another reason was that their outward asceticism prevented them from accepting the Divine Law, even though they had not truly understood asceticism. Consider how most of the Jews in the time of Christ were occupied day and night in their places of worship reciting the Torah, yet these very acts prevented them from recognizing the Dayspring of the Cause of the All-Glorious, for all deeds are meant for attaining unto God and His good-pleasure. Since they failed to attain unto the Truth, all such deeds were and shall ever be rejected. Even now there are some Jews who have secluded themselves in Jerusalem and are engaged in extreme austerities and scripture reading, with some fasting for three consecutive days and nights, yet they are and shall remain rejected in the sight of God. This is the greatest veil that has prevented most of humanity from the Most Great Vision. In brief, the aforementioned matters became the cause of most people's veiling. If they would truly turn to God and fix their gaze upon the essence of the Cause, they would become illumined by the dawning lights of the Sun of Divine Utterance shining from the horizon of the Will of the All-Merciful. Be not grieved at anything. Rather, rejoice in God's remembrance of thee and be thou among the thankful ones preserved in a mighty Tablet. Know thou that We have, out of Our grace, forgiven thy daughter who is before the Throne and accepted her. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.

In the Name of the Kind Lord. This is a letter from the Dawning-Place of the All-Merciful to the oppressed ones in the land of Zanjan. By My life! The heavens have wept at what hath befallen you, and the thunder hath lamented at what ye have suffered of harm and tribulation in the path of God, the Lord of all names. Ye are they who have been tried because of your belief in God, the Creator of the heavens. Grieve not; be patient. Your rewards are with your Lord - ye shall soon behold them in truth. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Observe those who every year lament and wail over the oppression of the Prince of Martyrs - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - and His companions, and who curse the oppressors, while they themselves have manifested such tyranny that the oppression of former tyrants is as pure nothingness in comparison. In truth, they curse themselves and perceive it not. The sources of oppression today are the divines of the age, who have turned away from the truth and clung to their own idle fancies. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of divine unity that in former ages too, such souls were the cause of oppression, for through the decrees of heedless souls, the Manifestations of the glory of divine oneness have drunk the cup of martyrdom. The soldiers who fought against the Prince of Martyrs were certain individuals who would fast three months every year, recite the Qur'an day and night, and never miss congregational prayers. Among them was 'Umar Sa'd, who wore a cloak and turban, and who, immediately after the martyrdom of the Prince of Martyrs, led the congregational prayer which all followed. And Shimr Dhi'l-Jawshan was among the judges and divines, and his asceticism reached such a degree that he would clear thorns from the path lest they hurt the foot of any Muslim. Despite such asceticism, he dealt with the Treasury of Divine Knowledge and the Recipient of heavenly revelation as he dealt. Verily the Pen lamenteth and weepeth at what was wrought against Him by these oppressors who cast certitude behind their backs and followed the vain imaginings of every remote divine.

That which hath befallen you, though outwardly it appeareth as vengeance, hath been pure bounty and will prove to be sheer mercy. The might and power of the oppressors shall soon be brought to naught and shall vanish, while the reward of your deeds shall endure forever in the Kingdom of the Lord of Names. The oppression of the world and its sedition and corruption have been and shall be from the ignorant ones who are known as divines. This grace sufficeth you, that the Most Exalted Pen maketh mention of you with such mention as shall endure and remain forever and ever. Praise be to God that through divine bounty and heavenly favor ye have drunk of the choice sealed wine and turned toward the dawning-place of the Countenance of the Self-Subsisting, and in the recognition of God have outstripped most of the peoples of the world. Your mention is renowned in the Concourse on High and your deeds are recorded by the Most Exalted Pen. Ye should occupy yourselves with the remembrance of God in complete joy and gladness and fix your gaze upon His horizon. The glory and the spirit rest upon you and upon the handmaidens of God who have stood firm in His Cause and have won the recognition of His Self, the Protector of the worlds.

He is God, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed

This is expressed in the Persian tongue so that the purpose may become evident and manifest without veil or covering to those who seek the Kaaba of their heart's desire. There has never been any doubt that the creation of the world was for the knowledge of God, and the knowledge of that Hidden Essence is not attained except through knowledge of the Dawning-Place of His verses and the Dayspring of His evidences. In every age and cycle when the Manifestation of Revelation appeared from the horizon of divine will, the people arose in rejection and protest. Thus have you heard how most of the Prophets and chosen ones drank the cup of martyrdom in the path of love for the Lord of Names and ascended to the Supreme Companion. And in all ages the cause of people's veiling has been the divines, as mentioned in the Books. Consider the appearance of the Seal of the Prophets, may the spirit of all in the kingdom be sacrificed for Him. After His appearance from the horizon of Hijaz, all the divines of that age from among the Jews and Christians, despite their anticipation of His appearance, after His manifestation raised the standards of discord and arose in utter opposition. One who was among the most learned of divines remained deprived of the Sun of Truth, while one who was but a shepherd attained the knowledge of the Manifestation of the All-Merciful, and drank from the water of life. Likewise observe this before Him in Jesus son of Mary. After the appearance of that Most Great Luminary, all the Jewish divines turned away, while at first only a few souls who were fishermen turned to the horizon of faith and attained the knowledge of the All-Merciful. Among them was Simon Peter who was known in previous Books as Peter, who was occupied with fishing, and after hearing the divine word from Christ did not hesitate for a moment but attained the ocean of knowledge. Now observe what caused people in those ages to be deprived of the path of the Chosen One. If you reflect a little, most hidden matters will become clear and evident to you. The suppositions and imaginings of most of the servants have prevented them from the knowledge of the Lord of all beings. Hear the counsel of this Wronged One and deprive not yourself of the bounty of this Day. Soon all that is visible will become non-existent and perish. Strive that you may attain to that which is enduring and lasting. God willing, in these days you will attain the fountain of knowledge at the Dawning-Place of the Cause and turn to the horizon of revelation. Take the cup of knowledge in the name of your Lord, the All-Merciful, then drink thereof despite those who have hesitated in the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. Beware lest the allusions of the divines veil you or the dark veils of the opposers prevent you. Arise to serve the Cause of your Lord and say: "O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy most excellent Names and Thy most exalted Attributes and by Thy most sublime Horizon and the Manifestation of Thy Cause in the kingdom of creation, to make me detached from all else save Thee and turning toward Thee, speaking in Thy praise and glorification. Then assist me in Thy service that there may appear from me that whereby my mention shall endure in Thy kingdom and Thy dominion. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Giving, the Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Generous."

This voice of David from the Lote-Tree of God-with the Messiah's spirit she

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, O Glad Tidings!

With the magnet of fidelity, with the protection of Bah-

from the horizon of "HE" she came.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, O Glad Tidings!

With light from the morn of reunion, with guidance from Mount Sinai she came.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, O Glad Tidings!

This song of the spirit, to her lovers-from the Night Song of denial she came.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, O Glad Tidings!

With joyful tidings of reunion, from a branch of the Tree of Blessedness she

came.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, O Glad Tidings!

This slain lover, this fallen bird-she came as a sacrifice in the path of the

Beloved.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, O Glad Tidings!

This sword of oppression from the Throne of fidelity-

she came upon the neck of the Beloved.

invitation in hand.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, O Glad Tidings!

This luminous page, she came with light and splendor from the Midian of

Spirit.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, O Glad Tidings!

This Witness of the Omnipotent, this wine of the Beloved-

she came with the goblet of sovereignty.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, O Glad Tidings!

That essence of the beauty of the True One, that jewel of the Glory of the

True One-

she came with the Most Great Sign.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, O Glad Tidings!

That Countenance of the Desired One, that Face of the Adored One-

she came with the most supreme mercy.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, O Glad Tidings!

The souls to her reunion, the hearts to her bestowal-

as the Most Exalted Lord she has come!

This wondrous remembrance hath come from the Eternal Rose Garden that the

lovers of the beauty of the Adored One, hearts and souls burning with love,

might, in utmost tranquillity, busy themselves with these wondrous new

melodies; that perchance, so attracted, the inmates of the Kaaba of knowing

might be shaken ecstatic and remember their divine and sacred home.

A mention from Us to My loved ones who have acknowledged God and recognized His sovereignty and turned to the Countenance when it shone forth from this manifest horizon. By the life of God! They are the ones who turned to the Dawning Place of inspiration when they heard the call of God, the All-Possessing, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. O people of Qaf! We desire to make you hear the melody of God and give you to drink of the Kawthar of utterance from this Hand that was dominant over all who are in the heavens and earth. Turn with the ears of your hearts that you may hear the call of God from this far-off spot. Blessed are you in that you have cast away vain imaginings and taken the cup of certitude through this manifest Name. By God! Were you to discover what hath been ordained for you, you would soar on wings of joy and arise to serve the Cause of your Lord, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Grieve not over anything. Rather, rejoice in that God remembers you from His Most Exalted Pen in this sublime station. Blessed are you in that you have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and faced toward the Qiblih of all horizons when every polytheist turned away from it. Thus have We adorned your temples with the ornament of remembrance and illumined your hearts with the light of the utterance of your Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. Say: Arise to serve the Cause with wisdom and hold fast unto it - this is better for you, did you but know. O Samandar! Your letter which you sent to the Name of Bounty hath come before the Throne and the servant present hath read it, and We make mention of you that you may rejoice within yourself and be of the thankful. Turn with the ear of nature that you may hear the melody of God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting, and turn with the eye of nature that you may behold the scene of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: O people of the Bayan! By God, the horizon of certitude hath been illumined and the Countenance of the All-Merciful giveth you to drink of the water of life. Beware lest you deprive yourselves of that which your Lord, Who is dominant over every witness and witnessed one, hath brought. Say: By God! This is the Most Great Day and the Lord of Destiny hath by His own Self arisen to His Cause - He to Whose manifestation all in the unseen and visible worlds have bowed down. Gather ye together in remembrance and praise of God, then make mention of Him in such wise as to attract minds. Do you slumber upon your couches while He standeth at your heads giving you glad tidings of what hath been ordained for you in a preserved Tablet? Beware lest sorrows overtake you or the imaginings of those who have denied God, the Mighty, the Loving, prevent you. The land of the Prison hath cried out and lamented - were you to ask it why, it would say because the hem of sanctity hath been sullied by what the hands of those who have believed in God, the Single One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, have wrought. O thou servant who art present! Hold back the Pen lest there flow from it that which would cause the Concourse on High to wail and the eyes of those near unto God to shed tears. Turn away from what thou wert occupied with and make mention of My loved ones who are there with My beautiful remembrance. Say: Upon you be glory, then praise, then immortality in that you turned when every hypocrite turned away, and drank when every transgressor was prevented, and knew when every doubter remained ignorant, and faced toward the Dawning Place of faith when the All-Merciful came with manifest sovereignty. Doth not suffice you what hath flowed this night from the Most Exalted Pen? Say: By Thy life, O Beloved of the worlds! We are satisfied with what we see and witness from the horizon of Thy grace - nay rather, we acknowledge that all this is naught but a token of the wonders of Thy bounty and favor. Thou art He to Whose grace the whole creation hath testified, and to Whose sovereignty all in the worlds have borne witness.

O Ali-Asghar Khan! He is God - exalted be His glory, majesty and power!

Pure praise and the essence of glorification befit the sacred and holy court of the Intended One, Who created all existence with a single word and distinguished man through insight and knowledge above all else. He is the divine seal in the scroll of the world, He is the Most Great and Glorious Talisman, the honored Essence. And the intent of this insight is not the outward sight which other than man also possesses, rather it is that insight which has dawned from the shining lights of the Sun of the word "He comprehendeth all vision." How lofty is the station of man if he attains to its conditions and becomes aware of its degrees!

There has never been any doubt that all creation was brought into being for the knowledge of the True One. This has been the ultimate purpose behind the creation of the world of being. Today, whosoever attains to this most exalted station and supreme summit is accounted as human in the sight of the All-Merciful; otherwise, he is reckoned among the heedless masses.

Praise be to the Beloved of the worlds that your honor gazes toward the highest horizon and has drunk from the Most Glorious Kawthar. I beseech God, exalted and mighty be He, to grant your honor a portion of the outpourings of the ocean of bounty at all times. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.

Thereafter, it is submitted to His Excellency that this evanescent servant was blessed to read your esteemed letter, and as it was adorned with mention of the Beloved of the worlds, it brought boundless joy and delight. God willing, may this fragrance ever waft and this mention remain eternal and enduring. After this servant became apprised of the contents of your noble letter, I turned to the Most Exalted Station and read it at the Most Glorious Spot. At that very moment, an exalted Tablet specifically for your honor was revealed from the heaven of grace and sent forth. Although in these days, due to the lack of capacity of the time and season, the worth and station of this bounty is not apparent, yet I swear by the Sun of the horizon of unity that a time shall come when its glory and station will become evident in the assemblage of the world like the sun - God forgive me for this comparison - a hundred thousand such suns prostrate themselves in that station in utter humility and submission. The Pen has confessed its inability to describe that mighty station.

God willing, through divine confirmations and heavenly favors, may you be the cup-bearer of the sealed wine and occupied with the mention of God, exalted be His glory. The mention of His Excellency Nawwab Muhammad Azim ud-Din Khal, upon him be the glory of God, shone forth from the horizon of your noble letter, and this servant attained unto it. In the Most Holy Court, mention was made of his honor and the noble ladies referred to. He showed loving-kindness and favor toward all. Were its radiance to shine upon contingent being, the very name of extinction would be erased therefrom. This servant was and is not capable of describing its details. I hope that his honor may ever be ablaze with the fire of divine love and speaking forth the wondrous praise of God.

Glorified be He by Whose name the ocean of utterance surged in the realm of possibility, and the Sun of Manifestation shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of proof, and the Dove of Paradise warbled upon the branch of certitude. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower.

Say: O people of the earth, rejoice within yourselves! The Temple of the Ancient Beauty hath been established upon the Most Great Throne and hath spoken that before which the Books of the world have bowed down, and His grace hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Blessed is he who hath recognized, and woe unto every denying infidel.

Say: The gate of the Divine Presence hath been opened, and from the treasury of divine knowledge the pearls of wisdom and utterance have been revealed, through the command of God, the Powerful, the Chosen One.

Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and We have heard thy sweetest call in the remembrance of God, the Lord of all beings, and witnessed thy turning toward the Most Exalted Horizon. We have answered thee with a Tablet before which all tablets have bowed down. We have indeed sent down for thee, both before and at this time, that which hath opened the gate of knowledge to the face of every insightful seeker. Blessed art thou for having attained, in the earliest days, to the Kawthar of inner meanings, when the servants were prevented therefrom, save whom God, the Lord of creation, did will.

We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to give thee to drink, at all times, from the choice wine of His utterance and the Kawthar of His remembrance and the Salsabil of His mercy, which hath preceded all religions. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of My utterance from My pen's traces, say: Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Manifestation through which the Mount was shaken and the Lote-Tree spoke that which drew unto it the hearts of the righteous ones.

O my Lord! Thou seest me, in all conditions, turning toward Thee and directing myself to the horizon of Thy grace and the ocean of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me from that which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy mercy for them that circle round Thy Sacred House. Every person of fairness hath testified to Thy power and sovereignty, and every person of justice to Thy greatness and might, and every person of insight to Thy Manifestation and appearance and Thy loftiness and favor.

Draw nigh, O Thou Who art the Goal of the world and the Beloved of nations, Thy servants who have become remote from the court of Thy nearness and have turned away from Thee in Thy days. O Lord! Aid them to acknowledge after denial and to turn toward Thee after having turned away. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, the Bestower.

O my God! Send Thy blessings upon Thy trusted ones and Thy chosen ones who have acted according to that which Thou didst command them in Thy Book. Then adorn them among Thy servants with trustworthiness and religiosity and truthfulness and purity. Verily Thou art the Possessor of the Kingdom of names and the Supreme Ruler of earth and heaven.

O Lord! Make known to them Thy path and Thy tidings which Thou didst promise in Thy Books and Thy Scrolls. Then enable them to hold fast unto it and to cling to its hem. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Chosen One.

O Lord! Thou seest Thy servant Nabil who hath arisen to serve Thy Cause among Thy servants. Assist him through the means of Thy heavens and earth that he may draw the servants nigh unto the Most Great Ocean through Thy bounty and generosity. Thou art He Whom the desires and schemes of the nations cannot prevent, nor their might and power and sovereignty and oppression. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou desirest. Verily Thou art the Commander, the Ruler in the beginning and in the end. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

O Mirza Hasan-i-Qaf! He is the Most Holy, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious!

Glorified be He Who hath appeared with the truth with all the signs and hath spoken between earth and heaven with a call whereby the hearts of the Concourse on High were attracted, yet most of the people hear not. At every moment He saith: "O people! We created you for My manifestation and caused you to know the Manifestation of My Self. Yet when He came upon clouds of inner meanings, surrounded by hosts of revelation, ye denied Him and were of those who turned away from God their Lord after the signs had encompassed them from every direction - to this all existence doth testify, as do honored servants."

O people! Hearken unto the call of your Lord and stop not your ears from hearkening to the Word of God, your Lord and the Lord of all things visible and invisible, would that ye might know. Say: God is independent of the faith of His servants and whatsoever He commandeth them. This is of His grace unto them, that He might draw them nigh unto the right hand of the Throne and send down upon them that which shall purify them from the defilement of contingent being and bring them to a station of glorious praise.

Verily those who have disbelieved in these days - every atom doth curse them, as doth all that was and will be. All that was created in creation doth address them saying: "O people, your eyes are blind! Do ye witness the Names yet withhold your gaze from Him through one letter from Whom were created the Names and their Kingdom, then the Attributes and their Dominion? This indeed is a wrong ye have wrought against your own selves, would that ye might understand."

Rend asunder the veils through My Name, the Chosen One, and turn not unto those who have disbelieved in God after their belief and turned away from Him for Whose meeting they were created. Thus doth the Tongue of God, the Sovereign, the Protector, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting, speak at this moment. O people! Cast away what ye possess and take what is with God. By God the Truth! None hath any protector today save through His Cause. Thus hath the decree been sent down in all the Tablets and in the Torah and the Gospel and the Psalms.

O people! Look ye at God's previous Scriptures. By God! In every word thereof ye were promised this resplendent, dawning, rising, hidden, mighty and manifest Beauty. Whoso today pauseth for less than a moment regarding His Cause hath indeed turned away from God and His Messengers in every age and time. Therefore ponder within yourselves, then choose what is best for you, would that ye might know.

O servant! In these days cleanse thine eyes from the ophthalmia of vain imaginings and hold fast to the cord of certitude. Be not of those who are blind upon the earth yet reckon they can see. By God the Truth! The veils have so encompassed them that they understand nothing, nor do they see. As for thee, emerge from behind the veils through a power from Us and a might from Our presence. Then sanctify thyself from all that existeth in the hands of men, that thou mayest ascend unto an atmosphere wherein thou wilt hear the sounds of the wings of the birds of eternity and witness thyself attracted by the love of thy Lord. Thus do We command thee and inspire thee that thou mayest follow the bidding of thy Lord and be in a praiseworthy protection. And peace be upon thee if thou standest firm in the Cause and upon those who have turned unto God, the King, the Mighty, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

O Mirza Baqir of the people of Ya, glorified be He Who sends down the verses in truth. Verily there is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command. He ordains whatsoever He willeth by His command, and He encompasseth all things. He hath sent down by His command a Word in truth and made it the sword of His Cause between the heavens and the earth, whereby He distinguisheth between the polytheist and the believer in divine unity, for He is powerful over all things. He hath made it the magnet of attraction between the heavens and the earth, drawing unto itself the essences of existence while leaving behind mere accidents, for He is wise over all things.

O servant! Blessed art thou in that thou hast remained steadfast in the Cause in days wherein the feet of all have slipped, when they were veiled from the beauty of God by the veils of their own selves. When they are asked by what sign they believed in God, they say "the verses." Yet when the Beauty through Whom were manifested the Manifestations of the past from a beginning that hath no beginning appears before them, they are overwhelmed by the dust of the fire, for thus hath the matter been decreed.

Be thou steadfast in the Cause by Our command and fear no one. Then make mention of thy Lord through what the Spirit hath uttered in thy breast, for He will aid thee at all times. Turn thy face toward God, then turn away from all else, for He will suffice thee against all who dwell on earth. We have received word of thy steadfastness in the Cause of God thy Lord. God will surely reward thee with the most excellent reward and will send down upon thee that which will gladden thy soul, for He is knowing of all things.

Take thou the chalice of glory by the power of thy Lord and pay no heed to anyone. Then drink in the name of this Youth, around Whom circle the kingdoms of names and Whose name hath been recorded by the Pen of the Command in all the Tablets. Know thou that he whom We strengthened, protected and taught, when the breezes of might wafted and he felt secure in himself, rose up like a serpent against the Beauty of the All-Merciful. Thus hath the matter transpired against this Youth Who languisheth imprisoned in this prison.

By God, O thou servant who gazeth upon the Throne! Were We to cast upon thee what hath befallen Us, thou wouldst cut thyself off from all souls, cast ashes upon thy head, and cry out morning and night. But We have concealed it from thee to preserve thy soul. Would that thou wert with Us to witness those whom the people have taken as lords besides God. Alas for them in that they have taken such as their beloved! Thou seest these people only as one dumb who asketh about speech and what of God's utterance is treasured therein, or as one blind who asketh about the sun - nay, more abject still, and God is witness to this.

Cast them and all they possess beneath thy feet, then ascend to the heaven which God hath raised up at the Pole of eternity, from whose horizon hath shone forth the Sun of eternity with this Name which was, in the Mother Book, gloriously radiant in truth. Thus have We informed thee and made mention of thee, that thou mayest know We have not forgotten thee and that thou mayest be witnessed by Us in the most excellent station in truth. And glory be upon thee and upon those with thee who are faithful and thankful believers.

Be thou steadfast in thy love for the Youth, then convey unto the people the Command of thy Lord with wisdom and utterance, lest the clamor of the heedless and the howling of the wicked be raised. Cast the kingdom behind thee, then turn unto thy Lord. The world and all that is therein shall perish, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the Lord of grandeur and power.

O Siyyid Abu-Turab, upon him be the glory of God! He is the One dawning from the horizon of the heaven of the Kingdom. God testifies that there is none other God but Him and He Who has come with the truth - verily He is the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Secret through Whom the sealed wine was unsealed and the Name of the Self-Subsisting appeared and arose with the Cause in such wise that neither the doubts of the learned, nor the turning away of the mystics, nor the power of princes could move Him. He is the One through Whom the veils were rent asunder and the Mother Book was sent down which had been hidden in the knowledge of God, Lord of all worlds. Whoso acknowledges Him has acknowledged God in all ages, and whoso turns away is accounted among the polytheists in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O Abu-Turab! The All-Bountiful, Who is imprisoned in this fortress through what the hands of the heedless who turned away from God and His sovereignty have wrought by following every ignorant remote one, makes mention of thee. Thy letter was presented and the servant present before the Wronged One submitted it, and We answer thee from My Most Exalted Pen at this time when the Lord of Names walks in this spot which has been honored by the Concourse on High and the denizens of the Kingdom of Names. Verily thy Lord does what He wishes by His command, and He is the Single One, the All-Informed.

Behold and remember when thou wert present before the Face and heard the Call from the Most Exalted Horizon, the seat of the throne of thy Lord, Creator of heaven, through Whom all things proclaimed: "The Kingdom belongs to God, the One, the Mighty, the Great." Thou art he who sought the circumambulation place of the Prophets and crossed land and sea until thou attained and saw what was denied to the Interlocutor on the Mount of Knowledge. Verily thy Lord is the Ordainer, the Powerful. By the life of God! The treasures of the world cannot equal what the Pen has testified for thee - to this bears witness the Lord of Eternity, He is the Bestower, the Generous.

Blessed art thou for having uttered the mention of the Wronged One when kings and subjects turned away from Him, save whom God willed, the Sovereign of this wondrous Day. Say: O people! By God, the Truth has come and He makes mention of you and draws you near to a station whose remembrance shall not pass away throughout the duration of His Most Beautiful Names and Supreme Attributes. Fear God and be not of the heedless ones. The bodies have risen through the breezes of revelation while you are among those who sleep. Arise from the slumber of passion, then hearken to what the Lord of all humanity calls you to - He summons you to His Straight Path. Leave the ways of the world to the nations, then turn with radiant faces to this Path which has been raised up through this Most Great Name.

Say: O people! Be fair by God and oppose not Him Who has come with God's proofs, signs and clear evidences to all in the heavens and earth. Say: O concourse of earth! Have mercy on yourselves and follow not those whom glory and wealth have prevented from this noble prospect. Soon shall they behold what they deny today - then shall they lament and weep and find neither helper nor escape. Thus has crowed the Cock of the Throne and cooed the Dove of Heaven upon the branches of the Tree of Eternity that thou mayest rejoice and be among the thankful ones. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the faces of those whom God has honored by turning to none but Him and has illumined their hearts with the lights of His manifest Name. The glory be upon thee and upon those with thee from God, the Speaking, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and Power

For what were the world and nations created? For the recognition of the Ancient Lord. Why does the sun rise? To be evidence of His power. Why does heaven exist? To bear witness to His grandeur. Why did the sea come from nonexistence into being? To preserve the pearls of His knowledge. Glory be to Him, glory be to Him, beyond my mention and the mention of all things, beyond my knowledge and the knowledge of all things. Glory be to You, O God of all beings and Goal of all contingent things. I beseech You by the movement of Your cord, by whose movement all existence, both seen and unseen, was set in motion, to assist me and Your servants in Your remembrance and praise and in acting according to what You commanded us through the tongue of Your Beloved \[Muhammad\]. You are He Whom no command can prevent nor any thing \[sadden\]. I testify, O my God, that Your power has conquered all beings and Your might has encompassed all things. You are indeed the Powerful, the Strong, the Conquering, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Thereafter, the letter of that honored one arrived. Praise be to God, it brought joy and renewed the heart. After being presented at the court, the Sun of favor rose and shone forth. This servant is incapable and falls short of mentioning it. Regarding what was written about the beloved of the heart, his eminence the Observer, upon him be 9 66 \[Baha'u'llah\] and His favors, and his stay, and likewise what the spiritual friend his eminence Aqa 'Azizu'llah, upon him be 9 66 \[Baha'u'llah\] eternally, related - their stay in that land has been accepted, since in all correspondences the command of consultation was mentioned, and as the collective opinion settled upon this and purely for the sake of God their stay emerged from consultation, therefore it was adorned with the ornament of acceptance. It is hoped that great beneficial matters will appear from them. However, observance of wisdom is obligatory, for some were not and are not aware, clinging to conjecture and holding fast to suppositions, and these two are mighty barriers preventing the servants. Verily our Lord is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower. I mention the friends with a hundred thousand tongues and beseech the One God for each one an enduring mention and eternal everlasting word. He is indeed the All-Bountiful and He is the Mighty, the Generous.

Regarding the funds that must be sent, according to the command they must reach here the beloved of the heart, his eminence Aqa Rida and Aqa Faraj, upon them be 9 66 \[Baha'u'llah\], as they are requesting it at the door. On this day the honored master, his eminence Afnan Aqa Mirza Mu?sin, upon him be 9 66 \[Baha'u'llah\] the Most Glorious, mentioned that "I receive here \[and in\] Istanbul from his eminence Aqa Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be God's peace." Therefore the amount of sixty-five Ottoman liras was received from him which you should give to them there. The servant asks his Lord to open upon your faces the doors of blessing and bounty and that whereby your hearts may rejoice. He is the Hearer, the Answerer, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Peace and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon God's assured and sincere servants. And praise be to God, the Goal of the mystics.

The servant, on 27 Dhi'l-?ijjih 1305

In the Name of God the Most Holy, the Exalted, the Most High

Know thou that the heedless banished us from the City of God with such manifest injustice that the voice of weeping was raised betwixt earth and heaven, and the dwellers of the Realm above cried out in lamentation; yet was this Youth filled with perspicuous gladness.

At the time of Our departure one of the believers offered up his life as a sacrifice in his love for God, the Lord of all worlds . In ringing tones We called upon the people, summoning them unto the Court of Holiness; nor did Our tribulations prevent Us on that momentous Day from yielding praises unto God. So continuous was the stream of Verses descending from the Heaven of thy Lord, the Possessor of all Names and Attributes, that their sweet savours encompassed all the worlds. Those in whose hearts was the light of thy Lord perceived the fragrance of Our raiment and, turning their faces towards God, severed themselves from all else but Him; while the heedless inhaled not the sweet breaths of holiness, which passed over them even as the wafting of the dawn breezes over those who slumber.

At length we arrived at the ocean's shore ; then did He Who is the Most Mighty Ocean embark upon the ship , and in this there are signs for them that truly believe. The ship set sail upon its voyage, continuing on its course until at length it came to rest before a city named Izmir . Here the one who hath been designated by Our Name, Munir, fell down upon his face before this Youth, laid hold upon His foot, and begged that he might sacrifice his life in the way of God even as he lay there before Us with his arms around Our foot.

with his arms clasped around Our foot.

Thy Lord, verily, hath power over all things. Ever had Our suppliant entreated of his Lord this exalted, glorious, and peerless station. God granted him his wish, and We commanded that he leave the ship. Shortly after he had disembarked, his soul ascended unto the Supreme Horizon.

By God! The company of God's well-favoured angels came forth to meet him, and on that day a continual descending and ascending took place as one group from the Concourse on High came down to meet him and another group returned unto their retreats on high. Thus, truly, did it come to pass. Thy Lord, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.

Then did the ship continue on its way by the leave of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, until we arrived before the city in which hath been imprisoned He through Whose appearance the eyes of God's Messengers were gladdened . We disembarked from the ship, and with Us the whole band of Our companions save only four , who were prevented by the oppressors from accompanying Us, and whose hearts so blazed forth that one of them , in his grief at separation from Us, cast himself from the first deck of the ship into the sea. Such was the treatment We received from those who, though they invoke Our Name by day and by night, are bereft of understanding. Even as he cast himself into the sea he called upon God by this Most Great, this Glorious Name, whereupon a company of guardian angels laid hold upon him, as bidden by God, the Sovereign, the Just, the All-Knowing, and bore him up until such time as help could reach him. Thus was it decreed by One Who is the Most Powerful, the Almighty.

Did the other exiles with Yahya also manage to rejoin the Baha'is?

Read about 'Abdu'l-Ghaffar in Memorials of the Faithful.

God is My witness! The things that have befallen us in the way of God are such as neither the pens of the whole earth can describe nor the tongues of all its peoples recount; yet, filled by a joy with which the joy of all the world cannot compare, We say:

'Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God, for having made us the object of Thine irrevocable decree, and for having singled us out to bear tribulations in the pathway of Thy love and Thy good pleasure. I ask Thee by Thine own Self to protect Thy loved ones from whatsoever may prevent them from remembering Thee and from speaking forth Thy praise. Cause them, then, to remain steadfast in these days when most of the people of Thy Kingdom have been held back from turning towards Thy face. Thou, truly, art powerful to do what Thou willest, and Thou, truly, art the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.'

The things that befell Us on Our departure and Our arrival had previously been revealed, and now in this Tablet We have reiterated them, that thou mayest be of those who are informed. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds!

He is the Self-Subsisting, the Everlasting

Glorified be He Who possesseth the kingdom of the heavens and earth, and He, verily, hath knowledge of all things. Before Him boweth down whatsoever is in the heavens and the Throne, and He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. His is the bounty and grace - He quickeneth whom He willeth through His sovereignty, and He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. His is the sovereignty and eternity, the grandeur and glory, the loftiness and splendor, the might and radiance, the majesty and creativity. He forgiveth whom He willeth and chastiseth whom He willeth, and He, verily, is wise in all things. Say: God is the Creator of all things, and We, verily, are witness unto this. Say: God is the Provider of all things, and We, verily, are cognizant of this. Say: God is the Quickener of all things, their Maker, the Sovereign over all things and their Creator, and He, verily, encompasseth all things. Say: O people, fear God and believe in Him Who hath come to you with clear sovereignty and authority. Beware lest ye disdain the worship of your Lord or wax proud after the proof hath reached you from every near direction. Follow not the bidding of your desires, but hasten unto a station of transcendent glory. Say: The test hath come upon you from all directions, and the thunderbolts of the Cause have seized you from every novel quarter. Fear ye God, then stand firm in the Cause, then be steadfast upon the path, and be not tyrannical oppressors in the land. Fear God and drive not away Him Who hath come to you with clear signs - He summoneth you only through a mighty sovereignty. He remembereth you with most excellent remembrance in the Word that hath gleamed from God's horizon. He commandeth you to righteousness and piety, and forbiddeth you transgression and wickedness, and causeth you to hear wondrous and novel verses. O people, if ye have forgotten God's decree in ages past, the people of the Furqan are not far from you. Have the tidings not reached you of those who lived before, who denied God's signs and mocked His Messengers, whereupon He seized them with manifest wrath? Fear ye God and reflect upon what hath passed, that ye may be guided in these days when signs descend from every direction. Say: Should all who are in the heavens and earth prevent you from this, pay no heed but turn away from them and advance toward a beauteous divine countenance. Know then that what thou hast written hath come before Us, and We found therein the fragrance of an exalted love. We answer thee with these verses which have descended in truth from an elevated holy heaven. Know that We loved thee before and love thee now, and desire for thee in Paradise a noble and honored station - a station preceded by none save as God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds, willeth. And thou, O My loved one, strive within thyself to be steadfast in thy love, firm in thy religion, and holding fast to that handle which is mighty in truth. Thus do We impart unto thee that which is better for thee than all in the heavens and earth, if thou behold with the eye of the spirit. Then remember from Our presence all who have believed in God and the Last Day, and who remain constant in love and steadfast in the Cause.

The Book of Revelation hath been sent down from the heaven of divine bounty unto him who hath turned towards God, the Sender of Winds. Verily, in the establishment of the Ancient Beauty upon the Most Great Throne and the rising of the Sun from the horizon of the Prison are signs for those endowed with insight. Cast aside, O people of guidance, that which your idle fancies bid you. Hold fast unto this Cord, whereby, when it is stirred, the worlds are stirred. It hath dawned from the horizon of Names by the leave of the Creator of Heaven. Then aid thy Lord amidst the concourse of creation. Thus art thou commanded from the Dayspring of Inspiration.

Through My remembrance, the unitarians soar unto the heights of truth, and the sincere ascend unto the Daybreak of Lights. Through My name copper is transmuted into gold. My love is the religion of the righteous. Through My sweet call the world was set ablaze, and through My Most Glorious Name the rivers gushed forth from the rocks. The Pen hath been so transported by the wine of the love of the Lord of Eternity that were We to reveal it, it would draw unto itself all that dwell in the lands.

Say: Through My Most Exalted Name the Water of Life hath been proffered unto all creation, and through My name, the All-Merciful, the breezes of forgiveness have wafted. Exalted be My renowned Name - when it is mentioned, the Maids of Paradise emerge from their chambers, advancing toward the seat of Revelation. And through its other pillar the Most Great Scene was illumined, and the Lord of Destiny proclaimed: The Beloved is come and the horizons are brightened. For such a Lord praise beseemeth the people of all religions and faiths.

Be fair, O peoples of the world! Say: Do ye sport with that which floweth from His Pen? By My life! Were it to be cast upon the mountain it would soar unto the Lord of Causes, and were its fragrance to pass over Sinai, it would hasten to the seat of Revelation. Fear God, O ye who are endued with insight! Say: Would ye test His power after it hath encompassed the earth and the heavens? Fear God and question not concerning that which ye are forbidden in the Book. Choose for yourselves that which God hath chosen for you - this is the root of the matter, if ye be among them that perceive.

Say: The Spirit was abashed before the delicacy of His nature, and Light was ashamed to appear before His countenance. Ye have committed that which the Pens are powerless to recount. He, beneath Whose feet the mirrors would be ashamed to be trodden, dwelleth in the most desolate of abodes. Have We borne these trials for Our own sake? Nay, rather for your sake - to this testifieth every atom. Is it meet for anyone to hesitate when they hear the All-Loving proclaim: 'To Me, to Me,' O ye who comprehend! Have I desired aught for Myself in the kingdom? Ponder My deeds, then speak, O ye that are veiled! Have ye found in that which hath appeared from Me any self-preservation? Nay, by the Lord of Lords! Then did the Most Exalted Pen tremble and raise from it the lamentation of weeping, saying: 'After Thee there shall be no mention, O Lord of Names, and no pen, O Thou through Whose remembrance all remembrance is obliterated! How can I move across the Tablet after Thee, and how can anyone hear my scratching? Nay, by Thy life, O Thou in Whose grasp is the kingdom of verses!'

Thus have We revealed unto thee, O thou who art mentioned before the Throne, that which God hath made the crown of the pages of creation. Preserve it as thou wouldst preserve thine eyes, then recite it with the sweetest of melodies. Beware lest anything debar thee from God. Hold fast unto His remembrance and glorify His praise at eventide and dawn. When thou hast attained the Tablet, turn thy face toward the Most Glorious Horizon and say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having remembered me in Thy Most Great Prison. May my soul be a sacrifice for Thy prison, O Thou in Whose hand is the Kingdom of might and power.

O Ghulam, son of Dhabih, upon both of whom be the glory of God! He is the Hearer in the Kingdom of Utterance. This is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down to him who hath believed in God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, that the fragrances of revelation might draw him to the Dawning-Place of the verses of God, the Lord of existence.

O son of Dhabih! Reflect upon the sacrifices for God, exalted be His glory, in this Most Great Revelation, how each one, with utmost eagerness and contentment, set out for the place of sacrifice and offered up their lives for the Peerless Friend. Nevertheless, none took notice, and these mighty deeds only increased the wickedness of the opposers. From pulpits they praise and extol the sacrifice of former times, even though that sacrifice was spared and returned in safety, while of the sacrifices of this Revelation, who freely gave their lives, no mention was or is made. Likewise, they consider the martyrdom of Husayn ibn 'Ali to be the cause of the exaltation of the Cause of the Apostle - may my spirit be sacrificed for all else but Him. Glory be to God! In this Revelation the attraction of divine verses so inflamed the hearts that they flew on wings of longing to the place of sacrifice and offered up their spirits before the feet of the Luminary of the horizons. Where are the eyes to see, where are the ears to hear, and where are the hearts to understand?

O son of Dhabih! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Verses descend like torrential rain by night and day, the ocean of utterance surgeth before the faces of all religions, and the Sun of inner meanings dawns and shineth from the horizon of the heaven of the All-Merciful's mercy. Yet all remain heedless and veiled save whom thy Lord willeth. Today the people of the Bayan are seen to be more lost than the Shi'ih sect. They have set aside their God and taken their vain desires. They have named the Dayyan the father of evil and the Friend of the All-Merciful the father of calamities, and they have embraced tyranny and shed his blood.

O son of Dhabih! Upon thee and upon those with thee be the light of My utterance and My mercy. Observe the wickedness of the heedless souls. Because of Siyyid Muhammad Isfahani - who was unworthy of mention and whom We expelled from Our presence and service - some have remained veiled and deprived of the Divine Revelation and the Dawning-Place of celestial light. They slay the Dayyan while asking about one who hath no mention with God, the Lord of all worlds.

God is witness and aware that this Wronged One's purpose and desire is to remove strife, corruption and conflict from the world and to purify the hearts of all peoples from rancor and hatred. The heedless ones have clung to names while remaining deprived of their Creator, Source and Lord. Names have become as idols for some, and the Shi'ih sect is truly recorded with God as worshippers of names, and on the Day of Reckoning they have done what no oppressor hath ever done - from pulpits they curse and revile the Object of all the worlds. Leave their mention and what they possess, turning to God, the Lord of all worlds.

Convey My greetings to all the women and gladden them all with the remembrance and orientation of the Wronged One. They have never been and never shall be forgotten. We beseech God to preserve you from the evil of those who have denied Him and His verses. Glory be upon you and upon those with you, and may you be remembered by God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

In My Name, the Wronged One, the Stranger! O Greater Lady, Mother of Afnan, and Aqa Mirza Aqa, upon both of whom be the Most Glorious Beauty of God! Thou hast ever been remembered, and art still remembered, in the Most Great Prison. Some time ago thy letter was received and was read before My face. From it We perceived the fragrance of thy sincerity and thy love for God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forebears. The people of the world have denied this most great favor, though the Cause is manifest, verses have been revealed, and clear proofs are evident, the Light is radiant. Yet the recompense for the deeds of the servants hath prevented them from the ocean of the utterance of the All-Merciful, save whom God willeth. By the life of God! The Afnans of the Divine Lote-Tree have attained to that which hath no likeness or parallel. All must fix their gaze upon the supreme horizon and, with utmost joy and radiance, occupy themselves with the remembrance of the Goal of all who dwell on earth. We beseech God to protect that which He hath bestowed from thieves and betrayers. It hath previously been said: "The true believer is rarer than red sulfur." Certain souls outwardly claim to have turned towards God while inwardly they strive diligently to lead His servants astray. We previously said concerning the transgressors and the heedless: "Your likeness is as the morning star that appeareth to shine brightly, yet in truth causeth the caravans of My cities and regions to go astray." Be not grieved at what hath befallen thee. The glance of Our loving-kindness hath been and shall ever be upon thee. God will soon manifest that which He hath purposed. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Thou hast shared with God in His tribulations. All the treasures of the earth cannot equal this testimony. He Who possesseth the perspicuous Book beareth witness unto this. We make mention of the wife of the Afnan, upon her be My glory and loving-kindness, and all the household. We beseech God to aid them in that which He loveth and pleaseth, to strengthen them with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, and to ordain for them that which will draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful. Concerning the countenance of the Most Exalted Leaf, upon her be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, We have commanded the Greater Afnan, upon him be My glory, to write to the land of Ya. That countenance must reach that honored lady. This is what the Wronged One hath decreed. We beseech God to aid them in that which they have been commanded by the Ancient Ordainer. The glory from Our presence be upon thee and upon those women who have believed in the All-Informed, the One. O my God! Look upon Thy Afnans with the glances of the eyes of Thy mercy and bounty, then ordain for them that which shall make them pages of Thy remembrance and praise amongst Thy servants and creatures. O Lord! Thou seest them turning toward Thee and holding fast to the cord of Thy generosity and bounty. I beseech Thee, by the ocean of Thy verses and the lights of the Sun of Thy knowledge, to preserve them from the oppression of the enemies of Thy Self who have turned away from Thy horizon and have committed that which hath caused the Supreme Paradise and the dwellers of the most exalted Heaven to lament. O God! Send Thy blessings upon them and upon those whom neither armies could prevent from taking Thy Book nor ranks from turning to the lights of Thy countenance. Verily, Thou art powerful to do what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Protector of those who are in the heavens and on earth. Praise be unto Thee, for Thou art the Goal of the mystics and the Beloved of those near unto Thee.

O Nabil-i-Qab'l-Isma'il, upon him be the Glory of God! In the name of the one true God! Thy letter which thou didst send to the Nazir, upon him be the Glory of God, attained the presence of this Wronged One. We saw it and heard it. Praise be to God, every word thereof testified to thy turning and devotion to the Most Exalted Horizon. We beseech God to increase at all times thy steadfastness, love and devotion. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.

O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! In this Most Great Revelation and Mighty Announcement, praiseworthy deeds and pleasing virtues have been supporters and helpers, as hath been revealed in the Books, Psalms, Scriptures and Tablets from the Supreme Pen. Today the people of truth must be adorned with the ornament of trustworthiness, righteousness, truthfulness and sincerity. Blessed is the heart that hath been illumined with the light of trustworthiness. After the recognition of God and steadfastness in His Cause cometh the station of trustworthiness. We beseech God not to deprive cities and lands of its lights. Trustworthiness hath ever been the cause of the world's wealth and the reason for divine blessing and infinite bounties.

This Wronged One is saddened by certain events that have occurred. Convey My greetings to those who have turned to God. Impart unto all the divine counsels, that haply they may turn from what they possess to what God possesseth, and hold fast unto that which befitteth this Day.

Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty, and the lights of the Day-Star of Thy Revelation, and by Thy verses that have encompassed earth and heaven, and by Thy arising to establish Thy Cause after the passing away of all things, to send down from the heaven of Thy grace upon Thy loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and enable them to recognize that which will profit them in this world and the next, through Thy generosity and bounty. O Lord! Illumine their hearts with the light of Thy knowledge, and adorn their heads with the crowns of trustworthiness amidst Thy creatures, and their temples with the ornament of detachment through Thy grace and mercy. I beseech Thee, O Lord of all being and Sovereign over the seen and unseen, to make Thy loved ones the standards of Thy guidance amongst Thy servants and the banners of Thy truth in Thy lands. Then protect this servant of Thine from those who have abandoned what they were bidden in Thy Book and have done what they were forbidden by Thy command. O Lord! Ordain for me the good of this world and the next, then send down upon me from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will make me independent through Thy riches, detached from all else save Thee, standing firm in Thy service and speaking Thy praise. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

We beseech God to cause the people of that land to attain unto that which hath been revealed in these blessed words, that all may be adorned with an ornament whose light shall guide the peoples of the world to the Dawning-Place of God's Command and the Dayspring of His verses. Verily, He is powerful over all things.

Thou hast been and art remembered before the Wronged One. Soon shall appear what God, the Powerful, the Mighty, hath ordained for thee. The Nazir and Asadu'llah, upon them be My Glory and loving-kindness, abide beneath the canopies of grandeur, at rest. Under all conditions be ye vigilant in exalting the Word. Your affairs are referred to God. Verily He hath ordained for thee what He willeth, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have quaffed the wine of steadfastness from the cup of the favor of their Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous.

O Mirza 'Abbas-Quli! Upon him be the Glory of God, He Who speaks in the Kingdom of Utterance. Your letter which you sent to Samandar - upon him be My loving-kindness and mercy - was forwarded to the Most Holy Court and attained the honor of being heard in the presence. The fragrance of divine knowledge was wafted from it. Praise be to God that you have attained the honor of mention, praise and acceptance. In these days when all peoples, both learned and common, have turned away and have done that which caused all things to lament - they spoke of the Imam yet killed his Creator; they spoke of the Successor yet martyred his Sovereign. Glory be to God! They continue anew to utter these names. It is not known what they have understood of the Day of God. I swear by the Sun of Utterance rising from the horizon of the prison's heaven - until the heart is freed from names it will not attain unto reality nor reach the ocean of inner meanings. The first station in this Cause is detachment from all save God. Read what the All-Merciful has revealed in the Qur'an: "Say: 'God' then leave them to their vain discourse." If a soul discovers the fragrance of this blessed word, he will find himself free and liberated. Such a one is of the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark. The clay figures of the world have newly desired to play at successorship, while by the life of God they were and are unaware of the root of the Cause, its beginning, its Manifestation, its Originator and its Creator. The Mother Book bears witness and the Mother of the Bayan testifies. One who intended to remove killing from the world they have accused of killing. Say: Die in your wrath! The possessors of sight and hearing are not and will not be prevented by such idle fancies. In all Tablets whatever was the purpose of the Ancient Beauty has been explicitly mentioned and revealed. Blessed are they who understand! Glory be to God! They called the honored Dayyan "the father of evil" and martyred him, and they called the honored Khalil "the father of calamities" and perpetrated that which caused the denizens of the highest Paradise to weep, and likewise with other souls. Were God to will it, We would mention what they committed in the days of God through tyranny and oppression. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. We have mentioned the friends of Alif and Shin both before and after. Praise be to God that each has attained the verses of the Supreme Pen. We beseech God to manifest in all such steadfastness as befits this Most Great Cause and is worthy of this Mighty Announcement. O people of God! The victorious hosts today are praiseworthy character and deeds. We have enjoined upon Our loved ones goodly conduct and the fear of God, the Lord of all worlds. The Glory be upon you from Us, O My loved ones, and upon those who have held fast to the Most Great Cord and clung to the hem of God's loving-kindness, the Beloved of those who know. When you attain My Tablet say: Praise be to You, O You Who remembered me in Your Most Great Prison! I beseech You to forgive me and whoever has turned to You, then ordain for me the good of the hereafter and of this world. You are the Powerful, the Mighty, and worthy to answer prayers. O 'Abdu'l-Husayn, say: My God, my God! Make known to Your servants the path of Your good-pleasure, then grant them the blessing of visiting Your House and illumine their hearts with the light of Your knowledge, then ordain for them what You have ordained for Your chosen ones, by the glory of Muhammad, the Seal of Your Prophets.

In the name of Him Who hath established Himself between the heavens and the earth! This is an epistle from Him Who was in the hands of the enemies in the path of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and upon Whom fell the arrows of tribulation until He was imprisoned in this Most Great Prison - the station of Him from Whose robe's hem were severed the hands of those near unto God - unto him who hath heard the call of God, that he may stand firm in the Cause and be detached from those who believed and then denied God, the Most High, the Most Great.

O servant! Know thou that tribulations in the Cause of God are sweeter than all else that hath been created between earth and heaven, and none shall find their sweetness save the hearts of the lovers. How many nights did I find solace in the chains of iron, and I would kiss them for love of God, the King, the Protector, the Mighty, the Bountiful. And how many days did I address my neck beneath the fetters, saying: "Blessed art thou for having borne, in the path of the Beloved, the chains of the oppressors." And I was grateful for all that befell Us, and We were among the thankful.

I bore such hardships as none had borne, until the Sun of the Cause shone forth upon all created things. Then rose up against Me those servants whom We had supported in all matters and taught throughout the months and years. And they reached such heights of opposition that they would read My words, then war against My Self, being unaware. They would seek help through My names, then shed holy blood with the swords of hatred. Thus dost thou witness the state of these people. Be thou possessed of keen insight.

O servant! Hear My counsel, then ponder what hath befallen My Self from previous peoples and what I have borne for God's sake. By God! It is a testimony unto all the worlds. Beware lest anything hold thee back from God. Be thou detached from all that veils thee from Him, then turn with all thy being to His shining, holy and luminous countenance. Verily, those who have denied God - God will seize them with a vengeance from His presence, and He is the most severe in retribution.

Then aid thy Lord through utterance. Say: O people! Have mercy upon yourselves and oppose not Him at Whose door the Faithful Spirit standeth, in Whose presence the denizens of the all-highest Paradise glory, and Whom the inhabitants of Paradise serve at all times. O people! Do ye deny Him through Whom God granted you victory in truth and raised the pavilions of the Cause upon the shore of a mighty sea? O people! This is the Lamp of God among you, which He hath preserved through His Most Great Name from the winds that blow from the direction of your hearts, O company of polytheists! Be ye ashamed before Him Who created and fashioned you, and render not your deeds vain, but be among the doers of good.

Thus do We counsel thee, O thou who doest good, that thou mayest be beneficent in God's Cause and remind thyself of what the Spirit hath cast upon thee, and also remind the veiled souls who have neglected God's Cause and shall never attain understanding, who cling to traditions in their possession even after they have not comprehended the Cause. Thus have their souls enticed them in a matter and made them to be among the deniers. And thou, avoid those from whose hearts the breezes of holiness have been entirely cut off, and place thy trust in God, the Most High, the Most Glorious. Verily, He sufficeth thee in truth, and He is the best Sufficing One and Helper. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon thy son and thy family, and upon those who have passed over the Path and were among the detached ones.

Those who have veiled themselves from God, these have been heedless of their Lord's remembrance and the angels near the throne curse them. Say: Do ye deny what your Beloved witnesseth above all things? Fie upon you, O company of the deluded! Those who would purchase women's cloaks with their eyes to cover themselves therewith have now emerged with a strange deadly poison. Say: Where were ye, O heedless ones, in the days when your souls were agitated by the cry of a weak gnat, when thou didst see the chief of the deniers? Say: O veiled one, how long wilt thou not be fair in the Cause of thy Lord, nor show mercy to thyself, and be of the heedless ones? Say: By God, were it not for My Self, ye would be non-existent upon the earth - and ye bear witness to that which God hath witnessed, if ye be of the fair-minded. Say: Have you forgotten, O servant, the days when if any among you would enter into the presence, people would drive him away and even curse him with great wrath? Yet when the breezes of security wafted, ye emerged with swords of hatred, turning toward God, the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful. By God, the eye of creation hath not seen anyone more veiled than thee and those who followed thee without My leave and who walked the paths of delusion. O Husayn, hear the call of this Husayn at the time when Shimr stood at His right, and the spear was held before His head, and the accursed Khawli stood before His face, and He called out among these polytheists saying: O people, slay Me not with swords of hatred - I am but the Self of Ali among you, and the Spirit of Muhammad within you, and the Beauty of God before you. Fear God and be not of the wrongdoers. Fear God and shed not the blood of Him at Whose spilling the pillars of the Throne shake and the supports of the exalted Seat cease to be. Say: O people, I have not spoken among you except in truth, and I have not commanded you save what the Spirit hath uttered in My heart with wondrous melodies of glory. Be ashamed before Him Who sacrificed Himself in My path - have mercy on My wronged and lonely Self. Thus was the command of the Youth among these cattle in this prison, and We have related it to thee that thou mayest share in grief with the Prophets. Hear My words and shun those who have denied God Who created all things and sent the Messengers. Then remind the people with wisdom that they may recognize the Beauty of the Divine Unity and arise from the slumber of the heedless ones. Know thou that We remembered thee before thou didst remember Me, and We strengthened thee for the victory of My Cause, and We inspired thee with that which would establish My Cause against the ignorant ones, and We ordained for thee in the heaven of destiny abundant good - this is from God's favor unto thee that thou mayest be of the thankful ones. Convey God's greetings to the faces of those who have believed and to the face of thy wife, then give her glad tidings of her Lord's remembrance. We have made her one of Our successful handmaidens and We have mentioned her name in tablets of mighty glory. Thus doth God single out for His mercy whomsoever He willeth, and He is indeed the Lord of bounty and transcendent mercy.

O Siyyid Mirza, upon him be the Glory of God! In the Name of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed! This is a Book from Us to him who hath been illumined by the lights that have shone forth from the horizon of his Lord's Will, the Most High, the Most Exalted, in the days when the Beauty of the Unseen cast aside the veil from His face and appeared with the sovereignty of His Most Glorious Name amidst the concourse of creation, and every thing proclaimeth that there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Gracious. Blessed art thou for having rent asunder the veils and for not having been hindered by the clouds of glory from turning towards thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. The Spirit of God hath quickened thee and the breezes whose fragrances have been wafted throughout the worlds have awakened thee. Blessed art thou for having associated with him whom We have chosen for Our remembrance and whom thou didst honor when he came unto thee with the mention of God, the Beloved of those who know. Take thou the Tablet of God and its effects, then leave those who have disbelieved even if they should come unto you with the scriptures of the first and the last ones, for today nothing shall profit anyone save attachment to this Cord which hath been stretched between the heavens and the earths. They who are in doubt in these days of their Lord - these shall have no portion of this Kawthar which hath flowed from the mouth of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, at the midmost heart of Paradise. God shall soon seize them with a mighty grip from His presence, for He is the most severe in punishment. Soon will come unto you one who will call you to Satan. Thus doth the Pen of the All-Merciful inform you beforehand in a Tablet of wondrous glory. Say: O people, shun him and follow not those who have disbelieved in Him in Whom they had believed. By God! They dwell in nothing but manifest delusion. Say: O people! Do ye worship names and deny their Creator? Woe unto you from the punishment of a grievous day! We have ordained for thee in the heaven of Our command a glorious and noble station. He, verily, aideth those who have stood firm in His Cause, and He is the Rewarder of the doers of good. Vain imaginings have encompassed all men except such as have laid hold on the hem of thy Lord's robe, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. He is among the most exalted of creation - the denizens of the Supreme Paradise and the angels nearest to God send their prayers upon him. Say: With Him is the knowledge of all things. Not an atom's weight in the breasts of all created things can escape His knowledge. He recompenseth every soul for what it hath earned, and He knoweth all things. We beseech God to manifest through thee that which shall bring joy to the eyes of them that have recognized His unity, and to make thee a standard of guidance among His creatures and a leader of His servants in this Day wherein the veils of glory have been rent asunder and God hath come with manifest beauty. At all times will He aid thee to remember and praise Him amongst His servants, for He hath power over all things. Rejoice thou in God's loving-kindness and mercy, for His mercy hath encompassed thee through His grace - none can comprehend it save those who have soared in this atmosphere which God hath sanctified from the idle fancies of them that doubt. Were the veil to be lifted from what We have ordained for thee in this Tablet, the servants would be bewildered, nay thunderstruck. Therefore have We concealed it as a grace from Our presence, for He is the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. We beseech God that He change not His decree and that He send down upon thee at all times that which will draw thee unto Him and sever thee from all else. There is none other God but He, the Giver, the Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The fragrance that hath been wafted from the garment of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, be upon thee and upon them that are with thee among God's sincere servants.

O Muhammad-Sadiq! In the name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious! This is a letter from the Prisoner to him who hath believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, who came to Iraq and upon whom shone the Day-Star of the horizons with mighty splendors, who entered the Spot of Paradise and attained the presence of his Lord, the Most High, the All-Knowing, with Whom the Tongue of God conversed in words of impregnable glory whereby were created the heavens and earths, the treasures of inner meanings were revealed among His creation, and there emerged from the earth what God, the King, the Powerful, the Forgiving, the Merciful, had buried therein of His treasures. Blessed art thou for having attained the Most Great Scene, the Spot wherein was established the throne of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and thou wert among those who attained. However, in those days the appointed time for the Cause had not been fulfilled, therefore We concealed the Face lest the servants recognize it, though it was shining from the horizon of holiness with manifest radiance. When the appointed time was fulfilled, the veils were rent asunder and thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, appeared from behind them and spoke a word whereat all in the heavens and earth were struck with terror. By God! Those who have purified their vision from names and turned to their Creator are among the choicest of creation - through them mercy descends from the clouds of the Cause and there grows from the earth the plants of knowledge and wisdom from the presence of One mighty and knowing. Know thou that We have not forgotten thee - be thou assured by the grace of thy Lord. Verily He forgets not His sincere servants. We have sent down to thee a Tablet wherein is detailed all things, wert thou of those who know. However, when Satan lurked in every pathway, We were prevented from sending it. When the way was opened by Our power, We sent thee this mighty, impregnable Tablet that thou mayest find from it the fragrance of the Beloved and be independent of the tablets of the worlds. Say: Through one word of this Tablet have all the Tablets of God been sent down aforetime. Beware, O people, lest ye deny it and be of the heedless. This is He of Whom the Bayan spoke, sent down by your Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. Say: O people, be ye ashamed before Him Who created you by His command, and deny not Him but for Whom the Books of God, the Just King, the Wise, would not have been revealed. Fear thou no one, but remember thy Lord - verily He will guard thee from the hosts of the wrongdoers. Say: O loved ones! Ye dwell in your homes while the Youth is imprisoned by the hands of the heedless. Ye lie upon your couches while the Eye of God rains tears from the oppression of these polytheists. Time hath brought Me so low that he who was created by My word hath risen to oppose Me and prideth himself in serving Me - God is witness to what I say. Soon shall they know, when death comes upon them and their frames tremble from the force of divine wrath - then shall they cry: "Alas for what we neglected toward our Lord, the All-Merciful! We were truly among the most lost!" Though their souls be seized and they be among the dead before thy Lord, they are deaf, dumb and blind, though they witness things and speak what their selves and desires confirm unto them. Thus have We judged with truth, and I am the Doer of what I will. Convey God's greetings to the faces of those who have turned to His Face and detached themselves from the polytheists. Praise be to God, thy Beloved and the Beloved of the mystics.

Mirza Hashim Khan

He is the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most High!

This is a Book sent down in truth, wherein is guidance and remembrance for all the worlds. Hearken, O servant, unto that which is revealed unto thee from the direction of the Throne, the Station round which circle the denizens of the Concourse on High, then those who dwell in the depths of Names, then they who move in the atmosphere of holiness, this sacred and luminous Space: that there is none other God but Him, alone with no partner, no minister, no peer and no likeness unto Him. He hath ever been single in His Essence and unique in His Being. He sent forth the Messengers aforetime unto His creation, testifying that there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Most High, the Great.

Bear thou witness, even as God hath caused thy heart and tongue to witness, and be thou of them that are assured of the Revelation of God and the Manifestation of His Self, and be of the steadfast. Know thou then that thy name was mentioned before the Face, and therefore were verses of mighty glory sent down from the cloud of holiness, and We sent them unto thee as a mercy from Our presence that thou mayest be of the thankful. When they reach thee, take them with the hand of power and might, then read them with the melodies of them that are nigh. Through them shall be produced in hearts that which shall detach them from contingent things and draw them nigh unto the direction of a mighty throne.

Be thou steadfast in the Cause of God and His love, and there shall descend upon thee from the heaven of the unseen that which shall gladden thy heart, for He is the Rewarder of the steadfast. Beware that thou grieve not over this world, for it shall pass away, and that which remaineth for thee is what hath been ordained in the Most Exalted Kingdom by the Pen of thy Lord, and this is a certain truth. Seek thou, O servant, the grace of God and His mercy, and despair not of His wondrous mercy that hath encompassed all created things. Thus hath the Command been sent down at this moment in truth, that thou mayest be of them that rejoice.

He sendeth down at every moment upon His servants whatsoever He willeth, and with Him is the knowledge of all things that have been created between the heavens and the earths. Not an atom escapeth His knowledge. He ruleth over the kingdom as He pleaseth by His sovereignty, and none can gainsay His irrevocable and wise decree. Remember thou thy Lord in the night season and the days, then at eventide and dawn, and fear thou no one, for He shall guard thee from the hosts of the oppressors. Put thy trust in Him in all matters and be of them that trust. Then be content with whatsoever God hath been pleased with in these days, for this is His Revelation and His sovereignty amongst the worlds.

Say: O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast manifested Thyself unto all created things and hast risen above all beings, to detach me from all that Thy good-pleasure abhorreth and to send down upon me that which is best for me, for Thou knowest what profiteth me and I know not, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O my Lord! Leave me not to myself and my desires, then send down upon me from the cloud of Thy mercy that which shall purify me from the mention of aught else but Thee. Then assign me a seat of truth with Thee, then send down upon me the good of this world and the next. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest, and Thou art the Munificent, the Generous.

Thus have We remembered thee and commanded thee that thou mayest be of them that act. And glory be upon thee and upon them who are steadfast in the Cause of God and are of the firm ones.

He is the Mighty. This is a Book which speaks with truth and reminds the people in days wherein clouds of grief have risen sorrowfully and rained upon all created things from showers of intense anguish, whereby tears of sorrow flowed from the eyes of those near unto God, and this was grievous unto Us. O friends of God! By God, I desired naught for you save that which is better for you than all who dwell in the realm of creation. Say: O concourse of the beloved! Hearken unto the call of this Bird Who warbles in the heart of existence, and grieve Him not on a day wherein sorrows have encompassed Him from all directions - and God is witness to what I say. And ye know what hath befallen Me from the embodiments of tyrannical wickedness. By God, at such time the eyes of the denizens of the Realm of Eternity weep over what hath befallen this Servant, Who turned wholly unto God and paid no heed to anyone, nor hearkened to the words of any soul, and was wholly detached from all else but Him. Do ye not witness how the oppressors among the people have gathered against Us and drawn the swords of hatred against Us every morn and eve? They have risen up to wage war against Us and rejoice in what befalleth Us of this matter which hath caused the hearts of the mystics to be consumed, and the embodiments of existence weep in chambers of crimson ruby, and the dwellers of earth and heaven cry out, and then the celestial beings of might and power in most exalted sanctuaries of holiness. Therefore, O My loved ones, be not content that after this there should descend from you upon Us that which would consume Our hearts and grieve Our souls and cause tears to flow upon radiant and luminous cheeks. By God, We love you more than ye love Us, and all who dwell within the canopies of a mighty Name bear witness to this. Therefore dwell in your hearts and be not disturbed by what God hath ordained for Us in a mighty Book, and be content with what God hath been pleased with for Us and decreed for Us, and be at all times purely submissive to God's command. Thus do We counsel you in truth - follow My bidding for the sake of the love that existeth between Me and you, and touch Me not with the sorrow of your grief, for I love not the sorrow of any one of you, and this is with Me greater than all greatness. And thou, O Muhammad, remember Me after Me and be not frightened in this terror which hath encompassed all the worlds. Be patient in the Cause of thy Lord and be not disturbed within thyself, and trust in God in this darksome night which hath encompassed all existence both small and great. Fear God and be not a cause of My burning anguish after thou knowest that I am seated at the heart of tribulations and trials - and God sufficeth as a witness and knower between Me and you. Therefore have mercy upon Me, O My loved ones, and hearken unto My words at a time when, if I turn to the right, I hear the lamentations of the mystics with voices of manifest grief, and when I turn to the left, I perceive the inner turmoil of the hearts of the lovers like water that boileth in an iron pot. By God, I have forgotten all matters, for the Beloved is unable to hear the cry of the lovers every morn and eve. Thus do We counsel thee that thou mayest hear My words and be firm in My love, that I may find rest from this sorrow which hath encompassed Me from your lamentations and be at peace from thee.

He is God, Who has been wise in all things. The inscribed leaf was witnessed and the celestial melody was heard in the realm of might. Praise be to Him Who has elevated you to the heaven of His love and settled you upon the earth of His affection and made you hear His wondrous melodies and made you one of the believers in His verses and those assured of His Book and those who drink from the cups of His bounty and those who gaze upon the garments of His countenance and those who are content with His decree and those who are patient in His tribulation and those who hasten to His good-pleasure and those who ascend to His holy precincts and those who rise to the carpet of His intimacy and Who has purified you from indication of aught else. Now, when you have drunk of the sweet water of grace from the hands of bounty, say: Glory be to Thee, O my God! I call upon Thee with every tongue and I beseech Thee with every utterance and I remember Thee with every heart and I thank Thee with every mouth and I prostrate before Thee with every face and I behold Thee with every eye and I love Thee with every inmost heart and with every cup I drink from the seas of the graces of the heaven of Thy generosity and with every chalice I am given to drink from the rivers of the outpourings of the might of Thy bounty and with every wing I fly to the heavens of the throne of Thy grandeur and with every feather I soar in the splendors of the might of Thy mercy that I may be intoxicated at the warbling of the dove of the Sovereign of Thy majesty and enraptured at the manifestation of the dawning of the Sun of Thy beauty and bewildered in the mysteries of the divine realm from the glances of the eyes of the might of Thy oneness and as nothing upon the throne of the Kingdom at the burning brands of the most luminous glory of Thy attraction that I may be wholly detached unto Thee and beseeching of Thee and clinging to the holy manifestations of Thy Self-Sufficiency and entreating the aspects of intimacy of Thy Oneness. Then teach me, O my God, a letter from the repositories of Thy knowledge and the treasuries of Thy Revelation and the dawning-places of Thy Command and the daysprings of Thy wisdom that I may remember Thee upon the throne of the cloud with the melodies of the sanctified ones and thank Thee with knowledge upon the seat of glory with the myriads of the purified ones and praise Thee upon the most glorious throne with the songs of those who glorify Thee. For Thou, O my God, hast ordained no glory except in the knowledge of Thy Book and no light except in the recognition of Thy verses. So glory be to Thee, glory be to Thee! We are all poor before Thee and servants unto Thee and we know nothing except what Thou teachest us from the wonders of Thy grace and the effulgences of Thy generosity, for in Thy hand is the kingdom of all things and we all bow down before Thee and hope in Thy mercy. And I beseech Thee, O God, my God, by the one whom Thou hast raised to the heavens of Thine eternity and seated upon the throne of grandeur in the station of Thy sovereignty and distinguished among the servants at the dawning-places of Thy Command and the conditions of the holiness of Thy Self-Sufficiency and the signs of intimacy of Thy Oneness and the intimations of the manifestations of the light of Thy Self-Subsistence and the beginnings of the splendors of the lines of the cloud of the appearance of Thine Essence, that Thou unite Thy servants as Thou hast united Thy letters and create love in the mysteries of their hearts through Thy power as Thou hast created it among their conditions through Thy might. Then kindle in their hearts the fire of Thy knowledge and the splendor of the light of the sun of Thy oneness, for in Thy hand is the kingdom of the dominion of the heavens and the earth and Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest.

He is God, exalted be His glory in wisdom and utterance!

O Name of Bounty! Upon thee be My glory! The letter of His name Jamal and Samandar (upon both of them be My glory) which they sent to you was seen. The fragrance of sincerity, love and steadfastness was outwardly and inwardly diffused therefrom. They have drunk the wine of grace and bounty from the cup of the favor of their Lord, the Most Glorious, and have attained that which was hidden from eyes and inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Book.

That which was mentioned therein regarding the affairs of the Sheikh (upon him be My glory) attained the glance of grace. We beseech the All-Bountiful to send upon them the rain of His bounty and mercy and to open before their faces the gates of eternal blessing and favor. Verily He is the Lord of creation and the Lord of the mighty throne. That which flows from the Supreme Pen has appeared and shall appear. Verily He is powerful over all things.

According to what was mentioned, His name Jamal intended to send an answer to the most noble authorities regarding the question he had asked. This is not permissible. In this matter silence is preferable. What is necessary are words that cause assurance and trust, and even that only if the occasion arises. If something were written now it would cause agitation and lead to expansive imaginings, therefore it is not permitted. If an occasion arises, words expressing humility, submissiveness, love and resignation would be good and acceptable at the Sacred Threshold. Otherwise speaking without occasion is not permitted.

What is now necessary and what all must focus on is teaching the Cause with wisdom and utterance, and in such manner that it does not cause the spread of corruption. The presence of His name in that land day by day is also beloved, for if the stay exceeds the bounds of moderation it will surely cause talk. Glory be to God! Although God's will in this Revelation is clear and evident to all, still they mix their own knowledge with the ignorant fabrications of the calumniators.

In any case, some days ago verses were specifically revealed for Jamal from the heaven of favor. We beseech God to assist him through what was sent down from the kingdom of His wondrous utterance.

O Jamal! In all conditions look to reconciliation and to that which brings tranquility. His Majesty the Sultan, in two instances, outwardly protected this community from evil ones through the hosts of justice and fairness - first in Ha and Mim, and again in the land of Kaf. In truth he did that which befits justice and fairness. Therefore all should be content and thankful. In all conditions remind the believers. The Supreme Pen in scriptures and tablets has forbidden all from that which saddens hearts, let alone oppression, transgression and corruption. We beseech God to adorn His loved ones with the ornament of love, fellowship, harmony and unity, and to illumine them with the lights of the luminary of justice. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Chosen One. Glory be upon thee from Us, and upon those with thee, and those who love thee for My sake, and upon those who hold fast to good deeds and cling to the hem of righteousness, as commanded by God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

In the name of God, the Holy, the Most Holy.

O denizens of the Concourse on High! Other decrees have been ordained for Us, and they are intending yet another Pit into which to hurl this eternal Joseph. That Pit is in the fortress of 'Akka.

Very soon they will expel Us from this land and they will incarcerate Us there. In truth that city is decrepit, unclean; its air is bad, its waters are polluted and foul-smelling, and they wish to shut from His Face all bounties and gifts which have been ordained for His Self by God, the Omnipotent, the Almighty, the All-knowing. Very soon you shall see and hear that of which We inform you in this Tablet - things whereat the tears of the near ones will be shed, and mysteries of divine decree about which the lamentations of the sincere ones will be raised - all by virtue of what will befall us yet another time. In all circumstances We thank God in all that will befall us in his love and his good pleasure.

As to Akka it is a City one direction of which is towards the River Jordan across which the Friend of God, Abraham, passed and in whose environs He called God His Lord using the melodies of the peoples of Paradise. In another direction it faces the Holy and Sacred Vale from which was raised the call of all the Prophets and Messengers saying: "Here we are! Here we are! O Lord our God!" Very soon We shall smell its air and We shall hear all that was raised therein. And yet from another direction 'Akka faces the wilderness of Sinai. I swear by the righteousness of God! When this Youth turns towards it every atom of its earth, every leaf of its trees, and every pebble of its sands cries out saying: "there is none other God but He".

O my Friends when you shall hear of My calamities, the like of which the eye of creation has not seen, do not be saddened inasmuch as We have been created for all these afflictions and tribulations and God has ordained that they be the oil for My Lamp. Blessed is the one who understands My meaning and blessed is the one who is enraptured by the fragrances of the words of this Youth Who has always been the targets of the arrows of men in the path of God.

Say unto them: this is a Youth for if He were to be drowned in the sea He will praise God in the company of the fish of the sea, and if His head be raised on the cross He will make mention of His God, the All Merciful. And if every member of His body be cut, that cut member will raise its voice testifying: "in truth I have attained to that which was my highest hope and highest aspiration."

O My loved ones! Be not grieved. Rather walk over My traces and cling firmly to the Cord of God. If the veil be lifted you would all sacrifice yourselves to hear that Word that ascendeth from the mouth of the Well-Beloved, and so much will yearning enrapture your beings that chains and tumults will not deter you from turning to this Luminary of the entire world.

O My loved ones! You are the children of the Spirit. Be not grieved over your bodies. Rather be gladdened by the glad-tidings of the All-Merciful with spirit and fragrance. Then remain steadfast in the love of God and His Cause, then follow what hath been revealed in the Book and follow not every doubtful polytheist. Thus doth the Youth counsel you at a time when He is immersed in an ocean of sorrows through what the hands of the heedless have wrought, while My tongue, My heart, My limbs and My hair all proclaim "Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds." The Youth hath been prevented from writing, else We would have sent to each one of the loved ones of God that which would cause him to be detached from all the worlds. My Self hath been imprisoned, then My Pen, and the latter is greater than the former. This hath not occurred except due to lack of capacity in the realm of creation. Soon shall come a time when they shall become aware of some of what they have perpetrated; they shall weep and supplicate but shall find nothing for themselves to compensate for what hath passed them by. Thus doth the Pen of Truth inform you, and verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is witness to what they have done and what they do, and He is indeed cognizant of what lieth within the breasts.

In the Name of Him Who is manifest before all faces!

O people of Ha and Mim! Hear the call of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. He hath mentioned you before in numerous Tablets which the tablets of the world and what the nations possess cannot equal. To this doth the Most Great Name bear witness in this exalted and glorious station.

O Muhammad-Quli! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Sorrows have encompassed Me from all directions through what the hands of the oppressors have wrought. How many a servant claims faith within himself and steadfastness in the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds, yet the Wronged One witnesses great hypocrisy. Were We to reveal what is in their hearts, they would lament for this Wronged and Exiled One. We have sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs and raised up the Cause, yet the people are in evident ignorance. Say: Glory be to Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the All-Bountiful. Glory be to Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the All-Generous. Glory be to Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Chosen One, to deliver the Dawning-Place of Thy verses, the Manifestation of Thy clear proofs, and the Source of Thy commandments and ordinances from those who claim faith outwardly yet inwardly support Thine enemies. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned to Thee over successive years and Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy bounty clear verses. I beseech Thee by them and by their Revealer to strengthen me in the Great Steadfastness, lest there appear from me that which would cause the angels, the Spirit, and those who circle round the Throne to lament at morn and eve. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.

O Muhammad-Quli! Convey greetings and glorification from the Lord of Majesty to the friends of that land of every kind. Say: By the Sun of Truth which hath shone forth from the horizon of the prison of Akka, each of you is mentioned in the presence of the Countenance and hath attained special favor. Some of the friends in their cities and lands considered themselves helpers of God's Cause, yet in their inmost hearts they are occupied with helping the enemies. Glory be to Him Who seeth and concealeth, and He is the All-Patient, the All-Concealing, the Compassionate, the Bountiful. We beseech God to confirm all in that which will cause the exaltation of His Cause. Glory be to God! In all ages most people took the calf as the station of Truth and worshipped it. Such is the condition of creation, except those through whose steadfastness the pillars of the idol and false god were shaken and every lying pretender was thunderstruck.

O My friends! This is the day of hearing and sight, and the time of victory and triumph. All must arise to serve the Cause through divine power and might, and must conquer hearts and souls through the hosts of wisdom and utterance. They are of the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark in God's clear Book. Today the friends of God are souls who gaze toward the highest horizon and hold fast to the cord of the Most Great Name. There is no distinction between them except in the station of steadfastness, precedence and knowledge. Say: Read what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an - His exalted Word: "Verily the most honored among you in the sight of God is the most righteous of you." This is the most holy and pure garment. Blessed is he who hath clung to it and adorned his temple with this sacred and luminous ornament. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you and upon those who love you and hear your word concerning this Most Great and Mighty Announcement.

O Jamal! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Self-Sufficing, the Most High! The Most Great Branch was present and conveyed that which thou hadst sent to him. Have no doubt concerning what thou hast heard from the Tongue of Grandeur and what hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. My mercy hath preceded thee, My loving-kindness hath encompassed thee, and My grace shall be with thee. Today the river of mercy is flowing, and the lights of true unity are manifest, brilliant and visible from the horizon of the Will of God, exalted be His glory. Ponder thou upon this word, for until now the servants have not recognized the Day of God, nor known its greatness and station, and are deprived of true unity. Say: This is a Day wherein none is mentioned save God alone. From the people of the Bayan the buzzing of flies hath appeared; like the previous people they desire anew to subjugate the heedless through their vain imaginings. Blessed is the soul whom the chains of idle fancies and vain imaginings have not debarred from the Lord of all names, and who hath witnessed all else but God as non-existent. Such a one is of the people of this Court and is accounted among the people of unity in the sight of God.

Your letters have repeatedly arrived and all have been honored by the glance of favor. You have ever been and continue to be remembered. Convey My greetings to the people of God. Each of the souls mentioned in your letters has attained that from which the fragrance of eternity is wafted. The Word of God revealed for each one shall endure for the duration of the kingdom and the realm above. This is of thy Lord's grace unto thee and unto them. We send greetings to Hibbu'llah; his petition was noticed. Convey My greetings to the Leaf, thy wife, upon her be My glory. They have not been forgotten.

O Jamal! Reflect upon the tribulations of the Wronged One. In the days when from all horizons the standards of discord were visible, and the divines and rulers arose to harm this Wronged One, We stood up alone before all faces and summoned all to the truth, in such wise that no matter prevented Us and no authority held Us back. We bore that which caused the eyes of the Concourse on High to weep and the dwellers of Paradise to lament. Then, when some traces of the effects of the Most Exalted Pen became manifest and resplendent among the servants, the people of the Bayan arose above all others to harm this Wronged One. By the life of God! These differences have prevented the servants from the Most Great Ocean, the Most High Station, and the Supreme Horizon. Glory be to God! They describe a drop while remaining deprived of the ocean. Beseech ye God that He may enable all and grant them sight, that they may not remain deprived of the outpourings of the True Bestower.

Convey My greetings to the friends of God wherever they may be, and say: Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One of the world and strive that perchance the vain imaginings of the past may not be renewed and the people may not be afflicted with the chains of idle fancies. Verily, He strengtheneth the truth and guideth the way. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beautiful. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of thy Lord's utterance be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who hearken unto thee and who love thee for the sake of God, the Lord of this mighty Day.

In the Name of our Lord, the Most High!

O beloved! Days have passed and We have not received from thee the sweet fragrance of faithfulness. Hast thou forgotten Him Who, if thou forgettest Him, will never forget thee, and if thou leavest Him, will never leave thee, and if thou art heedless of Him, will never be heedless of thee? We have heard that sorrow hath encompassed thee in these days, and by thy sorrow We have been saddened, and by what hath befallen thee We have been afflicted with adversity and tribulation. But O beloved! The Herald of eternity now bringeth thee glad tidings from the garment of faithfulness and cometh unto thee with this verdant Tablet. Arise from thy place, then walk upon the earth seven steps, and in each step traverse one of the books: In the first, enter into the sea of search and seek God, thy Lord, in thy inner being and heart. In the second, enter into the sea of love and remember God, thy Lord, in the raptures of thy longing and the dominions of thy taste. In the third, walk in the paths of detachment - that is, detach thyself from thy desires and follow thy Master. In the fourth, enter into the depths of the seas of oneness and the ocean of divine unity. In that station, place thy face upon the dust before the Lord of Lords and sanctify thy soul and spirit from all coming and going, that thy heart may be purified from all causes in the realms of creation. In the fifth, ascend to the heaven of wonderment that thou mayest taste sweet fruits in this holy atmosphere and become bewildered at the power of thy Beloved and the sovereignty of thy Creator, and say as did the King of existence and the Goal: "Lord, increase my astonishment in Thee!" In the sixth, soar with the wings of submission and contentment to the city of the cloud of unknowing that thou mayest enter the wilderness of extinction, to be extinguished in that station from thine existence and abide through thy Creator. In the seventh, thou shalt arrive at the sea of eternal life where extinction shall never overtake thee and thou shalt find thy countenance abiding in the shadow of the Face of God, the Eternal. Then wilt thou inhale the fragrance of glorification from the right hand of the All-Merciful, that thy breast may not be straitened by whatsoever befalleth thee in this mortal life and transient dominion. And when thou hast traversed these journeys in secret without outward display, cast this garment upon thine hidden sight that the eye of thy heart may be opened. For by God, O My beloved, if thou attainest unto this station thou wilt discover wondrous worlds and witness lofty gardens and exalted paradise and transcendent heavens, and wilt know the mysteries of the journey of spirits in an ever-holy atmosphere and an ever-lasting heaven of glory, and thy spirit shall rejoice to such degree that the signs of joy and ecstasy shall appear in all the pillars of the world. Thereafter, sorrow shall never overtake thee nor shall gloom touch thee, and thou shalt abide in the paradise of holiness among those who rejoice. Know thou moreover that thou hast with God a mighty station and an exalted rank. Isolate not thyself from the servants but gather them unto God's Cause and remind them of His days. Put thy trust in God in all matters and He will suffice thee against all things and protect thee from the hosts of Satan and cause thee to enter the eternal paradise, wherein thou shalt be among those who rejoice. Convey My greetings unto those who follow thee in the Cause of thy Lord, then call them to a straight path.

This is what hath been sent down from My Most Holy Pen to My sanctified name whom We have deposited in the land of Ha and Mim - upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of the worlds. In His Name through Whom the ocean surged and the fragrance wafted! The Glory shining and gleaming from the horizon of the heaven of the providence of the Lord of eternity and the Most Great Name be upon thee, O Name of God, the Most Truthful, the Most Ancient, and His remembrance among the nations. I testify that thou didst not hesitate for less than a moment when the Call was raised between earth and heaven - thou didst turn, hear, respond and hasten until thou didst attain unto that which was recorded by the Supreme Pen and mentioned in the Books of God, the Lord of all beings. O My Name! Rejoice in the Supreme Horizon, for unto thee hath turned the face of the Lord of Names and the King of the Kingdom of eternity, Whom neither the hosts of princes nor the opposition of divines could frustrate. We remember at all times the loved ones of the All-Merciful who were not weakened by the power of the mighty nor frightened by the onslaught of the enemies - they arose and said: "God is our Lord and the Lord of the Throne and earth, and the Master of the hereafter and of the former times." O My Name! We remember when there shone upon thee the Sun of Permission from the horizon of the heaven of My Command, and thou didst turn toward My Kingdom with a face wherewith all created things turned, and with such humility that all contingent things became humble before it. I testify that thou didst leave thy home, turning toward the Heaven of eternity and the Supreme Height, and didst traverse land and sea until thou didst present thyself before the Gate and didst hear the call of thy Lord, the Bestower, in that place for the hearing of which ears were created, and hearts and minds for its comprehension. Thou didst behold His horizon and didst attain the presence of Him Who denied the same to Moses when he said "Show me Thyself that I may look upon Thee." Thou art the one who took the Sealed Wine in My Self-Subsisting Name, and the oppression of the people did not prevent thee from the remembrance of this Day. Thou didst take the cup of thy Lord's love, the Creator of all things, and didst drink thereof before the faces of all people. Because of this there came upon thee that which caused the denizens of the realms of might and the dwellers of the cities of the Kingdom to lament. We testify that by reason of thy calamity the Pen of thy Lord, the King of the Kingdom of Names, was stilled, and the rivers in the Most Exalted Paradise became motionless. Through thee God guided His servants to His Straight Path, the Mighty News and His firm, unshakeable Command. God have mercy on the servant who drank the choice wine of thy utterance, heard thy mention, hastened to thy dust, visited thy grave and recited before the tomb that which the Supreme Pen hath spoken in the prison of Akka. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who held fast unto thee in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds and the Master of the Day of Judgment. Glory be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord, my Support and God of the Kingdom and the Realm, and Master of the cities of wisdom and might! I beseech Thee by the finger of Thy power and will whereby the spheres of utterance revolved amidst the Concourse of creation, and by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the manifestations of Thy grandeur in the kingdom of creation, and by this grave which Thou hast made the point of circumambulation for Thy servants and creatures, that Thou forgive me and my father and my mother and whosoever hath hastened to the gate of Thy grandeur and before the throne of Thy manifestation. Verily Thou art He Whom the clamor of the servants and the might of the pharaohs of the lands do not prevent. Thou ordainest what Thou willest through Thy firm, unshakeable command. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Great.

He is God, exalted be His glory - Greatness and Power

Praise be to God Who hath sent down the water of existence from the heaven of His Name, the All-Loving. Verily it is that water of which He hath ordained in His perspicuous Book, and whereby He hath distinguished between truth and falsehood until the Day of Judgment. He hath said, and His word is the truth: "And of water We have made every living thing." Verily it is that water whose praise hath left the people of hearts and minds bewildered. In its primary station it is the knowledge of God - exalted be His glory, abundant be His favors, and mighty be His sovereignty. Whoso hath attained unto it is reckoned among the living before God, the Revealer of verses; and whoso hath been deprived thereof is accounted among the dead in a Book All-Wise. And peace and blessings be upon the First Light through which the world was illumined and the hearts of nations were enlightened - they who cast away vain imaginings and held fast to the Sure Handle - and upon His family and companions through whom the Word of God, that must be obeyed amongst all creation, was exalted, and that which lay hidden in the presence of God's knowledge, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, was made manifest.

Glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all created things! I beseech Thee by Thy chosen ones and trusted ones who have fulfilled Thy Covenant and have arisen to serve Thee in such wise that the ornaments of earth prevented them not from drawing nigh unto Thee, and from placing their trust in Thee, and from turning toward Thy court, that Thou aid Thy servants to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee. O my Lord! Thy grace hath encompassed all, Thy mercy hath preceded all, and Thy bounty hath been perfected. I beseech Thee by Thy Self to send down from the heaven of Thy loving-kindness that which shall preserve them from the promptings of self and passion, and from whatsoever shall harm them in the kingdom of creation. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.

Thereafter, your letter was received. Praise be to God, it was adorned with mention of the Truth and glad tidings of your health. This servant beseecheth and imploreth God - exalted be His glory - to make you appear as a standard raised upon the hills among His servants, and to increase your knowledge, wealth and honor at all times. Verily He is the One Whom nothing can frustrate and no affair can render powerless. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Some time ago this evanescent one wrote and sent a letter to you. God willing, it will have reached you by now. Likewise a letter was sent to H.S. of M.Y., and another letter to Aqa Muhammad-'Ali of S. God willing all have been received and delivered. This evanescent one hopeth that those holy souls who have drunk of the sealed wine in the name of the Self-Subsisting will appear in such wise in the Cause that the radiance of the All-Merciful may be witnessed in their faces. I have beseeched and do beseech the True One - exalted be His glory - at most times that He may enable His loved ones to attain unto this station, that all the world may follow their example, and that the whole earth may be seen as one country and its people as one soul. This is not difficult for God. Peace and mercy and blessings be upon you and upon those who have acknowledged the unity of God - exalted be His glory - who have aided His Faith and who have acted according to that which they were commanded in His perspicuous Book.

The Afnan of the land of China attains the blessed presence of my Lord and Master, His Holiness Nabil-i-Qabli-'Ali, upon him be the everlasting Glory of God.

In His Name, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted

Praise be to God Who has adorned the Book of Existence with His Hidden, Treasured, and Protected Name, which has appeared as His Most Glorious Name in the Kingdom of Creation, and through it revealed the Primal, Invisible, and First Point, and through it detailed Books which the minds of the wise and those in the Kingdom of Names cannot comprehend. At this station, creation began with the Will which appeared and shone forth in creation through the very essence of creation. Exalted, exalted is His glory above being clouded by the understanding of those in earth and heaven! Then exalted, exalted is His holy court above being comprehended by the hearts of those endowed with insight! Can the evanescent one mention that which the very essence of eternity would be ashamed to claim? Can the non-existent soar in this atmosphere when even the known has fallen with clipped wings in this space? If I mention Him as the Known, this is but an attribute for His servants, and if I describe Him as the Self-Subsisting, this is but a mention from His creation. Exalted, exalted is He above being mentioned by any name or described by anything besides Him, above what the tongue mentions in praise and description. My limbs trembled, my pillars shook, and my joints quaked at the mention of this station wherein the reins of pens were not loosened and the points of words were not sharpened. Therefore I conclude and say: There is no God but You, the Hidden, the Inaccessible, the Single One Who cannot be described by what has been or will be said, and You are the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.

My spirit and soul be a sacrifice for You! The fire of longing in this evanescent servant is ablaze and the heat of the thirst of separation is burning. This thirst can only be quenched by the water of reunion and this heat can only be cooled by the Kawthar of meeting. And since outwardly this door has been closed through the oppression of the oppressors, remembrance and utterance have been given the power to compensate for this station. This servant has been deprived even of that. From the day they attained the Most Great Honor and were blessed to reach the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court in the Abode of Peace until now, mention of His Holiness has been in the heart of this lowly, evanescent one. Praise be to God that through divine favors and infinite heavenly grace they preceded in the Most Great and Decisive Cause, for at the first manifestation of effulgences they attained the station of nearness and were blessed with meeting. Verily He ordains for His Afnan what He desires and decrees what He wishes. There is no God but He, the All-Knowing, the Wise, the Powerful, the Mighty.

The Most Glorious Glory be upon Your Holiness and upon those who bow before you for the sake of their Lord.

The Servant of God

Since the two sons of Jenab-i-Za, upon them both be the Glory of God, had previously requested that this servant submit this matter, therefore it was submitted and praise be to God it was accepted in the Most Holy Court. We praise Him in all conditions. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most Powerful

Praise be to Him Who sendeth down the verses and manifesteth the clear proofs, Who speaketh from the trees saying "I am the Powerful, the All-Choosing." He it is Who hath revealed the treasures of inner meanings and utterance for the preservation of man and the elevation of his station in the contingent world. We bear witness that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever described His Own Self as being beyond description by any save Him, and hath made him whom He hath chosen for His Cause the Dawning-Place of His names and attributes. He speaketh of Him in all conditions and giveth glad-tidings unto the people of that which He hath ordained for them in His Most Great Book, wherein hath been inscribed that which was hidden from the nations, save whom His Will and Purpose hath chosen. Verily He is the Powerful over whatsoever He willeth, through His Name, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And peace and blessings be upon Him and upon His family and companions, whom the whisperings of the idolaters did not deter, nor did the might of the oppressors frighten. They arose to promote the Cause with such power as stunned all created things and caused all possibilities to tremble. Through them did rivers flow among the servants, and that which was recorded by the Supreme Pen in the scriptures and tablets was made manifest.

Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One and the servant present hath laid it before Him. We make mention of thee and reveal for thee that from which every seeker will inhale the fragrance of care and kindness. Blessed is the servant who hath cast away vain desire and laid hold on righteousness, and woe unto every one who hath turned away and rejected God, the Lord of all creation and the Lord of the throne on high and of the dust beneath. We have found from thy letter the fragrance of thy love and submission and thy trust in all things in God, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection. We beseech God to aid thee through His Cause and assist thee through His sovereignty and to make thee among those whom neither the commerce of the world, nor that which the nations possess, nor the treasures of princes, nor the hoards of ministers have deterred. They have advanced with supreme steadfastness and have said: "God is our Lord and the Lord of the angels and the Spirit, and the Lord of the mighty throne and the elevated seat."

O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of divine knowledge! We counsel thee to observe the glorious Law which the All-Merciful hath sent down in the Qur'an, and to act according to that which hath been revealed therein. Verily He is the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Moreover We counsel thee and the friends of God with that whose fragrance shall never pass away, and with those virtues through which the traces of them that are nigh unto God have been spread abroad and faces have turned toward God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: My God, my God! Thou seest the people of Thy unity amongst the polytheists among Thy creation and the rejecters among Thy servants. I beseech Thee to preserve them through Thy might and power and sovereignty, and to aid them to act according to that which Thou hast commanded them in Thy Book, and to ordain for them the good of this world and the next. Verily Thou art the Lord of all creation and the Lord of the throne on high and of the dust beneath. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful. My God, my God! Thou knowest and seest how the polytheists have surrounded Thy domains and desire to seize Thy lands. I beseech Thee by Thy light whereby the earth of Thy wisdom and the heaven of Thy utterance were illumined, to protect Thy trusted servants from the oppression of the treacherous ones and the aggressors and the slanderers. Verily Thou art He from Whose knowledge nothing escapeth, and no power in the heavens or on earth can frustrate Thee. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

In the Name of God, the Luminous, the Most Luminous

O Living Letter! Hearken to the call of thy Lord once again in this most holy and most luminous Dominion. Then remember what is now being revealed unto thee from the direction of the Throne above the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary, that thou mayest recall within thyself what We previously mentioned to thee by the tongue of God the first time. Therefore reflect on what remaineth thereof, that thou mayest be among the people of the Hereafter in this primary world. Say: By God! The decree of the Nine hath appeared and the beauty of the Eighty hath shone forth. And verily thou didst not comprehend its beginning, so strive within thyself that thou mayest comprehend its end, that thou mayest be among those possessed of understanding. Therefore stand firm in the Cause of thy Lord, then remind the people of what the Dove remindeth thee at this moment from God's most sublime Kingdom. Take heed that thou fear nothing, nor hesitate in the Cause of thy Lord, nor be among the blind. Come forth from behind the veil of silence, then loose thy tongue in praise of thy Lord, that thou mayest be among those who are guided, and remind people through thy remembrance, that perchance through thee may be brought about in them what God hath chosen for them. Thus do We bestow Our grace upon thee once again, that thou mayest be assured in the Cause of thy Lord and rend asunder the veils from the face of remembrance. Say: By God! The Spirit at this moment moveth before His presence, and the Sun deriveth its light from His resplendent brow, and the Beauty of the Unseen speaketh above His head with a call that draweth unto it the hearts of those possessed of understanding: "This, verily, is He Who appeared in the year sixty, and this is one of His mighty signs." And these are the pearls which We have brought forth from the Shell of Holiness and cast from the Ocean of Grandeur, that ye may find what hath been ordained for you by your Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High. And this, verily, is the Beauty of God which hath dawned from behind the veils with a sovereignty that cannot be concealed nor hidden. And this, verily, is the Sea that surgeth within itself, and these are its waves, if ye be of those possessed of wisdom. And these, verily, are the breezes of God in truth, and this is their wafting in this morning time. Say: The Noah of eternity hath fashioned the Ark of immortality, and it saileth upon the sea of grandeur - glorified be thy Lord, the Most High! And thou, turn thy face towards it and hold fast unto it, that thou mayest be among the companions of the Garden of Refuge. And this, verily, is the Voice of God raised between the heavens and the earth. Therefore put off the shoes of vain desire, that thou mayest be turned towards the Sinai of the Spirit in this most distant expanse. Take heed that nothing prevent thee, even should all who are in the kingdom oppose thee. Then hearken unto the call of thy Lord, that thou mayest be of those who have heard and called out. Thus have We cast upon thee and inspired thee with that which will sever thee unto God, thy Lord, that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and be of those who have believed and are guided. Say: By God! The Beauty of the First hath appeared in the Point of the Last. By God! This is thy Lord, the Most High, and whoso turneth away from Him and denieth His signs hath indeed gone astray and transgressed. Thus do We call out to thee once again, that thou mayest hear the call of thy Lord in the Dominion of eternity, and be stirred within thyself, and arise in the Cause of thy Lord with supreme steadfastness. Say: By God! Whoso hesitateth in His Cause, God will surely return him to the lowest depths. Thus have We informed thee and taught thee, that thou mayest be mindful of the remembrance of thy Lord and be of those who drew nigh and approached.

HE IS THE MOST EXALTED, THE MOST HIGH

O Rida! God hath recorded thy slumber within thee before thou wast created in thy mother's womb, and hath interpreted it for the Concourse on High before the spirit was breathed into the bodies of those brought nigh. Yet it behooveth not to reveal this unto the righteous, much less unto these transgressors who claim to love, but from whom naught appeareth save that which giveth rise to tyranny and hatred, without any proof from God or command from His presence. By the Lord of the realm of 'Ama! I have grieved over a matter which the Pen cannot describe, nor ink enumerate, nor can spirits bear. I have withdrawn myself from these corrupt ones. Thou seest how conflict hath arisen among them after God forbade them this, to such extent that some denounce others as infidels and backbite their loved ones behind their backs, such that the fragrance of love hath been lifted from their midst and hatred hath settled in their breasts, as though they had turned away from God their Creator and followed what their souls desired and their passions craved. Say: Fie upon you, and upon your deeds, and upon what ye possess and what ye deserve! Verily, I love them not, nor do I wish to sit with them or meet with them, unless they repent and return unto God their Lord. By Him Who holdeth my soul in His hand! I desire naught but to flee from them and dwell in a land devoid of their faces, even as I fled before. But since God decreed for me what He decreed, I returned to them and witnessed from them what none of His enemies - much less His loved ones - had ever witnessed. Therefore I remain in the house and show patience in my affair, trusting in God my Lord, until I return unto Him and soar unto the heaven of His holiness. They shall soon fall into disagreement and scatter from this land after my concealment or wrongful departure, and they shall be tested as they were tested before. But ye shall not be dismayed by the terror of that day. Be as immovable mountains, and trust in God your Lord. Turn to Him with the essence of your hearts, that He may bring about for you a matter whereby ye shall be saved and draw nigh unto Him, that ye may be of those whose hearts are at rest through God's light, and who are guided by His signs.

With utmost joy and assurance, soar in the heaven of love. God willing, enter the city of submission, be sustained by the wine of contentment, and drink from the Salsabil of oneness, that thou mayest witness the vastness of divine mercy and become aware of the lights of the Beauty of the All-Glorious, until thou art intoxicated with the wine of reunion and steppest into the wilderness of nearness and meeting, closing thine eyes to all contingent things and opening them to the countenance of the Friend, severing thyself from all else and binding thyself to Him. After ascending beyond the stations of annihilation and reaching the dawning-places of eternity, thou shalt become the cupbearer on the carpet of sanctification and drink the chalice of divine unity. After reaching this homeland, thou shalt present the pure water of inner meanings in the cup of the heart in remembrance of the peerless Divine Beauty, and it shall be taken from the hand of grace and accepted. How lofty is this station if thou attainest unto it! Thou shalt bestow a portion of the Holy Spirit upon the loved ones and the righteous ones.

LXII

Recall thou to mind My sorrows, My cares and anxieties, My woes and trials, the state of My captivity, the tears that I have shed, the bitterness of Mine anguish, and now My imprisonment in this far-off land. God, O Muafa, beareth Me witness. Couldst thou be told what hath befallen the Ancient Beauty, thou wouldst flee into the wilderness, and weep with a great weeping. In thy grief, thou wouldst smite thyself on the head, and cry out as one stung by the sting of the adder. Be thou grateful to God, that We have refused to divulge unto thee the secrets of those unsearchable decrees that have been sent down unto Us from the heaven of the Will of thy Lord, the Most Powerful, the Almighty.

By the righteousness of God! Every morning I arose from My bed, I discovered the hosts of countless afflictions massed behind My door; and every night when I lay down, lo! My heart was torn with agony at what it had suffered from the fiendish cruelty of its foes. With every piece of bread the Ancient Beauty breaketh is coupled the assault of a fresh affliction, and with every drop He drinketh is mixed the bitterness of the most woeful of trials. He is preceded in every step He taketh by an army of unforeseen calamities, while in His rear follow legions of agonizing sorrows.

Such is My plight, wert thou to ponder it in thine heart. Let not, however, thy soul grieve over that which God hath rained down upon Us. Merge thy will in His pleasure, for We have, at no time, desired anything whatsoever except His Will, and have welcomed each one of His irrevocable decrees. Let thine heart be patient, and be thou not dismayed. Follow not in the way of them that are sorely agitated.

Arise, O Muhammad-Ibrahim, upon whom be the Glory of God! He is the Manifest, the Speaker, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

God willing, may you be enkindled with the fire of divine love and illumined by the light of His countenance. The whole world was created for the recognition of this blessed Day, yet when the dawn of God's Day shone forth from the horizon of His Will, all were found to be troubled, shaken, heedless and veiled, save those who cast away vain imaginings and turned to the horizon of certitude.

Consider the past ages and cycles: whenever the Dawning-Places of Revelation and the Daysprings of God's Cause appeared from the horizon of His Will, all arose in opposition and inflicted upon those Manifestations of Divine Unity and Dawning-Places of His Cause that which the Pen is ashamed to recount. Despite witnessing with their outward eyes the transience of the world and its passing away at every moment, they still cling to it while remaining heedless and veiled from that which endures throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven.

You must, with the utmost joy and fragrance, and in the name of the Beloved of the worlds, revive the withered souls of the heedless through the springtime of the All-Merciful's utterance. Whosoever arises today to serve the Cause in the name of Truth will assuredly be accompanied by divine confirmations. All that is witnessed in the world will soon return to nothingness, but that which proceeds from anyone through love of God and His Name, exalted be His glory, will endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Well is it with them that act!

Strive to drink from the Living Waters in the name of the All-Merciful - a drink after which no thirst remains. Thus does the Wronged One make mention of you from His Most Great Prison, that you may be among the steadfast. Today Satan calls out in the name of the All-Merciful, and the deniers among the people of the Bayan are busily engaged in leading people astray with the utmost deceit and guile. God willing, may you attain such a station that you regard all else but God as non-existent and null, and engage in serving His Cause with complete strength and power.

In all conditions, fix your gaze upon the horizon of wisdom, for this mighty Command and firm Decree has been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in God's Books, Scriptures and Psalms. He commands all to that which benefits them. He is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Say: Glory be to Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the heaven of knowledge was raised up and adorned with the suns of utterance, to make me detached from all else but Thee, holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty and clinging to the hem of Thy mercy. O Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and placing my trust in Thee. Send down upon me from the heaven of Thy mercy that which will purify me from the mention of any but Thee, and enable me to arise to serve Thy Cause, and make me of those who desired for themselves only what Thou didst desire for them through Thy Most Exalted Pen and didst command them in Thy Books and Tablets. I beseech Thee, O Lord of eternity, by the Most Great Name, not to deprive me of the outpourings of Thy days and the fragrances of the garment of Thy Cause. Thou art He Whom the affairs of the world cannot frustrate, nor can the clamor of the nations prevent. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the All-Praised.

In the Name of the God of Glory, the Most Glorious

O Dhabih! Verily We have made thee the manifestation of the name "Sacrifice" in the earth. Therefore, O servant, strive within thyself that there may appear from thee that which appeared from Ishmael. Through this special favor and all-embracing mercy We have clothed thee with the garment of grace that thou mayest glory in this supreme gift amongst the people of this world and the next. Know thou that when Ishmael, son of the Friend of the All-Merciful, desired to set foot in the wilderness of love that he might reach the Sinai of divine nearness - which is the station of complete sacrifice - at the moment he intended to proceed to his destination, he observed one adorned in the garments of knowledge and piety. This person drew near to Dhabih and, with utmost cunning, sought to prevent him from the places of divine destiny and to turn him aside from that which he had intended. When that Luminary of the horizons caught the odor of hypocrisy from him, he informed the Friend of the All-Merciful, who said: "O son, pay no heed to him for this is Satan. Beware of his deception and take refuge in the protection of the King of Grandeur. Choose thy dwelling in the secure abode which is the precinct of divine protection." When that lover of the Beauty of the All-Glorious heard the melody of the Friend of the All-Merciful, he drove him away and took refuge in God's protection. Thus was he preserved and safeguarded from the evil of Satan and his deception.

Since thou hast been honored with this new and blessed garment, thou must be vigilant at all times, that if Satan should appear before thee in human form, thou mayest recognize and beware of him. Today the manifestations of the All-Merciful are distinguished from the manifestations of Satan through their love for this spiritual Youth. Soon there shall come upon thee a matter that would prevent thee from the love of thy Lord. At that moment be thou assured that it is Satan and his hosts who would deprive thee of the clouds of the rain of divine mercy and the clouds of holy divine bounty. At such a time take refuge in God as did the first Sacrifice, that thou mayest not slip from the firm and straight path and be joined with the letters of hell. Thus have We distinguished thee among the servants and inspired thee with tidings that are now concealed, that thou mayest become aware of a matter of which none in the world is aware. May the spiritual breezes wafting from the divine and holy paradise of oneness be upon thee and upon those who behold the matchless holy Beauty with their own eyes and vision. And peace be upon thee.

In His Name, the Beloved One!

O emigrant unto God! Hearken unto the voice of this Bird of Immortality, who hath been afflicted beneath the talons of the wicked, and upon whom hath descended in the path of the Beloved that which hath descended upon no one else, who hath at every moment drunk from the cup of destiny and quaffed from the chalice of tribulation. Yet praise be to God that we have bowed our heads in acceptance of the Friend's good-pleasure and set our hearts upon His decree. We do not complain of the oppression of enemies nor do we protest the tyranny of the wicked. We eagerly seek the arrows of our Beloved's decree and yearn for the poison of tribulation in His path. We have attached our hearts to Him and become detached from all else. I swear by His beauty that all else hath been non-existent and all save Him shall cease to be.

And thou, O traveling servant and emigrant, hearken unto My call with the ear of thy soul. Be steadfast in the path of the All-Merciful in such wise that should all who are in the heavens and earth arise to turn thee away, thou wouldst not slip from the path of His love nor remain distant from the way of His good-pleasure. Purify thy heart from the world and all that is therein, and with holy detachment turn thy soul toward the All-Merciful. At all times be occupied with His remembrance and be severed from all else, for all else neither nourishes nor satisfies. All things are captive in the grasp of His power and all the wealthy are poor at the threshold of His riches. Strive that thou mayest drink from the pure crystal waters of His grace and enter beneath the shade of His all-encompassing mercy. At all times soar in the heaven of inner meanings and contemplate the wonders of His divine craftsmanship, that thou mayest not remain heedless of the wonders of His power nor be veiled from beholding the mysteries of His handiwork.

Adorn thy tongue with His remembrance and give peace to thy heart through His love. God willing, thou shouldst manifest thyself in such wise that the signs of God become evident and apparent in thy deeds, words and actions amongst His servants. For in this day most people remain veiled from God's Cause and are occupied with their own comfort. How many souls there are who claim attachment to the Truth yet remain far heedless of it, for association is not perfected through words alone and no claim is validated without proof. Thus those who claim attachment to the Truth must surely manifest signs of sanctity in their deeds and the radiance of joy must be witnessed in their countenances.

In any case, your honor must gather the loved ones of God upon the universal Word and ever remind them of the wondrous verses of His remembrance. Whosoever arises today to teach God's Cause shall be confirmed by the Holy Spirit and aided by the hidden divine power. Convey wondrous greetings to all the friends of God who dwell in that land. God willing, we hope that thou shalt not remain deprived of the cloud of the All-Merciful's mercy nor be left hopeless of the rain-clouds of divine bounty, for His grace hath ever been and shall ever remain with His loved ones. And peace be upon him who followeth the Truth.

He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! These are the verses of God which have been sent down in remembrance of one of His handmaidens who ascended to the Most Glorious Companion and entered the Garden of Paradise, and whom the mercy of her Lord encompassed. Thus was the matter decreed from the presence of the Mighty, the Powerful. God distinguished her with this station because she bore a servant who loved God and the Manifestation of His Self, and who migrated with Him and was afflicted with sorrows in the path of his Beloved until he entered with Him into a remote prison, and aided his Lord to the extent of his ability, and hesitated not in the Cause for less than a moment. And when the Sun of Eternity dawned upon him from the horizon of Glory, he fell prostrate before a Beauty holy and resplendent. Thus does God assist whomsoever He willeth of His servants and purify the hearts of those who fear God and are possessed of insight.

O handmaiden of God! Glory thou over the Maidens of Paradise, for thy mention hath flowed from the Finger of Eternity - and this is a mighty favor. Blessed art thou, O handmaiden of God, for the breathings of the All-Merciful seized thee from every direction and turned thee toward the right hand of Paradise, an exalted and impregnable station. Therefore eat of whatsoever fruits of Paradise thou desirest, for they have been ordained for thee from the presence of One mighty and wise. And find solace with the maidens of Paradise in chambers of luminous glory. Thus hath God changed thy sorrow to joy and the Hand of Grace hath clothed thee in a beautiful robe of glory. Therefore doth the Tongue of God magnify thee from this Tongue which hath not opened concerning what hath befallen it from the hosts of the wicked and rebellious.

O handmaiden of God! Should the Manifestations of Paradise ask thee concerning the Beauty of the All-Merciful, say: By God! There hath befallen Him that which hath exhausted the tongues of all worlds from mentioning it. By God! The people of wickedness have encompassed Him with swords of hatred, and He remaineth among them alone and solitary. His grief and tribulation have reached such a state that His food is from a piece of His liver and His drink is from His blood, and He writhes upon the dust at every moment like unto Solomon. And whenever He crieth out for help, He is aided by spears, then swords, then sharp daggers. By God! The eye of creation hath not witnessed one oppressed like unto Him, nor any imprisoned equal to Him, nor any wounded similar to Him, nor any sorrowful comparable to Him. Say: By God! He now walketh among the servants without liver or heart or entrails - and God is witness to this.

O Beauty of Eternity! By God! Through what hath flowed from Thy Pen, the hearts of the people of Paradise are set ablaze - how then could they bear to hear what hath befallen Thee from those who have disbelieved in God and His signs from ancient times? Therefore have the tongues of all created things spoken, saying: The curse of God be upon the first oppressor who wronged the Primal Point in His latter Manifestation in His Most Glorious Name, and upon those who fought against Him and disputed His signs and denied His sovereignty and were among the opposers in the Tablets of glorious and wondrous might. Blessed is he who attained His presence and acknowledged His sovereignty and recognized His court and turned to His face and heard from His lips the melodies of God and was among those drawn nigh in the Tablets of glorious and bountiful might. And the Glory which hath shone forth from the horizon of grandeur be upon thee, O handmaiden of God, and upon the maidens who serve thee in the highest Paradise at all times.

Jinab-i-Amin, upon him be the Glory of God, arrived and brought a register containing the names of the people of God and His loved ones from the servant, upon him be the Glory of God.

And they desired that on behalf of the aforementioned souls they might repeatedly attain the presence and be honored with visitation. Praise be to God that the people of God who dwell in the cities and lands of God, exalted be His glory, have been blessed with the effulgences of the Sun of Providence and adorned with the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed are they and joy be unto them. And they have made Jinab-i-'Ali and Muhammad-Baqir partners in their deeds of visitation and feasting and attention and presence, and now they have again sought permission to attain the presence by proxy and to hold several feasts with tea and other things on behalf of the aforementioned loved ones. This has been adorned with the ornament of acceptance and it was commanded that they should engage in feasting and Jinab-i-Amin in service. The people of God must give thanks, for in days when the standards of discord were raised in all regions and the fire of hatred was ablaze in the breasts of most people, and the Truth was wronged and imprisoned in the Most Great Prison, the hand of power was manifest and the blessing of the presence was witnessed, and the aforementioned one arose to serve and feast on behalf of the loved ones. These are deeds that have had and will have no equal. O Amin! Give him the glad tidings of the acceptance of what he desired. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Wise. The Glory be upon you and upon them and upon those who have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Again it is mentioned that they have sought permission for themselves and the two aforementioned souls, upon them be the Glory of God. This matter has been adorned with the ornament of acceptance and the sun of permission has risen and shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of God's will. However, they must in all circumstances be mindful of wisdom, that nothing contrary to its requirements may occur. If it accords, then attendance is beloved, and if not, the reward of His presence is written for them. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty. O Amin! Give the glad tidings to the servant that God hath forgiven his father and mother and hath mentioned them in such wise that the fragrances of grace and mercy shall endure through the eternity of His most beautiful names. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and the Power

Praise befits and is worthy of the intended Lord Who, through His complete power and all-encompassing grace, created servants who arose with supreme steadfastness in His Cause. What came from the peoples did not prevent them from the Ancient King, and neither what emerged or emerges from their mouths, nor what appears from their pens, nor what is born of their thoughts held them back from helping His Cause. Praise be unto Him, then thanks be unto Him, and we beseech Him to assist His Afnan in what He loves and is pleased with.

It was presented and by command was sent to your presence that you may consider it and act as befits, and whatever you deem good and proper, cling to it without delay. In all matters, act with perfect joy and fragrance and with dignity and composure. They said: "Whosoever puts his trust in God, He is sufficient unto him." Be not grieved by certain matters. At this time while walking They said to write to the Afnan Siyyid Mu?sin, upon him be God's care and peace, to complete what was said in the presence, and if possible after being present in this land to set forth. We beseech God to grant him success and assist him and aid him through His might and power and sovereignty. Verily He has power over all things.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and the Power

Praise befitteth that Intended One Who illumined the world with the lights of the Sun of Truth and ordained for the hearts of the Prophets and chosen ones the spring of the Water of Life. He is the One Peerless Lord Whose sovereignty neither increased nor diminished through the acceptance or rejection of the peoples of the world. Exalted, exalted be His binding Command and His Most Great Mystery. And blessings and peace be upon Him Whom He sent with the truth and made the Manifestation of His most beautiful names and most exalted attributes among creation, and upon His family and companions through whom the earth brought forth its fruits and the heaven sent down its rain.

Thereafter, the letter of that honored brother arrived. Praise be to God, it indicated your well-being and the favorable resolution of affairs, which brought joy. When it was presented before the Master, He said: "O Lutfu'llah, welcome to thee! The flourishing of work and personal health brings joy. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid thee in that which pleaseth Him and to grant thee success in His remembrance and praise. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Be thou in all conditions reliant upon Him, hopeful of the wonders of His grace, speaking His praise, and gazing toward the horizon of His mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth."

Thou art mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. The friends of that land have not been and will not be forgotten. God willing, may all the friends of God be adorned with the ornament of goodly deeds and spiritual qualities. In all circumstances be mindful of wisdom. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings.

Praise be to God, thou art successful in remembering the true Friend. In truth, grace hath been manifested in such wise that this servant is powerless to mention it. God the All-Informed is witness and testifier that in the nights and days I have beseeched and do beseech from God, exalted be His glory, glory and blessing and exaltation and bounty for you and the other gentlemen. How much joy was obtained from news of the good health of the spiritual friend Aqa Mirza 'Ali-Akbar. In truth, he is a remembrance and remnant of the family of the late and forgiven one whose virtues the pen is powerless to recount, and he is ever remembered in the presence of the Face. This servant conveys greetings to him. Repeatedly mention was heard from the blessed tongue of his healing. The servant praises God for this. Verily He is the Hearing, the Answering.

As to your mention of the honored and revered brother Aqa Muhammad-Rida, upon him be the peace of God, God is witness and testifier that this servant in all conditions beseeches and hopes for the wonders of His generosity and grace, that He may preserve him and his kin beneath the shadow of His care and compassion. And further I beseech from God that He may ordain a meeting. This matter has been long delayed. God willing, may the Pen of Destiny bring it near. He is powerful and mighty over all things.

We have no news of the honored master Sabri Efendi, upon him be the Glory of God. God willing, may he be sustained with the blessing of health and well-being. The poor one possesses naught save prayer. Verily He doeth whatsoever He willeth.

In the Name of Him Who is the Manifest, the Speaking, the Trustworthy

All praise, sanctified from words, befitteth the Lord of the Day of Judgment, Who hath illumined and adorned the world and its peoples with the lights of the Luminary of Manifestation, the One Who conversed on Sinai. In all conditions, the banner "Verily, I am God" was raised from the right side, and the standard "He doeth whatsoever He willeth" was manifested and unfurled from the other direction. Exalted be His power, glorified His might, and magnificent His signs. There is no purpose save Him.

O Pen! Hearken unto that which the Lord of the worlds and Master of eternity hath spoken, then make mention of God's chosen ones, His sincere servants, His trustees and bearers of His mysteries. Let nothing among all things, nor any name among all names, hold thee back. Stand before the faces of the servants and say:

Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me to Thy most exalted horizon and acquainted me with Thy Cause, whereby the limbs of those in the realm of creation have trembled. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty to transform the tyranny of Thy servants into justice, their turning away into turning toward the court of Thy glory, and their denial into acknowledgment of that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. O Lord! Thou art the Generous, possessed of great bounty. Make known unto them that which behooveth them in Thy days, and their return unto the seat of Thy throne, and their repentance at the door of Thy forgiveness. Thou art the Almighty through Whose command the Herald hath called out from every direction: "The dominion, the kingdom, the grandeur and the power belong unto God, the One, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful."

O Lord! Thou beholdest the oppressor seated upon the throne of tyranny, shedding the blood of Thy loved ones with such injustice that the Manifestations of justice have lamented. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Glory be unto Thee, O my Purpose! Glory be unto Thee, O my Beloved! Thou seest me clinging to the cord of Thy grace and holding fast to the hem of the robe of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty that hath encompassed all created things, and by Thy command that hath subdued all contingent beings, to ordain for the people of T and F that which will draw them nigh unto the pavilion of Thy glory and the canopies of Thy grandeur. Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Strong, the Triumphant, the Wise.

O Lord! Illumine their hearts with the lights of Thy knowledge, then send down upon them from the clouds of Thy mercy the rains of Thy generosity and bounty. Thou art He to Whose power and sovereignty all names have testified, and to Whose might and grandeur all things have borne witness. By Thy glory! This servant desireth naught save the manifestation of Thy gifts and favors unto Thy servants and creatures. O Lord! I have heard the utterances of the idolaters in the land of Y, and have seen what hath befallen the sincere ones through that which the hands of the wicked have wrought. Where, O my God, is Thy power, Thy might, Thy justice and Thy sovereignty? How many homes, O my God, wherein the sighs of weeping have been raised, and how many places wherein the cries of the trustees and chosen ones have appeared! I beseech Thee, O King of Kings, by the mysteries of Thy kingdom and the lights of the Orb of Thy justice, to seize the oppressors with the scourges of Thy wrath and the transgressors with the fire of Thy anger. Thou art the Almighty, to Whose power the layers of the earth and its pebbles have testified, and to Whose might the heavens and all that was created therein have borne witness. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.

The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of proof be upon thee, O Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali, and upon My loved ones and friends who have drunk the choice wine sealed with My Name, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.

In My Name, which speaketh before the faces of all people! Praise be unto the Lord of all possibilities, sanctified from all mention and description, Who, through His complete power and conquering might, hath transformed the prison of 'Akka into the Most Exalted Paradise. Blessed is he who hath beheld, and blessed is he who hath attained to hear the warbling of the birds of wisdom and utterance in the garden of true knowledge. Say: O people of God! Know ye the worth of this Day. Today the Lord of Destiny, from the Most Great Scene, calleth unto all and inviteth them to the highest horizon. Blessed is the soul that hath not been deprived of the outpourings of the All-Bountiful in these days.

O thou who gazeth toward My horizon! Some time ago a glorious Tablet was revealed in thy mention, wherein was recorded in detail thine encounter with the Dayspring of the ignorance of the world. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee! We testify that thou didst seek out the Kaaba of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, and didst traverse land and sea until thou didst attain the spot which God hath made the circling-place of the Concourse on High, the Most Glorious Paradise, and the Most Exalted Garden, and didst hear the call of God, the Lord of existence and the Educator of the seen and unseen.

We beseech God to illumine the friends of those regions with the lights of the Sun of true unity. Until now the former people have been numbered among the polytheists in the arena of the people of unity. And in this Most Great Revelation, despite the signs that have encompassed the world and a power and might the like of which hath never been witnessed, we observe that some who count themselves among the learned and insightful, and whose mention hath even flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, are still somewhat afflicted with vain imaginings. Say: My God, my God! Sanctify Thy loved ones from idle fancies and vain imaginings, and illumine them with the lights of the Day-Star of Thy Revelation. Then send down upon them from the clouds of Thy grace that which will draw them nigh unto Thee, and assist them to stand firm in the Greater Steadfastness, that the doubts of the people and the idle fancies of the nations and the vain imaginings of those who have denied Thy proof and Thy testimony and have rejected Thy bounty may not cause them to slip. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

While We were walking in the house and speaking of the mysteries of the Revelation, the Greater Branch entered with what thou hadst sent to him and to the Name of Bounty, and read them before Our face. We have answered thee with this clear Tablet. Convey My greetings to all the loved ones. Say: Today it behooveth all to protect the servants, according to their capacity, from former superstitions. Today the ocean of grace is surging and the sun of justice is shining and manifest. Blessed is the soul that hath preserved itself through the Name of Truth and hath arisen to aid the Cause. Such a one is of the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark. Say: O people of God! This is the Day of assistance, and assistance hath been and shall be through utterance. We beseech God to aid all and illumine them with the lights of the Day-Star of Revelation. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. There is no God but Him, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My kingdom be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who love thee and hearken to thy word in this irrevocable and mighty Cause.

I request that you convey on behalf of this evanescent one profound, exalted greetings to them and all the friends of that land. God the All-Knowing bears witness that this evanescent one is occupied with mentioning the friends most of the time. God willing, may we all be assisted to serve the Cause of God in a manner befitting this wondrous Day. Glory be upon you and upon God's friends who shall have no fear nor shall they grieve, and praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. The Servant, on 4 Rajab 1298. It is submitted that after completing this letter, this evanescent servant attained the elevated handwriting of him who was named at the Most Great Scene as 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of Power. Praise be to God, it brought joy and gladness. Likewise two renowned handwritings from Aqa Mirza Asadu'llah, upon him be the glory of God, arrived on this same day. This evanescent servant begs God, exalted be His glory, to be enabled to present and send the reply soon. Similarly the handwriting of Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be the glory of God, arrived. Three sacred Tablets have thus far been sent in his name and one more remains. Due to wisdom they were not all sent at once, but in those same days when his handwriting arrived all Tablets were revealed and present. Again my greetings are extended to each of the gentlemen and beloved ones, entrusted to your grace. Then greetings, praise and glory be upon you and upon them.

Consider the former generations. Witness how every time the Day Star of Divine bounty hath shed the light of His Revelation upon the world, the people of His Day have arisen against Him, and repudiated His truth. They who were regarded as the leaders of men have invariably striven to hinder their followers from turning unto Him Who is the Ocean of God's limitless bounty.

Behold how the people, as a result of the verdict pronounced by the divines of His age, have cast Abraham, the Friend of God, into fire; how Moses, He Who held converse with the Almighty, was denounced as liar and slanderer. Reflect how Jesus, the Spirit of God, was, notwithstanding His extreme meekness and perfect tender-heartedness, treated by His enemies. So fierce was the opposition which He, the Essence of Being and Lord of the visible and invisible, had to face, that He had nowhere to lay His head. He wandered continually from place to place, deprived of a permanent abode. Ponder that which befell Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets, may the life of all else be a sacrifice unto Him.

How severe the afflictions which the leaders of the Jewish people and of the idol-worshipers caused to rain upon Him, Who is the sovereign Lord of all, in consequence of His proclamation of the unity of God and of the truth of His Message! By the righteousness of My Cause! My Pen groaneth, and all created things weep with a great weeping, as a result of the woes He suffered at the hands of them that have broken the Covenant of God, violated His Testament, rejected His proofs, and disputed His signs. Thus recount We unto thee the tale of that which happened in days past, haply thou mayest comprehend.

Thou hast known how grievously the Prophets of God, His Messengers and Chosen Ones, have been afflicted. Meditate a while on the motive and reason which have been responsible for such a persecution. At no time, in no Dispensation, have the Prophets of

God escaped the blasphemy of their enemies, the cruelty of their oppressors, the denunciation of the learned of their age, who appeared in the guise of uprightness and piety. Day and night they passed through such agonies as none can ever measure, except the knowledge of the one true God, exalted be His glory.

Consider this wronged One. Though the clearest proofs attest the truth of His Cause; though the prophecies He, in an unmistakable language, hath made have been fulfilled; though, in spite of His not being accounted among the learned, His being unschooled and inexperienced in the disputations current among the divines, He hath rained upon men the showers of His manifold and divinely-inspired knowledge; yet, behold how this generation hath rejected His authority, and rebelled against Him! He hath, during the greater part of His life, been sore-tried in the clutches of His enemies. His sufferings have now reached their culmination in this afflictive Prison, into which His oppressors have so unjustly thrown Him. God grant that, with a penetrating vision and radiant heart, thou mayest observe the things that have come to pass and are now happening, and, pondering them in thine heart, mayest recognize that which most men have, in this Day, failed to perceive. Please God, He may enable thee to inhale the sweet fragrance of His Day, to partake of the limitless effusions of His grace, to quaff they fill, through His gracious favor, from the most great Ocean that surgeth in this Day in the name of the Ancient King, and to remain firm and immovable as the mountain in His Cause.

Say: Glory be to Thee Who hast caused all the holy Ones to confess their helplessness before the manifold revelations of Thy might, and every Prophet to acknowledge His nothingness at the effulgence of Thine abiding glory. I beseech Thee, by Thy name that hath unlocked the gates of Heaven and filled with ecstasy the Concourse on high, to enable me to serve Thee, in this Day, and to strengthen me to observe that which Thou didst prescribe in Thy Book. Thou knowest, O my Lord, what is in me; but I know not what is in Thee. Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

In the Name of God, the Most Mighty, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted!

Glorified is He Who sends down the verses in truth for people who understand. Verily, there is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command. All were created by His command and all are prostrating before Him. Among them are those who recognize and prostrate, and among them are those who prostrate but do not recognize. Thus are all worshippers. And he who worships but does not recognize - his deeds are not accepted and return unto himself, if you but knew. And he who recognizes his Lord - his deeds have ascended unto God. Thus has the matter been ordained, but people do not understand.

Say: O people! Recognize God, then observe what He has ordained in the Tablets of His laws and ordinances, and be not of those who differ. Say: Deeds must follow recognition - thus have you been commanded in all the Tablets and in this blessed, mighty and praiseworthy Tablet. Say: All remembrances have ended in this Most Great Remembrance, and all paths have ended in this Straight Path. Say: Verily, He was Ali in a mighty and glorious Book, then Muhammad in the Furqan, if you be of those who know, then Husayn in a luminous and mighty Book.

Say: O people! Differ not in the Cause of God. Behold His Messengers in this Messenger, and His verses in these holy, mighty and wondrous verses. Beware lest you make distinctions between them. Bear witness to them all in this Most Great and Mighty Announcement. Say: This is a station beyond your allusions, O heedless ones! Thus was it revealed in the Bayan, if you be of those who testify.

O servant! Arise by God's leave and command. Cast names behind you, idols to your left, and vain imaginings beneath your feet. Take in My name the cup of My praise filled with the wine of My remembrance and My glory. Drink from it again and again, and pay no heed to the clamor of the idolaters. Whenever their outcry and screaming rises, drink again from the cup, again and yet again, to spite them. Thus have you been commanded by One All-Knowing, All-Wise. Walk in My footsteps and My way, and be not of the heedless ones.

In the days when the Luminary of the horizons arose with God's command in Iraq, the people of hypocrisy opposed Him and sought to shed His blood, having followed the evil ones. We did not withhold the Cause because of their opposition to the remembrance of God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds. The more they increased in opposition, the more We increased in manifestation, to spite them. Thus was the matter decreed, if you be of those who hear.

Shatter the idols of vain imaginings by the command of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Then cut yourself off from every sinful polytheist. Then the people gathered around His love and His Cause - and this is indeed a great bounty. Thus have We caused the Kawthar of utterance to flow from the finger of your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, that you might drink and be of those who are thankful to God Who created you by His command and made you among His successful servants.

And the Spirit be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who turn toward the holy court with a pure and luminous heart. The Most Glorious! Therefore glorify God before the face of your father and mother and family, and by His glorification the people of Paradise and the angels of the highest heaven glorify Him.

In the Name of God, the Most Wondrous, the Most Glorious! God testifies that there is none other God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all are prostrate before Him. He gives life and causes death, then resurrects as He wishes through His grace. Verily, there is none other God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all are worshippers before Him.

O Pen of Command! Make mention of the servant who is named Ali, that he may stand firm on the Path and purify himself from those who have denied God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. O Ali! Strip thyself from all veils and allusions, and cast behind thee all that they who joined partners with God have clung to, and take fast hold of the cord of God, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Beloved.

Say: O people! Fear God and spread not corruption in God's earth after God hath come from the Orient of Grandeur with manifest sovereignty. Say: This indeed is the Essence of Oneness in the Most Exalted Assembly, and the Reality of Divine Unity in the Kingdom of Eternity, and the Mystery of Divinity in the Kingdom of Names, and the Ancient Beauty in this radiant and noble Temple. He is indeed the One through Whom every Prophet was raised up, every Messenger was sent forth, and every irrevocable decree was revealed.

Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear God and war not against Him through Whom your worth was exalted, your name was made manifest, and your traces became renowned among the worlds. O Ali! Express what We have shown thee in thy soul's journey unto God, then ascend to the atmosphere of nearness and holiness that thou mayest witness what no mystic hath witnessed. Guard thyself lest thou be stirred by the winds of hypocrisy which blow from the direction of the wicked ones who warred against God and turned away from His beauty after He appeared with all verses, scriptures and perspicuous books.

Stand firm in the Cause, then convey unto the people thy Lord's command, and be not of the patient ones. Know thou that those who were given the Bayan seek to invalidate the Truth using the same arguments used by the transgressors of the Qur'an when the Sovereign of the Cause came to them with God's kingdom - the True, the Certain One. They wrote tablets rejecting God just as the people of the Qur'an wrote rejecting Ali before Nabil. We have ordained for whoever is able that he write in support of this Cause that which casts the spirit into his breast, and this is from God's grace upon His steadfast servants.

Arise in the Cause, then drink the cup of life from the hands of the All-Merciful, then detach thyself from every sinful deceiver. Turn not to the right or the left; set thy face toward thy Lord, the Most High, the Great. Hearken unto what is revealed unto thee from the right side of the Throne, the place whose very air proclaims: "This indeed is the Beloved in the heart of Glory," and whose heaven calls out: "This indeed is the One mentioned in the scrolls of mighty glory," and from Whose dust particles is heard: "There is none other God but I, the Powerful over what I wish, and I am the Mighty, the Exalted, the Wise."

Thus do We cast upon thee that thou mayest stand firm in the Cause and convey unto the people what thou art commanded by God, the Most High, the Powerful, the All-Knowing. And glory be upon thee if thou standest firm in the Cause and detachest thyself from the worlds, and upon those who hear thy words concerning God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers of old.

Faran. O Mir 'Ali Aqa Beg, upon him be the Glory of God. He is the Hearing, the Answering.

God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath come with the truth is verily the Dawning-Place of the signs of God, the Lord of all worlds. Through Him was opened the door of bounty to the world and the ocean of knowledge surged among the peoples. But for Him, the verses would not have been sent down nor would the clear proofs have appeared. To this the Mother Book beareth witness in the final return.

O 'Ali! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He maketh mention of thee from the precincts of the prison in such wise as to draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of all religions. Blessed is the one whose strength is not weakened by the veils of the world and whose steadfastness is not shaken by the oppression of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of lords. Thy letter which thou didst send to the Name of Generosity, upon him be My glory, hath arrived. We have answered thee with this Tablet from whose horizon the lights have shone forth. We bear witness that thou hast turned to God and attained His presence and heard what the Son of 'Imran heard on the Mount of Knowledge. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath clung to the cord of God, the Revealer of verses.

We have desired to make mention of My loved ones there who heard the Call when it was raised in truth and answered their Lord, the Lord of all religions. O friends of God in Faran! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He maketh mention of you and biddeth you show forth such steadfastness that neither the veils of names nor the idols of fancy and vain imaginings shall hold you back. Cast away what the people possess, turning with your hearts unto God, the Lord of the final return. Say: Beware lest the might of the world and the clamor of the peoples prevent you. Take ye hold of the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him and the strength that cometh from His presence. He will aid you with the hosts of the seen and the unseen. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Chosen One.

We make mention at this time of Mir Husayn with a mention whereby the hearts of the people of understanding are attracted. O Husayn! The Wronged One in prison maketh mention of thee even as He hath mentioned My loved ones at eventide and at dawn. And We make mention of 'Ali-Akbar and give him the glad-tidings of that which hath been sent down for him from the heaven of the bounty of his Lord, the Lord of all men. O 'Ali-Akbar! Know thou that the Call hath been raised at the Most Great Scene in the prison of 'Akka. Blessed is he who hath heard and woe unto every heedless doubter. And We make mention of him who was named Rajab-'Ali who hath turned unto God, the Lord of mankind. Give thanks unto God thy Lord and praise Him for having moved the Most Exalted Pen to make mention of thee in days wherein all things have spoken saying: "The Promised One hath come! The command belongeth unto God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Forgiving!"

At this time We make mention of My trusted ones and My chosen ones who have held fast unto the Sure Handle in the days of their Lord, the Lord of all men, and have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur had spoken before all things. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Help in Peril.

O 'Ali! We have illumined the world with the lights of the Sun of My utterance and have perfumed it with the fragrances of My revelation and adorned it with My manifestation which hath encompassed all who are in earth and heaven. Blessed is he who hath attained and woe unto every heedless doubter. Say: O people of the Bayan! The oceans of the world have surged through My remembrance and the trees have spoken even as the Tree of the Mount hath spoken. To this He beareth witness in Whose grasp is the reins of all mysteries. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who love thee for the sake of God, the Lord of lords.

O Mirza 'Abdu'llah, upon him be the Glory of God, Judge

He is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise

God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and He Who speaketh with truth is indeed the One concealed in His Books, mentioned by His tongue, and recorded by His Most Exalted Pen, through Whose movement the Kingdom of Names was manifested. Blessed is he who hath hearkened and turned unto Him, and woe betide him who hath denied His supreme bounty. They who have turned to God in His days are among those who are nigh unto Him in a perspicuous Book. All things give them glad tidings and the Concourse on High pray for them, and behind them is He Who speaketh the truth from this noble station.

O 'Abdu'llah! The servant who is present hath presented thy letter and read it before the Wronged One, Who is imprisoned in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. We have heard that wherewith thou didst commune with God and We answer thee with that which diffuseth the fragrance of eternity through the duration of My most excellent Names. Be thou grateful and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the worlds!" We have found from thy words the fragrance of My love. We have turned toward thee from this station and revealed unto thee this wondrous Tablet. We give thee the glad tidings of God's favor and His mercy, and counsel thee with that whereby the Cause of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, may be exalted. Arise with wisdom and utterance and say: "O people of the world! By God, the All-Merciful hath come, and on His right hand is the river of life, and on His left the stream of knowledge and understanding. Fear ye God and be not of the heedless. He hath come through Whose name the standard of guidance hath been raised amidst all creation and through Whose remembrance the banner of 'There is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed' hath been hoisted. Do ye deny Him through Whom the eye of faith hath been solaced? Fear ye God and follow not every heedless doubter."

O 'Abdu'llah! Counsel those around thee with what God hath sent down and convey to them the Cause of thy Lord, the Kind, the Generous. Say: Beware lest the allusions of the people prevent you from Him Who hath come with manifest sovereignty. O people of the earth! There is no escape today for anyone except for him who hath cast away vain imaginings and turned toward the Countenance with an illumined heart. Grieve thou not over anything. Rather give thanks unto God for having aided thee and enabled thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of Revelation and for having sent down for thee that which bringeth tranquility to the hearts of them that are endued with understanding. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord's loving-kindness and stand firm with supreme steadfastness in service to His wondrous Cause. He will verily exalt thee through the truth and ordain for thee what He hath ordained for His chosen ones. He is in truth the Single, the One, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

We make mention of him whom thou didst mention in thy letter, who is named Abu'l-Qasim, and give him the glad tidings of this mighty remembrance. We beseech God to strengthen him in all conditions to make mention of Him and praise Him. He is the Protector of them that turn unto Him. And We make mention of his brother Muhammad-Quli with a remembrance through which they that are nigh unto God shall perceive the fragrance of their Lord's loving-kindness, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. And We make mention of those with him who have turned toward the Supreme Horizon and have drunk the choice wine of the Most Glorious through His name, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thus hath the ocean of My loving-kindness surged and the fragrance of My mercy, which hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth, been wafted. Hold fast in all conditions unto the cord of wisdom, lest the clamor of the ignorant be raised. The glory that hath dawned and shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord's loving-kindness be upon thee and upon them that have cast away vain imaginings and turned toward the Dayspring of certitude. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

O Friend in Ta! He is the All-Possessing, the Most High, the Mighty, the Beloved! Glorified be He Who hath sent down the verses in truth unto people who believe. He it is Who hath sent down the Book and sent forth the Messengers. Fear ye God and be guided by His Messengers. Among them was Adam, whom God forgave after he transgressed what was forbidden him, and made him a Prophet and sent him with truth to give glad tidings to those who were certain of the presence of God. And after him He sent Noah with guidance, who said: "O people! Fear ye God and follow His Messengers if ye have believed in God. Then remember God and be ye among those who remember God." When they turned away from him, God drowned them in the depths of fire in the waves of heedlessness in the valley of sulfur, and therein they perished. And among them was Moses, whom God assisted with the rod of His Command and honored with nine verses from the Bayan. He said: "O people! These are the signs of God which ye behold. Fear ye God and be guided by His guidance." None believed in him save those whom God made as lights upon the earth, who were illumined by the light of divine attraction. When they denied and turned away and came not unto the Manifestation of the Spirit, God afflicted them in the wilderness of rejection and made them among those who turned away from the good-pleasure of God and were? from the canopy of Beauty. And among them was Jesus, whom God assisted with the Holy Spirit and sent with truth. He said: "Fear ye God, O people of the earth, and be not of those who are not guided by the light of God." Thus did God send Messengers aforetime and will send them hereafter, but they believed not in them nor will they believe save those who walk in the good-pleasure of God. Thus do We recount unto thee from the stories of the Command that thou mayest be informed of those who denied and recognize the matter of those who showed pride before God and turned away from Him, and that thou mayest not be heedless of the Command but be among those who circle round Beauty, turning not to aught of the world, and when touched by hardship give thanks to God and place their trust in Him. And when they hear the verses of God they fall down in prostration and are struck unconscious by the melodies of Paradise. Say: O people! This is a servant of God who draweth you nigh unto God and calleth you to a station unto which all spirits ascend. He commandeth you naught save to return unto God and the Manifestations of His Cause. Thus do We cast upon thee from the word of piety that perchance ye may be nourished by the fruits of the spirit. Then command the people to justice and piety and forbid them from transgression and indecency. Fear thou no one and trust in God, and be not of those who turned away from the Face. Say: These days shall pass away and depart from you, and God will not accept from you what ye imagined regarding His loved ones, and all this hath been written in a Tablet whereof ye are heedless, save those who turned in repentance - these are the companions of guidance for whom the angels seek forgiveness. These are they whom the rejection of the rejecter deterreth not, nor the denial of the denier, and they turn toward the canopy of nearness and detachment. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon the sincere servants.

In Sabzivar, there hath been revealed for Muhammad-Qabli-Rida from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He is the Ever-Abiding, the Most Glorious. Glorified be He Who sendeth down the verses in truth and will continue to send them down as He pleaseth by His command, and verily He hath power over all things. Before Him bow down in adoration all who are in the heavens and on earth, though He is in truth independent of the worship of all creation. All that He commandeth men is from His grace unto them, that He may bring them to the holy habitation, the station which hath been raised in truth above Paradise itself. The worship of all who are in the heavens and on earth profiteth Him not, nor doth the opposition of any in all the worlds harm Him. O Muhammad! Praise thy Lord in the evening and at dawn, then take Him as thy trustee in truth. Find solace in Him and forget all else - thus doth the Pen of Command bid thee from the presence of the Mighty, the Powerful. Arise in thy love for thy Lord, then detach thyself from all things - this will make thee independent of all who are in the heavens and earth. God is witness to what I say. Would one who harbors in his heart the trust of love for his Ancient Lord exchange it for aught else that hath been created on earth? Nay, by God, besides Whom there is no other God - save he who hath deprived himself of the sweet savors of holiness. Take fast hold of God's command and cast all else behind thee. Thus hath the utterance descended on the clouds of wisdom and the matter been decreed from the presence of the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. O Rida! Be content with what God hath ordained for thee, then walk in the ways of His good-pleasure. This is better for thee than all that is on earth, though none know this save they who are endowed with insight. Blessed is he who walketh in the paths of his Lord's good-pleasure and severeth himself from every sinful idolater. Shun those who have denied God and His verses, then guard thyself against them and remain under mighty protection. Do not that which thy heart approveth not. Act according to that which thou hast been commanded by the Mighty, the Wise. Thus have We sent down unto thee verses from the heaven of names and attributes, that thou mayest be gladdened in thy soul and stand firm in the eternal Faith, steadfast in thy love for God, thy Lord. They who have denied God and His verses - their souls have made evil seem fair to them and Satan hath adorned their deeds in their eyes, and they were on that day far removed from the shore of grace upon the path of wrongdoing. Soon will Satan enter therein and forbid you from the love of the Youth. Therefore shun him and remain under impregnable protection. Say: O Satan! By what proof didst thou believe in the Beauty of the All-Merciful and by what evidence didst thou deny? If thou didst believe in Him Who came from the dawning-place of the Command by the name of Ali through what was revealed unto Him of verses - these are His verses that have filled the East and West of the earth, which none deny save every froward wretch. Thus have We informed thee and acquainted thee with what is hidden from the eyes of all the worlds. And the glory rest upon thee, if thou remainest steadfast in thy Lord's command.

The Beloved of God in Farahan

He is the Dawning from the Horizon of Revelation

This is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down to those who have turned unto Him in the land named Farahan, that they may rejoice in the remembrance of God, the Lord of the worlds. O My loved ones in that place! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison. He mentioneth you through that which God hath made as wings for those near unto Him, that they may soar in this holy atmosphere from whose birds' wings can be heard the cry: "There is none other God but Me, the Forgiving, the Generous." The ocean of tribulation hath surged through that which the hands of the wretched ones have wrought - they who followed every ignorant impostor and turned away from the Creator of all things when He came with manifest sovereignty. We have seen in the path of God what no eye hath seen and heard what no ear of creation hath heard. To this testifieth He Who created all former and latter generations with a word from His presence. Blessed are ye for having cast away vain imaginings and taken hold of that which ye were commanded by God, the Mighty, the Wise. Take hold of the Book of God with the power granted by Us, then act according to what hath been sent down therein from My Most Exalted Pen. Thus doth the Lord of Names command you as He walketh in this exalted Prison. Beware lest the whisperings of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, hold you back. The evil ones lie in wait, clinging to every stratagem. Avoid them, O people of Baha, and put your trust in God, the One, the All-Informed. The rivers have flowed, the winds have blown, the mountains have passed away, and the branches have been scattered, yet the people remain in strange slumber. The call hath been raised between earth and heaven and the world hath been illumined by the lights of the Revelation, yet the people remain in evident delusion. They have forsaken their God and taken Satan as their protector instead of God. Thus was it decreed aforetime and in this Revelation wherein all things have spoken when it appeared. The Beloved of the world hath come and that which was recorded in the Scriptures of God, the Mighty, the Great, hath been manifested. This is the Day wherein the Kingdom of Utterance hath appeared and wherein the tongue of the All-Merciful speaketh that which hath caused the hearts of the sincere ones to soar. Hold fast, O My loved ones, to the cord of the mercy of your Lord, and cling to the hem of God's grace, the Sovereign of this resplendent Day. Take the chalice of salvation in the name of the Cleaver of the Dawn, then drink therefrom with His remembrance whereby the unitarians have hastened to the Supreme Horizon and those near unto God to the Dawning-Place of Names. Thus doth the Creator of heaven remember you from this remote prison. When ye find the fragrances of My utterance and drink the choice wine of My bounty, turn your faces toward My horizon and say:

O Thou Who art the Object of worship of the world and the Beloved of the nations! We beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst once appear in the form of the Balance in creation, and at another time in the temple of Revelation when the Lord of Resurrection appeared, and at another time in the image of "There is none other God but He," and at another time in the form of "Verily I am God, there is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise" - to assist us in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with, and to grant us the Kawthar of steadfastness wherewith Thou didst counsel Thy chosen servants in Thy Books and Scriptures. O Lord! We are Thy servants and the children of Thy servants. We have turned toward the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy bestowals. We beseech Thee not to disappoint us from that which we desire from the wonders of Thy supreme mercy. Thou art verily the Almighty over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Praised.

O Rida! Hearken unto the shrill voice of the Most Exalted Pen. Verily, it calleth between earth and heaven and summoneth all to a station that hath been raised up through the name of God. We have heard thy cry in the love of God and seen thee turning toward the horizon of the Cause.

Take hold of the Book with a strength from Us and a power from Our presence, and abandon those who remained far from the waters of nearness. We have heard thy lamentation in the love of God and have sent down for thee this Tablet which hath been sent down from the heaven of justice.

O Mahmud! Hearken unto that which the Lord of Hosts calleth thee from this Praised Station that was inscribed by the Pen of the All-Merciful in the Qur'an. We have heard thy cry and make mention of thee with that which cannot be equaled by the treasures of earth. Thy Lord is verily witness to what I say. Rejoice thou in this Most Great Remembrance and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of eternity, for having turned toward this servant of Thine and mentioned him with verses that all on earth have failed to comprehend. Thou art, of a truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed."

O Asadu'llah! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee from the precincts of the Prison and counseleth thee and those who have believed to uphold the Most Great Trust among the concourse of creation. Thus hath the matter been decreed in thy Lord's Book. He is, verily, wise over all things. We send greetings from this Station to My loved ones who have attained unto My days, turned to My horizon, drunk the choice wine of My utterance, held fast with mighty constancy to My Cause, and performed that which they were commanded in My Book. By the life of God! They are among the Concourse on High in the Book of Names and the companions of the Crimson Ark that was inscribed by the Pen of Command. Hold ye fast to the cord of the Cause and cling to the hem of grace in this Day which hath been illumined by the lights of the countenance.

O Nasru'llah! The Most Exalted Pen maketh mention of the loved ones of God and His chosen ones, and commandeth them to that which shall profit them in every world of the worlds of their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have heard thy mention and make mention of thee and those who have believed with My beautiful remembrance. Give thanks unto God for having aided you to recognize Him Who was promised in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds. How many learned ones were heedless, and how many unlettered ones hastened, drank, and said: "Praise be unto Thee, O God of all who are in the heavens and on earth!" Your letter hath come and that which ye sent hath been honored with acceptance, as a bounty from His presence. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Blessed is he who hath adorned himself with the ornament of deeds which God hath revealed in His perspicuous Book. Praise be unto God, the Lord of the worlds.

He Who domineth over all who are in the heavens and on earth

A letter from Us to him who desireth to aid the Cause of God when the Dawning-Place of Revelation came with verses which all in the world were powerless to comprehend save whom God pleased - the King, the Almighty, the Most High, the Most Great.

Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Dayspring of Revelation and been attracted by the fragrances of the verses of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Say: In the name of God and by God, take thou the chalice of divine knowledge in the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and drink therefrom first, then give to drink them that dwell in the realm of possibility through this Name whereby the limbs of existence trembled and the hearts of the doubters who cast the Command of God behind their backs and followed their own idle fancies were agitated. Turn thy face with such steadfastness as will cause all faces to turn towards God, the Lord of all worlds. Arise and say: O people! By God, the Promise hath come and He Who was promised hath appeared with such sovereignty as neither the might of princes nor the clamor of divines could withstand. He calleth the world in the Most Great Prison unto God, the King, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Say: O people! Turn not unto the world and what is therein; soon it shall perish, and that which shall endure is what hath been ordained by the Most Exalted Pen for him who hath believed in God and acknowledged His sovereignty that overshadoweth all who are in the heavens and on earth. Say: Cast aside what ye possess and take what ye are bidden by One Who is Mighty, All-Knowing. Thus have We adorned the horizon of utterance with the light of explanation that thou mayest thank thy Lord and be of them that arise in such wise that sitting shall not hold thee back from this Cause whereby the horizon of unity was illumined and the faces of the deniers were darkened.

God willing, drink ye at all times from the fountain of divine knowledge and bestow with wisdom and utterance upon the people of the world the sealed wine whose seal hath been opened through the blessed Most Great Name. Most people you will observe to be as infants - were they given strong food at first, they would perish and never reach maturity. They must be given the milk of divine knowledge from the breast of wisdom until they attain true maturity, which is the station of the rending of veils. His mercy hath preceded all things and His grace hath encompassed the worlds. God willing, be ye cupbearers of the wine of divine knowledge among the people of the world and be ye so enkindled by the fire of the divine Tree that all regions may be ignited therefrom and attain unto the love of God and recognition of the Sun of Truth. This is not difficult for God.

All that is witnessed in the world shall perish and vanish save for deeds that are manifested today for God's sake - these shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. Say: Glory be to Thee, O God, Lord of the world and Master of the nations! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name to assist me to serve Thy Cause that I may guide the servants to the shore of the ocean of Thy oneness and bring them nigh unto the Dawning-Place of detachment through Thy Name and Thy sovereignty. O my Lord! Thou art the Gracious, possessed of great bounty. Ordain for me that whereby my mention shall endure among all mentions and my spirit among all spirits. Verily Thou art the Cleaver of dawn and the Sender of winds. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Giving, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.

He is the One speaking in the Kingdom of Utterance! This is a Book sent down in truth from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. It guides the servants to the supreme horizon - the station wherein the call has been raised that there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Loving. We have heard your call and mentioned you before, and at this time with a mention from which wafts the fragrance of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of the seen and unseen. This is the Day in which the Most Great Name has appeared - He Who is the Great Announcement in the Qur'an, the Comforter and Lord of all being in the Gospel and Psalms. Hear the call of the Wronged One. Go forth from the horizon of the House, speaking forth this Name by which the limbs of the tyrant trembled, the veils were rent asunder, and the back of the idols was broken - to this testifies He with Whom is the Preserved Tablet. Arise in thy Lord's Name and say: O peoples of the earth! This is a Day wherein ears were created to hearken to the scratching of the Supreme Pen and eyes to behold the lights of the Manifestation. Beware lest human doubts prevent you from the Lord of Destiny, or the misleader who turned away and denied God, Lord of all being, veil you. Say: O misleader! Where were you when the Wronged One stood before the faces of princes and divines? Where were you when He came from the horizon of power with manifest sovereignty? Fear God and refute not the truth by what you possess. Return unto Him - He hears what your tongue utters and sees what has appeared and will appear from you. He is the Truth, Knower of the unseen. Nothing prevents Him from anything, and no affair escapes His knowledge. He has arisen and called out with the most exalted call: O peoples of the earth! The appointed time is fulfilled and this is the Promised One. Deny Him not by what you possess. Turn with radiant faces and return unto Him - He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Mighty, the Pardoning. When thou hast attained the choice wine of My utterance and found the fragrance of My verses, say:

My God, my God! Aid me to remember Thee and praise Thee and serve Thy Cause, that I may arise among Thy servants to exalt Thy Word and manifest Thy Cause until the standards of Thy oneness and the banners of Thy victory are raised. O Lord! Illumine my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and my breast with the radiance of Thy verses. I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I testify to Thy oneness and singleness, and that Thou art God - there is no God but Thee. Thou hast ever been sanctified above the deeds of the world and the mentions of the nations, and wilt ever be as Thou hast been from time immemorial. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the cries of the sincere ones and the wailing of those near unto Thee in their separation and remoteness from Thee, and by the lights of the Orb of Thy grace which has shone from the horizon of the world for the reformation of the nations, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love such that the power of created things weakens me not, nor the might of contingent beings frightens me. Thou art He to Whose power the denizens of Thy Kingdom and Thy Realm have testified, and before Whose will the Concourse on High and the most exalted Paradise have bowed. Ordain for me through Thy bounty and grace that which will solace mine eyes, assure my heart and dilate my breast. Then write for me what will profit me in every world of Thy worlds. Thou art, verily, powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Protector of what was and what will be.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most Powerful

Unto God belongs the work of those who have detached themselves from all else save Him and have attained unto that which was commanded them in the Book inscribed by His Most Exalted Pen. And unto God belongs the pearl of those who have hearkened to His sweetest call, have turned toward His most exalted horizon, and have testified to that which God Himself hath testified - they are the ones through whom the horizon of utterance hath shone forth and through whom the fragrance of the garment of the All-Merciful hath been wafted throughout all possibility. And upon God rests the recompense of those who have recognized His days, whereby the Books, the Scriptures and the Tablets have been adorned.

Thereafter, there hath reached the servant thy letter which was perfumed with the mention of the Beloved and adorned with the praise of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen. I read it and beseeched God, our Lord and your Lord, that He might aid you to celebrate the praise of the Dawning-Place of His verses, the Dayspring of His knowledge and the Source of His wisdom which hath encompassed the world. Verily, He is the Near One, the Responding One.

It is submitted that mention was made of your honor in the Most Holy Presence, and after presenting what you had written and sent, He said: "God willing, they must engage with the utmost diligence and effort in the mention of God, that perchance sleeping souls may attain the grace of awareness, may hearken to the call of the Wronged One, and may arise to serve the Cause. A hundred thousand regrets and reproaches be upon those souls who have not attained to the recognition of the Promised Day and who wander and journey in the gloomy wilderness of their own desires. Thinkest thou that they understand or hear? God testifieth that they are among the dead and perceive it not."

O servant of God! That which thou hast accomplished in the path of the Intended One hath not been and shall never be forgotten. Give thanks unto God for having enabled thee to serve His Cause. This, verily, is a supreme station. Convey My greetings unto those who are with thee. Thus doth command thee the Wronged One, the Stranger.

As to what thou didst write concerning Jinab-i-Safi and the guest, upon them be the glory of God - praise be to God, they have ever been the recipients of divine favors. Jinab-i-Safi is among those souls whom the Truth Himself hath taught, and for whom He hath opened the door of His great mercy with the key of His blessed Name. Well is it with him and with her. Convey on behalf of this servant wondrous and glorious greetings unto them, and likewise unto all the friends in that land who have been nourished by the wine of divine love and who have been adorned with His endless bounties - convey on behalf of this evanescent one greetings, mention and peace. I beseech God to aid and assist them all and to adorn them with the ornament of steadfastness. The glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have walked His straight path. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

It is further submitted that regarding what thou didst mention about the son of the servant, it was presented in the Most Holy Presence. He said: "God willing, may they be illumined by the Sun of divine favor and may they be occupied with His mention, which is the first gift of the Beloved. The glance of grace hath been and God willing shall be upon them. And their Lord, the All-Merciful, He is verily the Bestower, the Generous."

O Name of God, upon thee be the Glory of God! He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!

Your letter arrived and your call was heard. May you ever be blessed through God's grace and be turned toward His direction. Be not grieved by hardship, for all are in hardship. And be not distressed by constraints, for all are under constraints. If there be no constraint of wealth, there must needs be constraint of aspirations. And if through the grace of the Beloved Who never fails the constraint of aspirations be removed, the constraint of greed remains. We must beseech the Self-Sufficing Sovereign with utmost humility and supplication to enable all to attain to His will and good-pleasure. For by the life of God, whosoever attains to this station, no hardship can touch him nor constraint afflict him.

O Name of God! If someone were to place multiple magnifying glasses over his eyes, could he find anything in the world that is not imprisoned within six directions of hardship? And this hardship stems from the imaginings and idle fancies that result from what men's hands have wrought. Hardship has degrees, and likewise constraint. Were these utterances to be expounded as they should be, surely Taftazani's lengthy work would seem brief in comparison. You and the other loved ones must in truth turn to God and seek His aid, that He may, through the key of His Name, open a door whereby all may be cleansed and purified from the defilements of this mortal world and attain to the kingdom of tranquility.

In the Hidden Words He saith: "Shouldst thou search the heavens and the earth, thou wouldst find no place of rest or security save in submission to God." God is my witness that the glance of His favor hath been and will continue to be directed toward you. Surely after reading this you will say: "The matter was presented, but what was desired was its resolution, not counsel and admonition." Our story and yours is like that of the Bedouin who came before a great one and said "I am poor." The great one replied "We are all poor, as God hath said: 'O people! Ye are all poor before God, and God is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised.'" Then he said "I wish to make pilgrimage to Mecca." The great one replied "God bless you, for pilgrimage to the House is prescribed for people by God." Then he said "I have no means for the journey." He replied "No blame is on you; stay at home, for God hath said 'for those who are able to make their way thereto.'" Then he said "O my master, I came for my need, not for sermons!"

These utterances have shone forth from the Dawning-Place of the Sun of Utterance that you may read them and be gladdened. But one word remains, which I speak in a tongue sanctified from utterance: "It is for you to make up for what hath passed you by." If you hold fast to this word, which is in truth the key of utterance, surely the doors of mercy, grace, blessings, bounty, rest and tranquility will be opened before your face. Thus doth the True and Trustworthy One give thee glad tidings. Hear thou with the ear of the spirit this word of the Wronged One of the world, and God willing, thou shalt be aided thereby. The end belongeth to the God-fearing, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

O Nabil! Most people have asked for poison from God and continue to do so, while in their imagination they sought honey. They have chosen the colocynth of selfish desires over the honey of the Divine Will. By my Lord, the All-Merciful, this is truly loss! If an infant asks poison from an adult, is it permissible to give it? No, by my Self, even if it cries and wails. The affairs of this land are veiled and the poisons of enemies concealed. Were the veil to be rent, death would result.

O Nabil! This servant is in the Most Great Prison while enemies are at the height of opposition. Yet despite the supreme prohibition, by what means do they still consider it permissible to turn toward this direction? A group from every tribe surrounds us - what can be done about their vain imaginings? The essence was God's good-pleasure, from which most have departed. Would that We could find opportunity to release what is in Our heart! Ah! By My life, if you could see Me with My own eyes, you would see each of My limbs in the mouth of a serpent. Alas, alas for what is concealed and must not be revealed! Soon will its covering be removed.

Seventy souls are imprisoned with the Ancient Beauty - imprisoned according to their belief. By My life, I am the Prisoner! By My Beauty, I am the Prisoner! By My Life, I am the Prisoner! Whose purposes shall be fulfilled? Who shall bear the countless favors? I have no word but "yes," no answer but "indeed."

Reflect on past centuries and ages. By My Beauty, none was afflicted as I am afflicted! Yes, in former times Divine Manifestations were among people when outward power existed and none could transgress beyond what God decreed. Would that they understood the cause of the Primal Point's lamentation in this Revelation! If you would reflect, you would know your own station, not what is with your All-Knowing Lord.

O Muhammad! Hear what I say: Read the Tablets revealed in Iraq along with what was revealed upon Our first arrival here, that you may know and discover what befell the Beloved of God, the Most High, the Most Great. The Herald of My Beauty says He has but two words: "yes" and "no." Now only "yes" remains. Know thou the melody of utterance and be of those who cry out! Then the Tablet and what appeared - wherein We were.

Your letter reached the Divine Throne. What was mentioned regarding Ali is understood and known. It is very clear that God's favor was with him. If permissible, We would surely have revealed and sought it ourselves. Abu'l-Qasim Khan has long wandered in the wilderness of bewilderment. We beseech God to make known to him what He intended. He is the All-Wise, the All-Informed.

O Nabil! O Nabil! By My life, you are with Me! How many near ones are strangers, and how many strangers are near! Blessed is he who is near and draws near! This is the red elixir - take it as a trust from Me with you. And glory be upon My people!

Through your mediation, Ali's coming to Haifa is permitted, but after the passing of numbered days, return to Shahba unto Hadba is most proper, best and closest to righteousness.

As for outward affairs, verily the two names Ha and Mim, from excessive transfers, nearly fled from Akka to Mecca. And peace be upon the best of creation.

O Nabil before Khalil, upon him be the Most Holy, Most Great, Most Glorious Glory of God! This is a Book from Us to him who has turned to God, the Lord of the worlds. We mention to him what has befallen Us from the hosts of the oppressors when they brought Us to this place. The matter became so severe it cannot be described in words. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Each day the affliction increases - one day they prevent people from attaining the presence of this Noble Scene, another day they quarrel with the loved ones of God and prevent them from tending to their needs - these are truly companions of hellfire. Another day they say "You are sending Tablets," and another day they cling to some other pretext - these are truly among those who have wronged throughout the ages and disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Verily He Who created the world for Himself - they prevent Him from looking upon any of His loved ones. This is nothing but manifest tyranny. One said: "Through you the fragrances of revelation have wafted through the lands and transformed the servants unto God, the Mighty, the Wise." Another said: "Through you the lamp of remembrance has been lit and we wished to extinguish it. If this be my crime then I am the most guilty of the two worlds. I am innocent of you and you are innocent of me. The matter between us is decided, and He is the Best of Judges." They said: "You have come with a white hand and radiant scrolls which our souls do not desire. You are but one of the mischief-makers." If this were so, servants before Me would have preceded Me, reciting unto you the verses of God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Whenever We recited clear verses unto them they said "These are forgeries," and when We showed them what their likes were powerless to produce, they said "This is manifest sorcery." We know not by what discourse their souls would be satisfied - they are truly among the drowned ones. They are drowned in the sea of passion yet reckon themselves to be among the guided ones. Thus have their souls seduced them and they are today among the transgressors. Remember when Nabil entered with his brothers, turning to God, the Lord of the worlds. They were seized at the gate by what the Impostor had inspired in the hearts of the oppressors. When they entered the seat of judgment, it was said: "We perceive from you the fragrance of the Divine Paradise and from your faces the radiance of the All-Merciful. There is no place for you with us - leave at once!" He said: "Have you not heard 'Honor the guest'?" Then he who had wronged was confounded. He said: "Expel him from the city" - thus did the chief of the transgressors command us. There befell Nabil before Ali and those with him what had befallen him. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing. We beseech God to suffice thee against the evil of these two - verily He hath power over all things. They plot, but soon shall the fire of their plotting blaze forth. May God extinguish it through His sovereignty and raise up one who will suffice against their evil. He is verily the Ordainer of what He willeth. They have committed that which hath caused the dwellers of the pavilion of sanctity to lament, and their plotting hath seized every young and old. We have recounted some of what hath befallen Us that thou mayest be informed of what hath transpired and arise to aid this Wronged One and remember thy Lord by this wondrous Name. The breezes of hypocrisy have stirred and the Light of the Cause is in the darkness of the horizons. Be thou not troubled - We love to behold thee among the steadfast ones. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing! This is a book from this lowly one who calls all unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, to him who hath believed in God and then was guided by the light through which all in the heavens and earth were illumined. O servant! Thy letter hath come before Us and before reading it We have answered thee and learned of the trials and hardships that have befallen thee and the poverty and want that have seized thee. Know thou that all this is a bounty from God unto thee if thou be of the patient ones, for whatsoever descendeth from the Beloved is beloved in truth, and naught befalleth anyone save by His leave. This indeed is the truth, the certain truth. And whatsoever trials and tribulations, decrees and afflictions descend upon the loved ones, whether secretly or openly, are better for them than all that thou dost witness and see in the kingdom of the worlds, for God is more merciful to all things than they are to themselves, and naught descendeth upon anyone except what is better for him than the kingdom of the first and the last. His bounty hath preceded all things and His mercy hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and the earth. There is no God but Him, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Rejoice in thy soul at what hath descended upon thee from God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Be not dismayed in thyself nor frightened in thy heart, but be patient in the Cause of thy Lord, then persevere, for the end belongeth to those who are patient. For the world and all that causeth thee sorrow shall pass away, while thou shalt abide among the concourse of the near ones and ascend to the atmosphere of holiness and take shelter in the shadow of the Face of God, the Sanctified, the Luminous, if thou followest His guidance and hearkenest to what We have imparted unto thee and detachest thyself from those who walk in darkness and follow their own selves and move beneath their desires like a shadow beneath a tree. This is what We impart unto thee in truth that thou mayest be of those who rejoice, such that no sorrow shall seize thee even though all sorrows should descend upon thee from God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent. Say: O people! By God, this is a Book which sufficeth the people if they follow it and draweth them nigh unto the shore of the Divine Essence and causeth them to reach the pavilion of glory, the station whereon shone forth the lights of grandeur from One exalted and magnificent, He through Whose name passeth the appointed time of the Names through Muhammad, and this indeed is the Light whereby were illumined the hearts of them that have professed His unity. Say: O people! Follow ye the guidance of God and follow not your desires. This indeed is guidance and a remembrance for all the worlds. And were all who are on earth to read this luminous Tablet or were it to be recited unto the East and the West, by God, they would all turn unto God and hasten to the paradise of holiness near the mercy of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Ancient of Days. Then whoso willeth, let him accept what We have imparted in truth, and whoso willeth, let him turn away. Verily my Lord is independent of all the worlds. He will cause them to pass away and bring another creation, then impart unto them that from which ye were veiled. This indeed is one of the mysteries of destiny which burneth and riseth high behind the veils of decree, if thou be of those who perceive. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who are enkindled with the fire of love at all times. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the Name of the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Glorious!

O My loved ones in the Ridvan! Hearken unto the call of your Lord, the All-Merciful. He remembers you as a token of His grace, that He may draw you unto Paradise, the station whereon is established the throne of your Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. The Tree of Knowledge hath sprouted forth in the land of the Bayan, proclaiming: "There is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise." Blessed is he who hath sought shelter beneath one of its leaves, for neither the concerns of the world shall grieve him, nor shall the doubts of the wayward trouble him. Whoso turneth today unto God, around him circle the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Cities of Eternity, then they who are established upon the Ark of Glory, then the realities of them that are nigh unto God.

O My loved ones therein! Soar upon the wings of detachment in this atmosphere wherein no atom moveth except that it proclaimeth that which the Luminous Tree proclaimed at the divine Sinai: "There is none other God but Me, the Sanctified, the Mighty, the Beauteous." Purify your vision and turn unto My most exalted horizon. By God! That which had never appeared in the worlds hath been made manifest, and the Most Great Word hath spoken forth, by a single letter of which the suns have shone forth - a Word none hath known save My All-Knowing Self, and through which the Books of God have been revealed from time immemorial, and by which the hearts of them that have detached themselves from all else and turned unto His luminous and radiant countenance have been attracted.

Be ye united in the Cause of God and adorn your temples with the raiment of love and unity. Thus doth the Lord of creation command you from this remote Prison. Whoso hath today attained unto that which God hath ordained, by God, the contingent beings shall be attracted by his utterance and all created things shall be moved by his mention. This beseemeth him who hath turned today unto the One, the All-Informed. Be as the breezes of spring unto the cities and lands of God, that from the soils of hearts may grow the hyacinths of praise and remembrance. He, verily, is the Manifestation, the Confirmer, the Mighty, the Wise.

This is a Book around which circle the Books of creation, yet most of the people are heedless. We have sent down the laws and expounded whatsoever We desired in truth. Follow that which ye have been commanded with power from Us, and turn not unto those who turned away from the Countenance when it shone forth from this luminous horizon. O people! Hold fast unto God and His commandments. He, verily, will make you independent of those who have risen in opposition. He is with His servants who have turned unto Him. Beware lest the veils of humanity withhold you from the Most Great Scene, or the allusions of men debar you from My straight path. Can the name of faith be truly applied unto those who have denied today? Nay, by My Self, the True One! To this testifieth every discerning knower.

Guard yourselves against them who have denied God, rejected His proof, and disputed His signs. Verily, they are among the perishing ones. Grieve not at what the idolaters say. Soon shall they find themselves in the abyss of punishment, and ye shall behold your temples in an exalted station. We have illumined the horizon of knowledge with the luminary of thy Lord's utterance, the All-Merciful, and have sent it unto you as a grace from Our presence, for We are, in truth, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. When ye perceive the fragrance of God from His verses, arise to make mention of God and His praise, that the slumbering may awaken and turn unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Glory be upon you, O My loved ones, and praise be upon you, O My cherished ones, from God, the Beloved of them that know. Rejoice in this Tablet, for it hath been sent down from the heaven of the favors of your Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Great.

O My Name! Upon thee be My glory! We have heard the call of those who have turned to the All-Merciful when He came with manifest sovereignty. He who hath heard My call, verily he is of the people of the most exalted Paradise before God, the Lord of the worlds. By My life! All things have appeared for this Most Great Day, and all beings for the recognition of this glorious station. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto that for which it was created, and blessed the eye that hath beheld My luminous countenance. Say: O people of God! Beware lest anything prevent you from the path of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Through My Name, the All-Powerful, every denier was weakened, and through My Name, the Trustworthy, every ignorant one far removed was shaken. Exalted be My Most Great Name through which the limbs of the nations trembled, and glorified be My Name, the Mighty, whereby We have strengthened the servants. Blessed is he who hath understood that which the Most Exalted Pen hath uttered in this wondrous, glorious dawn.

O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Ghulam-Rida, that My remembrance may attract him to a station wherein he shall behold naught save the signs of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee, then praise thy Lord in the nights and days for this bounty which hath been the hope of them that are nigh unto God.

O Nasru'llah! Thy letter was presented and We heard thy call. We have answered thee through this manifest Book. Give thanks unto God and say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having made me know Thee and guided me and caused me to hear Thy call when every learned one was debarred therefrom. I beseech Thee by the glances of Thy loving-kindness and the movement of Thy Pen and the mysteries of Thy verses and the lights of Thy countenance and the power of Thy most exalted Word in the kingdom of creation, to make us among those whom the ornaments of the world and the tyranny of the nations have not prevented from turning unto Thee and beholding Thy horizon. Then ordain for us, O our God, the All-Merciful, the reward of meeting Thee. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Commander, the All-Wise.

O My Name Mahdi! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness! The petition of Jinab-i-Ghulam-Rida and Aqa Nasru'llah which thou didst send hath attained unto the Most Holy Court, and these most holy, most exalted verses have been revealed in reply. We beseech God to assist them in mention and praise and the triumph of His Cause, and We counsel them and all the people of God to wisdom. Wisdom is like the sun for the new world, that is, the world of Baha, and it is a light for the nights. And We counsel all to the fear of God. It is the opener of cities and it is the helper of truth and the succourer, and it is the protector of the friends and their helper. Blessed are the souls who are adorned with this most great ornament. The light of these souls is more brilliant and glorious in the sight of the denizens of heaven than the light of the sun. O people of God! Take ye My Book with the hands of resignation and contentment. We beseech God to assist you in sincere deeds and to ordain for you the good of the hereafter and of the former life and that whereby your eyes may be solaced and your hearts may rejoice and whereby your mention may endure throughout the duration of My earthly and heavenly kingdom. And verily I am the Almighty, the All-Powerful, and worthy to answer.

O My Name! Set forth in general the affairs of this land that they may become informed. In these days attention is in no wise permissible, for the heedless are engaged in evident deceit and tyranny.

O friends of God in every land! This Wronged One adjureth you by the Best-Beloved of the world, Who is calling aloud in the Kingdom of Utterance, that ye deal not faithlessly with the substance of your fellow men. Be ye the trustees of God in His dominions and the embodiments of truthfulness throughout His realms. Blessed the man that heedeth the counsels of God and observeth His precepts.

He is the One Who gazeth before the Face. O people of the cities and villages! Hearken unto that which the Tongue uttereth in the Kingdom of Utterance from the presence of Him Who hath caused all things to speak, that there is none other God but Me, the Peerless, the All-Informed. He it is Who hath sent down the Books and dispatched the Messengers, that there is none other God but Me, the All-Watchful, the All-Wise. Every thing hath attained unto the blessing of hearkening unto the Call save every transgressing sinner, and every eye hath beheld the horizon of God, the Most Glorious, save every heedless and remote one. By God! The Most Great Scene hath appeared and the Lord of Destiny proclaimeth and saith: O concourse of humanity! The Day hath come and the moon hath been cleft asunder and all are gathered in a wondrous assembly. The Hidden hath been made manifest and the Treasured hath come forth and the Promised One hath appeared from the heaven of destiny more nigh than the twinkling of an eye, yet the people are in evident delusion. They behold the Sun and say: "Is this a sun?" and they witness the signs and say: "This is naught but mighty sorcery." Thus hath the matter been decreed in the Book while the people of the veil are in strange doubt.

O loved ones of the All-Merciful in all lands! The Wronged One adjureth you by the Best-Beloved of all possibility, Who speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance, that ye be not unfaithful regarding the substance of the people. Be ye trustees of God in His lands and dawning-places of truthfulness in His countries. Blessed is he who hath hearkened unto the counsel of God and was of them that act.

There hath appeared from faithlessness in this exile that which hath caused My liver to melt and Mine eye to shed tears and My inmost being to lament and My breast to be straitened. By the life of God! Sleep hath taken flight from the eyes of Baha by reason of what hath befallen Him in this white land. All things bear witness to this, yet the people are among the heedless ones. The rock hath cried out at My tribulation and the Divine Lote-Tree hath lamented at My distress. By God! My grief is not for Myself but for the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds. All sorrows are for him who is unable to mention what hath touched him of hardships and tribulations in this noble station.

We hear falsehood yet remain silent, while the liar supposeth that the matter hath become confused, when We found him in manifest truthfulness. O My loved ones! Adorn yourselves with the morals of God and array your temples with the garments of trustworthiness and uprightness and truthfulness. Thus doth the Lord of creation command you in a preserved Tablet.

Sorrows have increased at this time by what We observe of the Temple of Love and those with him beneath the claws of hatred from among the hosts of the wrongdoers. O God of Names and Creator of earth and heaven! Thou seest how the fire hath encompassed him who was beneath the shadow of the light in Thy days. O Lord! Protect him and those with him as Thou didst protect Me when I was in the serpent's mouth. Verily Thou art He through Whom power hath been manifested. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.

Thou knowest, O my God, how the brocade of servitude hath been adorned among creation and the sign of detachment hath appeared in the world of creation. Every fair-minded and insightful one beareth witness to this. Though tribulation in Thy path is sweeter than the Kawthar and more luminous than the moon, yet I beseech Thee, O Thou Who hast subdued the world by the Most Great Name, to deliver him from the hands of tyranny. Verily Thou art the Forgiving, the Generous. \[Then\] preserve him \[beneath\] the pavilion of grace and aid him in what he is engaged in regarding Thy love. Verily Thou art He in Whose grasp is the dominion of the kingdom of the heavens and the earths.

O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! The pen is bewildered what to record. Vain imaginings and idle fancies have so taken hold of the hearts and minds of the heedless that their elimination has become most difficult. The Qaim appeared, yet those who awaited Him and who considered themselves the most God-fearing and learned among all peoples committed that which caused the Eye of Grandeur to weep. And the people of the Bayan, who witnessed with their own eyes and heard with their own ears the deeds of the former people, now walk in the footsteps of that oppressive group and cling to the same names. Hadi Dawlatabadi is occupied with leading the poor people astray. He is among those who have contrived a Holy Land and a Jabulqa and Jabulsa. A whole world of idle fancies and a realm of vain imaginings hath newly appeared. Pray that God, exalted be His glory, may protect His servants. They say the Bayan has been corrupted. The Book of Certitude, which was revealed in the presence of the maternal uncle in answer to his questions and which mentions the exile of this Wronged One, they have nevertheless attributed to the dayspring of idle fancies. In such circumstances, what can the pen write and what can the tongue utter? That which hath been sent down from the Dayspring of God's Will is as manifest as the sun and is distinct from all else. No person of insight hath been nor will be confused by it. Beseech God to assist His loved ones to preserve souls, that they may not be afflicted with idle fancies as were the former people. By God's life! The pen and paper are bewildered. That honored one beareth witness that from the beginning of the Cause until now, this Wronged One hath caused verses to rain down like copious rain from the heaven of grace, and hath acted beyond the power and might of all the peoples of the world. No barrier prevented it, no thing became an obstacle. We summoned all with the most exalted call to the highest horizon. Most rejected the counsel of the trusted Counselor. They cast the advice of God behind their backs, clinging to their vain imaginings and idle fancies. The people have turned away, the government is heedless, and the ignorant ones of the earth have found opportunity and committed that which no group had ever committed. Some time ago, sublime and wondrous Tablets and sacred and prevailing verses were sent in the name of Varqa, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness. By God's life! Every letter thereof proclaimeth: "The gate of heaven hath been opened, and He Who was hidden in knowledge and concealed from sight hath come." Convey My greetings to each and every one of the loved ones in that land. Give them all glad tidings and make them joyous through God's grace. Say: O people of God! Occupy yourselves with the remembrance and praise of God and the victory of His Cause. Whatever befalleth Us, We are content and thankful. We beseech God to assist His loved ones to achieve the Greater Steadfastness and to accomplish that which He loveth and desireth. Verily He is the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the All-Wise. The glory from Us be upon you and upon those who have hearkened and have said: "Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the mystics!"

We beseech God to aid thee in that which beseemeth His days. Every soul hath testified and doth testify to the transience of the world and its transformation. Therefore the friends of God who have attained unto the Kawthar of utterance must at all times strive diligently to acquire eternal stations and everlasting bounties. Verily He is with whomsoever remembereth Him and desireth Him, and He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.

The Most Exalted Pen at this moment hath desired to make mention of one of the leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree and one of His handmaidens. We testify that she departed from her home, turning toward the Supreme Horizon, and traversed deserts, mountains, land and sea until she arrived at the fortified City mentioned in the Books and Tablets, and attained the presence of the Face, and was blessed with what God had revealed in His Books. We testify that she believed in God and His signs, and responded when the Call was raised between earth and heaven, and drank the cup of reunion from the hands of the bounty of her Lord, the Self-Sufficing, the Most Exalted, and heard what the near ones heard on the Mount of Knowledge, and saw what eyes and visions were prevented from seeing, save whom God, the Lord of lords, willeth.

The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness, and the glory of those in My Kingdom and My Dominion, and the first fragrance wafting from My garment, be upon thee, O My leaf and My handmaiden! We testify that thou didst circle round the Throne and didst attain the presence of thy Lord when most of mankind were debarred therefrom, and didst drink the pure wine from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon thee at every moment a mercy from His presence, and a loving-kindness from His own Self, and a grace from His direction. Blessed art thou, for the ocean of forgiveness hath surged in the contingent world, and the Day-Star of grace hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of pardon and beneficence. Thou didst believe in the All-Merciful when most handmaidens denied Him. The glory from Our presence be upon thee, and upon thy beginning and thy end, and thy outward and thy inward self, and upon whoso remembereth thy days and thy migration and thy nearness and thy presence, and upon every steadfast and firm one, and every knowing and discerning one.

O Husayn, O thou who standest before the Face! Be not grieved at what hath come to pass. By the life of God, she hath attained unto that which the Pen is powerless to describe. In truth, this transient abode was not and is not worthy of tarrying, settling and repose. However, in one respect it stands above all the worlds on high and is preeminent over all, for despite its transience and transformation, the acquisition of eternal stations and sublime ranks hath been ordained therein by the Ordainer, the Powerful, the Ancient of Days. In any case, thou shouldst not be grieved, for she hath attained unto the Most Great Bounty. The glory from Our presence be upon thee and upon thy brother and upon those who are with thee among the assured servants of God.

O Spiritual One! Your letter was received and attained the honor of being heard in the Most Holy and Exalted Presence. The fragrance of the love of the All-Merciful wafted from its words. Your prose bore true witness to your steadfastness, acceptance, and devotion, and your poetry proclaimed with the most exalted call the degrees of steadfastness, detachment, adherence and supplication. We heard and saw that thou hast been and art successful in all conditions. That which was mentioned by Aqa Muhammad-Rida attained the honor of His presence. We heard his call and this most exalted utterance was revealed from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful's expression in response:

"O Muhammad-Rida! We have heard thy call and answered thee, and We took a cup in thy name and drank therefrom the choice sealed wine. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this great bounty. O Muhammad-Hasan! The fragrance of sincerity was diffused from thy mention. We took a handful from the Most Great Sea and drank it when thy mention was flowing from My Most Exalted Pen. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all beings! Thou hast mentioned Me in such wise as hath enraptured the hearts of them that have turned and drawn nigh. O My handmaiden, O My leaf! Blessed is the handmaiden who hath attained unto a name uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur in His exalted and glorious station. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those handmaidens whose names were presented before the Wronged One in this mighty stronghold."

And We make mention of Muhammad-Husayn who hath in this hour attained unto the breezes of revelation and been encompassed by the mercy of his Lord. God hath forgiven him as a bounty from His presence, for He is the All-Bountiful, the Compassionate, the Generous. And We make mention of his wife as a mercy and favor from Us. We beseech God to ordain for her that which will draw her nigh unto Him in all His worlds. And We make mention of the mother of Dhabi? and bear witness to her devotion and acceptance on a day whereon the men of earth and their mighty ones and their learned ones turned away, save whom God, her Creator and Fashioner and Rememberer, willed. Blessed is she and joy be unto her.

O Muhammad-Husayn! We have adorned thy head with the crown of My love and thy temple with the ornament of My remembrance in this station which hath been illumined by the lights of the countenance of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Merciful. We counsel thee to be steadfast in this Great Announcement. The glory be upon thee and upon those with thee from God, the Lord of the worlds.

O Spiritual One! We have made mention of thee and thy kinsmen. Give them glad tidings from Me and remind them of My verses and illumine them with the lights of what hath been sent down from My Most Exalted Pen. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. And We counsel them regarding deeds and character that the fragrance of My mercy and providence and bounty which hath encompassed the horizons may be diffused from them. We beseech God to ordain for them what He hath ordained for His loved ones. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer.

Convey My greetings to the handmaidens in that land and illumine them with the lights of the Orb of the providence of God, exalted be His glory. O Spiritual One! Thou didst attain in the earliest days when the people were in manifest doubt and strange delusion. Thou didst turn to the horizon when the people were in great \[opposition\]. That which flowed from the tongue of thy heart in praise of the Goal of the worlds, We have sent to the pavilion of glory. Verily He is the Single, the One, the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

He is God, exalted be His glory in wisdom and utterance!

O Ali! Today from the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree this most exalted word was heard: "O concourse of kings and subjects! Cast away idle fancies and vain imaginings. By God! From the horizon of power hath appeared your Lord, the Chosen One, with manifest sovereignty." Praise be to God that you have turned to Him and drunk from the Kawthar of the utterance of the All-Merciful. This is God's grace upon you. Thank your Lord and say: "Thine be the praise, O Lord of Names, and Thine be the glory, O Desire of them that know!"

O Ali! There befell the Wronged One in the previous year that which caused the Pen to weep and the Tablet to lament. A tyrannical person sat upon the seat of authority and committed that which caused the rocks to cry out and the Concourse on High to wail. Yet the conditions of the world and the might of rulers and peoples did not prevent the Wronged One from the divine Command. In the midst of tribulations, before the faces of enemies, He spoke the Most Exalted Word. Earth and heaven bear witness, the sun and moon testify. Ask God not to deprive the world of the fragrances of His days and to bestow upon it a portion from the ocean of His knowledge. The Truth is distinguished from all else by all aspects and deeds, and His Cause is more manifest than the sun at its zenith. Yet eyes and ears are deprived of witnessing and hearing.

Reflect a while on the affairs of the previous community. For thirteen hundred years, ranks upon ranks of divines appeared and occupied themselves with mentioning and speaking of the Intended One from pulpits. Yet when the Divine Lote-Tree grew from the blessed and holy ground, all attempted to cut it down, and finally there befell the Essence of Being that which caused the eyes of grandeur to weep. Such was their heedlessness that not a single one of the divines discovered the presence of the Intended One in the loins. They were worshippers of fancy yet counted themselves among the monotheists. Their station on the Day of Reckoning became evident to all in earth and heaven.

Now again the people of the Bayan are occupied with forming a party similar to that party. O Ali! It is incumbent and obligatory upon you and the friends of God to protect people according to your capacity, that they might not be afflicted with new idle fancies. Arise for God's sake and speak for God's sake. We beseech God to assist you in all conditions with such assistance that its effects will become manifest throughout all horizons.

Convey My greetings to the friends in that land on behalf of the Wronged One and say: "Where is your enthusiasm? Where are the lights of your faces? Where are the fragrances of your mention in the days of your Lord?" Know the value of this Day and occupy yourselves with service, that there might appear from you that which will endure through the eternity of My names and attributes. Thus hath the ocean revealed its waves, the Book its verses, and the Treasury its secrets, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those whom the doubts of the world have not prevented from God, the Lord of the Ancient Days, Who hath come with the standards of verses and hath spoken before all faces - the Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the All-Wise. We make mention of My leaf and give her the glad-tidings of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to elevate her station and to send down upon her mercy from His presence. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

In the Name of the Friend, the Manifest, the Evident

O 'Ali! God willing, mayest thou be blessed by the fragrances of the divine garment of utterance and receive thy portion from the outpourings of the cloud of the All-Merciful's mercy. From the time of thy return until now thou hast been blessed with the favors of the Lord of the worlds. Be thou steadfast in serving thy Lord with wisdom. He will assist thee through His grace and aid thee through His command. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful.

In several places thy mention hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen: "Look neither to the right nor to the left. Behold the horizon of thy Lord's will, then remember Him with sincerity for His sake. Verily He heareth and seeth and is with those who are with Him, as He hath ever been. He is the True One, the Herald, the Wise."

O Muhammad! The Single, the One, in the Most Great Prison, summoned all unto God and manifested proof and evidence with the most exalted utterance. Some, upon merely hearing, drank without hesitation from the wine of revelation, while others, due to intervening veils, were deprived and prevented from the horizon of manifestation. The cause and reason for these matters is that there appeareth not, as befitteth, a teacher who is detached from all save God and who speaketh for God's sake, turning toward all. The people need educators. Souls who are steadfast, firm, content and pleasing must at all times be occupied with teaching the Cause of God with perfect wisdom.

O son of My Most Truthful Name! Upon thee be My loving-kindness, My mercy and My glory. Give glad tidings to the servants of My bounty and remind them of that which hath been revealed in My Book. In most of the divine Tablets the purpose of assistance hath been mentioned with utmost clarity. Nevertheless, it is observed that most have not attained proper understanding. Some petitions arrived from various places - it was observed that they had considered corruption as assistance and deemed the injury of God's servants as beloved. This is naught but due to the friends' lack of awareness. I swear by the sun of the horizon of utterance that if today any soul is content with the injury of another, it is as though he were content with injury to the Self of Truth. All must become aware of this decisive divine word and attain unto hearing it. Most strange it is that souls have not, until now, comprehended the meaning of assistance. By the life of God! He verily assisteth His Cause through wisdom and utterance. This is what the All-Merciful hath revealed in most Tablets. Thy Lord is verily the Explainer, the Wise.

Divine wisdom hath been and shall ever be dominant and triumphant. One pure deed is like unto a lamp between heaven and earth - it showeth the way and guideth the heedless unto itself. Say: Hearken, O people, unto that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken in His Most Great, Most Holy, Most Luminous Book. Convey My greetings to all souls who have drunk of the sealed wine, and say: In the divine days ye must appear in such wise that the clouds of the opposers, the hints of the corrupters, and the veils of the heedless shall not prevent you from the straight path. Hold fast unto God and leave all else behind you, remaining steadfast in this Cause whereby the pillars in the contingent world were shaken. Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who are with thee and upon thy family from the presence of the Gracious, the Generous.

He is God, exalted be His station in greatness and power

O 'Ali, O thou who hast clung to the cord of My loving-kindness, who soarest in the atmosphere of My love, who gazest upon My countenance and drinkest the Kawthar of My utterance! Hearken unto that which the Supreme Pen hath testified concerning thee in these days wherein His Name and His loved ones have been imprisoned in the land of Ta through that which the hands of the wicked have wrought - they who have followed their own desires and turned away from what God, the Lord of all worlds, hath desired. He testifieth to thy turning toward the Countenance and thy devotion to the Most Sublime Horizon, and thy rising to serve the Cause. By the life of God! Nothing existeth but that the hand of justice shall seize it and return it to nothingness, save this testimony which the Most Glorious Pen hath uttered before the face of the Lord of Names in this station which God hath made the point round which circle the Concourse on High. Verily thy Lord is He through Whom the ocean of bounty hath surged amongst the nations, and the fragrance of faithfulness hath wafted through the kingdom of creation, and the sun of grace hath shone forth from the horizon of the world. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers, then praise Him for this great favor. Verily He hath appeared with truth and caused thee to appear, and taught thee and made thee know, and guided thee to a path that all straight paths have circled round. And He hath sent unto thee one of the leaves among the leaves and a handmaiden among the handmaidens - this is of His favor unto thee and unto her. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. The servant beseecheth before the face of his Lord that He unite you both and send down upon you from the heaven of His grace a blessing from His presence and a mercy from His own Self, and draw you nigh unto Him in such wise that your names shall not be known save through His Name, nor your mention save through His mention. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all possibilities and the controls of all created things! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which, when it appeared, the earth quaked and the heaven was cleft asunder and the sun was darkened and the moon was eclipsed and the mountains moved, to bless us with the garment of reunion through Thy Name, the Holy, the Blessed, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Then ordain for us every good thing which the Supreme Pen hath sent down in the Qayyumu'l-Asma' and whatsoever lieth within Thy knowledge, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven! The tongue of my inner being and my outer self, and the tongues of my members and parts and features and elements, all testify that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Thou art He before the manifestations of Whose face's light every countenance hath prostrated, and before every one associated with Thee every sovereign hath bowed down, and around Whom all have circled. I beseech Thee by Thy Self, through Thy all-compelling and supreme Will, to ordain honor and glory for Thy loved ones, O Lord of the Kingdom of eternity! There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Send Thy blessings upon Thy loved ones and chosen ones who have been imprisoned for Thy Name and the manifestation of Thy Cause and the exaltation of Thy Word. Then send down upon them at all times the rain of Thy mercy and the outpourings which none hath known save Thy knowledge. O Lord! The Wronged One remembereth Thee through their tongues and on their behalf, and praiseth Thee for what hath befallen them in Thy path and Thy love - what befell Thy chosen ones of old who held fast to Thy Covenant and Thy Testament until they sacrificed their spirits for Thy Name. There is no God but Thee, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

In His Name, the One Who standeth over all things!

When the promise came and the appointed time was fulfilled, the Hidden One was made manifest through this Name which God had made the Dawning-Place of Revelation and the Day-Spring of inspiration unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. Among the people are those who cling to vain imaginings, turning away from the Self-Subsisting; and among them are those who are veiled by a name from among names, disbelieving in God, the Creator of heaven; and among them are those who hold fast to their desires, heedless of guidance; and among them are those who were attracted by the breezes of revelation in such wise that they turned with steadfast mountains and took the choice wine of life in the name of the All-Merciful, detached from all else, and drank and said: "This, verily, is what was intended in the Books of God, the Most High, the Most Great."

Say: O people! By God, this is He through Whom the fragrance of the All-Merciful was wafted and the Hidden Treasure was revealed. Fear God and be not of them that are veiled. Fear God and reject not the truth with what ye possess of books and vain imaginings, and follow not your desires. All matters have ended in the manifestation of God and His sovereignty. He, verily, summoneth you in truth unto His straight path. Seize ye the measure of the days of God and dispute not with My proof and My testimony, then with My grandeur and My signs. Be fair in the Cause of God and ponder on that which hath been sent down from His Most Exalted Pen. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.

Hasten with your hearts to the shore of grace and veil not yourselves with the veils of allusions. Break the idols of desire through the power of the Lord of Names and be not disturbed by those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the Kaaba of God and His Cause. Hold fast unto the cord of grace in this Day wherein the intoxication of passion hath seized all beings except such as have turned with a pure heart unto this glorious Prospect. Thus hath the tongue of the All-Merciful spoken in the midmost heart of Paradise as a token of His grace unto thee, that thou mayest be of them that know.

When thou hast succeeded in hearing what hath been sent down unto thee from the Kingdom of eternity, arise amidst all created things, then make mention of thy Lord with such utterance as will attract the hearts of them that advance. He, verily, aideth him who aideth Him, and remembereth him with that whereby his remembrance will endure through the eternity of His Name, the Protector over all worlds.

Say: O people! The All-Merciful is come and the proof hath appeared when heaven came with evident smoke. Fear God, O people, and follow not your own selves, neither follow your desires. Follow ye the religion of God - this is God's bidding from before and after. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Say: By God! The Cause hath appeared in such wise that no one hath any way to deny it, and whoso denieth hath indeed rejected God's decree from all eternity and is accounted among the polytheists in a mighty tablet.

Say: Verily, He Who hath appeared with His Most Great Name from the Supreme Horizon - He is the Glory of God unto all who are in the kingdom of names, and His sovereignty unto all who are in the realm of creation, and His proof unto all who are in the dominion of command and creation, and His enduring favor unto every fair-minded and insightful one.

When thou hast attained unto God's tablet, recite it with the most melodious of tunes. It will surely draw thee to the most exalted paradise. Thy Lord, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have taken for themselves a path unto God, the Forgiving, the Generous.

O Muhammad-Qabl-i-Kazim, upon whom be the glory of God, of Nasrabad! In the name of the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing! Praise be to God that through His boundless grace, mercy and loving-kindness, thou hast turned thy face to the Most Exalted Horizon and drunk from the hands of the Beloved of all possibility the living waters of immortality, and the tongue of the All-Merciful hath uttered: "Well is it with thee!" Know thou the worth of this most exalted station, this furthermost goal, this primal pearl, and guard this precious jewel from the eyes of the thieves and traitors, by the name of God, exalted be His glory. O Kazim, My friend, My servant! In the days when all souls were troubled and fearful of the might of the oppressors and the idolaters, and dwelt behind veils and clouds, this Wronged One arose to promote the Cause with utmost determination, power and majesty - an arising that no sitting could overtake - and with loudest call summoned the people of the Kingdom of Utterance to the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven. And when the world of possibility was illumined with the lights of the utterance of the All-Merciful, and the crimson standard was, through the grace of the Most Exalted Word, hoisted in the highest station, the veiled, concealed and fearful souls emerged from behind their veils and with a hundred thousand tricks and deceptions set about to lead astray the illumined and assured souls, turning to every land and region that perchance through fiery tablets and the book of hell they might bar those on the right hand from the living waters and draw them to the source of idle fancies and the dawning-place of vain imaginings. God willing, your honor must remain so steadfast that through its influence the people of that region, nay, of all regions and districts, may attain unto the supreme steadfastness. This is not difficult for thy Lord. Strive thou that in life thou mayest sacrifice thy precious soul for thy glorious Lord and in living attain the lofty station of martyrdom. Whosoever today hath caused his will and desire to be lost in the will and desire of God, exalted be His glory - that is, hath abandoned his own desire and held fast to that which God hath willed - hath in life and living attained unto the supreme martyrdom. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto this most exalted, most glorious and most sublime horizon. O Kazim! Rejoice thou in this most great gladness, for verily God, exalted be His glory, hath accepted thy mention and thy offering hath been accepted before the Wronged One. Give thanks unto God for this bounty which hath preceded thee and this mercy which hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. God willing, thou shalt be the cupbearer of the wine of mystic knowledge and shall revive and quicken the withered ones of that land and its people through the living waters of divine utterance, that all may not remain deprived of the ocean of knowledge. Would that they might become aware of the Most Great Luminary that hath shone forth from the horizon of the world! I swear by the Sun of divine knowledge that hath risen from the horizon of the prison, were they to become cognizant of but a trace of His countless favors, thou wouldst surely behold them all circling round. This is the Most Exalted Word that hath appeared from the Dawning-Place of knowledge of the Lord of Names. Blessed are they that hear! Blessed are they that understand! Blessed are they that act! Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!

And blessings be upon Him and upon His family and companions who held fast to the Book of God and strove in His path with true striving - they whom the All-Merciful hath described in the Furqan with His words "No fear shall be upon them, neither shall they grieve."

As to what you wrote regarding the friends and conveying the instructions - it is known that that spiritual beloved one hath been and remains firm, steadfast and established in service to the Cause.

This is the ultimate goal and the supreme pinnacle. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, not to deprive His creation and to adorn them with the ornament of justice and fairness. He is powerful and mighty over all things.

Peace be upon you and upon those with you, and the mercy of God and His blessings. End.

Your mention and greetings were conveyed to the two Most Great Stations. Special favor was shown towards that beloved one. Likewise the mention and greetings of the friends of God brought joy and delight. God willing, may they be assisted in that which God loveth and drink from the ocean of the Friend's good-pleasure.

He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!

Praise be to God Who fulfilled His promise and sent to His servant Javad what He had promised him, and sent down from the heaven of meanings to him who was named Muhammad-'Ali that which caused all things to soar and the hearts of the enemies to quake. O beloved of my heart! A most mighty and holy Tablet has been revealed from the holy heaven of Him Who is the Desired One and the Desire of the world, mentioning him who ascended unto God. In truth, one breath from the fragrances of each of its utterances has perfumed the world of knowledge and wisdom. Glorified be our Lord Who has made bounty His emblem and faithfulness His garment, and Who remembers His servants at all times with that which draws them near to the horizon of His Name, the All-Merciful. That which was revealed diffuses a wondrous fragrance and spreads the sweet-scented breeze of grace. Would that you had been present at the time of its revelation! Afterwards, the ascension of the brother of His honor 'Ali-Qabli-Haydar, upon them both be the glory and favor of God, was mentioned in the Most Holy Court. It is hoped that there will be revealed especially for them that which the differences of the world and its peoples cannot efface. The answers to other requests and petitions will also, God willing, be granted. The promise of a response has dawned and shone forth from the Dayspring of Will. Verily, He does not fail in His promise, though He has power over whatsoever He willeth and desireth. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon your honor and those with you, and upon the friends of God in that other land to which you intended to journey. We beseech God to protect you and grant you the good of this world and the next. There is no God but Him, the Lord of all creation.

O beloved of my heart! Among the special bounties that were revealed concerning the ascension of the destined sign was that on the day when, outwardly, news of the ascension was presented, at that very moment He commanded that the Branches of the Blessed Tree - may my spirit be a sacrifice for the dust of their footsteps - and all those around Him should hold a gathering and occupy themselves with mention of this new and blessed event. For two days, during which your honor was also present, by command of the Lord of the visible realm, this great and orderly gathering was manifested from the unseen into the visible world, and exalted words together with certain verses were read and recited before the faces of the loved ones. And in the afternoon of this day also, the Branches of the Blessed Tree and the people of the pavilion of grandeur and infallibility, together with the Afnan, have been and are being summoned to the Most Holy Court for the reading of the blessed pages which were revealed from the heaven of the Mother Book at dawn this day. It is hoped that the effects of the utterance of the Desired One of all worlds and the hidden mysteries therein will cause all to attain the Most Great Bounty and the Greatest Favor. Verily our Lord is the Hearer, the Answerer, and He is the Witness, the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thus has God strengthened His favor with a third from His presence. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. It would be beloved if a copy be sent with this letter to his honor Samandar, the fire of divine love, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory.

Thereafter, your repeated letters arrived. Praise be to God, from each one the fragrance of love was inhaled. After presenting them, it was revealed: "O Muhammad-'Ali! Be patient in times of hardship and silent before people. Make thy provision trust in God and thy deeds for God, and thy shield certitude in Him.

In truth, divine confirmation was and is from God, exalted be His glory. One thousand three hundred years have passed, and still the attraction of the First Word is manifest and visible in the world, such that every year they turn their faces from all regions with the intention of circumambulation. For God is their excellence, for God is their turning, for God is their orientation. Whosoever attaineth unto this Kawthar is mentioned as among those near unto God. In all conditions they must hold fast unto wisdom and be mindful thereof. This servant hath ever awaited news of that honored brother's health and still doth, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid that spiritual friend in all benevolent deeds. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings.

He is the Consoler, the Comforter, the Faithful Speaker

Praise be to God Who hath appeared through the kingdom of His utterance and revealed that which was treasured within His knowledge and hidden in the repository of His protection. He, verily, is the Truth, there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Powerful.

This is a Day wherein the Herald calleth out before the faces of all people and giveth them glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for them by the Most Exalted Pen in the Sacred Books and Tablets. He hath come for the life of the world and all that dwell therein. Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto the breezes of revelation in the days of God, the Lord of all mankind.

This is a Day wherein the Mother Book proclaimeth and guideth the people unto the horizon wherefrom hath shone forth the Luminary of God's utterance, the Lord of all men.

Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou seest Thy servant standing before the door of Thy bounty, uttering Thy praise and seeking to enter Thy presence. I beseech Thee by the all-encompassing power of Thy verses, the might of Thy Will and the sovereignty of Thy Purpose, to assist Thy loved ones in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Then enable them to render such service as shall cause its fragrance to be diffused throughout the world. O my Lord! Deprive them not of the outpourings of Thy days. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things past and future.

O thou who gazeth toward the horizon of God! We have desired to draw thee nigh through wings unsullied by the clay of idle fancies and vain imaginings, and through a will unhindered by the ranks of wickedness and indecency. Thy Lord, verily, is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

And We have desired at this time to make mention of My handmaiden and My leaf who hath soared on the wings of longing unto God, the Lord of the Day of Mutual Meeting. O Pen! Say: The first fragrance from the breezes of revelation and the first light that hath shone forth from the lights of the Countenance be upon thee, O handmaiden of God, and upon those who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn. We testify that she turned when the Call was raised and answered her Lord with the word "Yea." We testify that she attained unto My days, held fast to My loving-kindness, clung to the hem of My mercy, and spoke My praise amongst My handmaidens and My leaves. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon her at all times the fragrances of His Name, the All-Merciful. By the life of God! At the moment We desired to make mention of her, the ocean of forgiveness surged and the fragrance of God's garment, the Lord of all religions, was diffused. Thus did the Sun of Grace shine forth from the horizon of God's will, the Lord of the beginning and the end. Blessed is she and joy be unto her! She turned when most handmaidens turned away, and she acknowledged when the denizens of the realm of creation denied, save those whom God, He Who is established upon the throne of His Name, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful, willed.

O Muhammad-'Ali! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. When thou hast attained unto My Tablet and perceived the fragrance of My utterance and drunk from the ocean of My knowledge, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having given me to drink from the ocean of Thy bounty and guided me unto Thy mighty announcement and shown me Thy signs and caused me to hear Thy call. I beseech Thee to forgive Thy handmaiden who hath ascended unto Thee, then forgive those who have turned toward her resting place and visited her, by virtue of that which hath been sent down from Thy Most Sweet Tongue and Thy Most Exalted Pen. Verily Thou art the Lord of all mankind and the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.

O \[title\], upon whom be all the most glorious Glory of God! In the name of the Peerless Beloved! Praise be to God that thou hast steered the ship of high endeavor upon the sea of detachment and hast been blessed with divine outpourings and merciful bestowals. Thou art he through whom the victory of God's Cause was made manifest, inasmuch as thou didst not fall short in His service. To this testify all atoms, through what hath flowed from the Pen of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Wise. It is most clear and evident that the world hath neither fidelity nor permanence, nor shall it ever have. All shall return to nothingness save the righteous deeds that have appeared from holy souls in the Cause of the King of Oneness. I swear by the Most Great Luminary, whose light shineth resplendent in all worlds, that even in the material realm God, exalted be His mention, causeth every tongue to praise such souls. Look not upon the power of the enemies and the veiling of the people today. Though outwardly they appear strong, in truth they are the weakest of creatures. Soon shall they all turn with great remorse and supreme regret toward their Lord, the Most High, the All-Glorious. But they have been preceded by servants who have attained unto the days of God. Should God, exalted be His glory, forgive those souls, they would be under the shadow of the assured ones who are manifest today in His Name; otherwise thy Lord is indeed the All-Knowing. Thou must watch over God's Cause in all matters, but with utmost protection, concealment and wisdom. For whenever the sun of victory in God's Cause hath dawned from the dayspring of detachment of any soul, the envious have inevitably risen up with the fire of hatred. For every light there is fire. In all matters be mindful of wisdom and move with moderation. Remind the people, on behalf of the Dawning-Place of the Divine Word, of godly attributes and spiritual character, lest mischief appear from anyone that might cause the fire of the Cause to be extinguished among the people. Mischief hath never been and shall never be acceptable. All must walk among the righteous and the wicked with rectitude, steadfastness, dignity and composure, that the number of the righteous may increase and the wicked be called to the Chosen One. A goodly deed is in its essence a promoter of the Cause and a guide to the path of truth. Convey to the loved ones these hidden words which have shone forth from the Dayspring of the Divine Pen at this spiritual dawn, that all may be illumined by the lights of the Word and hold fast to divine counsels before their faces, lest they become heedless and remain veiled. Blessed art thou and those who are with thee and who hear what thou remindest them of through the remembrance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thou art he whom God hath related to Himself and singled out for the service of His Cause. By My life! Soon shall the tablet of creation be adorned with thy name for having turned with thy whole being to the countenance of the Intended One. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Convey My greetings to the faces of those who were with thee, whether female or male, young or old. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

Praise be to God alone, and blessings upon Him after Whom there shall be no Prophet. Praise be to God! The Light of Batha attracted many souls to the Name of God, glorified be His majesty, and enabled them to make pilgrimage to the House. The lovers from all regions, intoxicated by the blessed words "And a proclamation from God and His Messenger to all people on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage", turned with their whole being toward the direction of the Beloved. They attained the circumambulation of the House, visitation of the Stone, the running between Safa and Marwa, and the rites which whisper in the pure ear "Forget not the people of God." Praise be to Him, again praise be to Him, to the number of leaves and grains of sand, and to a number which cannot be counted by those who count. My spirit be a sacrifice for your honor. This evanescent servant attained the honor of seeing your noble handwriting, and whatever was written therein was presented before the Countenance. They said: "Today the manifest religion has been weakened by the assault of the polytheists and the heedlessness of its people. It is incumbent upon steadfast, firm, well-grounded and content souls who are detached from all save God and are gazing toward and turned to the Most Exalted Horizon to supplicate God, glorified be His majesty, in the nights and days for the protection of the manifest religion and to beseech the elevation of its station. Verily He originates and causes return, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy." Regarding what was written about Darvish Muhammad, permission has been granted. God willing, they may enter and after staying a few days return. And regarding what you wrote about the Prisoner (upon him be 9 66 \[Baha'u'llah\]), God willing may they be confirmed. Regarding what was written that they recite the Qur'an, I beseech God, glorified be His majesty, that all on earth may attain this most great bounty. Regarding what you wrote about Sa'id (upon him be 9 66 \[Baha'u'llah\]) and the request for a name for the newborn - may God bless - he has been named by the Beloved as Amanu'llah. Further, the two packets sent have arrived. God willing, it is hoped that an answer will be written later. O beloved of my heart! Work is abundant and time is short. The Command is in the hand of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Convey greetings and salutations to the beloved friend Nasir (upon him be 9 \[Baha\] the Most Merciful). God willing may he be confirmed and assisted. Today which is Thursday morning that honored one Aqa Muhammad-Ibrahim (upon him be 9 66 \[Baha'u'llah\]) was present before the Countenance especially mentioning Nasir. Happy is he! O apple of my heart's eye! Convey greetings and salutations to Husayn Effendi (upon him be 9 66 \[Baha'u'llah\]) and those with him. This servant intended to go to Arab Iraq, that is, to submit a petition in eloquent language to that Beloved. At one point it was observed that he had emerged from Persian Iraq. The Command belongs to God, the Ancient. This too was due to lack of time and extreme haste. If the petition submitted to that honored one, the name of whose bounty is upon him from all the Most Glorious Splendor, is observed, it will become clear to what degree work is pressing and how little time there is. Again the Command belongs to God, the One, the All-Choosing. The Servant. 16 Safar 1299.

O Habib-i-Ruhani, may Mr. Siyyid Farajullah - upon him be the peace and care of God - take note.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power

God is Most Great! The Hands of the Cause of God are occupied with divine commandments and prohibitions. In one station the decree of effacement is manifest, in another the decree of bestowal is resplendent. At times He separates, at times He unites. In the illumined, refined and truthful hearts and minds, from the hidden Pen is inscribed the blessed word "Love is for My sake." His love both enlivens and consumes - in both states it is a mercy. The world is enkindled by love and adorned by love. Glory be to God! The hearts of His loved ones are as one heart, their pillars like a single pillar. Once these exalted words were heard from the tongue of the Master: the loved ones of God are united as one hand, stand on one foot, and soar on one wing. In truth, this station is sanctified above description and utterance. Blessed are they who attain!

The letter of that spiritual friend arrived repeatedly, its reading brought joy, its fragrance refreshed the heart, its mention was a key to gladness and delight, for it was illumined with the light of the word of unity. After receiving, contemplating and reading it, We proceeded to the Sacred Spot where it was presented. He said: "O Farajullah! We beseech God to make thee a dawning-place of relief and to aid thee in that which is the cause and source of good deeds and praiseworthy character. Thank thy Lord that He hath aided thee to attain His presence and made thee among the successful ones. God willing, may enduring goodly traces remain from thee in that land for as long as the divine names and attributes endure. God is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. Neither the veils of the world nor the events of nations can prevent Him. He is the Generous One Whose glance of favor hath ever been and will ever be directed toward His loved ones. Nothing is hidden from His knowledge; verily He is the Knower of the unseen. O Farajullah! Upon thee be My peace.

The polytheists have surrounded the monotheists. Each day they scheme to seize some territory. All must supplicate the Self-Sufficient One with utmost humility and imploring, that they may perhaps find deliverance and become free and unfettered. But alas! alas! Hearts are divided and views discordant. They have attributed corruption to the Wronged One Who had no thought save the reformation of the world. In any case, I beseech God to aid the people of unity. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and worthy to answer prayer."

Praise be to God! A hundred thousand means came together to bring that spiritual friend near to the prison. God willing, may he be in all conditions a cause of unity, a source of accord, and a dawning-place of love and harmony. I convey greetings to the loved ones of that land and I beseech for each one glory, blessing, exaltation, care and bounty. Verily God is the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Peace, mercy and care be upon you and upon God's sincere servants. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds and Object of worship of all in the heavens and earth.

In the name of the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful! This is the Day whereon the Throne of thy Lord proclaimeth among the branches, calling out to all the dwellers of the earth and bidding them to glorify and sanctify their Lord. This is the Day whereon the angels of heaven descend at all times with chalices of utterance and vessels of knowledge, and return perfumed with holy and goodly fragrances. Say: The promised God declareth: O concourse of Jews! Ye were of Me and appeared from Me and unto Me shall ye return. What hath come over you that ye know Me not now, though I have appeared with all the signs? Ye have taken enemies for friends and have lost the True Friend. Today a new heaven hath appeared and a new earth hath been created. Were ye to look with pure eyes, ye would behold the New Jerusalem, and were ye to turn with hearing ears, ye would hear the Call of God. All things today call out to you and summon you to your Lord, yet ye are so drunk with the wine of pride that ye have not become aware of it for a moment. The ear is for hearing My voice and the eye for beholding My beauty. Hearken ye and shun all else. The Dome of God hath been raised by the hand of divine favor and the Cause of God hath been made manifest. The time of what was before hath passed away; a new time hath come; and all things have been renewed by the Will of God. But only a new eye perceiveth this and only a new mind comprehendeth this station. The beginning and the end pointed to one blessed Word, and it hath appeared and come, and it is the Spirit of the divine Books and Scriptures that hath been and will be forever, and it is the key to the Most Great Treasury of the Lord and the hidden divine mystery that hath ever been concealed behind the pavilion of infallibility. It is that Alif and that Ya of which John gave tidings: "He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden." O servant Hussein! God willing, mayest thou be confirmed and give glad-tidings to the branches of what was revealed aforetime in the Book of God, for these glad-tidings are as the water of life unto the dead of the world. Blessed is he who drinketh thereof; woe unto those who are deprived! Say: Today the City of God hath appeared in full adornment, and it is the City wherein the God of all hath been made manifest. Ponder these words of John who gave tidings of the holy and great City, until he said: "And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it," unto the end of his words. Take up the staff of trust in the Name of Truth and with complete detachment guide the misguided people to the divine Great City, that perchance those who are lost may attain to their true homeland and those who are blind may be blessed with new sight. Verily He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. All things are captive in the grasp of His might, and verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful.

O Haji Kazim, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the All-Knowing Expositor. Today the Book hath summoned all peoples to the Most Exalted Horizon, without veil or covering. This is that Most Great Book which in the Qur'an was mentioned as the Mother Book and the Mighty Announcement. For the Book there are meanings beyond counting, and likewise volumes beyond number. One volume thereof is the world itself, and the world itself is reckoned as a Book. It is that Book which encompasses all things and all regions of the world. One Book is inscribed by the Pen of Power and Creation, and one Book is written by the pen of the servants. "All things have We recorded in a clear Book." But this Book hath been revealed and sent down from the Supreme Pen, and the power of the Supreme Pen transcendeth all reckoning. It hath arisen before all faces with such an arising that no sitting could seize it, and neither ranks nor multitudes nor severity nor wrath could hold it back from its mighty, prevailing purpose. And one Book is \[mentioned\] in the Crimson Scroll, and it is specifically concerned with the mention of the gems of existence - they who regard the world as one country and who move amongst all with spirit and fragrance. The armor of these souls hath ever been and shall ever be the fear of God. They are adorned with the ornament of trustworthiness and are characterized by truthfulness, purity and fidelity. They possess praiseworthy qualities and perform commendable deeds. They render assistance, but through the hosts of virtuous character and proper conduct. The world is under the control of the All-Wise Physician. He hath ordained and continueth to ordain whatsoever is conducive to the welfare of His servants and the requirements of the age. None can comprehend anything of His knowledge save what He willeth. His throne embraceth the heavens and the earth. The mention of "earth" that hath been revealed in the Book encompasseth all lands. With Him is the knowledge of all things in a Clear Book. Should anyone ascend by the steps of exposition unto the heaven of inner meanings, he would testify to this exalted Word which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the Supreme Pen, namely: "No fresh or withered thing is there but it is noted in His perspicuous Book" - how much more so with a Book that is manifest and evident! The meaning of "fresh and withered" in one instance referreth to the divine commandments and prohibitions, and in another instance to that which profiteth or harmeth them in this earthly life. A brief mention hath been made and a mere allusion given, else numerous volumes would need to appear from the treasury of the Supreme Pen. We send greetings to the brethren of the earth and say: Today no fresh or withered thing can profit, nor can any question and answer. All must hold fast to this Most Great Verse which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful's utterance, and act in accordance with it: "This is not the day for tarrying and questioning. It behooveth every soul, when he heareth the Call from the Most Exalted Horizon, to arise and say: 'Here am I, O Lord of the worlds! Here am I, O Thou Who art the Goal of all that are in the heavens and on earth!'" Truth, like unto the sun, is distinguished from all else besides it. Blessed is the ear that hath attained to hearing the Call and the eye that hath beheld the Horizon of God's Manifestation, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. At the end of this utterance, verily the Wronged One remembereth His loved ones and remindeth them of the verses of God, the Lord of the kingdom of earth and heaven.

O My brother and My loved one! Hearken unto the call of Him Who hath loved thee and maketh mention of thee for the sake of God, that thou mayest stand firm in a Cause which hath been recorded in all the Tablets by God's will, and which no veils of contingent beings can obstruct, nor can the opposition of created things impede it, even should they arise against it with swords of steel. Thou knowest what hath befallen Me at the hands of him whom I protected from the harm of creatures, whom I assisted at all times, and whom I taught by night and by day that he might aid the Cause of God and be God-fearing in His religion. Yet when the sun of certitude dawned upon his back, he shed his skin like a serpent, and the first thing he decreed was to shed My blood without any proof or illuminating Book. By God, O beloved one, I am not among those who have calumniated the servants, and God is My witness to what I say. Ponder thou his deeds and what proceeded from him, then ponder My deeds and what proceeded from Me. Then shall the sun of certitude shine upon thee and thou shalt be established in that which thy Lord desireth. Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the holy precincts, a station which God hath raised above the knowledge of the worlds. Follow thou the religion of God and His Faith in this Cause which hath appeared and shone forth from the horizon of the Spirit from the presence of One mighty and powerful. Hear the words of thy brother and arise to serve the Cause in these days wherein all who are in the heavens and earth were shaken, and the dwellers of the realms of Command and creation were terrified, and all the kindreds of the earth lamented, save only a number of the letters of Our most beautiful Names, who at that time were rejoicing in the highest paradise by thy Lord the All-Merciful's leave, and thus was the matter decreed by God. Rend asunder the veils, then emerge from behind the clouds with resplendent lights. Arise to serve the Cause and detach thyself from all who are in the heavens and earth. Then adorn thy tongue with utterance in remembrance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. This is better for thee than all that is on earth. Grieve not over the world and what hath befallen thee of adversity, but place thy trust in all matters in God, the Most High, the Most Exalted. He will protect thee from whatsoever displeaseth thee, and He is the Observer of all things. By God, O My brother, there hath come upon Me from the malevolent ones arrow after arrow, spear after spear, lance after lance, and sword after sword, whereat the eye of Ali in the Supreme Companion weepeth for Me, and then the eyes of the Messengers in a most holy and exalted station. Were I to detail for thee what hath befallen Me, thou wouldst detach thyself from all things. We have therefore veiled it to protect thee, and have mentioned only what was destined. Know then that thy letter reached Me and I understood its contents. We beseech God to assist thee and Us in His Cause and to unite Us and thee in a station that was praised in truth. And glory be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God and were steadfast in the straight path.

Beware lest thou grieve on account of thy mother, for she, in truth, hath been uplifted to a seat of transcendent holiness in the realms above and gained admittance into the chambers of Paradise, from whose horizon the lights are shining.

Happy is she, for she hath quaffed from the chalice of sanctity and visited the beauty of God in the paradise of inviolable splendor.

O Dervish! Hearken unto the call of this Dervish, that perchance the breezes of love wafting from the direction of the Beloved of all worlds may stir thee, may detach thee from all else save Him, may establish thee in His love, and cause thee to speak His praise amidst His heedless servants. Blessed art thou for having attained the presence of the Face in these latter days wherein the Sun of the horizons hath set from the horizon of Iraq and hath dawned from another horizon, as ordained in the preserved Tablets of glory.

Remember thou My days and what thou hast heard of the tales of the Youth. By God! The hearts of those near unto God are consumed by His tales. Say: O people! I am verily the Youth of God amongst you, His servant amidst you, and His mercy unto all created things. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves thereof, for whoso depriveth himself is in manifest loss.

When thou enterest the gathering of lovers, remember then the burning of the Youth's heart. When thou seest one who is joyful, remind him of My great sorrow. When thou findest one imprisoned, recall My imprisonment and tribulation. When thou beholdest a stranger, reflect upon My exile in this land wherefrom the feet of the unity-professing ones are severed.

O servant! By God, My suffering hath reached such a state that I cannot recount it, and there hath befallen Me that which none can reckon. Yet know thou that I complain not of what hath befallen Me, but rather give thanks unto God, the Beloved of the mystics. Would that all the tribulations of the first and the last might descend upon Me! By God, through His love I shall not be dismayed by anything, though the swords of the oppressors, the spears of the polytheists, and the arrows of the falsifiers rain down upon Me. Would that I had a thousand souls in every moment that I might sacrifice them in His path, even as He sacrificed in My path, if thou be of those who know.

Say: He spoke naught but My remembrance and praise, and I speak naught but His praise. He testified unto My Self, and I testify unto His Self, the Inaccessible, the Mighty. All that befalleth Me in His path is beloved of My heart - and God is witness unto what I say - and all that befalleth Him in My path was beloved of His Being, yet the people of the Bayan are in grievous heedlessness.

Say: By God, I have sacrificed My head in His path and await in every moment what is ordained in the preserved Tablet. Say: He is now living in this Most Holy and Mighty Horizon, and He saith: "O people of the Bayan! Have mercy upon your Lord, the All-Merciful, and oppose Him not after He hath come unto you with the verses of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise." Say: O people! Be fair within yourselves and deny not Him through Whom the Cause of God hath become renowned amongst all created things.

O people! Ye were behind the veils, fearful for yourselves. But when the Youth appeared, He rent asunder your veils and your faces were illumined amongst the worlds. Fear ye God and deny not this precious and wondrous blessing.

Say: He desireth naught for Himself, but rather desireth to draw you nigh unto God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Thus warbleth the Dove upon the twigs of the holy and lofty Paradise. And upon thee be the Spirit, and upon God's sincere servants.

In the Name of Him at Whose bidding the Nightingale warbles in the Realm of Eternity that there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the All-Wise!

O Tongue of Eternity! Make mention of him who emigrated unto God until he entered the Spot of Immortality, the seat from whose horizon the Sun of Glory shone forth with manifest and brilliant rays, and entered God's precinct where the glances of holy radiance were turned unto him, and tasted the sweetness of remembrance from this Remembrance, Who, were the veil to be lifted from His face, would cause all who are in the heavens and on earth to swoon away, except such as have detached themselves from all created things.

O servant! By God the Truth, this is the Day whereon everyone possessed of sight must behold, and everyone possessed of hearing must hear, and everyone possessed of heart must understand, and everyone possessed of tongue must cry out between earth and heaven by this most holy and exalted Name. Thus does the Tongue of Holiness speak forth now in the realm of mighty glory. By God the Truth, this is the Day of them that are detached, and the Day of them that are unified, and the Day whereon God createth by His hands of power essences of oneness and realities of eternality, each one of which casteth the world and all that is therein behind its back and standeth firm in God's Cause in such wise as to astonish every person of understanding.

O servant! Hear what issueth from the mouths of those who have disbelieved in God after having believed in Him. By God, they speak as spoke the divines of the Qur'an at the time when 'Ali came upon the clouds of My Name that encompasseth the worlds. O servant, forget not My remembrance, nor the days when thou wert in the presence of My countenance. Remember then My grief and tribulation, that God may raise up one who will help the Youth. Thus hath the Pen of Eternity taught thee, that thou mayest arise to serve His Cause with mighty detachment.

Stand firm in such wise that should all the Manifestations of Our most beauteous Names descend and seek to turn thee from that whereon thou standest in thy Lord's Cause, thou wouldst not turn unto them nor unto what they possess, by My sovereignty that hath dawned from the horizon of holiness with wondrous lights. Know thou that whatsoever thou hast heard regarding this Cause hath, by God, appeared from the direction of My command, and none hath been apprised thereof save God - of this thou art well aware. When We raised up the Cause, they who served Me and circled round Me morning and evening arose to slay Me. Thus mayest thou know the state of these souls and those who followed them and took them as lords for themselves instead of God. By God, they and their idols are in the fire, and naught shall protect them from thy Lord's torment save that they repent and return unto God Who created them by His command. Verily, He hath ever been All-Forgiving, All-Merciful.

Rejoice, O servant, within thyself that God hath accepted thee for love of Himself and honored thee with His presence and inscribed thy name upon tablets which lie before the Throne, sealed with the seal of preservation by the fingers of power, in truth and by the truth. Glory be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and upon them that remember their Lord and are detached from those who know not their right hand from their left and who follow every froward devil.

In the name of God, the Most High, His station is majesty and power!

O my God, my Lord, my Master, my Beloved, my Heart's Desire! Every time I intended to make mention of Thee, such perspiration of shame encompassed me that I found myself bewildered and dumbfounded. How can a tongue of rebellion be capable of mentioning that station where pure sanctification itself is counted among the sinners? And how can a heedless heart be worthy of comprehending that Lord of all who is desired, before whom the very essence of comprehension has testified and continues to testify to its own inadequacy? Neither is the outward eye worthy to behold, nor the outward ear capable of hearing that call whose sweetness has attracted the kingdoms of earth and heaven.

O my Lord and my Master! Despite this confession and this impotence, the ocean of rebellion has turned to Thee and beseeches from Thee Thine ancient favor. Whatever exists has its relation to Thee and is reckoned as Thy creation. By the breeze of Thy grace, quicken the dead and by the fragrance of Thy garment, grant him attainment. O Thou Who art the Object of worship of the world and the Beloved of all nations! Pure darkness seeks light, and absolute heedlessness has turned to the ocean of knowledge, and the utterly thirsty one seeks the living waters of recognition. This one who is completely asleep has intended the city of wakefulness. Is there any sovereign besides Thee from whom he may seek what he desires? Nay, by Thy Self! Thou art the One Who exists, Who encompasses all, Who protects, Who is powerful and mighty. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me in what I desire from the wonders of Thy bounty and grace. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. O Lord! Send down upon Thy loved ones that which befits Thy bounty and favor, and assist them in Thy remembrance and praise and in what Thou hast revealed in Thy mighty Book. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

The letter of that honored friend transformed the darkness of grief and sorrow into the light of joy and gladness. This is from God's favor upon us and upon you. His mercy has preceded and His grace has encompassed all. After it was presented, He said: "O Lutfu'llah! Thy mention hath been and is before the Wronged One. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, not to deprive thee of His infinite bounties and to rain upon thee from the clouds of His grace - a rain whose mention shall never be erased from the book of the world. Verily He is the One Who has power over whatsoever He willeth. He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the Hearing, the Answering." Peace be upon thee and upon those with thee.

Praise be to God that you are mentioned and have been and are present before His face. The favor of the Lord toward you has been and is more evident than the sun. We beseech God not to withdraw the bounty of His favor and not to withhold whatever exists in the world, for all is transient and all bear witness to this truth. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, for His favor which is everlasting and abiding. Verily He has power over all things. Peace be upon you and upon your family and upon your daughter and upon God's righteous male and female servants.

O Mulla 'Abdu'r-Rahim!

In the Name of our Lord, the Everlasting, the Eternal, the All-Encompassing! Blessed be He in Whose hands is the Kingdom of the heavens and earth. His are the most beautiful names and the most exalted attributes. He giveth to whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He pleaseth. None can gainsay His firm and mighty command. Were He to desire to adorn all things with the ornament of names, He would be able to do so through His sovereignty which hath encompassed all created things from the first to the last. And were He to desire to strip from them all names, He would be powerful to do so, and none may say "why" or "wherefore." Whoso sayeth this hath disbelieved in God and His signs and is accounted among the idolaters.

Say: Every first name hath been established through the mention of the Inaccessible, the Sublime, and every last name is raised up through His Word, if ye be of those who perceive. Say: The manifestations of primacy are created in His dominion and the manifestations of inwardness are owned by His Presence. He is in truth the Possessor Who doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. Beware lest ye be veiled by names from their Originator and Creator. He hath created them even as He created all things, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing.

Every name that boweth down today before His face is among the greatest and first of names, were ye of those who know. And were it to hesitate in His Cause for less than a moment, it would become among the lowest. This is what hath been sent down in truth in the Tablets of your Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Beware, O people, lest ye look to names, but rather to that whereby they subsist. Thus were ye commanded before and now, lest ye be among the heedless.

Whoso turneth to names because of their connection to God, he is indeed among the unitarians. And whoso fixeth upon them in themselves and for themselves, he is among the worshippers of names and is accounted among the idolaters. Say: O people! Leave what ye possess, then take what is with God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers. He desireth for you naught save what draweth you nigh unto Himself and His presence, and purifieth you from the hints of the opposers who seek to prove their cause through what We revealed before, yet have denied My Self, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

Say: I am but a servant of God and the son of His maidservant. He hath sent Me with the truth to remind you of what ye have forgotten of the wondrous remembrance of His new creation. I speak not of Mine own self, but rather through what the Spirit uttereth within My breast, and God is witness to what I say. Say: O people! Would ye slay him whom the winds of your Lord's Will, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, have seized and move as they please by His command? Fear God and be not among the corrupt. He hath sent him to you to make you united in His Cause and brethren upon facing thrones. Be united, O people, then make peace among yourselves. This is what God desireth for you, if ye be of those who act.

Say: He loveth not discord but desireth harmony among you. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of what your Lord, the Mighty, the Great, hath desired for you. Hearken, O people, unto what the tongue of counsel hath spoken, and be not among the transgressors. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon God's unified servants. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

To the son of Haji Mirza Musa who has ascended to the Supreme Companion - We have revealed this for Abu-Talib that he may seek through it what God has ordained for him and be mighty in assistance. He is God, the Doer of whatsoever He willeth. The Beauty of God behind the clouds hath been witnessed from the holy horizon through grace. And verily the clouds are wisdom whereby God manifesteth His Cause among His creatures - were He to lift them, all who are in the heavens and earth would be terrified and every lofty and impregnable mountain would crumble. There is nothing but that its treasuries are in the heaven of destiny, and We send them down only in accordance with a measured decree. O Pen of Command! Make mention of the servant of God who is named Abu-Talib, that he may rejoice in his soul that his name hath flowed from thee and been mentioned before the Throne. O servant! We sent thee aforetime a Tablet that cannot be equaled by all that is on earth, and after it We sent this Tablet whereby are attracted the hearts of those who have drawn nigh and been purified from earthly allusions through the hidden mystery. O servant! Purify thy heart from aught else but Me, then read what hath been revealed unto thee, that it may preserve thee from sorrows in this time when the heaven hath come with manifest smoke. Guard thyself through My Name the Preserver lest the darts of Satan strike thee and make thee far removed from the seat of nearness. Take comfort in My remembrance and abandon all else - this is better in thy Lord's sight than all that hath been created on earth. Thus hath the matter been decreed from One All-Knowing, All-Wise. Illumine thy heart with My love and thy tongue with My remembrance and the remembrance of My tribulations, for by My Self, wert thou to become aware of them thou wouldst weep for months and years. Behold then, O servant, how grieved is the Master Who takes a servant and nurtures him with mighty hands of glory, and teaches him what He willeth, and preserves him from hardship and distress, and keeps him safe from all calamities in the protective sanctuary, and mentions him among the servants, and raises his name in the Concourse of Names to a station where all, young and old, make mention of him. Yet when he witnessed the matter thus and became assured in himself, he emerged from behind the veil and denied his Lord and rejected what He had bestowed upon him through His grace, until he arose to slay Him, then cried out among those whom the foolish of the earth had recognized, saying "I have left these people while wronged" - that he might cause doubt to enter the hearts of the believers and cause the rancor of the youth to enter the breasts of his followers. And God is witness to that. By God! He did this only because he knew the people to be worthless rabble, else how could he deny this grace which was more manifest than the light of the sun in the midst of heaven? By God! None would deny it save every ignorant blind one. Such was My Cause - ponder this in thyself that thou mayest become aware of it and be among the servants with insight into what befell this Wronged One Who was cast into the pit. Whereupon grief seized My heart and My pen, and it would not flow as desired, therefore We complete the Tablet. Be content with what hath been sent down unto thee from an exalted and uplifted heaven.

In the Name of the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing! All servants have been created for the knowledge of God, and those who have today turned towards the Most Holy Court and the Most Great Name are commanded to teach the Cause of God. Among the conditions for teaching set forth in the Book of God is wisdom; therefore one must speak to each soul according to their capacity, so that through the hands of training of the true physicians they may attain the station of maturity. Blessed art thou for having succeeded in teaching the Cause of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Again, blessed art thou for having spoken in praise of thy Lord and borne hardships in the path of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We were with thee when thou didst speak from this noble station. Be thou assured of God's grace; verily He sufficeth thee in truth. He is the Protector of those who remember Him.

We make mention of thy father. We testify that he ascended unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. At the time of his ascension the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Cities of Names welcomed him. How glorious is this mighty, exalted station! Blessed is he who draweth nigh unto him and visiteth him after his passing, saying: "Glory be upon thee, O thou through whom the horizon of faith was illumined and through whom those near unto God turned towards the Lord of all that was and shall be. I testify that thou didst drink the choice wine of life in the days of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, that thou didst teach His Cause and speak His praise, the Mighty, the Beloved. Thou art he whom neither the idle fancies of the divines, nor the power of rulers, nor the clamor of those who turned away from this praiseworthy station could deter." Draw thou nigh unto his grave and be thou the first to visit him. Then recite what hath been revealed in this hidden Tablet. We have mentioned him in numerous Tablets. Verily thy Lord is the Helper, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Loving.

Convey the greetings of this Wronged One to all the friends in that land, that all may be gladdened by the sweet savors of the favors of the Dayspring of Divine verses. Say: Today it behooveth everyone to fix their gaze upon the horizon of the Cause and that which appeareth from His presence, and to occupy themselves with the refinement of their own souls, that all may be adorned with the ornament of trustworthiness, religiosity, truthfulness, purity, goodly deeds and whatsoever God hath revealed in the Book. Certain heedless souls have attributed themselves to the Truth and have become the cause of dissipating the Cause of God, having abandoned what is known and called people to that which is rejected. Say: O friends! Today pure words and sincere deeds are beloved, for aught else shall not ascend to the heaven of acceptance and hath been and shall ever be rejected. Say: O loved ones of God! Shun ye those who claim faith and attribute themselves to God while committing that which causeth all things to lament and the limbs of all names to tremble. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Under all conditions your honor must be vigilant over the Cause of God, lest the pure in heart be deprived of the straight path through the deception of some. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the wine of steadfastness. He is indeed among the most exalted of creation before the Truth, as attested by My Most Exalted Pen in this Clear Tablet. And the Glory rest upon thee and upon My loved ones in that place who have stood firm in this wondrous Cause.

At the well, His honor Mulla Ali Akbar, my brother, has attained. In the name of the one God! His honor Ahmad has attained and his deed is accepted before God. The entire world cannot equal the testimony that has flowed from the Most Exalted Pen in this Tablet. God willing, may he be assisted to accomplish that which befits the Days of God and preserve this most exalted station through the Name of the Lord of humanity. O Ali before Akbar! Divine grace and favor have been with you, and whatsoever befell you in His path has been recorded and established by the Pen of Command in the Book of Names. That which the Tongue of Grandeur hath mentioned befell you in the path of Truth. Be not grieved, but engage in the remembrance of God with the utmost joy and fragrance, for whatsoever befell you was for God and in the path of God. What station is greater than this and what matter more glorious and excellent? Nay, by His very Self, the True One! For souls that are turned to Him and are steadfast there are stations that pen, tongue and utterance are powerless to describe. Two letters from you have returned to the Book, two birds have winged their flight to the most exalted nest, and two souls have turned toward the Most Glorious Homeland. By the life of God! They both gaze from the Supreme Horizon and hear what the Tongue of Bounty hath spoken at this moment. Were anyone to behold their station, they would swoon away. Rejoice thou in this mighty favor. We make mention in this station of thy brother who was named Muhammad-'Ali and who ascended unto God. We testify that he turned toward the Supreme Horizon and answered his Lord, the Lord of Names, when He called out from the Kingdom of Utterance: "There is none other God but Me, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting." We were with him at the time of his ascension, and a company of near-angelic beings received him. Glory be upon him and upon those who make mention of him through what My Pen hath spoken in this exalted station. Grieve not over anything. Verily thy Lord is with thee. He hath assisted thee to turn unto Him and taught thee what had escaped the champions among men. Thy Lord is indeed gracious to His loved ones, but most of the people are heedless. Praise be to God! Thou hast attained unto a mighty favor, for God's mercy and His grace have encompassed thee, and the evidences thereof shine forth like suns from the horizons of His Tablets. Grieve not for the two letters - they were two letters from the Book of Divine Love and have returned to the Mother Book. Reflect upon this bounty, that while the divines of the age, despite having awaited the appearance of Truth throughout centuries and ages, remained deprived behind the veils of idle fancies and were shut out from the ocean of generosity when the dawn of the Day of God appeared and the world was illumined by the lights of the Sun of Truth, your children attained to a station mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen, despite them and despite those who disbelieved in what they were promised in every Book, every Scripture, every Psalm and every mighty Tablet. We have mentioned thee before and at this time, and those who are with thee, and those who have heard and answered their wronged, estranged Lord.

Praise be to God that you have traversed the expansive plain of eloquence, ascended to the heavens of rhetoric, drunk from the wine of utterance at the dawn of certitude, attained the lofty stations of exposition which is the ultimate station of language, and brought forth in their completeness the pearls of speech from the shell of possibility. It seems you have gained knowledge of the comprehensive words and the perfect word as they truly are. Well done to you, again well done to you! Yes, the manifestations of action in the world of existence appear through divine destiny and arrangement, but destiny and arrangement do not become the cause of deficiency such that an argument would arise or a flaw would find its way. If you become aware of this subtle point, you will gain knowledge of all the stations of the worlds of destiny, of which the world of compulsion and free will is but a letter. Rules and customs are of the characteristics of the world of creation, while the world of command is sanctified and exalted above all such limitations. Therefore one must lift one's foot from the realm of nothingness and step into the realm of eternity, so that we may raise the banner of being in the heaven of non-being and comprehend the meaning of "All things perish save His face," and pass beyond the earthly homeland to return to the original divine homeland, of which "Verily we are God's and to Him we return" is indicative. O my beloved! After ascending to the heavens of inner meanings, the wayfarers attain to three stations, meaning that the manifest Sun shines and becomes revealed in the mirrors of existing things according to these three ranks, although some consider the ranks of determinations to be five and have named them the five presences. Were I to explain in detail, a book would not suffice and I would not be able to fulfill it, just as that divine mystic and knower of divine mysteries, the lordly Imam, mentioned a drop from these stations in defining the world of the heart, which has surely come to your noble attention - that the final rank of these three stations is the journey from God unto God. In this station and rank, existence is effaced from self and subsists through the Truth. All are from God and unto God shall they return, and "Say: All things are from God" is sufficient witness and adequate proof of this point, as the mystic of Rum has said:

His attributes are annihilated in the attributes of Him

While His essence remains through the survival of His essence

This station certainly has no rules and seeks no customs, meaning all His deeds are pure justice even if outwardly they appear as injustice, and pure knowledge even if in form they appear as ignorance. This station needs no explanation - it is manifest and evident. God willing, may we drink of the peerless wine of the Eternal Presence and be sustained by the effulgences of the beauty of the Countenance of the All-Glorious, that we may enter the Egypt of immortality and attain to the honor of the divine presence, so that we may comprehend all meanings without veil or covering. And peace be upon you.

Hasan Khan-i-Kirmani - He is the Hearer, He is the Answerer

Praise be to the Lord of the kingdom of earth and heaven, Who through His Most Exalted Word drew the hearts of the people of Baha to the Most Glorious Horizon. His Cause is unalterable and His decree is firm. Blessed are they who have drunk from the cups of the love of God and have held fast to the cord of His favor. These are the companions of the Crimson Ark mentioned and inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Qayyumu'l-Asma'. Well is it with them and with those who love them and who perceive from them the fragrance of the providence of God, the Lord of the worlds.

O Hasan! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of the seen and unseen. Thy letter was delivered to Our presence through Husayn, upon whom be My Glory and favor, by means of the Most Great Branch, and was heard by Us. Blessed be thy tongue which God hath strengthened to mention and praise Him, and thy heart which hath been illumined by the light of recognition. The Most Great Branch recited what thou hadst composed in praise and remembrance of God. This is from God's grace and mercy upon thee. Be grateful and say:

Praise be to Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the visible and invisible, for having enabled me to turn to Thy Most Exalted Horizon and guided me to Thy Most Glorious Path, and made known to me Thy Great Announcement and Thy Most Great Name which overshadoweth all who are in the heavens and on earth. I beseech Thee by Thy generosity which hath encompassed all things, and by Thy Command whereby the Trump was sounded and those in the graves were raised, to make me steadfast in Thee and in Thy signs, and to cause me to cling to the hem of Thy mercy and bounty. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee. I implore Thee to open before my face the doors of Thy grace, favor and blessing. Thou art He Whose power hath been acknowledged by the tongues of all created things and Whose sovereignty hath been confessed by all existing things. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Today the ocean of favor is surging and the sun of grace is shining and the light of bounty is radiant. We beseech God to confirm thee in steadfastness in this Most Great Cause and Momentous Announcement. Say: O servants! Today the Sovereign of Revelation is seated upon the throne of 'He doeth what He willeth.' Deprive not yourselves of this most exalted station and most sublime summit. Today the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise and the Supreme Heaven are gazing upon you, and from each one appeareth mention of good or a righteous deed. All speak the words "Blessed be God, the Lord of the Throne" and show forth love. O Hasan! Give thanks unto God for having turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison and mentioned thee with verses whereby the hearts of those near unto God and the sincere ones were attracted. Today every word that proceedeth from the mouth of the Divine Will is immortalized by the command of the Lord of Names in the Crimson Tablet. Its fragrances endure and its perfume is diffused. Blessed is he who hath perceived it and hath said: "Praise be to Thee, O Lord of all mankind and King of Glory, O Thou the Goal of the hearts of them that know!" The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon those who have not broken My Covenant and My Testament, and who have said before all faces "God is our Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne and the Master of the Day of Judgment."

O Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Taqi, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the One Who warbleth upon the loftiest branches.

Praise be unto Him Who is sanctified above the mention and description of all the peoples of the world, the Lord of all nations, Who befitteth and deserveth that through His absolute Will and pervading Purpose He hath taken possession of all hearts and souls and guided them to the supreme horizon. Neither the opposition of the world's rulers nor the ascendancy and oppression of the divines of the nations could hold Him back from His all-conquering and compelling Purpose. Glorified be His majesty, exalted be His dominion, and all-encompassing be His signs. There is no God but Him.

This is a Book which the Lord of all beings hath sent down unto one of His loved ones that He may draw him nigh unto the Most Glorious Horizon and illumine him with the light of the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds. O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! We have remembered thee before and at this time, and have revealed for thee that which hath caused the hearts of them that are nigh to soar. Say: This is the Day wherein God walketh and speaketh, did ye but know it, and this is the Mother Book calling out in the most exalted voice from the horizon of the heaven of the prison of Akka, yet ye perceive it not. Arise to serve Me through My command, then speak forth that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken amongst My servants and say: O concourse of men! By God, the Lord of destiny hath come and every hidden matter hath been revealed. Cast away what ye possess and take hold of that which ye have been commanded by God, the Ordainer, the All-Wise. Beware lest the veils of the world or the doubts of those who have denied God's proof and evidence and have disputed His signs which have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth withhold you. Say: Fear God and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who hath come to you with a sovereignty that hath encompassed the world and with a power that hath encompassed all existence, of the former and latter generations.

O Mirza, before Ta and Qaf! The Lord of the world hath turned toward thee from the direction of His Most Great Prison and hath sent down for thee that which hath caused the ocean of knowledge to surge before the faces of the world. Blessed is he who hath cast the world behind him and hath held fast unto the cord of God, the Holy, the Mighty, the Sure. By God! The rivers have flowed, the trees have yielded their fruit, the branches have swayed, and the boughs have stretched forth - a bounty from God, the Mighty, the Great. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken, as a grace from Him unto thee and unto those who have arisen and said: "God is our Lord and the Lord of the angels who are nigh."

When thou dost inhale the fragrance of My utterance and hear My call, say: "My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me unto the horizon of Thy Manifestation and illumined me with the lights of Thy Name, the All-Forgiving. I beseech Thee by Thy most sweet call and by that which was hidden in Thy knowledge, O Lord of the Kingdom of Names, to rain down upon me from the clouds of Thy mercy the rains of Thy utterance and bounty. Then open before my face the door of Thy generosity and favor, and aid me, O my God, to serve Thee amongst Thy creation, and assist me with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Verily Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through Thy manifest sovereignty. There is no God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Subduing, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful."

That which thou didst send hath been presented before the Throne and hath been honored with the ornament of acceptance. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid thee in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to exalt thee through His Name amongst all beings. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Giving, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

O Mirza Asadu'llah, son of him who hath ascended to the Supreme Companion! He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!

A mention from Us unto him who hath attained to the recognition of God when every ignorant and remote one turned away from Him, that he may rejoice in His remembrance and speak forth His praise in such wise as to attract the hearts of them that have known God. O Asad! He Who is the One, the Single, maketh mention of thee from this Spot which God hath made the point round which circle the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Cities of Names, and then they who circle round the Throne in the name of their Lord, the Mighty, the Trusted One.

Blessed is thy father, concerning whom the Supreme Pen was moved to make mention both before his ascension and after his elevation to a station wherein he beheld the world beneath his shadow. Verily thy Lord is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed. We have mentioned him in such wise as would cause the near ones to invoke blessings upon him at morn and eventide. Grieve not at what hath befallen thee. Verily thy Lord maketh mention of thee in such wise as would gladden every hearing and perceiving one. We make mention of him in this Spot that God's chosen ones and His loved ones who have turned unto God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great, may remember him thereby.

O Muhsin! I bear witness that thou didst hear the Call when it was raised betwixt earth and heaven, and didst answer thy Lord, the Manifest, the All-Knowing. Blessed art thou for having quaffed the Wine of Life from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, and for having attained unto the most great steadfastness when feet did slip and every lofty mountain was scattered to dust. Thou art he whom neither the clamor of the divines held back from the Creator of heaven nor the assault of the oppressors from this Great Announcement. We bear witness that thou didst rend asunder the veils when the All-Bestower came riding upon the clouds, and didst acknowledge that which the Tongue of Grandeur did utter: "There is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the Powerful." Thou art he from whom they that have known God have inhaled the fragrance of steadfastness in this Cause at whose appearance all things proclaimed: "By God! That hath appeared from which all who are in the earth have fled in terror, save those whom God hath willed, the Lord of this wondrous Day." Thus hath the Lord of all mankind made mention of thee that the servants who have believed in God, the Lord of the worlds, may visit thee thereby.

O Asad! Divine favor toward him is manifest and evident from wondrous and sublime verses, and the testimony that hath proceeded from the Supreme Pen concerning him is, in the sight of God, greater than all the treasures of the earth. Verily He seeth and witnesseth and speaketh. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Mentioning, the All-Knowing. Though for some days in this world he bore afflictions, trials and the like, this was in accordance with God's conclusive wisdom. I swear by the Sun of utterance that such bounty hath been vouchsafed unto him as the pens of the world and its scribes are powerless to describe. If thou shouldst perceive these words, which are more delicate than the fragrance of a garment, with an attentive ear, thou wouldst attain unto the most great joy and wouldst cry out in all nights and days "Thine be the praise, O God of the worlds!" God willing, thou shalt drink of the choice sealed wine in the name of the Self-Subsisting - and that wine is steadfastness, for the treacherous ones and the satans are engaged with the utmost effort and striving in leading souls astray. Ask thou God to protect thee and His servants. Verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Wise. The glory be upon thee and upon thy mother who heard and turned unto God, the Lord of this wondrous Day.

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious! Muhammad-Rida who has attained to His presence.

Glorified is He Who has ordained for all things whatsoever He hath willed. He, verily, is the One Who ruleth as He pleaseth. He hath created the Word in the form of man, and through it He hath drawn all worlds unto Him. He who is not attracted by the Word of God cannot truly be said to exist. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Through it hath God raised up whom He willeth and distinguished between the polytheists and the monotheists. It is a fire unto them that have waxed proud, and a light unto them that have turned towards the Dayspring of Revelation. Thus hath the matter been decreed in a preserved Tablet.

Blessed art thou, O servant, inasmuch as thou hast attained and visited thy Lord, the All-Merciful, when He shone forth from the horizon of the Prison with manifest sovereignty, and entered through the gate which they who desired to prevent it seized with tyranny through what Satan had whispered in the hearts of the heedless ones. We have blinded the eyes of them that wished to prevent it and caused you to enter by Our power. Thy Lord, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. He ordaineth what He pleaseth with sovereignty from His presence and doeth what He willeth. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. They who beheld God's power and denied it are indeed the losers and are in manifest error.

Remember when thou didst enter the seat of the Throne and didst hear with thine own ears what was uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur while He was in the Most Great Prison through what the hands of the nations had wrought - they who disbelieved after the clear proofs had come unto them from their Lord, the Revealer of verses. They are indeed among the perishing ones. When it was said unto them: "By what crime have ye imprisoned Him through Whom the tooth of faith hath gleamed and the sign of the All-Merciful hath appeared?" they said: "It hath been proven that He desired to change God's laws and His religion, and He hath no excellence over us; rather, we see Him as one of the mischief-makers." Thus spoke nations like them before. We seized them for what they said and made them a lesson to them that have insight. Soon shall We seize these as We seized those who were mightier than them in strength. Thy Lord, verily, is powerful over what He willeth and ruleth over what He pleaseth.

Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Praise be unto Thee for having called me through Thy grace, drawn me nigh unto the Manifestation of Thy Self, shown me Thy beauty, and caused me to hear Thy call in days wherein every seeker was prevented, every visitor seized, every observer driven away, every hopeful one distanced, and every rememberer slain. O Lord! Praise be unto Thee for having enabled me and admitted me into the precincts of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee, O Creator of the heavens and Lord of Names, to inscribe me among the people of Baha who were not hindered by wealth and beauty from turning to Thy face, O my Exalted Lord, and whom the manifestations of the Name of Majesty did not frighten in Thy days, O Thou in Whose hand is the beginning and the end. O Lord! Since Thou hast called me unto Thee, make me steadfast in Thy Cause in all conditions, then grant me what Thou hast ordained for them that are near unto Thee among Thy servants, and decree for me the good of this world and the next. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Generous. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He is the Dawning Place from the horizon of the Kingdom of Utterance. God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His are the might and majesty, the grandeur and power, the glory and praise.

And whoso hath denied Him is accounted among the wrongdoers in the Book of God, Lord of all the worlds.

I bear witness, as do the Concourse on High in this Most Glorious Station and the denizens of Paradise, that thou didst arise to serve the Cause when the Call was raised between earth and heaven, and didst turn unto the Dawning Place of thy Lord's signs when He appeared with the truth, and didst acknowledge that which the Tongue of Grandeur did speak. I testify that through thee every heedless one became aware, every slumberer arose, every hesitant one hastened forward, every crippled one walked, and every tongue-tied one spoke forth - all this through God's grace upon thee. Thou art he who didst drink from the cup of tribulation for the love of God, the Sovereign of the Kingdom of Names, and didst bear hardships purely for His sake. Alas, alas! The Pen weepeth at this moment at that which the Ancient King hath spoken concerning what befell thee at the hands of the oppressors among His creation and the transgressors among His servants.

Thou art he through whose steadfastness the feet of the servants were shaken, and through whose tranquility the hearts of the wicked were disturbed, and through whose mention remembrance was raised from all directions. Thou art he who wast with the Wronged One in the prison of the land of Ta in the nights and days, at eventide and at dawn, and whom the imaginings of the divines prevented not from turning to the Mighty, the All-Knowing, and whom the veils and might of the enemies hindered not from drawing nigh unto the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Thou art he who wast my partner in tribulation and in chains and fetters. At thy calamity tears were shed and hearts were troubled and souls lamented.

Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee for having shown patience in the days of God and for having been content with whatsoever befell thee in His path and for love of Him amidst all creation and the standards of power among the righteous. Through you did the Sun of inner meanings shine forth in the world of utterance and the All-Merciful reveal Himself unto all who dwell in the realm of possibility. Ye are they who chose hardship over ease and tribulation over all who dwell in the mortal realm, in the path of God, Lord of the seen and unseen. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of the bounty of the Lord of creation be upon you, upon your first and your last, your outward and your inward, and the mercy of God and His blessings.

ABADIH. O 'Ata, upon him be the Glory of God!

In His Name, the One Who ruleth over what hath been and what shall be! God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath come with the truth is verily the One through Whom was revealed that which lay hidden in God's knowledge and was recorded in the Books of the Prophets and Messengers. Through Him hath the Hour appeared, and the Resurrection come to pass, and the Bridge been laid, and the Balance set up, and every firm and steadfast mountain been moved. This is the Day which in all the divine Books, Scriptures and Psalms hath truly been attributed to God and is known as the Day of God. Nevertheless, doubtful and hesitant souls remain veiled therefrom, clinging to the conjectures and idle fancies of the past. For twelve hundred years they considered themselves the best of all sects, the saved community and favored nation, yet when God's test appeared they proved more wicked than all other sects and more rebellious than all other peoples, for they hanged the Essence of Being and the Worshipped Beauty and martyred Him with the most grievous torment. The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people! And now the people of the Bayan remain veiled and deprived of the Name of the Self-Subsisting and the sealed wine, clinging to the same vain imaginings. Blessed is he who with might hath rent asunder the veils, and he who with power hath shattered the idols of fancy, and he who through steadfastness hath illumined the horizon of certitude. In these days, in one of the Tablets this blessed word hath dawned from the horizon of the Supreme Pen: Until thou becomest aware of the falsehood of the past, thou shalt not bear witness to the truth of this wondrous Day. The heedless people must be awakened that they may recognize the daysprings of conjecture and fancy of the past and future, and may hold fast to the straight path and the firm and mighty cord. The Cause is most mighty, yet the people remain weak. Until now they have not understood the Day of God and like earthworms remain stuck in the clay of vain imaginings. In one of the Tablets these firm and perfect words were revealed: Great and wondrous is this Day, for He is manifest in the garment of I and the Hidden One speaketh with the tongue of I am the One Who is seen. O 'Ata! Say: This Day hath no peer or likeness. Strive that ye may not be deprived of the outpourings of the true Outpourer. Say: O ye who are veiled! To whom do ye turn, and from whom do ye turn away? Say: Cast away what ye possess and take what God remindeth you of. It shall profit you in all His worlds. He is verily the Truthful Informer. Should anyone ask you by what proof ye have believed in God, say: By this perspicuous Book and this firm and mighty Cause. Say: Thus doth God teach you as a token of His grace, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous. Blessed is he who hath cast away the world, turning unto the Most Great Name through which the seas have surged and the winds have blown and the Nightingale hath warbled upon the branches. There is none other God but Him, the Manifest, the Speaking, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

He is God, exalted is He Who bringeth relief and consolation unto those who are in the Kingdom of Names.

God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who hath appeared through the power of truth is the Lord of all creation, the Educator and Helper of all mankind; He Who guideth them unto His supreme Path and enableth them to hearken unto His Most Great Announcement. And through Him the portals of His grace were flung open before the faces of all people, and the mysteries latent in the sacred Book were unravelled upon His Return, and announcers, both men and women, went forth to proclaim the joyful tidings that the splendours of His light had shone forth from above the horizon of the gracious Will of God, the Lord of creation.

God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who is voicing the Call within the Most Great Prison is none other but the Lord of creation, the Life-Giver of all peoples. By virtue of His supreme potency the Ocean of Divine Utterance hath surged throughout the world before the followers of all religions and through Him, earth and heaven have been illumined, and the Summoner hath raised His Voice on every side proclaiming: Majesty and grandeur, grace and tender mercy belong unto God, the One, the Peerless, the Almighty, the All-Wise.

One day We awoke in the morning and lo! We witnessed the doors of heaven wide open, and beheld the angels descending and ascending, each one of them carrying a vial of pure rose-water. Thereupon the Crier raised His voice, saying: "O inmates of the all-highest Paradise! O denizens of the exalted and blissful Abode! Glad-tidings! Glad-tidings! inasmuch as He Who beareth the Most Mighty Name, the King of Eternity, hath graciously purposed to bless by His Presence the habitation wherein the soul of one of His hand-maidens hath ascended, one of the leaves that had secured for herself a place within the precincts of her Lord, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful."

During successive years she circled around the court of her Lord, and lauded Him in her anthems of praise, both in verse and prose, for which she gained the ornament of His acceptance, and received the light of His divine good-pleasure, as a token of heavenly grace from God, the Lord of this wondrous Day.

Meanwhile He who is the Desire of the world stood bestowing rose-water with the hand of bounteousness to those who, at His bidding, had presented themselves before the throne for the express purpose of carrying her body to the resting-place ordained for her in the Books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O Pen of Glory! Hearken unto the Voice of this Wronged One and make mention of the one whom thy Lord hath graciously willed to remember, and say:

The first sweet-smelling breeze that hath been diffused from the vesture of the bounty of God, the Lord of Lords, and the first perfume that hath shed its fragrance upon the dwellers of earth and heaven rest upon thee, O handmaid of God. I bear witness that thou didst hearken to His call and set thy face toward the Summit of transcendent glory. Thou wert so inebriated by the the utterances of the Lord of all beings that thou didst unloose thy tongue to celebrate His praise and to magnify His Name and His Glory by day and by night.

I testify that thou didst embrace the Truth at a time when most maid-servants had turned aside from Him, and recognized that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the Will of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, when people in most countries had disbelieved in Him.

Great is thy blessedness, O My leaf! inasmuch as thou didst seize the cup of heavenly reunion from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the Lord of the latter days, and drank of it at one time with His Name on thy lips, and at another time with His gracious and cherished remembrance in thy heart.

By the righteousness of God! Thou didst attain unto that which none of the hand-maids in the world nor the leaves thereof have attained, save them that the Hand of Omnipotence hath aroused as a token of grace and bounty from His Presence. Verily, He is potent to do as He willeth, through the power of His mighty and glorious Utterance.

We bear witness that, through her remembrance, the soft-flowing waters of forgiveness have gushed forth and the day-star of the grace of God, the All-Merciful, hath dawned to demonstrate the outpourings of His favour, His bestowal and loving providence, which have surpassed all that are in the heavens and on the earth.

Praised be God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the Name of Him through Whom the Ocean of Divine Knowledge surged in creation! Your letter in the Arabic tongue is present, and the Eye of Grace beholds it. The response from the Mother Book descends in Persian, that all may partake of their portion from the Ocean of utterance of the All-Merciful and become aware of that for which sight and hearing and spirit were created. Today the attraction of the Divine Word has seized the world. All things, in utmost joy and delight, are engaged in remembrance and praise. The water says: "O earth, let us set aside the remembrances of the world and occupy ourselves with the praise of the Ancient King." The mountains say: "O trees, today is the day of singing and melody, for the Hidden and Manifest Purpose is seated upon the throne of revelation." Blessed is our time, blessed is our day, and blessed is our state! The grace of the Beloved of the worlds has encompassed all, the lights of the Sun of loving-kindness have shone forth, the ocean of mercy is surging, and the light of bounty is radiant. A fleeting moment, in this Day, excelleth centuries of a bygone age. Blessed is the one who has become aware and testified to the grace of God, and woe unto the one who has deprived himself of the River of Mercy and held himself back from the bounty of the True Beneficent One! O Kazim! On this day the Greater Branch was present before the countenance of the Lord of Destiny. We speak and he writes. Know thou the station of this bounty. O Yahya! We have heard thy mention, remembered thee, and seen thy name. We have revealed for thee that which the remembrances of all nations cannot equal. The Mother Book bears witness to this, as it sits upon the Throne of Divine Address. O Yahya! Take hold of the Book of God with the power that is from Him and the might that is from His presence. He, verily, aids whoever turns to Him and desires to drink of His sealed wine, through His Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. In the nights and days the Most Exalted Pen is in motion. Ask God to raise up souls who are worthy of these days and capable of this Most Great Cause. By the Luminary of inner meanings that shines resplendent from the horizon of the heaven of utterance, the bounty of these days has not been and cannot be reckoned. Blessed is the state of the one who was not deprived of its outpourings nor prevented from its favors. Today the sun speaks: "Thine is the praise, O Lord of the worlds," and the heaven utters: "Thine is the glory, O Lord of Names." The Tree of Sinai chants: "The Lord of Revelation has come," yet the people of the world are heedless and veiled, save for a few. O Kazim! We beseech God to aid all in that which causes the exaltation of His Cause and the advancement of existence. Thou didst seek forgiveness for thy parents. Praise be to God, it has been granted. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He shall not be asked of His doings. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, male and female, young and old, who have fulfilled God's Covenant and His Testament, and have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur uttered before the creation of the heavens and earth.

Jinab-i-Haji Abbas and Jinab-i-Kamal al-Din and the members of that household, both male and female, shall recite:

He is the Mighty! Glorified be He in Whose hand is the dominion of the Kingdom of eternity and the realm of might in the heavens! He doeth whatsoever He willeth with His Most Glorious Servant and is not questioned about what He desireth. He is the Almighty, the Most Powerful.

Say: The Servant hath departed from the City of God, and this We accepted for Ourself before the creation of the heavens and before the spirits were breathed into the temples of the worlds, at a time when neither the primal Adam, nor Moses of the Cause, nor the Faithful Spirit were yet mentioned. By this all are assured that the people can never inflict upon Us what We have not accepted before the creation of the first ones and the mention of the last ones. By the Lord of the Throne and of eternity! All who are in the heavens and earth are but as a handful of clay. How then could anyone inflict upon Us what was not ordained in a Tablet well-preserved?

Say: By God! When the Youth desired to depart from the Garden with manifest sovereignty, the Maids of Heaven emerged from their exalted chambers, the veils were drawn aside, and the Manifestations of the Unseen came forth from their holy retreats. All spirits gathered to behold the Beauty from this noble vantage. Not a single soul or spirit or manifestation remained behind the veil of the Divine Essence or the coverings of the Almighty Dominion - all descended from their stations to witness this glorious Beauty. The Youth walked forth and with Him walked the spirits of the near ones and the angels of all worlds, until He stood before the Steed. Then were the pillars of all things shaken, the realities of Paradise were troubled, and the hearts of the mystics swooned away. Then did the Beauty mount the saddle of light, even as the Spirit mounted the mighty throne.

At that moment the Herald called out from the midst of the heavens at the center of creation: "O City of God! How canst thou endure this separation that sets Iraq ablaze and melts the horizons?" Then were the hearts of the monotheists and the souls of the lovers consumed. "O land of the City! How canst thou bear anything in creation after the departure of God's burden, the Mighty, the Powerful? How can roses appear from thee and plants of glory spring forth after the disappearance of God's rose, the Transcendent, the Luminous? How can spring breezes blow upon thee after the departure of God's springtime, when thou art afflicted with the force of autumn? O air of the City! How canst thou nourish thy inhabitants after the sweet breezes of the Beloved are cut off from thee? O City of God! From whom wilt thou thereafter find the fragrance of musk, and with whom wilt thou find solace after the perfumes of the garment are sealed from thy face? O nightingale of the City! How canst thou warble upon the branches after the nightingale of holiness hath flown from the boughs of glorious might? O dove of the City! Wilt thou coo upon the branches after God's voice is no longer raised and the melodies of wondrous holiness are cut off from the City?" Thus do We make mention of the City of God after the separation, that the loved ones therein may be among those who remember.

O Living, Mighty, Exalted, Beloved One! How excellent, O my God, is the warbling of David in the garden of the Psalms through the melodies of the dove of attraction during the visitation of Thy countenance! O what joy, that the fire of Thy oneness was kindled in the essence of Thine eternity! O what bliss, that the spirit of attraction was breathed into the reality of Thy Self-Subsistence! My God, my God! Be not far from me, for tribulations have entirely encompassed me. My God, my God! Leave me not to myself, for calamities have wholly seized me. Give me to drink from the pure milk of Thy loving-kindness, for thirsts have utterly consumed me. Shelter me beneath the shadow of the wings of Thy mercy, for all enemies have purposed against me. Preserve me before the throne of grandeur in the presence of the manifestation of the signs of Thy glory, for complete abasement hath touched me. Feed me from the fruits of the Tree of Thine eternity, for utter weakness hath drawn nigh unto me. Grant me sustenance from the cups of joy from the hands of Thy tenderness, for mighty sorrows have taken hold of me. Clothe me in the brocaded robe of Thy sovereign dominion, for poverty in its essence hath stripped me bare. Cause me to slumber at the cooing of the Dove of Thy eternity, for the greatest afflictions have come upon me. Make me to dwell at the throne of oneness amid the radiance of the beauty of Thy countenance, for agitation in its most violent form hath destroyed me. Immerse me in the oceans of forgiveness before the surge of the Leviathan of glory, for sins in their magnitude have caused my death. Glory be to Thee! Glory be to Thee! How extreme is my evil plight! How great is the trembling of my heart! How intense is the burning of my being and the fire of my reality in the layers of my inmost self! I beseech Thee by Thy Word through which the throne of Thy mercy was set in motion, and the dove of Thy rapture warbled, and the souls of the detached ones cried out at the appearance of the sun of Thy loving-kindness, that Thou cut me off from all else but Thee, lest the sun of Thine eternity set from the cave of Thy oneness, and the lamp of Thine everlastingness be extinguished from the house of Thy Self-Subsistence. Yet this would not be a wonder among the signs of Thy power. Sufficient art Thou Thyself as a witness to what I say. Therefore, bless the stars of the heavens of Thine eternity, and the leaves of the tree of Thy reality, and the breezes of the expanse of Thy Self-Subsistence, and the letters of the book of Thine everlastingness, and the words of the tablets of Thy creation, and the suns of the dawning-places of Thy vitality, and the moons of the rising-points of Thy essence, and the lightning of the clouds of Thy might, and the roses of the garden of Thine eternity, and the lights of the manifestation of the light of Thy countenance, and the shooting stars against the devils of Thy community, by all Thy modes and manifestations and beginnings and endings and strength and power, for in Thy hand is the kingdom of command and Thou art powerful over all things. How can I mention, O my God, what hath touched me from the wonders of Thy overwhelming power and the brilliance of Thy might? Was I not a dove of Thy house, or an ant in the valley of Thy oneness, or a gnat from the desert of Thy Self-Subsistence, or a mosquito from the wilderness of Thine eternity? By Thy glory! My bones have dried up and my pillars have crumbled. If Thou forgivest me, verily Thou art the best of those who show mercy, and if Thou chastisest me, verily Thou art the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. And at that time, when I was prevented from the power of touch by what was decreed in the tablets of invincible glory, my soul departed from all directions lest it cause something Thou lovest not and I become one of the seditious. Thereby was I made an outcast in all lands and cast out among the servants, such that none could be found more grief-stricken than I in all the worlds. And I say: Praise be to Thee, for Thou art the Lord of all the worlds, and I call upon Thee with the cry of the distressed ones. Glory be to Thee! Glory be to Thee! above what the sincere ones say.

My call hath been raised from around My throne - blessed are they that hear! The Face of God hath appeared, unveiled and unconcealed - blessed are they that behold! The Sun of Utterance hath dawned from the Most Glorious Horizon - blessed are they that attain! The breezes of grace have wafted from the right hand of justice - blessed are they that turn unto them!

The Maid of inner meanings hath appeared in the chambers of thy Lord's words, the All-High, the All-Knowing - blessed are they that comprehend! The Tree of the All-Merciful hath yielded the fruits of utterance - blessed are they that take them! The fragrances of divine realities have been diffused in this garden - blessed are they that inhale them! The Youth's robe hath been suspended between earth and heaven - blessed is he who findeth from it the fragrance of holiness and is of them that are at peace!

Say: O people of the Bayan! The hearts of them that are nigh unto God are bewildered at you. I know not what ye desire, O ye heedless ones! If ye seek God's signs, by God they have descended in the most wondrous utterance, to which every thing beareth witness, if ye be of them that deny. If ye seek God's power, verily it hath appeared in truth, and ye have beheld it with your own eyes, would ye but be fair-minded. And if ye seek His beauty, verily it hath dawned in truth from the holy horizon with manifest sovereignty. And if ye seek knowledge, from it have appeared the treasuries of the knowledge of the first and the last. Say: I know not what ye have made the standard for recognizing your Lord - consider this, O ye idolaters!

Blessed art thou, O My name, for having been named with this Name through which God hath distinguished between the monotheists and the idolaters. There hath befallen Me what befell not My previous name, yet the people are in grievous heedlessness. Say: Verily My previous name was martyred with his loved ones in a single day, and ascended to the Supreme Companion with gladness and manifest joy. But this Name witnesseth his enemies in every moment as they slay him with the swords of hatred. Thus hath the matter been ordained, and We have sent it down in truth as a reminder to them that know. They are naught in thy Lord's sight but worthless rabble, nay more contemptible, and thy Lord is verily the Almighty, the Powerful. They have committed what none before them committed, even violating God's sanctity among His servants - yet they have only harmed themselves, though they perceive it not. Thus have We taken from them the spirit of understanding and left them in barren wastes, wherein they wander distracted. But thou, be thou assured by thy Lord's grace and fear not the hosts of the oppressors. By My life! Wert thou to know what hath been ordained for thee, thou wouldst sacrifice thyself in love for that most wondrous and wonderful station. Grieve not at anything - verily thy Lord is with thee in all conditions and will aid thee through His power. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful. And the Spirit be upon thee, upon thy wife, and upon them that are with thee of God's sincere servants.

He is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed

The servant present hath presented thy letter before the Throne, and this wondrous Tablet hath been revealed for thee. We have made mention of those who were martyred in the path of God with a mention that nothing in the kingdom can equal, as My perspicuous Book doth testify. There is nothing that hath not been honored with the ornament of My mention and been immersed in the ocean of My mercy and been established upon the throne of My loving-kindness in My exalted Kingdom. We make mention of them once again in this mighty Prison.

O Rafi', rejoice thou that the Lord of Eternity hath made mention of thee when thou didst ascend unto the Supreme Companion. Blessed art thou for having hearkened unto the call of God and turned unto Him and offered up thy spirit in longing for His presence and love of His beauty. He, verily, is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Thou art he who testified to that which God did testify, and turned unto Him when a great multitude turned away. Well done, for your turning and your submissiveness and your humility. He verily doth not suffer to be lost the reward of the doers of good.

And We make mention of Mirza Aqa who attained martyrdom in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. There were revealed for him aforetime clear verses whereby honored servants were attracted. He testified to that which My Most Exalted Pen did testify: that there is none other God but Me, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He drank from the ocean of reunion and tasted the sweetness of the heavenly table and found the fragrance of My luminous robe. We testify that he turned unto My horizon and soared in My atmosphere and sought the ultimate goal and the supreme summit. The Tongue of God doth testify to this in this noble station.

And We make mention of him who was named after the Prophet, that every devoted one may be assured that there is none other God but Him. His is the supreme providence and the mercy that hath preceded creation. He doeth what He willeth by His command, and He is the Kind, the Bountiful, the Merciful. Blessed are they who have visited the martyrs and remembered them with that which the Most Exalted Pen hath spoken. We testify that they are among the triumphant ones. All things shall perish, but there shall remain for My loved ones My beautiful remembrance. Joy be unto him who hath found the fragrance of utterance and recognized what hath been sent down from the heaven of the loving providence of his Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

We have mentioned them and their kindred before and at this time. By My life! Their deeds in God's path have been accepted. Nothing is hidden from His knowledge and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O My loved ones and My friends! Hearken unto My call. Beware lest anything among all things prevent you from the remembrance of God, the Lord of Names. Cast aside what is with the people, placing your trust in God, the Lord of the mighty Throne.

We have made mention of the prisoners of Nayriz and My loved ones there. We have heard mention of them in this Remembrance and of their turning unto God's bright horizon. Be assured of God's grace and mercy. He verily heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We send from this spot Our greetings upon the faces of My loved ones and My male and female servants, and I am the All-Knowing Rememberer. We counsel them to trustworthiness and godliness and patience and forbearance, and I am the Patient, the Forbearing.

The glory be upon you and upon those who testified to that which God testified and who took in the days of attainment the cup of life from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the Most Merciful, and drank in His Name, the Powerful, the Most High, the Mighty, the Wondrous.

O Muhammad-Ibrahim! In the Name of God, the Most Manifest, the Most Holy! Your letter has reached Our presence in this prison, and We have found the fragrance of your love and recognized your sincerity towards God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Those who have believed in God and held fast to the cord of His favor - upon them do the denizens of Paradise pray, and this is indeed a great bounty inscribed in the Tablet. Give thanks unto God for having given thee to drink the Water of Life from the chalice of eternity, and for having caused thee to ascend to the heaven of inner meanings, and for having made thee to hear wondrous melodies of glory. Leave the idolaters in the depths of the fire, then proclaim thy Lord's praise amongst His servants. Thus doth the Pen of glory and might command thee. Say: O company of the heedless! Have ye forgotten that which God counseled you in all the Tablets, to fear God and not to be tyrannical and wretched in the land? Say: Be fair - if ye deny what hath been sent down in truth from God's heaven of grandeur, by what proof do ye find rest in your souls and seek to guide others? Fear God and refute not the truth by what ye possess - this would be better for you, did ye but know. Sanctify yourselves from idle fancies and desires, then turn your gaze toward the Most Glorious Horizon. Thus doth your Lord, the Most High, command you in preserved Tablets of glory. Beware lest the world and what is therein delude you, or the intimations of the people of the clouds prevent you. Rend asunder the veils by a power that is mighty in truth. Know thou that from thy letter wafted the fragrance of love to all regions, and the angels of the Cause have preserved it from One mighty and powerful. God shall resurrect it in the most beauteous form - with Him is the knowledge of all things and He encompasseth all things. Were We to acquaint thee with the station God hath ordained for thee in thy love for Him, thy spirit would depart thy body in its longing for what is destined for thee. But We have concealed this through a wisdom known only to God, thy Lord and the Lord of all creation. Give thanks unto God for having made thee a repository of His love, but strive to preserve it from every accursed thief. For Satan and his manifestations have spread throughout the land, and should they find anyone heedless, in less than a moment they would steal what their Lord hath entrusted unto them. Thus hath the tongue of truth spoken faithfully. Be distinguished among the servants from all others, such that thy countenance shineth amidst all faces, and be among those whose faces are illumined by the lights of the Countenance. O thou servant who hast turned unto God! Ask God to grant thee what thou desirest. He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He pleaseth by His command, and He is indeed cognizant of all things. By God! It grieveth Me that thou shouldst seek to attain My presence and I must deny thee. But as We observe the decree of destiny, We have withheld the Pen from its ruling and suspended it in the heaven of the divine Will until God cometh with a manifest sovereignty. Should We remain in that land in such condition for a complete year, We shall reveal what hath been truly ordained, and He is indeed wise in all things. Spirit, glory and splendor be upon thee and upon those who are steadfast in love.

In the Name of the Everlasting Speaker

Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and He hath heard that which thy tongue hath uttered and known thy condition. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Hearken unto the Call from the direction of the Prison, then act according to that which thou hast been commanded in the Tablet of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. That which hath ever been intended by love, and ever shall be, is the love of God. True love guideth the people and treadeth the path of Truth, and this is achieved and attained through the grace of religion. Regarding thy statement in this connection that thy love hath reached such a stage as to know neither unbelief, nor faith, nor religion, it is Our hope that, God willing, thy love and affection may be adorned with the ornament of truth and meet with His acceptance. From the Pen of the Most High, there were revealed in the early days certain considerations regarding the stages of love that were specifically intended for the Sunnis. Those considerations were prompted by the requirements and exigencies of the time and by the stations and attainments of the souls. Regard religion as the orb of the sun and love as its light. Thus doth the tongue of this Wronged One speak forth in His prison, that thou mayest be of the steadfast. We beseech God that thou mayest become illumined with the light of the Sun of Truth and engage in that which is worthy of this Day. Thou hast been mentioned before the Throne and hast attained unto this most mighty and most holy Tablet. Thy Lord is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. God willing, thou shalt remain protected from the cawing of the ravens and the doubts of the suspicious ones. Say: O my God! I beseech Thee to make me steadfast and firm in Thy love and Thy Cause. Thou art verily the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. We make mention of thy father who believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and We give him the glad-tidings of this Most Great Remembrance that he may rejoice and be of those who have laid hold of My Extended Cord. O Ali, We have accepted thy sacrifice. This is from the bounty of thy Lord. Be thou grateful and numbered among those who render thanks. Now in life, occupy thyself with the remembrance and praise of the Friend, and seek from God true sacrifice, which is to submerge thine own will and purpose in the Will and Purpose of God, exalted be His glory - that is, to manifest no intention or purpose of thine own. Whosoever attaineth unto this station hath attained unto true martyrdom, and aught else is not permitted in this Day, for We have commanded all to wisdom, and they who are endued with insight must look to the Command of God and not act according to their own will. They must carry out that which they have been commanded and abandon that which hath been forbidden. O elder one! Since thou hast attained unto the love and favor of God, thou art young and art mentioned among the youth before the Throne. O Abu-Talib! The Desired One declareth: Praise be to God that in thy youth thou hast attained unto the recognition of the Dawning-Place of the Cause and the Day-Spring of Divine Revelation. Now ask thou of God steadfastness, for the heedless souls who associate partners with God are engaged with the utmost deceit and guile in leading people astray in the name of truth, and ere long their cawing shall be raised in that land. Guard thyself by the Name of thy Lord, the Triumphant, the All-Knowing. The glory be upon you from God, the Most High, the Most Great.

O friends of God in Husaynabad! In the name of the one true God!

The Most Exalted Pen mentions His friends with perfect grace and kindness, and counsels them to that which today is the cause of the elevation and exaltation of human station, that perchance the fragrance of unity may be diffused throughout the world and eliminate the odors of discord which are the cause and source of corruption. He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty - by a single word He brought the world from nothingness into the realm of existence, and should He so will, by another word He would cause it to return. He is the One to Whose power all created things have testified and before Whose grandeur all beings have prostrated themselves. God willing, may all the friends become united and in agreement upon the Word of the All-Merciful, and strive night and day to manifest such deeds as would cause all who dwell on earth to turn towards Him. I swear by the peerless Gem of Utterance that a goodly deed is in itself a proclaimer of God's Cause. Strive ye to act in accordance with what hath been revealed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Book. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the utterance of the All-Merciful and acted according to what he was commanded in His mighty Book.

Consider this opportunity a bounty and know ye the value of this divine Day. By the life of God! It hath had no likeness nor will it ever have one. Let not the might and power and riches of the people prevent you from the Truth. Consider the former ages and reflect upon what transpired in those days. Where is the might of princes and their wealth? Where is their power and dominion? Where are their ranks and their armies? God hath returned them to their graves and made them a lesson for His loved ones and chosen ones. Verily He is the Ruler, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Ere long all that is seen shall perish and pass away. Hold fast unto that which shall endure for you throughout the dominion of the earthly and heavenly kingdoms.

God willing, may ye be enkindled by the heat of the love of God - an enkindlement which the seas of the world cannot quench or extinguish. Verily He attracts whom He willeth through a word from His presence. He is, in truth, the One Who doeth what He pleaseth through His word "Be" and it is. Not an atom's weight of deeds is lost in God's sight. All that hath befallen you and all that ye have heard from the deniers and opposers in the path of Truth hath been recorded and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen. Soon shall the tongues of the world make mention of you and the Kingdom of Glory circle round about you. Know ye your worth and recognize the value of these days and preserve your stations, for the misguided lie in wait in their ambush, ready to prevent God's loved ones from Him and deprive them of the water of life. Beseech ye God at all times to make you victorious through the Kawthar of steadfastness. Verily He is the Hearer, He is the Answerer, He is the Bestower, He is the Generous, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. The glory from Our presence be upon you and upon those who have cast away all else save Me and taken hold of that which they were commanded in My wondrous Book.

O Husayn, upon whom be the Glory of God! The Supreme Pen speaks in the name of the Beloved of the worlds: Your letter was received before the Countenance, and from its expression was inhaled the fragrance of the love of the Beloved of the worlds. Praise be to God that through divine grace, in this spiritual dawn, you have attained to that which was intended and have been illumined by the effulgences of the Divine Word which has dawned from the Dayspring of Will. The effulgences of the Word have encompassed all who are on earth, yet most people remain deprived of the Dayspring of divine manifestations due to imaginary veils. Soon all shall turn toward the intended Goal, but alas for those souls who today remain deprived of the shining lights. I swear by the Dawning-Place of the Most Great Name that if people would rend asunder the veils and hearken with the ear of their true nature to the Call of God raised from the right side of the luminous Spot, all would turn with illumined hearts toward the Beloved. The veils have prevented them - soon they shall wail and weep, though now they perceive it not. Blessed are those souls who today have attained the recognition of God and have turned toward the Most Great Name and the Ancient Ocean. Although today the enkindled and devoted souls have been encompassed by abasement due to their turning to the Word of God, yet soon all on earth shall engage in glorifying their mention with utmost honor. That which exists and is witnessed shall soon vanish, but any deed performed by any soul for the triumph of God's Cause, even if it be but a sigh breathed forth for the love of God, shall endure forever and its effects shall be manifested in all the divine worlds through wondrous and sublime appearances. This is God's hidden grace of which none is aware. If the divine fingers of power were to rend this veil, you would witness all turning with complete devotion, perfect hope and supreme steadfastness to sacrifice themselves in the path of the Friend, counting all that exists in the world and whatsoever is related to it as non-existent. Since the preservation of souls for the triumph of God's Cause is observed according to divine wisdom's requirements, therefore this station remains unrevealed and hidden behind the veils of the unseen. Blessed are you for having attained, arisen, turned, heard and said: "Here am I, here am I, O Beloved of the worlds!" These are pearls and treasures that shall remain preserved in the divine treasuries of the unseen, and the hands of the treacherous and thieves shall be barred from them. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having caused me to be present before the Throne, to hear Thy call and be honored with meeting Thee. I beseech Thee by Thy Name that rules over all names to ordain for me to meet Thee in every world of Thy worlds, to cause me to soar at all times in the atmosphere of Thy love, and to turn toward the Kaaba of Thy reunion and meeting. Thou art powerful over what Thou willest, and Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful. The Glory be upon thee and upon those with thee. The mentioned Tablets were sent. Verily, He is the best of rememberers. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

His Holiness Aqa Siyyid Isma'il, upon him be the Glory of God. He is the True Speaker from His most exalted horizon.

The Book of God speaks the truth: There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The Fire calls out from the direction of the Mount, saying: "O people! The Promise has come, and He Who speaks is indeed the Promised One." The Balance proclaims: "O people of the earth! Fear the All-Merciful and be not of those who understand not." This is the Day wherein the Call has been raised from the most exalted horizon. Blessed are they who hear. The Path walks and says: "Draw nigh, O people, unto the Dawning-Place of bounty. The seal of the Choice Wine has been broken in the name of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting."

O Isma'il! Blessed art thou, for the Wronged One has turned toward thee from this praiseworthy station and remembers thee with that whereby all things have been adorned through the light of remembrance from God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Loving. Give glad tidings to the servants of this Most Great Revelation, through which has been manifested what was hidden in the knowledge of God, the Lord of existence. Beware lest the doubts of the people prevent thee from serving the Cause, or their might frighten thee. Be a teacher of God's Cause in all conditions. Verily He will protect thee, aid thee, and inspire thee with that which will draw people near unto Him. He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Blessed art thou for having drunk the wine of revelation from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the Possessor of the seen and unseen.

O Ibrahim! Rejoice that the Lord of Eternity has turned toward thee from His Most Great Prison and revealed for thee that which has diffused the fragrances of utterance throughout all possibility. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who has come in the shadows of the clouds with a Cause before which armies cannot stand. Thy letter reached the Wronged One and the Trusted One, upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of the worlds, delivered it. We read it and found from it the fragrance of thy sincerity, thy turning and thy devotion to God, the Lord of the Frequented Fane. Let not the words of those who have denied the Witness and the Witnessed grieve thee. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make thee attracted by His verses, firm in His Cause, and detached from all else. Verily He has power over what He willeth through His word "Be" and it is. Give glad tidings to the people of this Day which the Messenger foretold from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy - the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds. Say: O concourse of divines! Fear the Lord of Names. He has come with verses that have attracted the hearts of those who know. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of this bounty which has encompassed the seen and unseen. Blessed art thou, O Ibrahim, and joy be unto thee for having taken the wine of revelation from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord and drunk thereof in His name, the Mighty, the Wondrous.

We remember Mirza before Aqa with the verses of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, that the call of his Lord may attract him and draw him near. He is verily the Compassionate, the Generous. We remember My loved ones there and command them with that which will raise high the station of the Word among the servants, and We counsel them with that which God counseled His chosen ones in His perspicuous Book. We beseech God to preserve them and assist them with the hosts of verses. He is verily the Commander, the Strong, the Mighty. The Glory from Us be upon you and upon those who have heard, turned toward and answered the Herald of Grandeur in this exalted and glorious station.

In the name of God, the One

This is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down for those who have turned to and believed in God, the Lord of Lords. O Jamalu'd-Din! Hearken unto the call of God, the True King, the Manifest One. He maketh mention of thee that thy remembrance may endure in the Mother Book. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, and glory be to Thee, O Beloved of my heart and He Who is mentioned in my inmost being, for having illumined my face with the lights of Thy countenance and enabled me to acknowledge that which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance in Thy days to strengthen me to remain steadfast in Thy remembrance and praise. Then grant me, O my God, the Kawthar of Thy knowledge and the food of Thy heaven, and aid me through Thy bounty and Thy hosts. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.

O thou who gazest upon the countenance! The divine favor, grace and mercy concerning thee are more manifest than the sun at high noon. With this supreme bounty and greatest favor, thou must in the nights and days hold fast to that which will exalt the Word of God, in such wise that from all directions the lights of remembrance and utterance may appear and become evident. Set aside all else save thy Lord and take His Book through His name and power, and remind the people in His days. Verily He will be with thee and will strengthen thee as He pleaseth, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful.

In these days countless writings have gone to foreign lands, such that some from those parts have turned toward Iran to gain knowledge of this Most Great Cause, and having obtained what divine writings they could, have returned. The details of this will soon be spread abroad and you will become informed thereof. This Wronged One is not content that from you and Haji Faraju'llah, after much effort, no fruit or trace should appear. You must hold fast to the hem of steadfastness and grasp the strong cord of wisdom and utterance, that there may appear from you both that which befitteth this manifest Cause. Praise be to God that corruption, conflict and disputation have been erased from the Book, as every discerning one and every informed scholar doth testify. All must aid the Cause of the Goal of the world through praiseworthy character, good deeds, wisdom and utterance. It hath been repeatedly mentioned that the hosts are goodly deeds and praiseworthy character, and the commander is the fear of God. Blessed is he who hath recognized and joy be to him who hath held fast to what God, the Lord of the mighty throne and this noble station, hath desired.

In all conditions We beseech and implore the Self-Subsisting that He may aid thee and Haji to that which befitteth His Day. Effort is necessary and steadfastness obligatory, that perchance the hatred and rancor hidden in the hearts of the various groups may be stilled through the Kawthar of divine counsel and heavenly wisdom and utterance. This is the aim of this Wronged One, as all things and their traces, the trees and their fruits, the suns and their radiance, and the moons and their effulgence do testify. Blessed are they who attain and joy be to them who know. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of thy Lord's bounty be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who hearken to thy words concerning this mighty and wondrous Cause.

Tablet to Haji Aqa Baba of Kalih-Darrih, upon him be the Glory of God

He is the Manifest, the Speaking, the All-Knowing

This is a Book sent down in truth. Verily it is the Greatest Sign for the people of the world and the Choice Sealed Wine for whoso hath grasped the Name of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. O thou who hast turned! Thy letter hath arrived and been read by the servant present before the Wronged One, Who hath summoned both kings and subjects unto God, the Sovereign of sovereigns. We have heard thy mention and make mention of thee in this Tablet which proclaimeth between earth and heaven with the most exalted call: "The Kingdom belongeth unto God, Creator of the heavens and Lord of all names, Who hath come with the truth with manifest sovereignty."

God willing, thou shouldst in all times and circumstances speak forth the praise and glorification of the Beloved of all possibility. Convey greetings from the True One to the friends in the land of A and Sh, and say: "Under all conditions, keep your gaze fixed upon the Daystar of steadfastness which hath shone forth from the heaven of God's Cause. The whispering souls are busy with deception and guile. Every falsehood that hath led and leadeth God's servants astray hath attributed and doth attribute itself to the truth." God willing, all must be possessed of insight and gaze toward the Most Great Horizon. Whosoever from whom they detect the fragrance of hatred, they must leave to himself and place their trust in God, exalted be His glory. We have previously informed all the friends of God about the crowing of the crow and the like, that all might be aware and not be deprived by the deceit and guile of those who lead astray and turn away from the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Should anyone come with all the books in the world and speak other than what God hath willed, he is recorded as one of the people of the fire in God's Book and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen. Should anyone come unto you with the book of the wicked and the tablets of fire, cast them behind you. Thus doth command you He from Whom is a preserved tablet.

Likewise convey greetings from this Wronged One to the people of that village, both men and women, and say: "This is the Day of remembrance and utterance, the Day of assistance and service. All must remain firm and steadfast in the Cause of the Lord of creation in complete unity. The triumph of God's Cause hath been and shall be through goodly deeds and firm, decisive utterances. To this testifieth that which hath been sent down in the Book from God, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing." Strive that ye may all attain unto that which is beloved of God in this Day. Whosoever showeth forth steadfastness in this day is mentioned and recorded as among the most exalted of creation with God. Blessed are they whom the veils of names and the allusions of the possessors of creation have not withheld or deprived from the True One, the Inaccessible. I swear by the ocean of utterance that such souls are renowned in the Concourse on High and are associated with the Most Wondrous, Most Glorious Name.

God willing, thou shouldst recite this Tablet for the people of that land and the companions of A and Sh, upon them be the Glory of God, that all hearts may be illumined by the lights of the utterance of the All-Merciful and attain unto the most great steadfastness. Verily He is the Helper, the Forgiving, the Generous. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the greatness and power

Praise be to God, the news of your arrival in Beirut was received with joy and fragrance. This news became the cause of great happiness, as many of the circling ones were made glad. Praise be to God in all conditions. In truth, from the breath of utterance wafts the fragrance of reunion. It gives strength to the spirit and joy to the heart. In this evanescent one's opinion, its power is greater than the supreme remedy. After reading and becoming informed, we approached the Sacred Threshold and made mention. He said: "We beseech God to aid them in remembrance and praise, and to exalt them through His might and sovereignty. Verily, He is powerful over all things." End quote.

The mention of the Afnan, upon him be all the Most Glorious Beauty, has been and continues to be made. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant the blessing of presence and ordain reunion. It is the deeds of the people of earth that have caused dispersion and separation. I beseech God that, despite every heedless and ignorant one, He may grant the Afnan a dwelling place and refuge in the shade of the Blessed Tree, and that this servant too may attain. The honored letter, along with the letter of the honored Haji Siyyid Muhammad, upon him be the glory of God, and the petitions of all arrived. God willing, each shall attain their reward. Verily, He loves the doers of good.

To the Afnan, his honor Aqa Siyyid Mu?sin, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty, I convey greetings and seek for him that which endures with the permanence of God's kingdom, fixed and established. Likewise to Haji Muhammad Rida, upon him be the glory of God, I convey greetings. He is mentioned in His presence. To the beloved of the heart, Muhammad Mu??afa, upon him be God's grace and mercy, and the other friends, upon them be God's peace and bounty, I make mention. God is witness that whenever the name of each is mentioned, joy and delight are felt. But from what and whence is this joy? By the life of our Beloved, all is from sincerity and love and affection and unity. The illumination of the world is from the light of love, else darkness would seize and destroy all. It is the primary director in the world. Glory be to God - it is the source of two opposites, namely death and life. None but God truly knows His power. He possesses all attributes. Blessed is he who has attained unto Him and in whom are the signs of his Lord.

Finally, this servant beseeches his Lord - and entreats Him by His Prophets, His chosen ones, His friends, by Him whom He has made the emblem of His power in His lands and the banner of His might amongst His servants, and by His family and companions - to ordain for your honor and His servant that which will draw us near to Him in all conditions and gather us beneath His shade and in His presence. Verily, He is the Powerful, the All-Choosing. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon God's sincere servants. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the Name of God, the Most Mighty, the Most Impregnable, the Most Glorious!

I know not, O my God, by what call Thou didst draw the hearts of Thy loved ones, or by what fire Thou didst ignite the hearts of Thy chosen ones, or by what arrow Thou didst pierce the breasts of those who love Thee, or by what cord Thou didst bind the necks of those who long for Thee. For I observe, O my Beloved, that whenever the clouds of destiny rain down upon them the showers of tribulation, the soil of their beings grows verdant, bringing forth the ears of Thy love and the flowers of Thy attraction. And whenever the hands of tyranny and oppression are raised against them from every direction to sever the hand of any one of them from the hem of Thy love, they neither can nor are able to do so. And whenever the oceans of hardship are poured upon them, they neither quench the fire of their attraction nor extinguish the heat of their longing. It is as though in that station, O my God, they are like fish swimming and glorifying Thy remembrance, and should they be cast into the fire, they become as the salamander, living and delighting therein, drawn by the flames of the fire of Thy love and passion. And should the swords of the horizons be raised against them in enmity, they lift up their heads and say: "The Covenant has come, and this is the cup of the Compact, and here we are, the longing ones!"

By Thy glory, O my God, I am bewildered by them and by what hath appeared from them in the path of Thy love. Blessed are they, and joy be unto them! How the fire of Thy love was kindled in their hearts, and how the lights of Thy attraction appeared in their breasts, and how resplendent was the rising of the sun of Thy verses in the crystal of their realities and the mirror of their hearts! It is as though Thou didst fashion them for Thy love and chose them for Thy attraction and cast into them the spirit of Thy Cause and showed them the beauty of Thy oneness. Therefore they became detached from their selves and their dwellings in Thy path, and every day they were afflicted with a trial in Thy Cause. Yet with all this, tribulations prevented them not from turning to Thy most exalted horizon, nor did the opposition of all in creation bar them from gazing upon Thy most glorious countenance.

Therefore I beseech Thee, O my most glorious God, by Thy Self which Thou hast cast into the Most Great Prison for the liberation of mankind, that Thou assist Thy loved ones at all times through Thy wondrous confirmations and mighty inspirations, that they may all arise to aid Thy Cause and spread Thy remembrance, and that they may all become detached from all else save Thee and turn to none other than Thee, O our Lord, the All-Merciful, and O our Beloved, the Help in Peril! And among those sanctified souls, O my God, is this one whom Thou hast made a servant to the name of Thy divinity and named him thus in the kingdom of Thy names. Therefore assist him, O my Beloved, to perfect himself in that name and to manifest from him that which befitteth the court of Thy glory and the sanctuary of Thy holiness. Then ordain, O my God, for all Thy most beautiful names that they may find the sweetness of Thy servitude and the delight of Thy obedience, lest there appear from any possessor of attributes aught save Thy Cause, and lest any existent being see its own existence before the sanctuary of Thy manifestation. For verily Thou art the righteous Ruler and the Doer of what Thou willest. All are Thy servants and within Thy grasp, but we beseech Thee, O my God, to look upon us with the glances of the eyes of Thy bounty and grace, not with Thy justice, for we are weak, and verily Thou art the Generous Sovereign, possessed of great bounty. There is no God but Thee, the Protector, the Mighty, the Ancient of Days.

In My Name, the Speaker in the Kingdom of Utterance! O M A! Hearken unto that which the Spirit imparteth unto thee of the verses of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, that the Call may draw thee to the Most Exalted Horizon and bring thee nigh unto a station wherein thou shalt behold within thyself the fire of the love of God in such wise that neither the might of kings nor the intimations of servants shall quench it, and thou shalt arise amidst the concourse of creation to praise thy Lord, the Possessor of Names. This beseemeth thee on this Day. We make mention unto thee of that which hath come to pass aforetime, that thou mayest find the sweetness of remembrance and utterance and become aware of that which transpired in what hath been. Verily thy Lord is the Remembrancer, the Mighty, the Beloved. Remember when Moses, having tended the sheep of Jethro, his father-in-law, in the wilderness, heard the call of the Lord of creation from the Tree raised up on the blessed spot: "O Moses! Verily I am God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob." The rapture of that Call so seized him that he became detached from all created things, turning toward Pharaoh and his concourse with a power from thy Lord, the Protector over what was and what shall be. The people hear what he heard, yet they comprehend not. Say: By God! The glory of ministers and the might of princes and the palaces of kaisers and the pyramids of pharaohs shall pass away, while that which We have ordained for you in the Kingdom shall endure. Strive, O people, that your names may be mentioned before the Throne and there may appear from you that whereby your remembrance shall endure through the eternity of God, the Lord of existence. Make mention of My loved ones who are there, and greet their faces, and gladden them with that which hath been sent down for them from this praiseworthy station. Say: Beware lest the might of any oppressor frighten you. Soon shall the banners and standards perish, and ye shall behold the sovereignty of your Lord prevailing over the seen and the unseen. Beware lest the veils debar you from the bounty of this Day. Cast away that which withholdeth you from God and hold fast unto this Extended Path. We desire naught for you save that which is better for you, as recorded in the Preserved Tablet. We make mention of the loved ones most days, yet We find not from them that which beseemeth them in the precincts of the mercy of their Lord, the All-Merciful, the Forgiving, save as God willeth. He, verily, is the Powerful over what He willeth. He giveth and withholdeth. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. Take ye, O loved ones of the All-Merciful, the cups of life eternal from the hands of the favors of your Lord, the Lord of all possibilities. Then drink ye therefrom. By God! They shall so attract you that ye shall arise to make mention and utterance amidst the peoples of the worlds, and shall take possession of the cities of hearts in the name of your Lord, the Mighty, the Praised. We give glad tidings unto all of that which We have sent down in Our Most Holy Book, from whose horizon hath shone the sun of My commandments upon all who see and are seen. Hold fast unto it, then act according to that which hath been sent down therein. This is better for you than all that hath been created in the kingdom, did ye but know. Beware lest the affairs of creation sadden you and turn you away from the Truth. Ponder upon the world and its vicissitudes and changes, that ye may know its station and those who have turned unto it, turning away from that which hath been sent down in Our Preserved Tablet. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee, that thou mayest arise to make mention of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto this Sealed Wine.

Let him whom Muhammad-Rida observe - He is God, exalted be His glory, to Whom belong grandeur and majesty

May my soul be a sacrifice for Thy pure love! The letter of faithfulness which had issued forth from the source of truth and sincerity reached this evanescent servant, and from perusing it the utmost joy and gladness was obtained, for from all that was written therein were inhaled the sweet fragrances of the garment of divine love. Likewise were evident from that essence of contentment the signs of resignation and detachment from all else, and of orientation and sincerity toward the direction of our Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious. Praise be to God for having granted thee success and aided thee in what He desired, and made thee steadfast in His Cause, and established thee in His service, and given thee to drink in every moment from the Kawthar of His grace and the Salsabil of His bounty, from the cup of His glorious and beautiful remembrance.

After this servant attained the honor of receiving thy letter, I presented it in its entirety before the Most Sublime Vision. This is what shone forth from the horizon of care and bounty: "O Rida! God willing, mayest thou be successful through the bestowals of the All-Merciful at all times. Thou hast ever been and art remembered before the Countenance. All the services thou hast rendered in the path of God are remembered with Him and recorded in the holy Tablets. Grieve not over anything, be as thou wert, for He is with thee at all times." And concerning what was written about the honored travelers, upon them be the glory of God - all was presented before the Countenance. He said: "We beseech God to grant them success in acting according to what they have been commanded in God's lands and His kingdom."

Furthermore, if this servant, the attendant, wished to mention the favors shown to thee, in truth he finds himself incapable. This much I submit: that all thy troubles and services are remembered with God - not an atom of them has been or will be lost. Blessed art thou for having attained the favors of thy Lord and for having been mentioned by the Tongue of Grandeur and Power. In all conditions thou must be occupied with service, for this is the portion of existence: that it arise to serve its Lord. And exert the utmost effort and striving in creating harmony and unity among the friends, for this has been and shall ever be among the greatest of matters in the sight of God.

Furthermore, convey greetings and glorification on behalf of this servant to all the friends in that land, one and all, young and old. I swear by the Beauty of the Beloved that in all nights and days I have heard the mention of each one of them specifically from the Tongue of the Ancient of Days, and the manifestations of the infinite divine favors concerning all are evident and apparent. After the appearance of these enduring divine mentions concerning them, how can this servant venture to mention his own nothingness and evanescence in their service? Therefore I say with the tongue of all things: "Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds."

Convey glorification and glory to Muhammad-Hasan. God willing, his reply will arrive later. Glory be upon him and upon those who were with him.

The Servant of God

Tablet for Hasan and Husayn Nahri

Translation

By Jim Price

He is the Glorious in the Kingdom of Eternity

This is the tablet of the Primal Point for him who hath taken God as his protector. Who, when he perceived the Sun of Holiness from the horizon of that holy garment, lowered his gaze and fell to the ground.

Verily, those who have believed in God and in the return of His Primal Point in this Manifestation have been sanctified by God of all that is unseemly, and their Lord has enwrapped them in His mercy without bound. Say: "O people, fear God and follow not those who have fought Him, denied His testimony and away from Him have turned." Fear Him who is the Revealer of His Cause in this Day, arise to help Him who created you and fear not those who have disbelieved.

Say: "O people, do you still take your vain desires as your lord while

casting aside Him of whom every atom in creation testifieth 'there is no God

but He, the One, the Only'?"

O thou who bearest my name, listen to what the dove in eternity's midst doth say, and turn not toward those in whose hearts is hatred for this Beauty, so faithful and exalted. The sweet scents of the Rizvan of the All Merciful have captivated those who have believed and stood fast, and from the loving kindness of the Spirit they are nurtured.

Praise be to Him who hath revealed Himself so gloriously that His light has through all creation shined. Those endowed with spiritual insight testify that there is no God but He, the Peerless, the Everlasting, for to them His light as proof of His cause hath sufficed.

He hath revealed His verses as he willeth and desireth and in such wise that the sweet fragrances of His spirit have encompassed every horizon, which none can deny save those in whose hearts is envy and hatred.

Say "O people, fear God and turn a just eye to the testimonies of the Prophets and the Messengers. Beware lest ye deprive your own souls of the holy threshold."

Do not dare to refute the Truth with what knowledge you possess, for through My command was the Truth created. This is known only to those with sight refined.

And whosoever would deny the bounty of this Day hath nothing. They are those whose sight has died.

Say "O people, the mirrors of your hearts ye must purify, and your vision ye must rectify, ere you lose your way on this long and holy road."

And it is for this that we have given thee inspiration and revealed to thee our verses, that that mayest show thy mettle in the Cause of thy Lord, calling mankind to this path, for thee to be of those who are well guided.

Know then, that we have fallen beneath the sword of inequity brandished by those who have indeed replaced God with their vain desires, and so they have been scourged by One who is wise and well aided.

Thou must separate thyself from them and desire not their friendship. Seek for thyself, under the protection of thy Lord, a shelter fortified. Do not consort with those who have disbelieved and denied what they had accepted. Woe to the one who once believed and then rejected.

Rid thyself of all allusions that thou mayest speak plainly about the Possessor of all names and attributes. Well it is with them whom the veils of creation hindereth not from hearing the word of God, so the dove of the Spirit has warbled.

Upon thee be the Spirit of God and His might, and also upon all who have taken a lofty place within the shadow of their Lord.

O Most Generous, Most Glorious One! Have the verses been sent down? Say: Yea, by the Lord of the heavens! Has the Hour come? Nay, it has passed, and the Manifestor of clear proofs has come. The Inevitable has come to pass and the Truth has come with proof and evidence. The Wakeful One has appeared and creation is in turmoil and agitation. The earthquakes have come and the tribes have wailed out of fear of God, the Mighty, the Compelling. Say: The Deafening Blast has cried out and this Day belongs to God, the One, the Chosen. Has the Great Catastrophe been fulfilled? Say: Yea, by the Lord of lords! Has the Resurrection come to pass? Nay, the Self-Subsisting has appeared with the kingdom of verses. Do you see people lying prostrate? Yea, by my Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious! Have the tree trunks been uprooted? Nay, the mountains have been scattered, by the Lord of attributes. He asked: "Where are Paradise and Hell?" Say: The former is meeting Me and the latter is your own self, O doubting idolater! He said: "We see not the Balance." Say: Yea, by my Lord, the All-Merciful! None see it save those endowed with insight. Have the stars fallen? Yea, when the Self-Subsisting One was in the land of mystery - take heed, O ye who have eyes to see! All the signs have been fulfilled when We drew forth the hand of power from the bosom of majesty and might. The Herald has called out when the appointed time came, and those of Sinai were struck senseless in the wilderness of bewilderment by the awesome presence of thy Lord, the Creator of all things. The Trumpeter says: "Has the Trumpet been sounded?" Say: Yea, by the Sovereign of Revelation, when He was established upon the throne of His name, the All-Merciful! The darkness has been illumined by the dawn of thy Lord's mercy, the Source of lights. The breeze of the All-Merciful has wafted and souls have stirred in the tombs of their bodies. Thus has the matter been decreed by God, the Mighty, the Bountiful. The deniers asked: "When was heaven cleft asunder?" Say: While ye lay in the graves of heedlessness and error among the idolaters. Some rub their eyes and look to the right and left. Say: Sight has been blinded - there is no refuge for thee this Day. Among them is one who asks: "Have the souls been gathered?" Say: Yea, by my Lord, if thou wert in the cradle of vain imaginings! Among them is one who asks: "Has the Book been sent down according to nature?" Say: It is in perplexity - fear ye God, O people of understanding! And among them is one who asks: "Have I been raised up blind?" Say: Yea, O rider of clouds! Paradise has been adorned with the roses of inner meanings, and Hell has been kindled with the fire of the wicked. Say: The light has dawned from the horizon of Revelation and illumined the regions when the Lord of the Day of the Covenant came. Those who doubted are in loss, and he who turned with the light of certitude to the Dawning-Place of assurance has prospered. Blessed art thou, O thou who gazest upon what has been sent down to thee in this Tablet, by which spirits take flight. Preserve it, then recite it. By My life! It is a gate to thy Lord's mercy. Blessed is he who recites it at eventide and at dawn. We hear thy mention in this Cause whereby the mountain of knowledge was crushed and feet did slip. Glory be upon thee and upon all who have turned to the Mighty, the Bestower. It has ended but is not complete - be patient, for thy Lord is the All-Patient. According to the Most Holy Order, this Greatest Tablet was sent in exactly this form as it was revealed, and this evanescent servant says upon thee, O promulgator of God's Cause and one who mentions Him among all else, be the remembrance of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious, and the remembrance of all in the worlds.

O Most Great, Most Ancient One! Is it befitting to pause after the Beloved calleth out with the tongue of His Own Manifestation, saying: "Hasten with your hearts unto the court of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful"? Nay, by His very truth! Rather must every soul arise and say: "I believe in Thee, O Thou in Whose hand are the reins of all created things!" O Muhammad-'Ali! When thou hearest the Call from the Divine Lote-Tree raised upon the crimson hill, the seat of tribulation - God, there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Choosing - this is not the day for silence. Arise to praise thy Lord amongst His servants. This is the day whereon the trees have spoken, the leaves have cried out, and the tongue of thy Lord's will hath spoken in the kingdom of names. The sovereignty belongeth unto God, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Blessed is the eye that hath turned to the Most Sublime Vision, the face that hath turned to the Dayspring of Power, and the heart that hath been illumined by the lights of this Lamp. Leave creation behind thee and summon the servants unto the Cause which hath dawned and shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord's will, the Revealer of verses. Silence is praiseworthy except in the remembrance of thy Lord. Open thy tongue in utterance to remember thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen command thee from the presence of God, the One, the Mighty, the Compelling. The tongue was created for these days. Beware lest thou restrain it through vain imaginings. Speak forth in praise of thy Lord in such wise as to attract the spirits. It behooveth every soul in this day, when hearing the Call from the Most Exalted Horizon, to turn unto it and say: "Here am I, O Cleaver of the dawn!" Beware lest anything prevent thee from the remembrance of thy Lord. Stand firm through God's power and might, then reflect upon God's Messengers and what transpired in the past. Then shalt thou find thyself immersed in the ocean of certitude. This is the horizon from which hath shone forth the Sun of Certitude. By My life! If thou gazest with the eye of the heart, thou shalt see certitude itself circling round thy Lord's will, the All-Merciful. Thus have We revealed unto thee that thou mayest arise to aid thy Lord amidst all creation. Give thanks unto God for having sent down unto thee this Tablet from whose horizon hath shone the sun of wisdom and utterance. If thou recite it with the melody of the heart, it will attract thee to a station where thou wilt soar with longing and arise to help Him in such wise that through thee the breezes of the Divine Vesture will be wafted to all regions. Emerge from the horizon of certitude in the name of the Lord of Religions. Say: O peoples of the worlds! The divine fragrance hath wafted and the Promised One hath come with sovereignty and power. By God! This Prisoner desireth from this Tablet naught but thy mention and what is best for thee, and desireth naught but what God hath desired, and desireth for Himself naught but what hath been revealed in the Tablets. Know thou the worth of this bounty, then turn and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, for having remembered me through the tongue of the Dawning-Place of Thy Cause while He was wronged in the hands of the wicked ones. I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name which Thou hast made the ruler over all names, to aid me in Thy love and in helping Thy Cause and in detachment in Thy path in such wise that there may appear from me what befitteth Thy Cause. Then ordain for me what is best for me. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Help in Peril."

The Most Holy One! There has come before the Face a noble Book, which was read by a servant present in My court with the melodies of the sincere ones. When he read its first line, the eyes of the inhabitants of the cities of Names wept. Then arose a cry that filled creation. And at another line, sighs of sorrow burst forth from the hearts of those near ones, and grief seized the dwellers of this Ridvan who circle round the Face - the Spot whence waft the breezes of the All-Merciful upon the peoples of the worlds and the breaths of glorification upon all creation. And grief reached such a degree that the eyes of the Youth wept, both secretly and openly, for His love of thee, and the eyes of the people of the pavilion of glory and the domes of holiness in the presence of fellowship shed tears, and God was witness to that. And he who read it wept, and by his weeping increased the weeping of those who had sought shelter beneath the shade of the mercy of their Lord, the Most High, the Supreme. Blessed art thou for having been turned by the breezes of grace toward the right hand of justice and been made one of the sincere ones. Verily thy remembrance of thy Lord and thy seeking His pardon is better than the worship of most of the servants. To this beareth witness he who hath drunk of the most pure Salsabil from this wondrous Spring. And by thy sighing were consumed the hearts of those who soar in the atmosphere of nearness and holiness and beauty; then did the faces of the mystics turn pale. How wonderful are the winds of thy Lord's will, the All-Merciful, which blew upon thee and made thee purified from the defilement of the idolaters. I testify that thou wast born again from the breaths of the All-Merciful, and this is from the grace that nothing ordained in the heaven of destiny by the Mighty, the Powerful can equal. We beseech God to make thee a leader of His servants unto the paradise of God, the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful, and to raise up in thee that whereby the hearts of His creatures shall be attracted, that they may enter into the tabernacle of His mercy that hath encompassed all created things. We have found from thee at all times the sweet savors of faith, and thus it is preserved in a guarded Tablet of glory. When the appointed time came, that which was treasured within thee was revealed, and verily thy Lord knoweth all things. Arise and say: O people! Fear God and spread not corruption in the earth after it hath been set in order, and follow not those who desire naught but the desires of their own selves and have turned away from the Spot of nearness and are among the heedless. If they would heed that wherewith ye have been counseled in all the Tablets - thus doth this Youth command you from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Wise. He desireth naught in the kingdom save what God desireth. Open your eyes that ye may behold the Sun of Beauty of the Most High shining forth from this holy and luminous horizon. Soon shall ye arise from sleep and find not the Youth, and shall find yourselves in grievous loss. Seize ye the measure of My days and exchange them not for what ye possess. Fear Him in Whose grasp is the kingdom of all things. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Great. Thus have We inspired thee and made mention of thee at a time when We were in grievous sorrow. The Spirit and glory and splendor be upon thee and upon those who hearken unto thy word concerning God, thy Lord and the Lord of the noble Throne. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

7\. He is the Witness, Who heareth and is ready to answer!

O Abu ?alib! This Wronged One declareth: Praise be unto God that thou hast attained unto that which is the cause of thy honor in all the divine worlds. This abasement of thine is the pride of all glories. God willing, thine imprisonment and that of the other friends of God will become the cause and reason for the freedom and deliverance of the peoples of the world. For four months this Wronged One lay under chains and fetters in that same land. So grievous was His incarceration that no eye hath ever seen its like. Prior to that, for a brief duration, He was also thrown into prison, which place is the true abode of God's prophets and chosen ones. During the first imprisonment, which lasted but a short time, they showed Us kindness, but during the second imprisonment, they subjected Us to the most vehement cruelty and hatred. Nonetheless, under all conditions, We remained joyful and showed forth complete resignation and contentment, forbearance and tranquility.

O seeker in the path of God! Upon thee hath befallen that which befell this Wronged One, and thou hast followed His example in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. Were the peoples of the world to discover the delight of this abasement for the sake of God, they would one and all offer up their lives and souls in order to obtain it. The life of these days is fleeting, and its gay livery hindereth the people from pondering their end and final destiny.

Hearken to the voice of the Friend! By reason of thine abasement, wish not abasement for anyone. The station of those who are ever patient and thankful is most great. Seek not save the One True God, desire only Him, leave aside thine own will, and fervently set thy face toward the good-pleasure of thy Lord.

O Son of Nabil, upon him be My Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Ancient Beauty! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the Glorious One, from the Valley of Nabil. Verily, there is none other God but I, the Wronged One, the Stranger. Remember when thou didst enter the Most Glorious Presence and didst hear the melodies of thy Lord, the Most High, and didst attain that which flowed from the mouth of Grandeur in His most exalted words. Thou art assuredly among those who have attained. He admitted thee into His presence when all were forbidden from attaining unto the meeting and the oppressors had surrounded from every direction. Thus doth God single out for His grace whomsoever He pleaseth. He, verily, hath power over all things. Grieve not at anything. Place thy trust in all matters in God, thy Lord. He is with thee under all conditions and will aid thee with truth. He is the Guardian of the sincere ones. Should thou meet one in whom thou findest the fragrance of My love, recount unto him what thou knowest of the story of the Youth. Say: By God! He is verily the Wronged One Who hath been afflicted at the hands of the oppressors, and His plight became so severe that He banished all from His presence and dwelt alone in His house, detached from all the worlds. At the height of tribulation He sought no help from any soul. He remained steadfast in the Cause between the heavens and the earth. Forget not what thou hast heard from the tongue of Grandeur. Thus doth the Lord of the worlds command thee by virtue of thy presence before His countenance and thy burning in the love of God. God hath ordained for thee and thy kinsmen that which shall gladden the eyes of those endued with insight. Say: O my God! Praise be unto Thee for having caused me to hear Thy call and summoned me to the Manifestation of Thy Self and enabled me to enter the sanctuary of Thy reunion and the sacred precincts of Thy presence, and made me one of those who have attained. I beseech Thee by the wrongs suffered by the Manifestation of Thy Self to make me a champion of Thy Cause and one who speaketh Thy praise. O Lord! I am he who hath turned toward Thee, yet found not, through what the hands of the oppressors have wrought, an opportunity commensurate with that which would quench the thirst of remoteness with the Kawthar of Thy nearness and the burning of separation with the ocean of Thy reunion. I moreover beseech Thee, O Lord of eternity and Sovereign of nations, to ordain for me that which befitteth Thy grace and favors and to decree for me that which is best in Thy sight. Thou art indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Then cause me, O my God, to soar in Thy atmosphere and to be detached from all else but Thee. Then give me to drink from the Salsabil of Thy Revelation, whereof if one partaketh, the cawing of the infidels shall have no effect upon him. I have laid hold on the cord of Thy bounties and clung to the hem of Thy favors, gazing toward Thy grace and awaiting the wonders of Thy bestowals. Every limb of my body testifieth that Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. None can frustrate Thy command or prevent Thy decree. Thy Will hath encompassed all created things and Thy Purpose all contingent beings. The onslaught of the wicked cannot disable Thee, nor can the tyranny of the ungodly weaken Thee. Thou hast been supreme over all who are in earth and heaven and wilt continue to be as Thou hast been from time immemorial. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise. Cast upon me then, O my God, patience in my separation from Thee and tranquility in my remoteness from Thee, that I may be content with what hath been ordained by the Pen of Thy decree in the Tablets of Thy determination. Thou art verily the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.

O son of Attar! Praise be to God that thou art perfumed with the sweet-scented breezes of the verses of the Goal of all the worlds. Thy mention hath often been made in the presence of the Wronged One, and the glance of His loving-kindness hath been directed towards thee. Today the Ancient Beauty gazed from the Most Great Prison upon the mansion, making it the greatest vista, and after partaking of tea, We make mention of thee in this Blessed Tablet, each letter of which is a door among the doors of divine favor. We beseech God to aid thee, that thou mayest drink a cup from each letter and offer a chalice to others, that perchance the slumbering may awaken and the heedless may be adorned with the ornament of awareness. That which thou didst send in the name of Ali, upon him be My glory, was presented before Us and the glance of Our loving-kindness was directed towards it. Blessed art thou and blessed are they who have fulfilled God's Covenant and His Testament. Praise be to God that thou hast perceived the fragrances of God's days and attained unto that for which the world was created. His honor the Trustee, upon him be My glory, presented thy petition before Our presence. Verily We heard thy call and that wherewith thou didst commune with thy Lord and supplicate thy Master. He hath repeatedly mentioned thee and thy services. Blessed art thou and blessed are thy father and mother. Verily thy Lord is the All-Remembering, the Forgiving, the Generous. We send Our greetings from this spot to all who have attained Our presence, and have been blessed, and have heard and witnessed the greatest signs of their Lord. O Rahim! Be not grieved. Be enkindled with the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree. This world and all that is mentioned therein shall soon return to nothingness. Strive that there may appear from thee that which shall endure through the perpetuity of the Kingdom. We make mention of thy other brother and give him the glad-tidings of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds. Convey to all the household My greetings. The station of each one is visible before God. Verily He is with you, He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. The deeds of all on earth are visible before His face, and the words of all are heard. To this testify the Concourse on High and the dwellers of My Kingdom and My dominion. Convey greetings to all and give them the glad-tidings of what hath flowed from the Supreme Pen. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, and He is the Kind, the Mighty, the Great. Glory be upon you and upon those who have not denied what hath appeared from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having caused me to hear Thy call and guided me to Thy path and made me know the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation which was hidden in the eternity of eternities. I beseech Thee by it and by its sovereignty to make me adorned with the ornament of steadfastness and crowned with the crown of Thy remembrance and love. Thou art, verily, the One Who hath power through Thy power and dominion through Thy will. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Praised.

Ismu'llah mentioned the feast of the two leaves and it was accepted. Tonight, which is the twenty-first of Rabi'u'th-Thani, the feast is being held.

O Ruhani, upon thee be My Baha and My mercy and My loving-kindness! The Most Great Ocean hath, at this moment, willed to send thee a pearl from among the pearls of the shell of His bounty, mounted upon the form of a word, and the Palm Tree of Grace hath desired to send thee, as a gift, from among the fresh dates of inner meanings and utterance, and the Keeper of Paradise, who is named Ridvan, hath willed to send thee, in the form of letters, from among the fruits of the supreme Paradise. Each of these mentioned bounties and these recorded words is a speaking herald of divine grace and mercy and loving-kindness concerning that leaf. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this great bounty! Thy poetry in praise of the Peerless Beloved, and likewise thy prose, have been heard and honored with supreme grace. Blessed art thou and thy tongue, and blessed art thou and thy utterance! God hath heard thy call and what thou didst compose and recite out of love for God, the Single, the One, the Alone, the Self-Subsisting, Who begetteth not nor is begotten.

Today the rain of divine mercy is streaming and descending from the clouds of heavenly grace. The effulgences of the light of the Orb of His generosity have encompassed all existence, and the waves of the sea of benevolence have encompassed the world. Praise be to God, the peerless and incomparable pearl of divine love hath found its dwelling place in the treasury of the heart. The treasuries and riches and bounty and wealth of the world cannot compare with this testimony that hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed art thou, O my leaf and dawning-place of My love! Thou art she who hath taken the cup of bounty in the name of the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, and drunk therefrom through My mention, the Mighty, the Wondrous.

Say: O company of lovers! Today the horizons are illumined with the light of Beauty. Beseech ye God that He may aid you in that which beseemeth His bounty and generosity and His Revelation. Glory be to God! At every moment We behold Sinai in a different state: Batha is astir, the Holy City is soaring, and the land of the divine purpose is in motion. And the reality of existence speaketh with this word: "The world hath been illumined through the dawning of the Dayspring of Revelation. He, verily, is the Speaker on Sinai and the Caller in His Frequented Fane." This is the station which God hath made the point of adoration for such of His servants as are nigh unto Him, and for such of His creation as are sincere.

Give thou the glad-tidings to the handmaidens of that land from the Wronged One, and illumine them with the light of the Sun of divine utterance. We beseech God that He may adorn all with that which is the cause of the sanctification and glorification of His Cause. Verily, He is powerful over all things. O My leaf, upon thee be My Baha and My loving-kindness! The bounty of God is even as the sun, manifest and evident. Rejoice thou in this most exalted Word! We bestowed thy reasoned treatise upon Ali-Qabli-Akbar. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Thy mention hath ever been and will continue to be remembered. Rejoice thou once again in the cups of My bounty, and thank thy Lord for the chalice of My grace, and praise through the ocean of My generosity. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon My servants and My handmaidens who have cast aside their own desires, holding fast to My prevailing Will and My conquering Purpose and My wondrous Command.

Be firm in the Cause of God and in His love in such wise that the hosts of the world shall not deter thee. Thus doth the Most Great Name command thee from this glorious station. Say: O people! Adorn yourselves with the ornament of servitude unto God, the True One. By God, the True One! This is its day, did ye but know.

Convey My greetings unto her face and give her the glad-tidings of My remembrance of her, and unto the faces of thy children who have believed in God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy brother who hath been mentioned before the Throne. Blessed are ye both in that ye have heard and turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon. Thus doth God reward His servants who have spoken the truth and believed in Him when every rejected transgressor turned away. Then convey My greetings unto My loved ones there, that they may drink from My words the wine of My loving-kindness, soar in the atmosphere of My love, turn with their hearts unto My countenance and My horizon, and rejoice in what hath been sent down to them from My Pen. Upon them be My remembrance, My praise, My mercy and My forgiveness. Verily, thy Lord is the Bestower, the Compassionate, the Generous, the Mighty, the Loving.

In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!

O beloved of my heart! Today, which is Thursday the eighteenth of Dhi'l-Qa'dah, your letter dated the seventh of Shawwal arrived. Whenever your letter arrives, new joy becomes manifest and evident in the prison. You wrote that this servant had been negligent in responding to your letter. No, by the glory of our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the throne and earth! In the month of Shawwal two packets were sent. The first packet contained two letters from this servant and one sacred Tablet of revelation and two sacred Tablets specifically for two believers, as well as sacred, holy, and exalted Tablets for the loved ones of Asadabad, H.M. and Kermanshah, and in all the Tablets specific mention of you was revealed from the Pen of the Beloved. The second packet likewise in Shawwal contained divine Tablets and verses, and in all those Tablets too mention was made of you. Praise be to God, through His grace they have attained and through His bounty they are adorned. His mercy has encompassed that beloved one. For you and me and every believer to thank God for this great bounty and manifest generosity.

As to what you wrote about intending to visit the Holy Land, this was specifically presented before His Most Holy Presence regarding the honored Afnan, upon him be all the most glorious splendor of God. His blessed and exalted Word: "O Amin, upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness! Well done in what thou hast done. We love those who hearken to the words of Our Afnan. We beseech God to assist him in what he hath intended. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous."

By chance, on this day this servant had prepared and sealed a third packet in your name for sending when this new packet arrived. In any case, at all times this servant has sought and continues to seek exaltation, ascendancy, elevation and advancement for you. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer. In truth you have been confirmed in mentioning the friends and serving the Cause every day and every month. This is from God's bounty upon you. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.

Convey on behalf of this servant greetings, praise and mention to the spiritual beloved Ali-Qabli-Haydar, upon him be the glory of God. Likewise to Jenab-i-Beg, upon him be the glory and loving-kindness of God. We beseech for him joy from God, the Lord of the worlds. Let them not be saddened by what has befallen them - there has befallen them what has befallen the loved ones. What is meant is the grief and sorrow that has seized them in these days. Verily with difficulty comes ease. Relief and loving-kindness come from God, our Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful.

To the loved ones of God wherever they may be, this servant conveys greetings and seeks for each one that which will cause the exaltation of His Word. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those with you and those who hearken to your words for the sake of God.

O Abdullah Rubin Jehovah, His name is the God of all who are in the heavens and earth!

O inheritors of Moses! Hear the call of the Lord of Hosts which hath been raised in the world of creation from the prison of Akka, summoning you to His most glorious horizon. Blessed is he who hath cast away vain desire and laid hold on guidance, and woe unto every heedless doubter.

O Abdullah! The attraction of this Revelation hath seized the regions of the earth and their surroundings. Give thou the glad-tidings to the world of the God of Israel, through Whose manifestation the seas have yielded up the pearls of utterance from their shells, and the heaven of proof hath been adorned with its stars, and the mountains have brought forth their treasures and whatsoever was hidden within them by command of their Creator, and the earth its repositories and whatsoever was stored in its layers.

O Abdullah! On this day Sinai is filled with joy and Carmel is delighted and Jerusalem crieth out saying: "The gate of hope hath been opened and He Who was the goal of the former and latter generations hath come." The earth hath presented its treasures as an offering, and likewise the seas their pearls, and Jerusalem its mysteries, and the heaven of proof its ornaments. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto the divine fragrances on this luminous, spiritual day. Today the cry of Zion is raised aloft and the Holy City hath descended from the heaven of the grace of the One True God. Say: O Children of Israel, deprive not yourselves. The promise of God hath appeared, the light of His Word hath encompassed the world. Cast aside the weak cord and take hold of the mighty staff. Thy service and recompense have been recorded by the true scribes in the eternal book with the everlasting Pen. This is the glad-tidings for which the spirits of all else but God yearned and whose time of appearance they sought.

Hold fast to the Most Great Name wherein lie concealed all powers. He is the Deliverer, He is the Revealer of the hidden Cause and the Discloser of every mystery.

O Children of Israel! The God of Hosts declareth: This is the day of the Most Great Manifestation. Arise to serve. Power and might, glory and grandeur circle round about. Know ye its worth and recognize its station.

O Abdullah! The recompense of thy deeds, actions and words hath been inscribed by the divine Pen in the crimson scroll. Now must thou arise in the Name of Truth and stand firm in His love. This is the day of triumph and the day of service. The mention of this service shall never be erased from the Book - it is everlasting and eternal. I swear by the God of the world its fragrance shall never be cut off. That promised tabernacle hath been raised up in the name of the Lord of Hosts - visible and manifest. It hath not been changed or altered, for God the Lord hath raised it up. As thy service and labor are great in the sight of God, He hath therefore willed that thou shouldst enter and attain unto that blessed, mighty and glorious tabernacle and gain that which in God's knowledge hath no peer or likeness. Take up the staff of trust and turn thy face toward the gate of Palestine, that perchance thou mayest hear and become intimate with the melodies of the birds of Paradise.

O Haji Ibrahim, upon him be the peace of God. 5 Rama?an 1303.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power!

The servant testifieth that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been One, Single, Alone, Self-Subsisting, the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining, and will forever remain as He hath always been. In the beginning that hath no beginning, He is the One Who hath sent down the Books and dispatched the Messengers, that He might draw His servants nigh unto the highest horizon and make them cognizant of His path, His straight way, His Cause and His mighty Message. And may prayers and peace be upon the Point of Existence and the Lord of the kingdom of earth and heaven, Whom God hath made the Manifestation of His names and the Dawning-Place of His attributes and the Repository of His knowledge and the Source of His Command - He but for Whom nothing would have been created - and upon His family and companions who conquered the world through His Name and arose to aid His Cause and bore witness even as the tongue of His grandeur bore witness that there is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.

Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name, and by Thy mighty Message, and by the Dawning-Places of Thy Revelation, and the Manifestations of Thy Self, and the Day-Springs of Thy inspiration, to aid us in Thy remembrance and praise and in acting according to that which Thou hast commanded us in Thy Book. I beseech Thee, O Creator of the world and Quickener of the nations, by the lights of Thy Kingdom and Thy Dominion, and by Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones, and by Him through Whom revelation was cut off and Thy clear and straight path was made manifest, to ordain for us that which will remove us from all else save Thee and draw us nigh unto Thee. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest and within Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.

Thereafter, your letter was received, and at this hour, when six hours have passed from the fifth day of the blessed month of Rama?an, this ailing one, while fasting, is engaged in writing this letter that you might be gladdened thereby. God is witness and testifier that the friends have ever been and continue to be before our eyes. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to accept the unworthy deeds that have appeared and continue to appear in this blessed month, and to aid us in making up for what we have lost. Every deed that is performed for God's sake is acceptable and hath ever been and will continue to be the cause of success and prosperity. I convey my greetings to the friends in that land and beseech God to grant them the ability to perform good deeds and to acquire praiseworthy character. Although fasting is outwardly difficult and toilsome, inwardly it is a blessing and comfort. Refinement and training depend upon spiritual exercises - such spiritual exercises as are in accordance with the Book of God and are permitted by religious law, not those wherewith certain deluded ones have afflicted the people. Whatsoever hath been revealed by God is beloved of the soul. We beseech Him to aid us in that which He loveth and is pleased with. The two Pharaoh birds that you sent arrived. May God reward you. Indeed you took much trouble. While they were here also they endured many hardships. The deed was for God's sake and its reward too is with God. Peace and praise be upon you and upon God's sincere servants. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

That which the All-Merciful has spoken: If his honor J. departs, a Tablet will be sent specifically for both of them. Today we and they must all be mindful of God's Cause. If they are outwardly prevented from attaining His presence, no matter - God will grant them what He desires. If his honor Muhammad can establish a business in these parts it would be pleasing, however it would be more beloved if his companion, his honor Ali, returns to Iran, as lethargy and torpor have encompassed all regions, that perhaps he may become a cause of enkindlement. He said the plants of God's garden have withered from lack of water - someone must return to the Euphrates of the All-Merciful's mercy so that all may be refreshed by the sweet fragrances of the mention of their Chosen Lord. When drought intensifies, the springtime of grace arrives. Although Truth has Its servants under domes who are not distracted from God's remembrance by what was or will be, they are few, and these souls cry out "Are there any more?" For they are created from the breezes of divine love and must receive sustenance both outwardly and inwardly. Therefore if that person returns with the waves of the Most Great Sea, it will cause life, freshness and delicacy in the trees of the All-Merciful's garden. And certain Tablets specifically for the friends in various regions will be sent. O My Name! By My life, tribulations do not prevent Me from God's remembrance, nor do calamities stop Me from what He desires. In one of the Tablets was revealed: "I passed not by a tree but My heart addressed it saying: 'Would that thou wert cut down in My name and My body were crucified upon thee in God's path.'" By God! If the servants were to drink the wine hidden in this exalted word, it would suffice them and the intoxication of love would seize them to such degree as to detach them from all the worlds. Do they deny after witnessing that each morn the Youth faces tribulations beyond description? However God's loved ones in different regions must all conduct themselves with perfect wisdom and render assistance. No action should occur that would cause affliction to those souls, for if all are afflicted, who would call people to God? Therefore protection is necessary, and though God is powerful over what He wills, He loves these beloved ones to assist Him. The trials of the Ancient Beauty Himself suffice, and this very wondrous trial is itself assistance. Soon the people will recognize what they are veiled from today. The loved ones must engage in assistance with perfect wisdom. By God! The world laughs at those who have denied and occupied themselves with it, addressing them saying: "Soon will I disavow you. Are you content with that which has never been faithful to anyone like you? Woe unto you! Has anyone seen from me what you desire? Did those before you attain from me what would benefit them? Far from it! I left them all disappointed and at loss. Soon will I join you with the former ones." But O My Name! The heedless hear not its call and they do not perceive.

He is the One Warbling upon the Branches of the Divine Lote-Tree

Praise be to God Who hath manifested the Manifestation of His Self with a proof that hath encompassed all created things and a testimony whereby the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath been diffused throughout the contingent world, and Who hath revealed that which was hidden in knowledge and treasured in what He sent down in the Furqan. Praise be to God Who hath manifested one who hath proclaimed before all faces that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower. Through Him the trumpet was blown and the Herald proclaimed: "The Kingdom is God's, the Lord of Lords!" Blessed is the ear that hath heard the Call, and the eye that hath beheld the Most Glorious Horizon, and the hand that hath taken hold of the Book of God with such strength as the hosts of the rejectors and the might of every perfidious doubter could not deter. He hath arisen before all mankind with such arising as the chains of men could not impede.

O My Most Exalted Pen! Turn from the most eloquent tongue to the luminous language and speak in Persian, that all may understand and their hearts may be drawn. This Wronged One in the Most Great Prison hath hearkened to thy call and hath turned for the sake of God, that He might draw thee to the horizon whence shineth the Day-Star of the bounty of the Lord of existence. Today everyone must seek the Sealed Wine, must purify their ears with the water of detachment from all they have heard, and likewise cleanse their eyes from whatsoever is unworthy. Then let them contemplate the signs of God, detached from all else but Him. For ages and centuries the Shi'ih sect hath been occupied with the mention of names while remaining heedless and veiled from their Creator and Lord. Each day they cling to a deceiver and grasp the hem of one who sows doubt, warring amongst themselves. The recompense for these deeds became manifest on the Day of Reckoning, even as on the Day of Judgment they all assailed the Lord of Names with swords of rejection and spears of hatred. The divines of that people remain occupied to this day with rejection, revilement and cursing. By the life of God! The pulpits lament and the mosques wail and moan, yet ears that hear are lacking, save as God willeth. We beseech God to assist thee in shattering the idols of fancy and vain imaginings with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, that thou mayest wholly depart from that sect and exert mighty efforts to protect the servants, lest helpless souls become afflicted as before in the well of vain fancies.

Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having given me to drink from the cup of Thy knowledge and guided me to Thy path and illumined my heart with the light of Thy recognition and enabled me to turn to Thee and hold fast to the cord of Thy bounty. My Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy straight path and by Thy Great Announcement, whereby the hearts of the idolaters were troubled and the limbs of the heedless trembled, to assist me to arise for Thy Cause and to make mention of Thee and praise Thee amongst Thy servants. My Lord! Aid me to make up for what hath escaped me in Thy days. I testify with my outer and inner tongue that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee. Thou hast ever been powerful over whatsoever Thou hast willed through Thy word "Be" and it is. Verily we are God's and to Him shall we return.

O honored beloved! May His Holiness S.M. \[upon him be the Most Glorious Baha\] take note:

In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted Lord! Praise be to God, the tongue of Whose grandeur speaks in all conditions that which was spoken before the creation of the heavens and earth - that there is no God but Him, the One, the Bestower. He sent down the Book as a grace from His presence and ordained therein what befits man. Exalted is the All-Merciful, the Master of the Day of Return. And blessings and peace be upon those who, through their blood, aided God's Cause, raised up His law, and spread His signs throughout the realms and lands.

That which that beloved one sent was received. Its expression was the dawning-place of a new utterance and its mention was the source of joy and gladness. After presenting this, this most exalted Word was revealed from the highest horizon - His blessed and exalted Word: "Grieve not over anything. Trust in all matters in God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Then consider them with wisdom and utterance. He will assist you and teach you what He desires and will deliver you as a grace from His presence. He is the Powerful, the All-Bountiful. We have heard your mention and praise and humility and submissiveness and supplication, and We have remembered you with that which cannot be described by pens. We beseech God not to withhold from you the stream of His mercy which has preceded all created things. Glory be upon you and upon My friends in those parts who were not stirred by the tempests of the heedless and their words and deeds in the days of God, the Lord of all men."

When His Holiness's letter arrived, an answer was hastened with utmost speed, that perhaps news might reach His Holiness Ism'ullah, as it has been some time since any outward token of favor has been shown to them from the Most Holy Court, although all that is revealed is replete with mention of them. However, due to wisdom, nothing has yet been sent to the prison. Therefore now, briefly, several Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of favor and sent to them and also to those souls mentioned in their letter - let them deliver these to them. A detailed letter from this servant bearing divine utterances was sent from another direction - God willing that too will arrive. However, that beloved one must exercise great discretion, that is, regarding the companions in the land of Ta, for if it spreads in that land there is danger of harm to the prisoners and others. Several Tablets were also revealed specifically for the friends of that land - God willing they will be sent. And the gentlemen who were mentioned in that beloved one's letter have all been blessed with mention by the True One, glorified be His majesty. Perfect favor has been shown to each one, manifest and evident. God willing its effects will become visible and apparent in the land like standards. This evanescent one also expresses nothingness and evanescence in service to all, especially in service to the honored gentleman, the illustrious Nabil, upon him be the Most Glorious Baha. The Glory shining from the horizon of grace be upon your honor and upon God's loved ones and chosen ones who remember Him at eventide and dawn. And praise be to God, the Master of the Day of Separation.

In the Name of Him Who is the Guardian over all names! The Mother Book on the Day of Return proclaims: O learned ones, recognize the value of this Day! This is that Day which the Torah foretold in the revealed words "Lead forth the people from darkness into light and remind them of the Days of God." And the Desired One of all worlds declares in the Qur'an: "The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds." Each of the divine Books is adorned with His mention and bears glad tidings of His appearance. This is the Book that has no likeness or equal, and from which all books have appeared and to which they return. O people of God! The Most Great News has appeared and the wondrous Light shines forth. Gird up the loins of service and strive, that perchance those who are heedless may become aware of the Most Great News and hold fast to that which God has willed. This Wronged One remembers you in the nights and days. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to make each of you appear as a brilliant and radiant light among His servants, that all may follow your goodly deeds and praiseworthy character, and attain the station of nearness and the word of divine good-pleasure. O son of Dhabih! Upon thee and those with thee be My glory! Thou hast ever been remembered and, God willing, shall continue to be. Repeatedly have thy letters reached the Most Holy Court and been seen and heard. Grieve not over anything, but in all matters place thy trust in God, the Lord of Revelation. Some time ago the petition of the handmaiden of God, upon her be My glory, arrived. Indeed hardship has befallen, but first His Honour Haji, upon him be My glory, among the Afnan, must be consulted, and after receiving news and information, they may proceed to their ultimate goal and highest aim. In these days the affairs of the Afnan were somewhat disrupted and suspended, as the transactions in various regions, due to the treachery of certain covenant-breakers, were seen to be without effect or fruit. Therefore, no blame lies or has lain upon them. Say: My God, my God! Aid the treacherous to be trustworthy, the slanderers to be truthful, and the polytheists to return to the Tree of Thy oneness and the gate of Thy forgiveness and bounty. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Convey My greetings to the mother, sister and relatives, and illumine them with the splendors of the light of the Day-Star of divine utterance. We beseech God to aid and assist His Honor 'Ali, upon him be My glory, and to grant him success, and through His grace to open before him the gates of hope, bounty and wealth. He is the Powerful, the All-Able. There is no God but Him, the Most Glorious, the Most Luminous. We beseech the Causer of causes to manifest that which is the means of exaltation and elevation, and the cause of true profit and spiritual commerce. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the Lamp of Thy Cause, which hath taken neither glass nor guard nor veil for its protection, to ordain for us that which will gladden our hearts and tranquilize our souls. Then open before our faces, through the key of Thy name the All-Bountiful, the gates of Thy mercy and loving-kindness. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bestowing.

O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Hearken to the call of the Stranger when He was crucified upon the cross through that which the hands of the wicked ones who had not tasted the sweetness of faith nor drunk the choice wine of life in the days of their All-Merciful Lord had wrought. That which thou didst send hath come before Us. Blessed art thou for having desired to make mention of thyself in the presence of the Wronged One while He was in the hands of the wicked ones. Grieve not at this, but know thou and be assured that neither the plotting of those who have disbelieved nor the treachery of those who have turned away from God, the Lord of all beings, can harm Us. We summon the servants in all conditions unto the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Be thou steadfast with the steadfastness of thy Lord, then walk in His footsteps with wisdom. Thus doth thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, command thee. Make mention of those around thee on My behalf and give them the glad-tidings of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Lord of creation. If thou seest Ali, glorify him on My behalf. Say: Blessed art thou for having been faithful to the Covenant. He remembereth those who have turned unto Him and nothing escapeth His grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Hold fast unto the cord of wisdom amidst all people and place thy trust in Him. He is with those who have turned unto Him and He is the Friend of the righteous. We love to make mention of those who have become strangers in the path of God and who have wandered through the lands in His love. The glance of loving-kindness hath been directed towards you and His grace is with you, O concourse of the loved ones! Give thanks for the Pen having moved to make mention of you after the Ancient Beauty was in the most desolate of lands. If thou seest Mim give him the glad-tidings of his Lord's mention of him, the Ancient One. Say: Remember when thou wert present before the Countenance and didst hear that which the Tongue of God, the Mighty, the Generous, did speak. Grieve not at being a stranger - thy home is in My presence. We testify that ye are among those who dwell beneath His shadow. Rejoice at God's testimony, for naught in the heavens or on earth can equal it. Then remain steadfast in what thou art and glorify thy Lord with praise at all times. Forget not God's bounties and favors. Be mindful of the tales of this Stranger, then give Ha the glad-tidings of that which the Supreme Pen hath moved with, that he may rejoice within himself and be of the thankful ones. We make mention of the loved ones of God in the prison and enjoin them to fear God in the kingdom of creation, though the idolaters oppose Us. O servant! Hearken unto the call from this Spot that hath been raised between earth and heaven. Verily there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Be thou steadfast in the service of thy Lord and act according to that which thou hast been commanded by the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Begin thy day with the remembrance and praise of God, then end it with this praised Name. Would that thou knewest the state in which thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, calleth thee! By My life! Were it to be revealed thou wouldst lament, but the matter hath been concealed through that which hath been inscribed in a preserved tablet. We beseech God to assist you in His service and His good-pleasure and to guide through you those servants who have wandered in the wilderness of heedlessness and were of the deluded ones. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the Name of our Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted

O My beloved! I have known what hath befallen thee and what hath been decreed for thy countenance, and have heard the secret melodies and spiritual lamentations behind the pavilions of thy heart, and am apprised of what hath descended upon thee and come to pass with thee, and have reckoned thy patience in God and thy tranquility in Him and thy steadfastness in His Cause. Know thou that whatsoever hath been decreed for thee was only that thou mightest follow the friends of God in that which was ordained for them as the immutable practice of God - in the hardships and afflictions that touched them and that which none can reckon save God alone. And all this befell them only because of their detachment from the world and its ornaments and embellishments. Know thou, furthermore, that were the world to possess any worth in the sight of God, He would not have surrendered it to its people, nor would His chosen ones have cast themselves into the hands of the wicked, to do with them as they pleased and visit upon them whatsoever they desired. Thus recognize thou the station of tribulation in the path of thy Lord. By God! Were the veil to be lifted from the face of this Cause, thou wouldst witness the arrow of destiny and the spear of divine decree to be dearer in the sight of God than the hereafter and all that was before it, for through this the essence of detachment and the lights of creation appear, and spirits ascend to the canopy of eternity and the Divine Lote-Tree in the highest Paradise. And thou, know thou the worth of that which God hath graciously bestowed upon thee and granted thee through His bounty, in that He caused to shine upon thee the lights of the morn of oneness and the wondrous manifestations of the dawn from the divine horizon, and exalted thee until thou didst walk upon the air and attain to that station wherein thou didst drink from the chalices of certitude and discover the essence of inner meanings in the garden of utterance, the pole of Paradise, and didst soar on two wings of love to the uttermost degrees of nearness and didst hear the glad-tidings of reunion from the realm of might and holiness, as if thou didst perceive the melodies of the Divine Essence from the Eternal Dove, whereby thou wert immersed in the lights of beauty and freed from the veils of glory, and didst arrive at the seats of spirit and rapture and attainment. By thy life! Wert thou to don this shirt that hath been woven from the iron of words and the steel of allusions, thou wouldst be independent of all who are in the heavens and on earth, and of all that appeareth from the hearts of created things and the minds of abstract realities, and it would preserve thee from the darts of doubts and arrows of idle fancies, and from every tribulation and affliction, and from all that appeareth in the kingdom of creation and the realm below. Thus doth He preserve whom He willeth through His power, and verily He hath power over all things. Therefore clothe with the silk of glorification whomsoever thou willest, then gather them unto the Cause, then inhale from this shirt the fragrance of attraction that it may draw thee to the precincts of holiness from the Lord of lords, that thou mayest be numbered among the people of the spirit in the Concourse of Manifestation, with glory mentioned, from the letter "H" after the letter "B."

O Hussein in Sad, He is the Mighty, the Everlasting! O Hussein, bear witness with your self, then with your tongue, then with your heart, then with your essence that there is no God but Him and that Ali before Muhammad was the Manifestation of His Beauty, the Dawning Place of His Glory, the Mine of His Revelation and the Source of His Knowledge for all who are in the heavens and earth. Through him was established the Divine Unity and appeared the Beauty of Divine Singleness, and the Dove sang upon the branches of the Lote-Tree of Eternity that there is no God but Him, the All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate. Know then that your letter came before Us and We learned what was therein, for We were well-informed, and We answer you with these verses which have rendered the learned powerless. Say: O people, fear God and corrupt not the earth, and be not of the corrupt ones. And when the verses of God are sent down unto you, make them not an object of mockery, and be not of the heedless ones. Know then that We desired not to reveal Our countenance to anyone while We were among the servants, and none knew Us, for We were behind a mighty veil. But when the idolaters imprisoned Us in this remote prison, We therefore rent asunder the veils of concealment and revealed the Face like the manifest, radiant Sun, that thereby might be consumed the hearts of the deceivers and might increase the faith of the unitarians. Say: By God, from the Ancient Sovereign hath descended upon this Pen a word at which the heavens and earth would be cleft asunder, save whom thy Lord willeth, the Mighty, the Everlasting, the Inaccessible. Thus sang the Dove unto thee that thou mightest become aware of that which was concealed from every possessor of clear sight, and become steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord, and trustworthy in His messages, and find joy in thine essence and self, and be upon the Path with clear certitude. Know then that We forgot thee not before, nor have We forgotten thee in this Prison which lieth behind mighty mountains. We beseech God that He may enable thee in the Cause and raise thee to the Holy Seat, a faithful station wherein thy foot shall not slip from the Cause than which nothing is more mighty, and was greater than every great thing. And the Spirit and Light and Glory and Radiance be upon thee and upon those with thee from this day unto the Day of Judgment.

O Hussein in Sad, He is the Mighty! It hath been known to that honored one that the purpose of creation hath ever been and shall ever be the knowledge of God, and this knowledge dependeth upon the recognition of His servants who perceive the Truth through their own vision and heart and nature, for imitation sufficeth not, whether in acceptance or rejection. If thou attainest unto this most glorious and most exalted station, thou shalt reach the Greatest Perspective, which is the station of steadfastness after striving in God. This is the guidance thou didst seek, and We have sufficed with these two words which are from the jewels of God's consummate wisdom, and were any to turn unto them he would be independent of all who are in existence. And God sufficeth as a witness.

O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of the loved ones of God in the land of Ta \[Tehran\] who have not been deterred in the path of God by the censure of any critic, nor by the intimations of any polytheist, nor by the turning away of those who were in manifest delusion. Hearken to My call from the direction of My Most Great Name, which speaketh from this remote station. We counsel you with the most sublime call, whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of Names, may be exalted. He, verily, is the All-Knowing Expositor. Hold fast unto what is good and vie ye with one another in good deeds. Thus have ye been commanded by God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed are your hearts for what they have recognized, your hands for what they have grasped, your tongues for what they have testified, your faces for having turned, your eyes for what they have beheld, and your ears for having heard My most sweet call which hath been raised from this luminous spot, the station which God hath made the seat of His mighty throne. Ye are they who have outstripped all others in creation in turning towards My most exalted horizon. Blessed is the river that hath attained unto you and the houses from which your voices have been raised in remembrance of God, the Goal of them that know. The first counsel We have enjoined upon Our loved ones in the Book is the Most Great Steadfastness. Blessed is he who hath held fast unto it and attained its pure wine through My Name, the All-Compelling, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

God willing, may all the friends partake with the utmost joy and fragrance of the wine of divine revelation - a partaking that knoweth no end and whose thirst shall never seize it. And likewise may they be ignited by the fire of the divine Word - an ignition that shall know no cooling nor experience extinction. All must, through divine assistance and in perfect unity, gather at the table of the love of the All-Merciful, regard their aims as one and their purposes as united, vie with one another in service, and exert their utmost endeavor. I swear by the pure hearts and upright souls that these mentioned matters are of benefit to the world of good repute as water is to earth.

His honor Siyyid Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, is among those souls who have turned to the most exalted horizon and received their portion from the Sun of inner meanings. They have drunk repeatedly from the ocean of reunion and attained the lights of the Divine Countenance, and have taken their share time and again from the cup of trials in the path of the love of God, exalted be His glory and might. Therefore, let those souls who have taken shelter beneath the Divine Lote-Tree and are free and detached from the world and all therein strive to improve his affairs. We counsel those who have drunk of the Living Waters to look after his affairs according to their capacity. He is verily the Trusted Teacher.

At present they dwell in the Prison-land and circle round the Throne. O My loved ones! Take hold of My Book with the power bestowed by Us and place your trust in the One, the All-Informed. We behold from Our most exalted horizon those who have arisen to act according to what was ordained in My perspicuous Book. God willing, may all the loved ones of God be enabled to act according to His good-pleasure. Let Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Rahim and Aqa Abdul-Husayn exert their utmost endeavor in what hath been mentioned. The Glory be upon you all.

O Name of God Sin! He is God, the Ever-Living, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting! O Word of Love! I loved thee before there was a "before," ere the heavens were created, or the earth inhabited, or the mountains raised up, or the rivers flowed, or the trees planted, or the fruits appeared. And Adam was in the clay of love between the water and the light, and the spirits were walking in the air, and the holy temples were coursing through the heaven, and the souls were bewildered in the cloud, and this divine Youth was mounted upon the white cloud within the shadows of Beauty in the hiding-place of Glory, and in His hand was a pillar of light upon the temple of the Spirit. And He passed by thee like lightning flashing from the clouds - nay, faster than that - while thou wert standing in the land of symbols, at Horeb of the Command, Mount Paran, Sinai of the limits, Seir of existence. When I passed by thee, I removed the veil from My face; thereupon the heavens and earth shone forth. And thou didst know Me after I had known thee, and thou didst witness Me after I had witnessed thee. Then thou didst call to Me in the secret of thy heart and sought guidance from Me. Thereupon I took thy hand and raised thee to a station where thou didst hear the melodies of the birds moving in the unseen cloud beyond the pavilions of eternity at the axis of the sea of grandeur, the ocean of majesty. And I brought thee into the fortress of God, the Ever-Living, the Ancient King, after thou hadst believed in God, the Exalted, the Great. Were it not for Him, we would not have known the paths of guidance, and were it not for Him, we would not have reached this divine and goodly City. Therefore we thank God for what He hath given us through His bounty and honored us through His favor. Verily, He is the King, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. And after this, I have read what was sent from thee and understood what thou didst indicate in thy words, and I have answered thee now with the most excellent composition possible, that the birds of love may stir in thy breast and the cock of divine identity may move in thy heart, and bring thee to a station where thou wilt not be able to remain still in thy love or patient in thy station, and thou wilt be a wayfarer unto God in thy inmost self and an emigrant unto Him in thy being, that thou mayest reach the ultimate goal in the heaven of radiance and be among those who dwell therein. And as for what thou didst write and mention regarding the loved ones who have believed in God and His signs, We have heard their mention and their call, and We have known their condition. Therefore clothe them, both men and women, in silken garments from the pure substance of "God is Most Great," and give them glad tidings of the light of God, the Pre-existent, the Ever-Living, the Ancient. Verily, He will reward them with the most excellent reward and will assist them with the light as He willeth. Verily, He is, in truth, powerful over all things. And as for what thou didst write regarding the transgression of the servants and their rebellion against the bounds of God and their turning away from what was ordained in the Book, write for them a tract on the laws and send it to them, that they may remember and not transgress the bounds of God. And the light be upon thee and with thee and for thee and from thee and upon those who follow thee in the Cause of thy Lord, which was sent down from the "H" after the "B."

O Muhammad, upon thee be the Most Great, Most Ancient, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Glory of God! O Mim! Hearken unto the Call from the Divine Lote-Tree planted upon the crimson hill, from the Lord of Destiny. Verily there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The door hath been closed by thy Lord's command, then opened through His Name, the Mighty, the Beloved. Reflect upon what hath befallen the Dawning-Place of thy Lord's power, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. The matter hath reached such a pass that We were prevented from approaching the door from which no seeker was ever barred nor any pilgrim ever turned away. This is what We mention outwardly, but inwardly the door was never closed nor shall it ever be closed, by My Name whereby We have subdued all creation. Say: This is a door before which every possessor of a mighty throne doth stand, a station wherein the Faithful Spirit rendereth service. By God! Were thou to hearken with the ear of inner nature, thou wouldst hear its atoms proclaim: "The Beloved of the mystics hath appeared!" Were the Most Exalted Pen to move perpetually by thy Lord's leave, the Lord of Names, in description of this most exalted station and this spot wherefrom the sweetest of all calls hath been raised, it would find itself still at the beginning of its description. Thus doth thy Lord teach thee from this glorious vista. O Ha! Hearken once again unto the Call from the Divine Lote-Tree which hath been raised by God's leave, the Lord of Names. Verily there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the Powerful. Blessed is he who hath truly hearkened - verily he is of the people of Baha, inscribed in a Tablet sealed by this luminous Finger. And he who hath heard hath cast the world behind him and names to his left, turning with a most pure heart toward the station which God hath made the seat of this mighty Throne. Thus hath the Pen of Eternity moved by command of the Creator of Heaven upon this Tablet adorned with the ornament of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the All-Forgiving, the Merciful. Give thanks unto God for having adorned thy head with His wise remembrance and thy temple with the garment of His favors. Verily He ordaineth as He pleaseth. We counsel thee to remain steadfast in this Cause whereby all who dwell in the kingdom of names were thunderstruck, save those whom the hand of grace did seize by My leave, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Thus hath the Pen sprinkled upon thee from the ocean of thy Lord's loving-kindness. When thou attainest, say: "Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds, for having turned toward me the gaze of Thy favor and mentioned me when I was immersed in an ocean of sorrows through what befell Thee at the hands of the oppressors." O Pen! Take hold thy reins. By God! We behold existence thunderstruck at this moment by Thy mention and utterance. Among them We see some who have been seized by the wine of thy Lord's utterance, and others seized by the throes of death from the sweet fragrances of the Spirit. Thus hath a portion been ordained for every soul from thy Lord's Book, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Behold how that which was the cause of life became the cause of death. When thou knowest this station, thou wilt understand the mysteries of thy Lord's word according to thy measure. Verily He is the Expositor of all things, and with Him is a preserving Book. O Dal! Give thanks unto God and praise Him for having honored thee with His presence, admitted thee before His throne, and caused thee to dwell near Him. Thus doth He single out whom He willeth by a command from His presence. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O Dhabih, I speak in the Persian tongue so that whoever wishes may attain its meaning. Today is the Day when all who are in the heavens and earth are present in one place before God. Therefore, whoever has detached himself from all save God and soared in the holy divine atmosphere is mentioned before God as being among the people of the highest Paradise, and whoever has hesitated is counted among the people of the lowest abyss. God has never had and will never have any relation or connection with anyone. Whoever turns to Him is counted as being of Him, and apart from that has been and will be unmentioned. I swear by the Sun of the heaven of inner meanings that there has not been and is not in this heart anything except the dawning rays of the Morn of eternity, and to the extent possible, nay beyond that, I have strived to aid the Cause of God and for twenty years have never seen comfort or rest, and God is sufficient witness to this. Until, by God's might and power, the Cause was exalted and this servant arrived at this Most Great Prison. After that God is witness to what has befallen Me from one for whom, by God besides Whom there is no God, I exerted mighty efforts night and day for his protection, education and training. When I became assured of his character, he arose to kill Me. The hand of divine power prevented what he intended. Afterward he spread abroad what he had done and made accusations against this servant such as no one has ever made against another, sending these to all regions, such that today some of his writings have been sent from various places and are present before Me. Say: O servants! I swear by the Sun of the morn of holy transcendence that what he has mentioned is pure falsehood and he had no purpose except to cast hatred of this servant into hearts. Whoever has doubts should come to this land to become informed of matters which no one has understood. Although every person of insight perceives that all he has written about this servant has been and will be pure lies and calumny, since not all people possess insight, they must not be content with conjecture. And since it is not possible for all to come to this land, and it would cause harm, therefore two fair-minded persons should come and become informed of all matters and inform the people, so that God's proof may be completed for all. Otherwise, verily thy Lord is independent of the worlds. In brief, the harm done to this servant is greater than can be mentioned. I complain of my anguish and grief unto God, for He is the best helper and protector.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and Power

After offering praise and glorification to the Beloved of the worlds and salutations upon the honored loved ones - upon them be God's peace - it is submitted that for some time there has been no news from that honored brother. Every soul who turns from that direction to this direction makes most complete and perfect inquiries about your circumstances. God willing, you are in perfect health and well-being, occupied with the mention of God, exalted be His glory. In all conditions we servants must be occupied with that which causes the appearance of the stations of love, wisdom, faithfulness and human qualities and conditions. And I beseech God to confirm us - verily He has power over all things and He is the Hearing, the Answering One.

Jinab-i-Aqa Ghulam-'Ali and Aqa Lutfu'llah have arrived and praise be to God they are safe and well. This servant requested Jinab-i-Aqa Lutfu'llah to come to the garden for certain reasons, after which Aqa Ghulam-'Ali also arrived, and now by God's grace and bounty both intend to be occupied in this land. In any case, this servant supplicates for good and blessing and bounty for them.

The letters sent to you from Iran were read repeatedly. The flame of love appears to emanate from their every limb - their hearts have melted in separation. You should send them a reply, and from here also it is hoped that, God willing, a messenger will be found and a Tablet sent. Convey greetings and praise on behalf of this evanescent servant to the friends in that land. God willing, may they be eternally mentioned in the Kingdom of Names. Do not consider this statement impossible, for if a person in their life becomes occupied with and achieves good deeds and praiseworthy character, their mention is adorned with the ornament of perpetuity, and as long as mention remains, life remains, as mentioned in previous accounts.

I send greetings to the light of my eyes Aqa 'Inayatu'llah and their sister. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to preserve them all - verily He has power over all things. Peace and mercy and praise be upon you and your family and upon every steadfast believer. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.

The Servant, 3 Rabi'u'th-Thani 1300

Four letters were sent - truly it is a burning fire and had a great effect upon this servant. You should write to give them the glad tidings of the Tablet and the appearance of the favors and kindnesses of the Intended One regarding them. Blessed are they, as their remembrances were present and they were mentioned in that which its traces and fruits will endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. This evanescent servant sends greetings with a hundred thousand tongues and expresses pure sincerity in service to them. Glory be upon them.

They have requested a receipt for twenty tumans - you should write and send it so that it can be sent.

O Asadu'llah, upon him be the Glory of God! In the name of the Everlasting Knower! Praise be unto the Eternal Beloved Who is worthy and deserving, Whose all-encompassing mercy hath preceded all created things and Whose grace hath encompassed all beings, and Who hath caused the hidden treasure and concealed mystery to appear manifestly and brilliantly amidst all creatures with utmost oppression, in such wise that no matter hath prevented Him from His will and no veil hath concealed Him. From the most exalted horizon He proclaimed "Verily I am the Lord of all beings" and from the dawning-place of the prison He declared "Verily the prison is God's." At all times He hath bestowed the living waters upon the people of the contingent world and in all instances caused the Kawthar of utterance to flow from the fountain of the Most Merciful Name. Nevertheless the people remained veiled and heedless, deprived and forbidden from this mighty gift and these infinite bounties. Pass by the people of the Furqan and observe the party of the Bayan, how some have objected to the Truth saying He hath claimed Divinity. Fie upon them and upon what their tongues have uttered! God hath sealed their hearing and their sight. They have not yet understood that the advent of the Prophets culminated in the Manifestation of God, as the Point of the Bayan foretold: "Verily He speaketh in all things: 'There is no God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.'" Would that they had understood as much as the people of the Furqan, for that group acknowledged the cry "Verily I am God" that was raised from the Tree, yet they remain heedless of the bounty of this Day. This is the Day wherein the Friend declared "my heart is at rest" and Moses uttered the words "I have attained unto Thy presence." Observe the baseness of those souls who have failed to comprehend even the tradition well-known and accepted among the people of the Furqan which states "I am He and He is I" and so forth. God willing, ye must be set ablaze with the fire of the Divine Word in such wise that the veils of the vain imaginings of the people of the Furqan and the people of the Bayan may all be consumed and they may become illumined with the lights of recognition. May they abandon the sayings of the past and hold fast unto that which is manifest. In truth most people are withered, nay rather dead. Ye must draw these forsaken souls unto the Kingdom of eternal life through the fragrances of the Merciful Raiment. He verily will aid thee in all conditions. He verily hath power over all things. Thy letter was received and the fragrance of love was inhaled therefrom. God willing, may ye ever be mindful of His remembrance and speaking His praise. We have remembered thee before and remember thee now. Thy Lord is verily the Rememberer, the Manifest, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to make thee a helper of His Cause, speaking His praise and giving drink unto His servants. He is verily the Almighty, the Protector, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And the Glory be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God and His signs on this Most Holy and Wondrous Day.

He is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise

Praise that is sanctified above the understanding and recognition of all who dwell within the realm of possibility beseemeth the Goal of all the worlds, Who was not prevented by the tyranny of the world and the might of the peoples from uttering the blessed words "Verily I am God." The Most Exalted Pen crieth out with the most loud voice at the midmost heart of the world. Glory be unto Him! Glory be unto Him! How great is His power, how perfect His proof, how mighty His testimony!

O Rafi'-i-Badi', upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy which have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. We have made mention of thee through verses that all the books of the world cannot equal, and have caused them to endure in My mighty Book. Their fragrance shall never cease to be diffused, as testified by this Speaking, this Manifest Book.

O Rafi', upon thee be My wondrous remembrance. I speak the truth when I say that this is a Day of joy and delight. Joy from what? From the Kawthar of inner meanings on this luminous, spiritual Day. Hearken unto My call, then take the cup of gladness in My Name and drink therefrom before the faces of My servants - once in My Most Glorious Name, through which the heaven of idle fancies was cleft asunder, and again in My Most Great Remembrance, whereby the earth of the hearts of the peoples was rent asunder.

Reflect upon thy Lord's power and dominion. We have raised up servants in the land of Ba and manifested them with such steadfastness as hath caused the limbs of the idolaters and the perverse to quake with fear. Soon shalt thou witness the effects of what hath appeared through them. Verily thy Lord is the Knower of the unseen and the seen. With Him is the knowledge of all things in His perspicuous Book.

Grieve not over the happenings of the world, and fear not the oppression and might of princes. By My life! That which We behold today shall perish, but there shall abide for thee My glorious and beauteous remembrance. Know thou that My Most Great Branch made mention of thee before, and at this time We make mention of thee through this Tablet from whose horizon shineth forth the Day-Star of thy Lord's tender mercy, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

We have heard thy call and have answered thee, and have answered thy remembrance by making mention of thee. Rejoice thou in this perfumed, mighty and wondrous utterance. My Afnan, upon whom rest My glory and loving-kindness - he who hath chosen for himself a station beneath My shade and hearkeneth unto My verses at the time of their revelation - hath sent a letter which I had sent to him, and he hath attained unto My presence, My hearing and My glance. Thy Lord loveth him who hath loved Him, and ordaineth for him that which was hidden and treasured with Him and concealed from the eyes of the deniers. He desired to make mention of thee, so We have revealed for thee that which hath attracted the hearts of them that have recognized Him.

When thou hast succeeded in hearkening unto My call and reading what We have sent down from My kingdom, say:

"My God, my God! Unto Thee be all glory, for that Thou hast made me to know Thee and taught me and shown unto me Thy manifest path and Thy mighty Message. I beseech Thee by the Most Great Mystery enshrouded in mystery, and by the lights of Thy most great Throne, and the mysteries of Thy manifest Book, to make me a banner of Thy Name amidst Thy creation and one who standeth in service to Thee in Thy days. Then write down, O my God, for this Thy servant that which befitteth Thy glory and Thy greatness and Thy power and Thy might. Verily Thou art powerful to do what Thou willest. Within Thy grasp are the reins of all affairs of the first and the last. Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds and Goal of the hearts of them that have recognized Thee!"

Beirut. O Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be the Glory of God, Lord of Creation.

He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power.

Praise sanctified above hearts and minds befitteth the King of Kings Who, through the waves of the ocean of utterance, caused the world of contingent being to acknowledge His oneness and become aware of His singleness. Exalted be His generosity, exalted be His grace, and glorified be His loving-kindness, His greatness and His favors. And blessings and peace be upon the Lord of the world and Sovereign of nations, through Whose advent heaven was honored and through Whose manifestation the kingdom of creation was adorned, and upon His family and companions whom God made the lamps of the cities of His knowledge, the lights of His dominions, and the stars of His heaven, and through whom He caused His religion to flourish and His Cause to be made manifest among His servants and creatures.

And now, your illustrious letter arrived swifter than lightning and brought fresh joy, for indeed heart guides unto heart. When you intended to write that love-inspiring letter, the heart here was expectant, ready and waiting. The swiftness of lightning in this regard is very slow and its feet quite lame. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, not to deprive the world of this gift, that all may gather on one plane and become citizens of one homeland. In truth, were humanity to be blessed with the education of the true Educator, most of these visible means would be observed to be fruitless. But now it remains treasured in the stronghold of infallibility and hidden from all save whom God willeth.

As to the mention made of his honor the Afnan, upon him be from all nine \[Glory\] most glorious, and his honor Aqa Ahmad, upon him be ninety-six \[Baha'u'llah\], praise be to God the glad tidings of their well-being brought complete joy. This servant too extends his greetings and begs confirmation for them, yearns for their presence, beseeches their reunion, seeks their company, desires to be in their presence. Prayer is from the servant, acceptance from God - verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer.

And regarding the rice, his honor the Shaykh, upon him be ninety-six \[Baha'u'llah\], submitted his petition to the Most Holy Court and a most impregnable Tablet was sent especially for him, and this servant also mentioned something to him and as commanded mentioned the rice as well, and now too upon receipt it will be sent - do send it. And as for the writings, after submission They said it was not and is not advisable, rather even being in Beirut with writings is contrary to wisdom unless they keep them concealed and preserved in a firm, secure place, that is, in Beirut. End.

I beseech God to adorn the world with the ornament of trustworthiness and grant truthfulness and sincerity, that the properties of the servants may remain protected from the transgressions of the treacherous and the thieves, so that there may remain no need for concealment and hiding. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.

Two new packets arrived. God willing their reply will be sent. I extend greetings and nothingness to all the friends and masters. Peace be upon you and the mercy of God.

He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power

Praise be to the One Who is worthy and deserving, Who brought the world to life through a drop from the ocean of His love and guided it to eternal, everlasting life. And blessings and peace be upon the Lord of the world and Master of nations, and upon His family and companions who aided God's Law and His religion, and conquered lands through His power and His Name. And now, multiple occupations have seized this servant at this time - one being necessary writings and answering the letter of that honored master, and there is also the intention to visit the bath, and a necessary task has arisen requiring me to meet with his honor Afnan. In any case, now giving precedence to answering your epistle, I submit that your distinguished letter arrived and by its arrival sorrows and grief took flight and joy intended to take up residence. Praise be to God and His is the grace and favor, for truly it is His confirmation that makes hearts loving and causes them to be ignited with the warmth of love. In one of the Tablets this supreme utterance was observed - He says: "Today from the rustling of the Divine Lote Tree this supreme word was heard: The world is built through love and fellowship, and without it, it is in ruins." Truly it is the crown of the world and the source of the manifestation of the \[stations\] of humanity. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to bestow this great bounty and this goodly feast at all times so that all may soar in the air with one wing and dwell in one station. After reading and reviewing the eminent letter, I proceeded to His presence and submitted all. He said: "God willing, may they be blessed at all times with the favors of the Desired One, and be mentioned by His Name, illumined by His light, turned to His face, arise in His service, and whatever they have intended, God willing, will be adorned with the ornament of deed from potentiality, and from word to action." End quote. And then the sprinkling of the ocean of favor appeared and shone forth to such a degree that truly this servant is utterly incapable of mentioning it. Beyond that, opportunity has become like the phoenix and like the philosopher's stone. This servant beseeches God to ever confirm him in serving His friends. We deeply regret that for a time the flame of love was suspended and concealed. May God guide those souls who, without proof or evidence, engage in sedition and corruption. I beseech God not to deprive those souls from the ocean of His mercy and to educate them through the hands of His favor. I send greetings to the honored friend, his honor Aqa Ali Akbar. His letter, praise be to God, opened the gate of joy and spread the carpet of gladness. And now, in view of what was submitted at the beginning, no opportunity for further discourse remains. I seek his pardon. And finally, peace and mercy and divine favor be upon you and upon His friends and loved ones.

O Ali, son of him who has ascended unto God - upon both of you be the Glory of God! He is the One dawning from the horizon of eternity. A mention from Us to him who has turned toward the horizon of God, the Lord of Lords, who heard and responded and acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken in the final abode. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the Day of God, and woe unto every heedless doubter. The ocean of utterance hath surged in creation, yet the people remain in wondrous drunkenness. The verses passed before them morning and evening, yet they turned away from them, following vain imaginings. Thus did their souls seduce them, and they are among the most lost in the Book of God, the Lord of all men.

O Ali! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He mentioneth thee in the Most Great Prison and remindeth thee of verses that all the treasures of the world cannot equal. The Mother Book with Him beareth witness to this. Thank thy Lord for this most great favor and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of eternity, for having remembered me while I was among the hands of the wicked." We desired to mention in this station him who hath ascended unto God, the Mighty, the Bestower - he who turned toward the Supreme Horizon when the Luminary of Manifestation shone forth therefrom and illumined the horizons.

O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who heard My call, held fast to My cord, and uttered My praise. He is indeed of the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark. Say: The first light that dawned from the horizon of the Most Merciful's utterance and the first fragrance that wafted in the days of God, the Lord of all beings - upon thee, O thou who didst attain unto faith when the people were wrapped in the darkness of vain imaginings. Thou didst turn with thy face and thy heart and didst attain unto that which was revealed in the first days from the Pen of the Most Merciful. Blessed art thou, and blessed thy heart for having turned, and thine eye for what it beheld, and thine ear for what it heard.

The Most Exalted Pen beareth witness to thy turning, thy faith, thy recognition, thy certitude, and thy steadfastness in days wherein smoke enveloped all possibility. This is a testimony that nothing in all things can equal. Thou art he whom the rapture of the call so seized that neither the clamor of the divines, nor the might of names, nor the hosts of princes could weaken thee. Thou didst testify to that which God testified. Blessed art thou, and joy be unto thee, and unto him who mentioned thee through what flowed from the Pen of Utterance in the days of thy Lord, the Most Merciful.

The Glory manifest, evident, resplendent, dawning from the horizon of the heaven of thy Lord's loving-kindness be upon thee, upon thy beginning and thy end, thy outward and thine inward self, and the mercy of God and His blessings. O Ali! We have repeatedly mentioned the honored deceased one. The Pen is witness and the Tablet testifies that no good deed is ever lost in the sight of God, nor shall it ever be. Every good mention and pure deed is a treasure for its doer, preserved and protected with God. We beseech God to aid thee in mentioning him and to ordain for thee that which is the cause and means of drawing nigh. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth through His word "Be" and it is. Glory be upon thee and upon those whom nothing among all things hath prevented from drawing nigh unto God, the Self-Subsisting, the Self-Compelling.

The Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Great! A remembrance from Us to those in the kingdom of command and creation, that they may hear the call of their Lord, the Most High, from this Tree which hath been raised up by the command of God, the Lord of Names. Thus hath the matter been decreed in a Tablet from whose horizon hath shone the Sun of Command from the presence of One mighty and wise. O servant! Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the uttermost Tree upon the luminous spot. Verily, there is none other God but He, the Almighty, the Most High, the Great. Behold Me with Mine eye - thus hast thou been commanded in the Tablets from the presence of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Were anyone to ponder what hath flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful in this wise Remembrance, he would know what none hath known save whom thy Lord willeth, and would turn with his most luminous countenance toward the Most Sublime Vision and say: "I have turned my face unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds!" This is a matter the like of which hath not appeared in creation. By My life, this is indeed the wonder of the heavens and earth! Say: Ponder ye upon this innovation that ye may discover what your Lord hath intended in this luminous Tablet. This is not the day of desires - burn them with the fire of the love of your Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Arise to serve the Cause by the leave of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And this is not the day of idle fancies - rend their veils asunder by the name of your Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. The Beloved hath appeared in such wise that the horizons are illumined thereby. Blessed be He Who hath sent Him with the truth with a manifest sovereignty. Is it fitting to tarry when all things have been set in motion by the breezes of revelation? Fear ye God and follow not those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Were anyone to inhale the tablet of his Lord, he would discover therefrom the fragrance of His glorious and wondrous garment. And were he to turn with the ear of his innate nature unto all things, he would hear from them: "The appointed time hath come - dominion belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Peerless." It behooveth every soul to abandon what is possessed by the people, turning unto God, the One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We had sent thee aforetime a noble Book wherein was revealed that which illumined existence. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Bountiful. Hearken unto the call of Him Who summoneth thee in the prison unto God, thy Lord, and be thou of the discerning. He desireth for no one save what is best for him - to this doth testify the Most Exalted Pen which speaketh the truth while in the hands of the oppressors. When thou hast attained unto the lights of the Tablet, turn toward the Most Sublime Horizon. Say: O Lord of Names and Ruler over all things! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the Kingdom was adorned and the Realm of Might was embellished, to aid me to turn toward the Kaaba of Thy Beauty and to stand firm in Thy love and Thy Cause. Then write down for me what is best for me. I know not what is within Thy Self, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing. O my Lord! Ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and decreed for Thy loved ones. O my Lord! Thou seest mine eyes fixed upon the horizon of Thy favors and my heart turned toward the wonders of Thy grace and bounties. I beseech Thee to make me one of those who aid Thy Cause, who arise to serve Thee, who rest beneath the canopy of Thy mercy, and who are tranquil through the lights of the Sun of Thy Beauty. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Beautiful.

Lahijan. O Ashraf, upon thee be the Glory of God! In the name of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The drops of divine inspiration have trickled from the leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree, through the aid of the breeze of the Will of the Lord of Names, taking the form of these words: O Ashraf! Thy letter was present before the Most Great Scene and was the object of the attention of the Lord of Destiny. Praise be to God that thou hast drunk from the Salsabil of the utterance of the All-Merciful and art occupied with the mention of God amongst the people. We have recognized the fire of thy love and heard thy call. Verily thy Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. Blessed art thou for having fulfilled the Covenant of God and His Testament, and for having chosen for thyself the service of this Great Announcement, whereby the limbs of the world have quaked, the nations have been convulsed, and the feet of the mystics have slipped. God willing, thou shalt at all times stand firm in the assistance of His Cause and be vocal in His remembrance - an utterance that silence cannot overtake, and a standing that no sitting can follow. However, in all conditions ye must observe wisdom and summon the people with pure wisdom, for they are weak and heedless of the Dawning-Place of Divine Revelation and the Dayspring of the Lord's Manifestation. If they witness something whose reality they fail to comprehend, they will surely avoid it. In such case the work of teaching would be impeded. For example, the Blessed Birth occurred in Muharram - thus did God exalt it in truth and make it one of the festivals for His servants. Now if someone in Islamic lands were to outwardly observe the conditions of a festival during the month of Muharram, this would surely be contrary to wisdom, for most people are unaware of the blessedness of that day and what was born therein, and would suppose that the cause and reason for the festival was - God forbid - enmity towards the Prince of Martyrs, upon him be the most glorious of all glory. For they are ignorant and know not that the Dawning-Place of verses and the Manifestation of clear proofs hath appeared and speaketh. Moreover, they are heedless of the traditions that they themselves consider authentic, such as the saying of the Prince of Martyrs - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for his sake - that after the Qa'im, One bearing the name Qayyum shall appear and all the Prophets and chosen ones shall gather beneath His shadow. In brief, they are unaware of the Resurrection, the Day of God, and what hath appeared therein as revealed in the Qur'an and previous Books. They are intoxicated with the wine of passion and have turned away from the horizon of guidance. Woe unto them and unto those who follow them without clear proof or Book! In view of God's past mercy and the all-encompassing grace and favors of the Lord, ye should call all people with wisdom so that the attachments of existence may, through the wisdom and training of God's friends, attain to the station of "Blessed be God, the best of creators." Convey greetings from this Wronged One to all the friends and set them all ablaze with the fire kindled in the Blessed Tree, and adorn them with the ornament of unity and harmony and with that which God hath ordained in the Tablets. Verily, the Glory be upon thee and upon those who have turned toward the Countenance after the passing away of all things. He is, verily, the Lord of Names and the Creator of the heavens. There is no God but Him, the Expositor, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O Ghulam, before Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God

In the Name of Him Who has power over all who are on earth and in heaven! Glorified is He Who has sent down the verses and manifested what He willed. He verily is the One Who speaks at all times that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

The servant present before the Throne has read your letter. We have answered you with this wondrous Tablet. Give thanks unto God that your call has been heard in this spot round which circle the Concourse on High and the dwellers of Paradise, though most of the people are heedless.

We found your letter purified from vain imaginings. Ask God to keep you steadfast in your condition. He verily is the Almighty, the Powerful. O Ghulam! Rejoice that My Most Exalted Pen has moved to mention you while the Wronged One walks in His noble station. We have aided you to recognize Him Whom the world has failed to know, and guided you to My Straight Path. Hold fast to My Sure Handle, detached from what is with the peoples. Thus does the Ancient of Days command you as a bounty from Him, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient.

Your letter was seen. Praise be to God, the fragrance of divine love was wafting from it. God willing, may you be illumined by the lights of His countenance and enkindled with the fire of His love to such degree that neither the circumstances of the tyrants nor the sophistries of the Pharaohs who are the divines of the age would prevent you. Whenever the horizon of the world was blessed with the lights of revelation, the divines of that age arose in utmost rejection and protest, and issued the death warrant for His pure blood. This is not the first Cause that has appeared in the contingent world. In all ages and centuries that which caused the denizens of the highest Paradise to lament has appeared from them. All the books before and after have testified to this blessed Day. Nevertheless, that which has occurred is such that pen and tongue are powerless to mention it. Glorified is He Who speaks and continues to speak under all conditions, and manifests through His sovereignty whatsoever He desires in such wise that neither the power of the mighty nor the clamor of the divines can frustrate Him. He does what He wills and ordains what He pleases. He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Regarding your desire to attain His presence - blessed are you and your desire. He verily records for whosoever desires it the reward of attaining His presence. He is the Hearer, the Answerer. In these days this land is somewhat in turmoil and matters that cause grief are present. Therefore permission for visit has been delayed. However what is regarded today as among the most important deeds before the Self-Sufficing, the Most High has been and will be the teaching of the Cause with wisdom and utterance. God willing, you will be enabled through divine confirmation and heavenly favor to achieve this mighty endeavor. Strive that perchance you may quicken those in the graves through the living waters of utterance which have flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful. Be speaking in My Name, gazing toward My horizon, and holding fast to My mighty cord. Glory be upon you and upon those who have attained to this Most Great, Most Mighty Cause. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!

Glory be to Thee, O my God! I testify that Thy power hath encompassed all created things, and by the light of Thy Cause the earth and heavens were illumined. I beseech Thee by Thy generosity which hath encompassed all existence, and by Thy sovereignty which hath prevailed over the seen and unseen, and by Thy mysteries which were hidden from all eyes, to ordain for Thy chosen ones that which befitteth the heaven of Thy bounty. O Lord! They have acknowledged their poverty and confessed their weakness, therefore send down upon them that which will make them mighty in Thy kingdom and trusted ones in Thy lands. Then send down upon one of Thy servants that which befitteth Thy grace. O Lord! He hath turned to Thee and attained Thy presence. Then inscribe for Thy leaf and handmaiden, his wife, who hath turned with her heart to Thy horizon and acted according to what Thou commanded her in Thy Book. O Lord! Assist her through Thy bounty and generosity, then ordain for her what Thou hast ordained for Thy devoted handmaidens who are chaste and pure, who have held fast to the cord of Thy bounty and generosity and circled round Thy throne. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Strong, the All-Conquering, the Powerful.

Sent by the Leaf, upon her be the Glory of God, wife of Muhammad-i-Rahim. He who hath attained should deliver five hundred tumans as commanded to Ali-Haydar, upon him be the Glory of God, and act according to what is mentioned in this leaf: Jamal, upon him be my Glory - twenty-five tumans; Nabil-i-Akbar, upon him be my Glory - twenty-five tumans; Mirza Haydar-'Ali - twenty-five tumans; Ibn-i-Asdaq, upon them both be my Glory - twenty-five tumans; Ibn-i-Abhar, upon them both be my Glory - twenty-five tumans; Mirza 'Ali-Naqi, upon him be my Glory - twenty-five tumans. Ten tumans also from the Greater Mystery, the Most Exalted Leaf, upon her be the most glorious Glory of God, should reach Mulla 'Ali-Akbar to give to the handmaiden of God Layli. Five tumans also should reach the Fruit to be delivered to one of the handmaidens. Shaykh Muhammad also ten tumans, and twenty-five tumans also should be taken for the expenses of the Deputy, upon him be 966 \[Baha'u'llah\], and the remainder should be sent to the Trustee, upon him be the Glory of God, and whatever is intended regarding it will be made known for them to act upon.

O my God, my Lord and my Support! Those who have turned to the court of Thy glory and drunk the choice wine of revelation from the hand of Thy bounty and soared in the atmosphere of Thy love, desired to pay Thy rights which Thou didst send down in Thy Book. O Lord! They have spent in Thy love what Thou didst provide them from the treasuries of Thy bounty and favor. Ordain for them that which will draw them near unto Thee, then write down for them the good of every world of Thy worlds. Then I beseech Thee by Thy most exalted attributes to ordain for Thy handmaiden and leaf who hath attained to the payment of what was concealed from Thy Most Exalted Pen in Thy Scriptures and Tablets, the reward of those who circle round Thy throne and have won the privilege of hearkening to Thy call. O Lord! Thou seest that she hath done in Thy love what the queens of Thy earth were prevented from. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and the earth.

In the Name of God, the Ancient, the Everlasting

Glorified art Thou, O my God! Praise be unto Thee for having drawn Thy near ones through the breaths of Thy oneness and attracted them through the wondrous melodies of Thy voice. Thou hast made them helpers of Thy Cause among Thy creatures and celebrants of Thy name amongst Thy servants. Through them were enkindled the hearts of those who were heedless of Thy remembrance and had strayed from the pathway of nearness unto Thee. Thou hast raised them to a station Thou didst specially ordain for them through Thy grace, and through them Thy signs were spread throughout Thy dominion. Thou hast made them the embodiment of Thy most beautiful names for all who dwell on earth and in heaven.

Among them, O my God, is one who loved Thee and desired Thy presence. When he heard Thy mention and Thy call, he turned toward the horizon of Thy voice. The affairs of the world and the whisperings of the rebellious and the wayward did not prevent him from Thy remembrance. He hath plucked from the garden of Thy loving-kindness the fruits of the tree of Thy oneness, and beheld from the horizon of Thy favors the lights of Thy countenance and beauty. I beseech Thee, O my God, to assist him in all conditions that he may aid Thy Cause among Thy servants, and to protect him from the people of error that he may be occupied with Thy praise amidst Thy creation. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest, and Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful.

O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of faithfulness! Know that We have arrived in the fortress of Akka, and the heedless ones have surrounded Us from every direction. They desire to cut off the fragrant breezes of revelation from the universe, but this Youth hath not been deterred by the tribulations that have befallen Him and speaketh at all times that there is no God but Him. Say: Verily this Youth remembereth His Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Neither the swords of men nor the vicissitudes of days have prevented Him. He calleth out between earth and heaven and summoneth all unto God, unto Whom is His return and dwelling place.

Then know thou that the letter S entered the city, but the oppressors prevented him from attaining the presence before the Throne. They have barred the doors, but God shall open them when He willeth and desireth. Grieve thou not, for soon there shall descend from the clouds of grace that which shall cause people to enter into the religion of God in troops. Verily thy Lord hath power over all things. We beseech God to assist thee in all conditions and to send down upon thee the good of this world and the next. Thus hath it been ordained for thee in the Tablet, and that which hath been inscribed by the Pen of Command shall not be altered. Be thou thankful and among the grateful ones.

We desired to send thee Tablets concerning that which was mentioned before, but the idolaters intervened. We shall send them when God willeth and desireth. Verily, He is with His near servants. When God's loved ones gather together for the Cause, remember them on My behalf. We have sent Tablets wherein no names were mentioned for their protection. Give to each soul one of these Tablets. That which is befitting for each servant hath been sent down. Verily thy Lord is knowing of all things. Then know that one of My loved ones sent a Tablet there in the name of M. It was not revealed for him and there was a mistake, but perhaps God will bring about some remembrance through it. Thus doth the knowledge of thy Lord encompass all things, but the people are in heedlessness and schism.

He has been revealed for the brother who gazes upon the Face, who was named Abu'l-Qasim, that his heart may rejoice and that he may find for himself a path to God, the Most High, the All-Knowing. Glorified be He Who sends down verses at all times for people who are aware, for verily there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. All who are in the heavens and earth sing His praise, and all that was and will be. O servant who believes in God, hear the call of Him Who has been imprisoned in this remote prison, from Whom have been cut off the hands of those who desired the presence of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. He remembers you purely for the sake of God, that you may detach yourself from those who have disbelieved and associated partners with Him in Whom they believed, and who have turned back on their heels in opposition. Would that you had been with your Lord when He departed from Iraq with manifest sovereignty, and witnessed what befell Him from those who were created by His word "Be!" By God the Truth, those whom We created by Our command and whom We aided at all times and protected from the harm of every harmful one morning and evening - when they witnessed that the Word was exalted and the breezes of power wafted from the direction of your Chosen Lord, they emerged from behind the veil with sharp drawn swords. By God, at every moment I was struck by the arrows of discord from the hypocrites, and at every instant was struck by the swords of hatred, and none knew of this save God your Lord and a few numbered souls. Then they cast Me into the well of darkness in this prison while they rejoiced within themselves. Thus do We inform you that you may be possessed of clear insight. You must inform the people and remind them of God's verses that they may remember within themselves and be among those who are certain. Let nothing veil you from remembering your Lord in all days, and grieve not for the world and what befalls you therein. Be among those who have no fear and who do not sorrow. Follow God's command in what has been ordained in this Tablet and He will protect you from the harm of those who have denied God's verses and who do not understand. Come forth from the veils of sorrow through the name of your Lord, the Most Merciful, then open your tongue in utterance, for this is best for you, as honored servants bear witness. Know that your brother Nabil has attained the presence of the Throne and has won what was ordained for him in preserved tablets of glory. He has reached the summit of grace and has heard the verses of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The lights seized him from all directions - none comprehend this save those who have attained the presence of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Thus have We detailed the matter for you and sent down verses and dispatched them to you that your eyes may be consoled and that you may gaze toward your Lord's direction with praiseworthy humility. Glory be upon you and upon those who are steadfast in the Cause, who when proof dawns upon them from the Dayspring of the All-Merciful, fall prostrate before God and are among those who bow down in worship.

O Husayn of Sultanabad! In the name of the Goal of all worlds! The Day hath come wherein the sky bringeth forth manifest smoke, and the Day hath come wherein the mountains move as clouds move, and every mighty trustworthy one is shaken. O Husayn! Hearken unto the call of the wronged Husayn, Who from the direction of the Most Great Prison summoneth thee unto the Truth. Listen with the ear of thy soul to the call of the divine Summoner. If thou attainest unto it but once, it will draw thee to such a station that thou wilt find thyself detached from the world and all who dwell therein, and with loudest voice thou wilt engage in the praise of the Friend amidst the righteous ones. This is the Revelation concerning which the Point of the Bayan hath said: "Beware, beware lest that which is in the Bayan prevent thee," and in another place He saith: "Beware, beware lest thou be veiled by what hath been revealed in the Bayan." This is the Day the attainment of which all the Prophets and Messengers beseeched of God and yearned after. Look thou into the books of old that thou mayest discover what hath been concealed from thee. I am unto thee a faithful counselor. With the tongue of thy soul call out to the Beloved of all possibility and say: O my God, and my Master, and my Friend, and the Beloved of my soul and my spirit! How can I ever render thanks unto Thee? I was submerged in the ocean of heedlessness and ignorance when the tongue of Thy grace called out to me and the hand of Thy bounty seized me. O my Lord! My heedlessness reached such a point that it deprived me of the sweet waters of certitude and guided me to the bitter waters of idle fancies. I became forgetful of Thy remembrance, yet Thou didst not forget me. I grew cold in my love for Thee, yet the fire of Thy loving-kindness remained ablaze. With what countenance shall I turn toward Thee, and with what tongue shall I call upon Thee? Shame and remorse have overtaken me and made me despair from every direction. But O my Lord, my Goal and my Master! I have heard that Thou hast declared that if today anyone should but once sincerely say "Show me," from the Kingdom of Utterance he would hear "Look and thou shalt see Me." From this blessed and exalted word the station of this Day is clear and evident. Thou hast likewise declared that if from the beginning that hath no beginning someone had been deprived of all good deeds, today it would be possible to make up for them, inasmuch as the ocean of forgiveness hath appeared in the contingent world and the heaven of bounty is upraised. I beseech Thee by the sanctity of this blessed Day, which is the source and dawning-point of all days, to make me successful in that which pleaseth Thee and to adorn me with the ornament of Thy acceptance. O Lord! I am the poor one, and with Thee is the ocean of wealth. I am the ignorant one, and with Thee are the treasuries of knowledge and wisdom. I am the remote one, and verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Near One. If thou art successful in reciting that which hath been mentioned, assuredly thou shalt not be deprived of the outpourings of the Sun of inner meanings. This is the Sun of divine counsel that hath shone forth from the horizon of the Kingdom of Utterance. Blessed is he who hath heard and hath said: "Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds!"

In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious! The Call hath been raised from the right of the blessed and luminous Spot, from the Divine Lote-Tree, a Call which the realities of all things hear: "Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Wise." O people of the earth! Let not your ears be prevented from hearkening to the Word of God. By God! Through it are hearts drawn to the Station wherein they behold the power of God, their Lord and the Lord of their forebears. Come ye forth from the cities of fancy and idle imagination, then set your faces toward the Sacred House which God hath made the Qiblih of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Shatter the idols of vain desire through the name of your Lord, the Lord of all names. Thus have ye been commanded by the All-Glorious in a preserved Tablet. Bear ye witness, O people, to that whereunto God hath testified for His Own Self, by His Own Self, before the creation of all things: "Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Bountiful." The heaven hath come with the smoke of destiny, and men are enshrouded by the veils of allusion, save those who have cast the world behind them and turned unto the countenance of God, the Luminous, the Resplendent. Say: Recognition is My recognition, and the Path is My straight and manifest way. Say: Beware lest ye be veiled by desire from the Lord of all names. Follow that which ye have been commanded in the Book, and be not as those who, when the proof came unto them from the All-Merciful, violated the Covenant and denied God, the Lord of all worlds. Hearken unto the word of Him Who calleth you unto God. Cast behind you all who are on earth. Doth not God suffice you, He Who created all things by His command? There is no God but Him. In His grasp is the dominion of all things. He is, verily, powerful over all things. Those who have denied the All-Merciful after He came from the heaven of revelation with a mighty proof - these are they whom desire hath overcome, and thus were they debarred from the mercy of their Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful. O people! Hold fast unto the cord of God and His mercy. He, verily, will protect you and aid those who have turned unto Him. He is nigh unto the doers of good. Not a thing escapeth His knowledge. With Him is the knowledge of the heavens and the knowledge of what hath been and what shall be, in a Book inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen, whereof none is aware save the Lord of Names, Who hath come with His Most Glorious Name, were ye of them who know. O people! Adorn yourselves with My qualities and array your temples in the garments of knowledge and refinement, and be ye witnesses among His servants. Thus hath the matter been decreed by your Lord. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Him and is of the successful ones. O thou who hast turned to God! Give thanks unto thy Lord, for this Most Great Sea hath surged in thy remembrance, and the Lord of Pre-existence hath spoken thy name and sent unto thee this Tablet, from which the fragrance of the garment of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, is wafted between earth and heaven. Blessed is he who perceiveth it and saith: "Praise be unto Thee, O God of all who are in the heavens and on earth!" Make mention of My loved ones on My behalf. We have indeed recorded their names in a perspicuous Tablet, that their names may be confirmed in the Kingdom of creation and their spirits in the Realms of Glory - a bounty from Our presence, and I am verily the Bountiful, the Generous.

In His Name, the Everlasting, the Eternal, Who fadeth not away!

We have turned toward thee from this Most Glorious Horizon. We found thee stirred by the Supreme Word of God, wherefore We have revealed unto thee this Tablet, from whose horizon shineth the Sun of the tender mercy of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Most High, the Most Great. With Him is the knowledge of all things. He beholdeth him who speaketh in His Name and reciteth what hath been sent down from the Kingdom of his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

We have lit the Lamp of Eternity in the world that the peoples might be illumined thereby. Some have turned toward it, and some have turned away, following every remote scholar.

Say: O concourse of divines! Have ye heard the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen and turned away, or were ye among the heedless? Ye would call upon God morning and evening, and lament your separation from the Lord of Names. Yet when the meeting came to pass and the sea of reunion surged, ye broke God's covenant and His pledge, and turned away from Him Who was the goal of all worlds.

Say: Have ye witnessed a Revelation more mighty than what hath appeared in truth, or have ye heard a Call more sweet than what hath been raised between the heavens and the earth? At all times He calleth out with the most exalted call, in such wise as to encompass the earth and heaven. Turn ye, that ye may hear what ye have never heard in the Kingdom of Creation, that haply ye may arise to redeem what hath escaped you in the days of your Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

Say: We created ears to hearken unto this Call which hath been raised from the midst of tribulation. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Cast away what books ye possess which ye have authored according to your desires. By God the Truth! The Mother Book which was concealed in the knowledge of your Lord, the Guardian over the worlds, hath been sent down.

Say: The Sun hath appeared at high noon, yet ye have not discerned from it even as much as the blind discerneth. Thus hath the All-Merciful decreed when seated upon His exalted throne.

Grieve thou not at anything. Put thy trust in God, then remember Him with joy and fragrance. He aideth whom He willeth through a sovereignty from His presence. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Powerful.

Be thou enkindled with the fire of the love of God in such wise that the veils of the people who are shut out by their idle fancies might be burned away, those who have turned from the Truth when it came with a wondrous command. We desire to behold thee detached from all else and clinging to the Hidden Name which hath appeared from the horizon of power with a command before which all in the heavens and earth cannot stand. Thy Lord is verily the Strong, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing.

By My life! Naught shall remain for thee save the remembrance of God and the exaltation of His Cause. Thus doth he who loveth thee for the sake of God counsel thee. To this testifieth every just and well-informed one.

Render thanks unto God for having attained unto the days of thy Lord. This is a sovereignty which no decline shall follow, nor shall the hands of the thieves reach thereunto. Thus have We bestowed Our favor upon thee once again, and sent unto thee that whereby the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath been wafted throughout all possibility, and the breasts of them that are nigh unto God have been illumined.

When thou art illumined by the lights of the dayspring of exposition and hast attained unto the Tablet of the All-Merciful, arise, turning toward the Self-Subsisting, and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art wronged, estranged, and lonely!

O Mirza Zaynu'l-'Abidin, upon whom be the glory of God! He is the One Who speaketh openly before the faces of the world. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One and the servant present hath laid it before His face. We found therein thy turning to the lights of the Manifestation, thy drawing nigh unto the horizon of grace, and thy holding fast to the cord of God. Through this the ocean of utterance surged and desired to cast upon thee the pearls of wisdom and knowledge that thou mayest see and thank thy Lord, the Lord of the worlds. We have sent down from the heaven of bounty that which will draw thee to the most exalted horizon and bring thee near unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We beseech God to assist thee to rend asunder the veils of the world and enable thee to shatter the idols of vain imaginings, and to ordain for thee what He hath ordained for His loved ones who have cast the world behind their backs and taken hold of the Book of God with a strength and power from Him. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Great. We beseech God that He may give His servants to drink, through thee, the Kawthar of divine knowledge and make thee a sign of His remembrance in the contingent world. Verily He heareth and seeth and answereth, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Arise in My name to serve My Cause, then attract the servants through My mention and praise. Beware lest the happenings of the world hold thee back from the Most Great Name, or the might of those who have denied the Day of Judgment. Say: By God! The rustling of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha hath been raised up in the Most Exalted Paradise. Hasten, O people of the earth, and be not of them that hesitate. Beware lest the barking of dogs or the howling of wolves prevent you. Soon shall the world pass away, and the riches of every oppressor, and the might of every transgressor, and the croaking of those who have denied the proof of God and His testimony when He came with the kingdom of verses and mighty sovereignty. Thus hath the sun shone upon thee with its lights that thou mayest rejoice and be of them that arise to serve this Cause, whereby the limbs of the polytheists have quaked. When thou art illumined by the lights of thy Lord's utterance, the All-Merciful, say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God, O Thou Who art the Lord of all existence and the Ruler of the kingdoms! I beseech Thee by the movement of Thy Most Exalted Pen, whereby all things were attracted, and by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue the kingdom of names, to make me speak forth Thy remembrance and stand firm in Thy love in such wise that neither the doubts of the doubtful nor the signs of the heedless shall hold me back. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O my Lord! Ordain for me what beseemeth the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy bestowal. Thou art, verily, the Most Generous, the Bountiful. From the heaven of bounty thou didst seek permission to attain His presence. God, exalted be His glory, hath ever turned the gaze of His loving-kindness toward His loved ones and continueth to do so. However, in these days certain oppressors, enkindled with the fire of greed, passion and desire, have raised up the standard of hypocrisy in the Great City and have clung to tyranny and rebellion. Therefore the lights of the Sun of permission have been concealed behind the clouds until such time as God shall lift them away through a power from Him and a sovereignty from His presence. Verily He hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Commander, the All-Wise. The glory be upon thee and upon whosoever hearkeneth unto thy words concerning this News whereby the back of every learned one was broken, the limbs of every oppressor quaked, and the hearts of the heedless were troubled.

The Supreme Pen proclaims: O friends of Truth! The purpose of bearing these successive afflictions and consecutive trials is that souls assured in God should walk together in perfect unity, such that all difference, duality and otherness might be effaced from their midst, save in those special limitations that have been sent down in the divine Books. The man of insight suffers no loss in any matter - whatever occurs is evidence of the greatness of his station and the purity of his nature. For instance, if a person shows humility for the sake of God towards the friends of God, this humility in truth returns to God, as it stems from his faith in God. In this case, if the person faced does not respond in kind, or shows pride, the insightful one has attained and will attain to the exaltation of his own deed and its reward, while the harmful deed of the one faced returns to himself. Likewise if someone shows pride, that pride returns to God - God forbid! O people of understanding! I swear by the Most Great Name, it is a pity in these days for anyone to fix his gaze on transient conditions. Stand firm in the divine Cause and walk with one another in perfect love, purely for the sake of the Beloved. Burn away the veils of self with the fire of oneness, and associate with each other with radiant and joyous faces. You have all witnessed with your own eyes the character traits of Truth - never has it been pleasing that a night should pass with one of God's loved ones aggrieved with this Servant. The heart of the world is set ablaze by the divine Word - what a pity if you are not enkindled by this fire! God willing, we hope that you will make this blessed night the night of unity, and all become united with one another, adorned with the ornament of praiseworthy virtues and excellent character. Let your highest endeavor be to guide a soul from the abyss of extinction to the fountain of everlasting life, and to conduct yourselves among humanity such that the signs of Truth become manifest through you. For you are the first existence, the first worshippers, the first who prostrate, and the first who circle round. By Him Who has caused Me to speak what He desires - your names are more renowned in the Supreme Kingdom than your mention among yourselves. Think not this statement is imagination - would that you could see what your Lord, the All-Merciful, sees of the loftiness of your station, the greatness of your worth, and the sublimity of your rank! We beseech God not to let your selves and desires prevent you from what has been ordained for you. We hope that you will conduct yourselves with one another in the utmost fellowship, love and friendship, such that through your unity the banner of divine oneness may be raised aloft and the standard of polytheism cast down, and that you will vie with one another in goodly deeds and in manifesting contentment. His is the creation and the command. He does what He wishes and ordains what He desires. And verily He is the Almighty, the Exalted, the Powerful.

He is the One Who speaks in the Kingdom of Utterance! O H.S., upon whom be the Glory of God! This is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down. Verily it is the spirit for bodies, and fruits for trees, and the Kawthar of eternity for the people of Baha. Blessed is he who hath taken the chalice of bounty from the hand of the Lord of Names, detached from all that hath appeared in the kingdom of creation, and hath drunk in the name of God, the Lord of the worlds.

Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One. We have inhaled from it the fragrance of thy love and thy steadfastness in this Most Great Cause and Momentous Announcement. We have mentioned thee before in various Tablets whereby the fragrance of thy acceptance and thy humility before Him Who hath come from the horizon of might with clear verses and manifest sovereignty hath been diffused. Soon shall he who hath turned away from the Supreme Horizon behold what hath escaped him in the days of his Lord and find himself in manifest loss. This is a word that hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the knowledge of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Arise to serve the Cause through My command and My sovereignty. Verily He is with thee and will protect thee from the hosts of the oppressors. Thus hath the Supreme Pen spoken, when the Wronged One was in this exalted station. This is a glad-tiding from Us unto thee. When thou dost inhale its fragrance say: "My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having caused me to recognize the Dayspring of Thy signs, and shown me the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance, and enabled me to behold the horizon of Thy Revelation, and guided me to Thy path, and honored me with Thy traces, and illumined my heart with the lights of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee to ordain for me the good of the hereafter and the present world, and that which Thou hast written for Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones through whom the heaven hath rained and the earth hath brought forth its fruits. O my Lord! Thou seest me clinging to the cord of Thy bounty and holding fast to the hem of the robe of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee not to deny me any good thing which Thou hast sent down in Thy Book. Verily Thou art the Most Bountiful, the Most Generous. There is no God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful."

O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! The Wronged One desireth to make mention of thy brother who hath been named 'Abdu'llah, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful. O 'Abdu'llah! When the wine of My utterance doth intoxicate thee and My call doth attract thee, say: "My God, my God! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned to Thy most exalted horizon and supreme height, the station wherein Thy most sweet call hath been raised and the shrill voice of Thy Most Sublime Pen. I beseech Thee by the mysteries of Thy Cause, and the signs of Thy grandeur, and the Word whereby Thou hast aided Thy loved ones throughout ages and centuries, to make me in all conditions firm and steadfast, arising in Thy remembrance and praise and the service of Thy Cause. Verily Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful."

We make mention of the Leaf, thy wife, and send Our greetings upon her from this station. We beseech God to confirm her and assist her in that which He loveth and is pleased with. And We make mention of him who hath been named Husayn and him who hath been named Fakhru'd-Din. We beseech God to ordain for them that which shall gladden the eyes of His servants and benefit them in all the worlds of His worlds. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Great.

The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon them and upon those whom neither the doubts of the wayward nor the cawing of the ravens have prevented from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds.

O Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the One Who gazeth from His most exalted horizon. This is a Book which the Wronged One hath sent down from the precincts of the Prison unto him who hath turned towards God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He counseleth him with that which will cause the Cause to be uplifted and remindeth him of what hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen in this sublime station. O Hasan! Hear the call of God from the Uttermost Tree: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Let not the affairs of the world sadden thee, nor the might of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of existence. Say: The Promised One hath come, riding upon the clouds. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto every heedless and veiled one. This is the Day whereon the fruits say unto the trees: "Blessed are ye, for the breezes of the Revelation have passed over you in this Day wherein eyes have been gladdened." And the seas call out to the mountains saying: "Blessed are ye, for the pavilions of grandeur have been raised upon you and the tabernacle of glory hath been erected among you by the command of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen." Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto the knowledge of God in His days and hath arisen to serve His inevitable Cause. He who was named Salman hath appeared before Us with thy letter. We have read it and answered thee with this Tablet that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Shafi', even as We mentioned him before in diverse Tablets, that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the Sovereign of the kingdom of earth and heaven. O Shafi'! We have made mention of thee in such wise as to adorn the pages of the Book of existence. He Who possesseth the Preserved Tablet beareth witness unto this. Turn not unto the world and its conditions. Remind My servants with joy and fragrance that they may inhale the sweet-scented perfume of God's raiment, the Lord of all that was and shall be. Look not at the creatures and their deeds, but at Him Who speaketh at the heart of the world: "There is none other God but Me, the Truth, the All-Knowing." O Abu'l-Qasim! Hear the call of the Wronged One from the precincts of the Prison, then make mention of Him at eventide and at dawn. Beware lest the veils of the world withhold thee or the might of those who have disbelieved in the Witness and the Witnessed strike fear into thee. Say: "Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having turned toward me from the precincts of the Prison and remembered me with verses from which the fragrance of Thy beloved Name hath been wafted." We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Hasan that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. O Hasan! Turn with thy heart toward the Most Exalted Horizon, then make mention of thy Lord at all times. He hath remembered thee when thou wert silent in His remembrance, and hath turned toward thee from His mighty Prison. Thank God for that the Countenance of the Ancient of Days hath turned toward thee and remembered thee with that which shall never pass away. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Generous. O Hasan! Thank God, thy Lord, for that which hath flowed from His Pen in remembrance of every name that was in thy letter. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. We make mention of My handmaidens who have believed in the All-Informed One. By My life! Every maidservant who hath believed is regarded by God as amongst the most exalted of men. God hath forgiven those who have turned toward Him and whose letters have been presented before His Countenance. He is the One to Whose grace all created things have testified, and to Whose loving-kindness every fair-minded and discerning soul beareth witness. Glory be upon the people of Glory who have fulfilled God's Covenant, the Lord of all worlds.

He is the One speaking from the Divine Lote Tree

The Word of God speaks with truth from this station which God has made the dawning-place of His revelation, the dayspring of His signs, and the manifestation of His Cause that was mentioned in His Books and Scriptures and in His preserved Tablet. The hidden mystery has appeared, yet most of the people perceive it not. The Promised One has come, yet most of the people understand not. They have violated God's Covenant and His testament, and have committed that which has caused the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the cities of names to lament, yet they perceive it not. This is the Day wherein He Who conversed on Sinai calleth aloud with the most exalted call, yet most of the people hear not. They have cast aside the truth, clinging to the vain imaginings of men. He Who speaketh in every condition beareth witness to this, that there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.

The attending servant was present and read thy letter before the Wronged One, and We found from it the fragrance of thy love and thy humility and lowliness before God, the Lord of what was and what will be. We have answered thee with that which shall diffuse the fragrances of loving-kindness and shall endure as long as the kingdom and the realm endure. Blessed art thou for having hearkened unto the Call and turned to the Supreme Horizon when the learned ones and divines of the earth turned away from it, save those whom God desired, the Mighty, the Loving. Arise to serve the Cause by My command, then guide the people to the Most Great Path of God through this Name whereby that which was hidden in the treasuries of might hath been revealed. Thy Lord is, verily, the Commander, the Ancient of Days. Say: O people of the earth, fear God and follow not your desires. By God! The Promise hath come, and He Who was promised calleth aloud and summoneth all unto the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. Say: This is the Day in which the breeze of life hath wafted and the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath been diffused. Turn ye with illumined hearts and be not of the heedless ones. Say: O people of the earth, cast aside what ye possess that I may show you what God, the Lord of the invisible and the visible, possesseth. Beware lest ye deny God's favor after its revelation and bestowal. Reflect upon God's Cause and His sovereignty, and be not of those who cling to idle fancies and vain imaginings. Arise to remember and praise in such wise that neither the oppression of rulers nor the opposition of divines shall deter thee. Thus doth the Wronged One command thee from this forbidden spot. We desired their life and preservation and a station whose mention transcendeth every pen and tongue, yet they pronounced judgment against Us with such tyranny as hath caused the denizens of the Kingdom to cry out. Blessed is he who is not prevented by the turning away of those who have disbelieved in the Witness and the Witnessed. Thus have We revealed before all faces and eyes the pearls of wisdom and knowledge from this Sea whose waves proclaim that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of the All-Merciful in His days and hath spoken His praise and remembrance and drunk the choice wine of love from the cup of His bounty. He is of the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark whom We mentioned in the Qayyumu'l-Asma' from God, the Lord of existence. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto this irrevocable Cause.

He is the Expositor, the All-Knowing

This Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed in the most eloquent Arabic. Now We desire to speak in the luminous tongue, and We beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, not to deprive His servants of the Kawthar of wisdom and knowledge that lies hidden and concealed therein. Mention thou unto David - upon him be My glory - from the Wronged One. Verily We perceived in him a sign of acceptance, We turned toward him from the prison, and revealed for him that which will draw him unto God, the Lord of all worlds. O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Reflect upon the previous people - despite their seeking and yearning, when the Sun of Revelation shone forth from the horizon of the Will of Him Who conversed on Sinai, all arose in opposition and committed that which caused the horizons of the cities of divine knowledge and wisdom to be veiled from sight. In truth, at the first station and primary rank, those who prevented others were souls who counted themselves as sources of utterance and dawning-places of knowledge. And when the light shone forth they became as veils. These are the greatest veils in the sight of God, the Possessor of Destiny. The heedlessness of such souls reached such a point that they occupy themselves with cursing and reviling God, exalted be His glory, from pulpits, and they perceive it not. In these days the lamentations and moaning of pulpits in Iran have been raised high, for they were created and brought into being for the mention and praise of God, but now, we seek refuge in God, they are observed to be the place and station of the opposers and deniers. By the life of God! The sighs of those near unto God are raised up at this time and the tears of the sincere ones are flowing. The party that considered itself the most noble of all parties in the world and the most refined of all peoples is now observed to be the most abject and abased. They have committed that which no party among all parties hath committed. We hope that thou mayest be aided to rend asunder the veils of all who are on earth. This is not difficult for God. When thou hearest the call of the Wronged One and findest the fragrance of the utterance of His Name, the Self-Subsisting, say:

Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Aid this servant of Thine to assist Thy Cause among Thy servants and to establish Thy commandments and ordinances. O my God! Thou art He Who reminded me when I was silent in Thy remembrance. I beseech Thee by the breaths of Thy revelation whereby the cities of justice and fairness were perfumed, and by the light shining forth from the horizon of favor and grace, to make me arise to serve Thy Cause in such wise that the Pharaohs of the days and the tyrants of the peoples will not frighten me. Then enable me to rend asunder the veils through Thy power, Thy sovereignty and Thy might, and ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and trusted ones. O my God! I am he who hath turned unto Thee and placed his trust in Thee and committed his affairs unto Thee. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me from the waves of the ocean of Thy grace and bounty. O Lord! Adorn my head with the crown of detachment and my temple with the robe of godliness, that I may arise to mention Thee, detached from all else save Thee and severed from whatsoever is besides Thee. Verily Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Self-Subsisting, the Guardian over what was and what shall be.

In Commemoration of the Anniversary of the Birthday of the Bab

In the Name of the One Begotten Whom God hath designated the Herald of His Name, the All-Glorious, the All-Loving!

This is a Tablet from Our presence to glorify the Night in which heavens and earth were illumined by the Day-Star whose effulgent splendour hath encompassed the dwellers of the whole world.

Immeasurably blessed art thou, inasmuch as the Day of God hath been born in thee -- the Day which hath been singled out by Us to be the lamp of salvation unto the denizens of the cities of names, the chalice of blissfulness for such as dwell within the immensities of the realm of immortality and the source of joy and gladness unto all the inmates of the world of creation.

Immensely exalted is God, the Maker of the heavens, Who hath caused His Day to raise its voice in glorification of this Name whereby the veils of delusion have been rent asunder and the mists of idle fancy dissipated, whereby the Name of Him Who is the Self-Subsistent hath shone resplendent above the horizon of assurance. The choice wine of everlasting life hath, on this Day, been unsealed and the doors of true knowledge and utterance were unlocked before the face of all the inmates of the realm of existence and the breeze of divine mercy been wafted upon all regions. All glory be unto this Hour wherein the Treasure of God, the Potent, the Knowing, the Wise, hath been unveiled.

O peoples of earth and heavens! Verily God hath made the First Night a token for the Latter Night in which hath been born the One Whom no human mind can comprehend, Whom no expression of praise can magnify. Well is it with him who pauseth to reflect upon these Twin Nights. Indeed he would readily recognize that the outer form doth conform with the inner reality and would become acquainted with the divine mysteries that lie enshrined in this Revelation -- a Revelation through whose potency the foundations of disbelief have quaked and the idols of superstition have been dumbfounded and the banner bearing the proclamation: "Verily, no God is there but Him, the Powerful, the Pre-Eminent, the Peerless, the Incomparable, the Sovereign Protector, the Mighty, the Most Exalted" hath been unfurled.

This is the Night in which the fragrance of reunion hath been diffused, in which the portals leading unto the divine presence were, in fulfilment of the ultimate objective, flung open and all created things did proclaim: "Verily, the Kingdom is God's, the Lord of Names, He Who is come invested with such sovereignty as pervadeth the whole creation".

This is the Night in which the Concourse on High have celebrated the praise of their Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, in which the realities of all names have, in recognition of the glory of His Revelation, magnified the Name of Him Who is the sovereign Ruler of this world and of the world to come -- a Revelation which hath caused the mountains to wing their flight unto the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted, through Whose power men have set their hearts towards the countenance of the Beloved and the leaves are stirred by the gentle winds of deep longing and the trees, enraptured by the ringing Call of the Almighty, have lifted up their voice and the whole creation is vibrating with ecstasy in its eagerness to attain the presence of the Lord of eternity and all created things were called into being through the potency of the hidden Word which this glorious Name hath disclosed.

O Night of the All-Bountiful! In thee We discern the revelation of the Mother Book. We wonder whether it is a begotten child or a revealed Book. Nay, I swear by Myself; whatever hath been mentioned is but a matter of names, whereas God hath immeasurably exalted Him above this station. Through Him hath the Unknowable been made manifest and the impenetrable Mystery laid bare. Nay, by My life! All that hath been uttered is indicative of the station of designations, whereof He in truth is the sovereign Ruler. Through Him hath the letter of negation preceded that of affirmation. Nay, this is mentioned in proportion to the capacity of the peoples of the world, while in the estimation of thy Lord no one's ear but His Own is capable of hearing it. Well is it with them that are well-assured.

Thereupon Our Pen of Glory cried out, dumbfounded: "O Thou Whom names fail to describe! Forgive me, I adjure Thee by Thy might which transcendeth beyond the earth and the heavens. Wherefore I have been fashioned through the potency of Thy creative power, how can I describe that which no word throughout the realm of creation can describe? And yet, I swear by Thy glory, were I to express that which Thou hast divinely inspired me, the entire creation would be consumed away by reason of the ecstasy and exaltation it would experience. How much mightier then must be the waves of the ocean of Thine utterance which surge forth in praise of this sublime station, this exalted and transcendent habitation. O Lord! I beg Thee to forgive the incapacity of this tongue-tied Pen in magnifying the glory of this august station. Treat me then mercifully, O my Possessor and my King and excuse the things I have done amiss in Thy presence."

Verily, Thou art the Lord of Bounty, the Omnipotent, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.

O physician! This is a Book from the Word of God and the Manifestation of His Cause to him whom the breezes of the All-Merciful have turned from the left hand of temptation to the right hand of contentment, that he may be ever mindful of the remembrance of his Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, and be among those who have attained. O servant! Blessed art thou, for the clouds of holiness have sprinkled upon thee the drops of resplendent glory and purified thee from the allusions of the people of veils, and caused thee to hear the most wondrous melodies from the songs of the birds of the heaven of contentment, and drawn thee to a glorious and wondrous court, and made thee speak in praise of thy Creator, and inspired thee with the knowledge of His Self, the All-Encompassing, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. There hath come before the Countenance that which thy tongue hath uttered in remembrance of this imprisoned, lonely and unique One. We beseech God to assist thee in His Cause and make thee so steadfast that thou wilt arise with thy spirit, thy soul and thine essence to exalt His Word in this Most Great, Most Glorious, Mighty and Inaccessible Announcement, and aid thee at all times with the Most Great Spirit, and cause thee to speak a word that will shatter the pillars of the satans. How excellent art thou for having drunk from the Kawthar of God's mercy and attained to the knowledge of Him, after which every learned scholar was veiled therefrom. Say: O people of the Bayan! Glory lieth not in placing green and white turbans upon your heads. Were glory to lie in this, then the camel that carrieth them from town to town should glory over all the worlds, for it beareth a thousand times what ye wind round your heads, O heedless ones! Beware lest names keep you from the remembrance of your Lord, the Most High, in this Revelation which hath appeared with all signs and holy and wondrous scrolls. Say: Adorn your heads with the turbans of the love of your Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Beware lest what ye possess prevent you from God, from Whom hath appeared every wise command. Know ye that true knowledge is your detachment from all save God, your Lord, and your recognition of His Self, the All-Encompassing, the Mighty, the Powerful. And thou, O servant who speaketh in praise of thy Lord, arise to help God and teach the people with wisdom and utterance, and pay no heed to those who have denied Him in Whom they had believed, and whom vain imaginings have so seized that they read the words of God and yet deny their Revealer and Sender, and are not among those who perceive. Arise thou from the horizon of detachment with a face of wondrous radiance, then behold those who claim knowledge among these people beneath thy feet, then soar on the wings of the spirit to the atmosphere wherein waft the fragrances of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Generous. God hath accepted what thou hast composed in His praise, and He shall surely reward thee justly, for He doth reward His remembering servants. Be thou so enkindled with the love of God that should one of the idolaters confront thee, he would be unable to speak in thy presence. Thus doth the Spirit command thee at this moment when He walketh alone in the house and His tongue uttereth that whereby all created things would be quickened, were they of the assured ones. Spirit, glory and splendor be upon thee and upon those who have detached themselves from all things and clung to the hem of God, the King, the Mighty, the Ancient.

O Shaykh Sultan! In the Name of God, the Mighty, the Wondrous! This is a Book from Us to him whom God has loved and ordained for him an exalted station in His presence, that he may give thanks to his Lord and be detached from all else and remember Him among His praising servants. We have learned what has befallen you. Do not grieve. Be patient, then show forth ultimate patience, and be in great joy. Verily the world and its hardship and ease shall pass away, as every insightful and certain one bears witness. Grieve not over anything. We beseech God to bring about that which will set your affairs aright and comfort your eyes. He is verily the Guardian of the sincere ones. We grieved when We heard of the disorder in your affairs. Soon will your Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, bring them together. Grieve not except for My tribulation and affliction, and when sorrows intensify upon you, reflect on what has befallen My Soul at the hands of the oppressors. O Sultan! Know that a great ransom has been ordained for Us which cannot be exchanged for another - neither for sheep nor for all that exists between the heavens and the earth. Thus has the Most Exalted Pen inscribed in the Tablet of Destiny by My binding and wise command. O Sultan! The Cause of God has become obscure to most people, and We have veiled it from them when We found them wandering in the wilderness of delusion. Detach thyself from all else, then remember what has befallen My Soul, then speak My praise among the heedless, that they might recognize their Creator and become detached from the idolaters. Say: O people! Know the worth of these days, then hearken to God's call from the direction of His prison. He calls you at all times to draw you to the station ordained for you in a preserved Tablet. Yet you have risen in opposition, and there issues from your tongues concerning His Cause that which causes the heart of every possessor of a heart to burn and the faces of the mystics to pale. Say: O people! If the matter were as you claim, why did We send 'Ali before and sacrifice him in this clear and manifest path? If you were true to what you say, why did you change your religion? By God, you are of those who seek refuge from the frying pan in the fire. Woe unto you, O company of idolaters! If you find one who is receptive, cast upon him the words of your Lord; otherwise conceal them and avoid those who have disbelieved in God, the King, the Mighty, the Peerless. Thus have We cast upon you that which causes tears to flow from the eyes of the monotheists. By God, if you were to look upon Me with the eye of your heart, you would find in My outward and inward being naught but the wounds from the spears of the fettered ones. The evil ones of the Bayan have united with the evil ones of the Furqan for My harm and affliction. Fie upon them and that which they possess of satanic deception! Nay, Satan himself flees from these and seeks refuge with God from their evil and their plots. Your Lord is witness to what I say. Convey My glorification to your son's face, then remind him of My remembrance, that the remembrance of God, the King, the Just, the Wise, may stir him. And the Glory be upon you and upon him and upon those who are with you among Our assured servants. And praise be to God, the Beloved of the worlds and the Goal of the mystics.

He is God, the Most Holy, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Exalted

This is a Book from Baha unto him who dwelt within himself in the days of his Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Merciful, that perchance the sweet-scented breezes of the All-Glorious from this Paradise might seize him from himself and detach him from all creation and whatsoever hath been created in the realms of being, and draw him nigh unto the court of his Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful, and purify him from all that God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Compelling, loveth not.

Hearken unto the crowing of the Cock of the Throne and the cooing of the Dove of Paradise, then unto the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, then the rushing of the winds that blow from the right hand of thy Lord's throne and the downpour of the rain of mercy which descendeth from the heaven of holiness upon all created things, that there might be kindled within thy heart such fire of the love of God that thou shalt be detached from the world and all that is therein and arise to praise the Manifestation of the Self of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.

O servant! Hear My words, then efface from thy heart all allusions, that there might be imprinted thereon the lights of thy Lord's countenance and thou mightest behold with thine own eyes what hath been ordained for thee in the dominion of destiny by thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and be of them that attain. Cast away what is in the hands of men, then take what is with God, thy Lord. This indeed shall suffice thee above the kingdom of the dominion of the heavens and earth.

Say: O people! This is a servant of God and the son of His servant who hath come unto you with God's signs and His proof. Beware lest ye deny him by reason of what ye possess and be of the heedless. He desireth for you naught save that which is better for your own selves than whatsoever hath been created between the heavens and earth. Say: O people! Ponder within yourselves - have ye witnessed a Revelation more mighty than what hath appeared in truth? Fear God and be of the fair-minded. Should ye deny this bounty, by what proof then do ye affirm your faith in God your Lord? Bring it forth and tarry not even for a moment. Say: He hath come to quicken the world and gather all upon the ancient, eternal, fresh and verdant table. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves thereof and be of them that are veiled. Say: Verily the Sun hath risen in truth and reached its zenith, yet ye have not turned to its rays but remain as dead ones within the veils of your selves. Therefore lift up your heads from the couch of heedlessness and passion, then turn toward the heaven that ye might behold with your own eyes what none before you hath ever witnessed. Thus do We set forth the verses and expound them in truth, that perchance there might be generated in the hearts of the servants that which shall draw them nigh unto the shore of grace, the spot wherein shine forth the lights of the countenance of thy Lord, the Powerful, the Most High, the Most Great.

Arise to fulfill the Cause and fear no one, then bring people into the religion of God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who, when they hear the verses of the All-Merciful, fall prostrate upon their faces before God, the King, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And praise be to God, the Beloved of them that know.

Cast then the greeting from thy Lord, the All-Merciful, upon the countenance of thy son, then upon the side of knowledge, then draw her through the breezes of thy Lord from the left of wisdom and standing unto the right of attraction and yearning, out of love for the face of God, the King, the Just, the All-Wise.

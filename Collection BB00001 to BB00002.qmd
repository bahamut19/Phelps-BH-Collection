In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy

All praise and glory befitteth the sacred and glorious court of the sovereign Lord, Who from everlasting hath dwelt, and unto everlasting will continue to dwell within the mystery of His Own Inmost Reality , Who from time immemorial hath abided and will forever continue to abide within His transcendent eternity, exalted above the reach and ken of all created beings. The sign of His matchless Revelation as created by Him and imprinted upon the realities of all beings, is none other but their powerlessness to know Him. And he hath not shed upon anything the splendor of His revelation, except through the inmost capacity of the thing itself. He Himself hath at all times been immeasurably exalted above any association with His creatures.

He hath fashioned the entire creation in such wise that all beings may, by virtue of the inmost reality of their innate nature, bear witness before God on the Day of Resurrection that He hath no peer or equal and is sanctified from any likeness, similitude or comparison. He hath been and will ever be one and incomparable in the transcendent glory of His divine being and He hath ever been indescribably mighty in the sublimity of His sovereign Lordship.

No one hath ever been able befittingly to recognize Him nor will any man succeed at any time in comprehending Him as is truly meet and seemly, for any reality to which the term \`being' is applicable hath been created by the sovereign Will of Almighty. And God hath shed upon the Will the splendors of His revelation through the Will Himself, and in accordance with His most august station

He hath moreover deposited within the realities of all created things the emblem of His Will's recognition that everyone may know of a certainty that the Primal Will is the Beginning and the End, the Manifest and the Hidden, the Maker and the Sustainer, the Omnipotent and the All-Knowing, the One Who heareth and perceiveth all things, He Who is invincible in His power and standeth supreme in His Own identity, He Who quickeneth and causeth to die, the All-Powerful, the Inaccessible, the Most Exalted, the Most High.

It is the Will Who betokeneth naught but the sublimity of God's Glorification, the loftiness of His sanctification, the inaccessible height of the exaltation of His unity, and the unreachable summit of His magnification His beginning hath had no beginning other than His Own firstness and His end knoweth no end save His Own lastness.

All things, with all that hath been destined, or will ever be destined thereof, have verily attained thingness by virtue of the thingness of the Will, and have achieved reality through His identity. It is to the Will that God hath assigned the Beginning of the creation of all things, and it is unto Him that He hath ordained the return of the creation of all things.

All the most excellent Names belong to the Will, while the depth of His Essence is sanctified above any Name or praise, the purity (kafúr ) of His indivisible unity (sadhij) is exalted above any glory or loftiness, and the substance of His transcendence is glorified above any height or sublimity. He is the First, yet not defined by it, and He is the Last, but not described by it. He is the Seen, and not praised by it, and He is Hidden, and not recognized by it.

He is the First to believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, and He is the First Who hath believed in Him Who hath been manifested. He is the True One Being, by Whose creation all things are created, by Whose Provision, all things receive provision, by Whose death, the death of all things is manifested, by Whose life, the quickening of all things is manifested, and by Whose rising up, the resurrection of al things is made manifest.

The eyes of existence have never seen the like of Him, neither aforetimes, nor hereafter. He is the Name of the Unseen Essence , and the Countenance of Lordship, Who abideth beneath the Face of Divinity and refereth unto the Sovereignty of Divine Oneness.

Were I to know that all things will taste His love, I would never mention the word hellish fire, inasmuch as the inmost reality of fire came into existence, with all his attributes and nature, by virtue of his refusal to bow down before Him. Otherwise, to the extent that all things partake of His love, they are all light, from light, within light, towards light, and upon light. God would guide through His light whomever He willeth, and He raiseth unto His light whomever He pleaseth. He verily is the Cause of the Beginning of things, and their Return.

It is for the Will, and through the manifestation of His own Self, that God hath created, out of His Self, 18 souls, ere the creation of all things; and He hath enshrined the sign of their recognition in the inmost reality of all things, that all, from the depth of their essence, may bear witness that He is the Primal Unity and the Eternal Ever-Living. For He hath enjoined upon His contingent beings naught but the recognition of His own Self, and the celebration of the Unity of the quintessence of His Inmost Reality. For all besides Him are mere created beings before the court of His glory, who are created by His Cause. Behold! His are the kingdoms of Revelation and that of creation, aforetimes and hereafter. Verily He is the Lord of all worlds.

He who beholdeth these words should know that God hath returned and renewed the very creation of the Qur'an, in the Day of Resurrection, by virtue of manifesting, therein, His very own Self. Then He fashioned all things as a new wondrous creation, as if all things hath come into existence at that very moment. For every things hath been created for the sake of the day of the Manifestation of God, inasmuch as He is the supreme Purpose of all things, and the ultimate End of all things. Thus when He was manifested through the revelation of the verses of His inimitable power, all things have undoubtedly achieved the utmost perfection attainable to them, the presence of God.

Then once again God, glorified and exalted be Him, created the Primal Will, and created all things through Him. Inasmuch as at this very moment, the creation of all things was described as a New Creation, it becometh evident that His creation hath always existed and will continue forever to exist. For there hath never been a time when God hath been adored, with no creature to worship Him. God verily hath always been in the sublimity of His sanctity, while all besides Him have been confined to the abyss of their limitation.

And the very beginning of the creation of all things is taking place in this hour, a Friday, through these very words that are being uttered by God. The Lord of Majesty hath fashioned this new wondrous creation by virtue of His own Command, and He hath made it abide beneath His shadow, until such time when He will return it. For it is beyond whatever doubt that it is God Who hath brought this creation into being and it is Him Who afterwards cause it to return. God is verily potent over all things.

God hath organized the creation of all things in accordance with the number of all things (kull shay'=361), by virtue of the commandments which have been revealed from the court of His holiness, and have shone forth out of the Day Star of His grace, that all things may attain perfection through the remembrance of all things within all things, for the manifestation of the Next Resurrection. At that Hour, He shall recompense everything according to its due right. Should it be one of negation, it would be by His justice, and should it be one of affirmation, it would be by His mercy.

For His knowledge of all things before the existence of all things, is like His knowledge of all things after their existence. Likewise, His power over all things before the existence of all things, is like His power over them after their existence. God hath always known all things and hath always been potent over all things. His are the Excellent Names, aforetimes and hereafter. All that is in the heavens, on earth, and in that which lieth between them ceaselessly glorify His praise. None other God is there but Him, the Almighty, the Best-Beloved.

Behold with the eyes of certitude that the gates (chapters) of the religion of the Bayan is arranged in accordance with the number of all things. Beneath the shadow of each gate (chapter), all the angels of the heavens, the earth, and that which lieth between them, are, by the leave of God, immersed in glorification and magnification, sanctification and celebration of divine praise, and deeds and exaltation. Yet in the Day of the Revelation of God, which is the very Revelation of the Point of the Bayan in His Resurrection, unto Him all gates shall return.

Should 361 exalted souls, the number of all things, turn unto Him, the fruit of all things would be manifested before Him. Well is it with him who is gathered in the day of Resurrection before God, who is accepted by Him as one of the gates (chapters) of the all things (The Bayan), inasmuch as he is the very exalted soul, unto whom shall return all who have believed in the Bayan through their fulfillment of the commandment of that very gate. Therefore, hasten ye unto this lofty bounty, then hasten ye, hasten ye, hasten ye, and hasten ye. For God is the Most Swift in reckoning.

Who knoweth, it could be that the gates of all things will not all attain His presence, and yet He may ordain the return of the creation of the Bayan, and to wrap up, in His grasp, all the heavens that are raised in the Bayan. Even as in the Qur'an, countless number of the gates (chapters) have been infinitely multiplied amongst the believers , and yet at the time that God hath renewed the creation of the Qur'an, none was present before Him except a single soul, who is accounted before Him as one gate (chapter) among all the gates of the divine law. Thus, God doeth what He willeth, and it is He Who ordaineth and wisheth , and He may not be questioned of that which He doeth, while all are questioned of all things.

At this time when the entire creation of the Qur'an hath returned, and the creation of all things hath begun within the Bayan, the habitation of the Point, Who is the Manifestation of Lordship, lieth upon the land called by the name Basit, where all the heavens that have been raised in the Qur'an are all wrapped up and returned unto the Primal Point. Yet none hath witnessed unto this Resurrection save God and he who is present before Him.

Notwithstanding the fact that God hath not revealed in the Qur'an any matter of more significance than the Day of Resurrection and being brought before Him, yet at the Hour of Return, of all the countless souls who believed in the Qur'an, whose number is only reckoned by God, only one soul hath been present before God. That was the Hour when all things have returned, and all things have been created in the resurrected life, at the behest of the Exalted God.

Therefore, take heed and watch yourselves O the people of the Bayan, not to be shut out as by a veil from God, your Lord, despite your yearning, day and night, to attain holiness.

In the Gate One of the number of all things , that which is enjoined by God, glorified and exalted be Him, is the recognition of this word: "There is none other God but God, the Absolute Truth, the Utter truth." For the entire Bayan returneth unto this word, and the gathering of the Next Creation shall proceed thereof. But the recognition of this word dependeth upon the recognition of the Point of the Bayan, Whom God hath ordained the Lord of the seven letters.

Whoso knoweth of a certainty that He is the Point of the Qur'an manifested in His Resurrection, and the Point of the Bayan in His first Revelation, and that He is the Primal Will Who existeth by Himself, the Self-Subsistent, while all things are created by His bidding, and exist by Him, he is numbered among those whose inmost realities have testified unto the unity of his Lord. For he who recognizeth Him not, he is a letter of negation, and he will enter the hellish fire, and what fire is more remote than the very being of he who faileth to believe in Him? And he who believeth in Him, he entereth the heaven of affirmation, and what paradise is more exalted than the very soul who recognizeth Him?

That is the Word Who verily hath glorified, exalted, magnified, sanctified, and praised His Lord in the day time and in the night season.

Gaze not upon this Word, except as thou beholdest the sun in the heaven; and see not he who believeth in Him, save as thou lookest at the mirror. For the inmost reality of any one who believeth in the Lord of the seven letters, is derived from one of the Names of God, glorified and exalted be Him, while his outward manifestation is a leaf amongst the leaves of the Tree of Affirmation. All things return unto this Indivisible One Being (shay'-I-vahid), and all things are created by this Indivisible One Being.

In the next Resurrection, this Indivisible One Being is naught but the very being of Him Whom God shall make manifest, Who, under all conditions, proclaimeth: "I, in very truth, am God! None other God is there but Me, the Lord of all things, and all besides Me are only My creation. Then adore Me, O My creation!"

Know thee that He is the Supreme Mirror of God, out of Whose Revelation is manifested the worldly Mirror, Which is naught but the Letters of the Living, and naught is seen in that Supreme Mirror of God but God. Whoso speaketh in the Dispensation of the Bayan the word "There is none other God but God," he hath turned unto God through Him, even as the Beginning of his creation hath been caused through Him, and it is through Him that the Return of his creation shall be carried out.

The fruit of this true knowledge is this, that in the Day of Resurrection, ye would not say that we bear witness unto the word "There is none other God but God," and that this is the root pillar of religion. For all that ye bear witness is merely a shadow of His Transcendent Sun, which hath been manifested in His first Revelation , while He Himself is more true to this word, than the truth of the inmost realities of all created beings to their own being. For should a mirror say that the Sun is present in me, it would be evident before the True Sun that it is only Its shadow that the mirror is speaking of.

O ye the created beings of the Bayan! We verily have made you recognize the uttermost excellence of your existence which lieth in the word of your Lord, that ye may not be veiled from Him Whom God shall assuredly make manifest, in truth, in the Day of Resurrection. For verily all that ye speak is a mere image of His revealed word within your hearts, whereas that which He proclaimeth is what God hath testified unto Himself, that, "verily there is none other God but Him, the Omnipotent, the Self-Subsisting."

Today, amongst the followers of the Qur'an, he who witnesseth unto this word, which is the essence of all faith, he undoubtedly speaketh this word solely by virtue of the previous affirmation of this same word by Muhammad, the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him. For the True Sun of this supreme word hath been effulging in His heart, and it is a mere shadow thereof that is manifest in today's speakers of that word. Therefore, all expressions of this word return unto Muhammad in His next Revelation, which is the manifestation of the Point of the Bayan, and not in His first Revelation.

For in His First Revelation, the Tree of divine Unity, had not yet been exalted in the inmost realities of the created beings, but now that 1270 years have passed, this Tree hath attained the stage of yielding fruits. Whoso findeth in himself a shadow of that Sun, the Point of the Furqan, Who is the very Point of the Bayan Himself, he must manifest it today before the holy court of the Point of the Bayan.

I used the example of the most exalted word, upon which resteth the faith of all, whose utterance confirmeth the beginning of religion, and it is proclaimed by all at the time of their death, after which they then return unto Him. For the shadows present in the mirrors, return not, except unto that form which they have proceeded. Therefore, when the mirror is removed, that which it containeth of the image of the Sun, returneth unto the True Sun, inasmuch as it hath proceeded therefrom. Yet neither its return nor its resurrection taketh place, except at the level of its mirrorness.

Where the uttermost height of the word of the Furqan, in the past, and the utmost summit of the word of the Bayan, in the future, is of this ephemeral character before the Sun of the Truth, how much less must be the station of the manifold tokens which are derived from this same word, including those of the knowledge of the Names of God, knowledge of the Prophet, knowledge of the Imams of guidance, that of the Gates of guidance, and those of the infinite, and countless secondary questions.

Whoso is shut out from His recognition on account of any of the above, he hath been veiled from that Inmost Reality, out of Whom hath proceeded his very existence, and unto Him he shall return. This assumeth that he hath in truth belonged to the Tree of Affirmation, and therefore, his witnessing unto the verse of unity was indeed referring unto the Sun. Otherwise, if, God forbid, his testimony fail to refer unto Him, he would not even be worth mentioning.

For amongst those who claim allegiance to the Qur'an, how many judgments are prevalent, which contradict that which is revealed by God. And this non-mentioning before God pertaineth to their inmost realities, and not to that which is derived thereof. For that derivative which refereth unto the non-truth, returneth unto his inmost reality, and inasmuch as his inmost reality faileth to point towards God, it is not even mentioned before Him. Likewise that which is derived from the inmost realities that are endued with truth, returneth unto them. Should these inmost realities be signs that are securely established within the mirrors of their heart, and not the mere transitory and borrowed ones, they would return unto their true habitations, in both the Beginning and the Resurrection.

Inasmuch as the Sun is bound to shine forth forever, those mirrors will never cease to seek reflection in their own limited stations. The effulgence of God hath never been and will never be interrupted or exhausted.

Whoso saith, "God! God is my Lord, I join no partner with Him. Verily the Lord of the seven letters is the Gate of God, and I will not call unto any Gate besides Him," and he will recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest, he hath then attained unto this first gate of the first unity. Well is it with those who have attained, for their share of the wondrous splendor of the Mighty Day. That is the Day in which all are brought before God, their Lord.

Gate Two of the First Unity

The Substance of this gate is this, that Muhammad, blessings of God rest upon Him, and the Manifestations of His Self, have all returned to this world. They were the first amongst the servants Who stood in the presence of God in this Day of Resurrection, acknowledged His unity, and proclaimed the verses of His Bab unto all mankind. Therefore, God hath fulfilled the promise He made in the Qur'an, "And We desire to show favour to those who were brought low in the land, and to make them spiritual leaders (Imams) among men, and to make of them Our heirs," and made Them Imams (spiritual leaders).

And by the very same proof which aforetimes the prophethood of Muhammad, blessings of God rest upon Him, was vindicated, Their return to the world is also proven in the sight of God and those who are endued with knowledge. That supreme proof is naught but the revelation of the verses, which is beyond the power of all dwellers on earth to produce the like thereof.

There should be no doubt that man's glory is in witnessing unto God's unity, recognizing Him, acknowledging His justice, obeying Him, and seeking His good pleasure. It is, however, certain that these sacred Souls have attained, prior to everyone else, unto that which is the quintessence of all excellence and glory, inasmuch as any one who ponderth , he beholdeth no glory in anything except in the good pleasure of God. And there can be no doubt that They were the first Lights Who bowed down before God, accepted the verses He hath revealed unto His Bab, and proclaimed them to the world.

No excellence in the world is more exalted than this glorious state that the heart of the servant would ceaselessly refer unto God, and never be veiled from His Beloved even for an infinitesimal moment (a ninth of a ninth of a tenth of a tenth of a ninth of a moment). For in all deeds performed by anyone in his life, he desireth naught but the good pleasure of God, inasmuch as this is the uttermost end of all. But it is undoubtedly true that the good pleasure of God shall not be manifested save through the good pleasure of the One unto Whom God hath conferred His supreme testimony.

Without a doubt, these holy Lights were blessed with the attainment, prior to all other things, of the good pleasure of God, and that is the most exalted excellence above any excellence, and the most glorious sublimity above any sublimity. There should also be no doubt that Their Return in the Next Revelation is far greater in the sight of God than Their First Revelation in the past. Thus, that which aforetimes hath proven the station of prophethood, today vindicateth the station of Viceregency.

Although the Revelation of the Point of the Bayan is exactly the very Revelation of Muhammad in His Return, yet, inasmuch as He hath been manifested as the Revelation of God Himself, therefore, it is only beneath His glorious shadow that all Names can refer unto God. For He is the First and the Last, and the Seen and the Hidden. As for the Most Excellent Names, God hath singled out, in This Dispensation, Their names as the 18 Letters of the Living.

For They consist of 14 sacred Soul, and the Hidden, Well-Guarded Name, Whose 4 letters are called by various names including the Four Gates, the Lights of the Throne, and the Bearers of creation, provision, death, and life. Together They comprise the number of the word the Living (hayy=18), Who are the most near Names unto God. All others besides Them are guided through Their guidance, inasmuch as God hath proceeded the creation of the Bayan from Them, and hath ordained that unto Them they shall return.

They are the Lights Who have ever been, and will continue forever to be, kneeling before the Throne of God. In each Dispensation, They are called by different Names amongst the people, and in each Revelation, Their physical names are also changed. Yet, the names of Their inmost realities, which refer unto God, and are manifest in Their hearts- without which They could not attain the presence of God by virtue of the nearness of their inmost realities-, have always existed and will continue forever to exist.

Although there are infinite names for God, yet it was through Their Names that all have received the divine effulgence. Thus all were guided through Their guidance. Naught is seen in the hearts of These Names but God. Nay, rather, naught is seen in the heart of any believer, male or female, except the Name through Whom his heart seeketh help from God, and naught is seen in that Name save God alone.

Behold! His is the kingdom of creation, and His is the kingdom of Revelation, aforetimes and hereafter. There is none other God but Him, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsistent.

Whoso had recognized Muhammad, blessings of God rest upon Him, together with the believer in the one other than Him, he hath returned beneath His shadow. All shall be recompensed for that which they have done, For God is a witness unto all things.

Gate Three of the First Unity

On this, that 'Alí, peace be upon Him, hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful, and all who believed in the one other than Him. He is, after the letter Sín, the Second to believe in the Point.

Gate Four of the First Unity

On this, that Fatimih, the blessings of God rest upon Her, hath returned to the world, together with all Her faithful, and all who believed in the one other than Her.

Gate Five of the First Unity

On this, that Hasan, peace be upon Him, hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful, and all who believed in the one other than Him.

Gate Six of the First Unity

On this, that Husayn, peace be upon Him, hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful, and all who believed in the one other than Him.

Gate Seven of the First Unity

On this, that 'Alí the Son of Husayn, peace be upon Him, hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful, and all who believed in the one other than Him.

Gate Eight of the First Unity

On this, that Muhammad the Son of 'Alí, peace be upon Him, hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful, and all who believed in the one other than Him.

Gate Nine of the First Unity

On this, that Ja'far the Son of Muhammad, peace be upon Him, hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful, and all who believed in the one other than Him.

Gate Ten of the First Unity

On this, that Músí the Son of Ja'far, peace be upon Him, hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful, and all who believed in the one other than Him.

Gate Eleven of the First Unity

On this, that 'Alí the Son of Músa, peace be upon Him, hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful, and all who believed in the one other than Him.

Gate Twelve of the First Unity

On this, that Muhammad the Son of 'Alí, peace be upon Him, hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful, and all who believed in the one other than Him.

Gate Thirteen of the First Unity

On this, that 'Alí the Son of Muhammad, peace be upon Him, hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful, and all who believed in the one other than Him.

Gate Fourteen of the First Unity

On this, that Hasan the Son of 'Alí, peace be upon Him, hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful, and all who believed in the one other than Him.

Gate Fifteen of the First Unity

On this, that the Qa'im, the Testimony of God, peace be upon Him, hath been manifested with verses and conclusive evidences, through the Revelation of the Point of the Bayan, which is exactly the very Revelation of the Point of the Furqan.

Although the Point of the Bayan was mentioned in the first gate, the Point of the Furqan in the second, and the revelation of the Qa'im in the fifteenth gate, the truth of this mystery lieth in the fact that the Point in Its station of pure transcendence, which is naught but the very utter Revelation of God Himself and is manifested by the name Divinity, is mentioned in the first gate. But the same Point in Its station of determination, which is the rank of the Primal Will, is mentioned in the second gate. Finally, the manifestation of the Point in Its station of standing supreme over (qa'imíyyat) all souls, which is a glory confined to the Revelation of the Fourteenth Sacred Soul, was mentioned in the fifteenth gate.

The Point in Its Primal station of Firstness hath ever been, and will continue forever to be. He is more true and befitting to be praised by all Names, than the praise of any Name for Itself. For instance, when the Name Divinity is present, the Name Lordship, and all other Names are also present therein, even though He Who is manifest by the Name of Divinity, He hath always been, and forever will continue to be, mentioned as the Divinity in the lofty station of the Point, while the Images of all Names remain manifest solely in the sublimity of Their own habitations. For He is the First at the time that He is the Last, and He is the Hidden at the time that He is the Manifest, and He is the One Who is praised by all the Names, at the very time that He is glorified above the praise by any Name. There is none other God but Him, the Upright Qa'im, the Self-Subsistent Qayyúm.

Gate Sixteen of the First Unity

On this, that the first Gate hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful in truth, and all who believed in the one other than Him.

Gate Seventeen of the First Unity

On this, that the second Gate hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful in truth, and all who believed in the one other than Him.

Gate Eighteen of the First Unity

On this, that the third Gate hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful in truth, and all who believed in the one other than Him.

Gate Nineteen of the First Unity

On this, that the fourth Gate hath returned to the world, together with all His faithful in truth, and all who believed in the one other than Him.

Gate One of the Second Unity

On Recognition of Testimony and Proof

The substance of this gate is this, that in each Dispensation, the Lord of the universe, glorified and magnified be His station, manifesteth His incontrovertible testimony, according to that which is the pride and glory of the most exalted amongst the renown of that Dispensation. Thus at the time of the revelation of the Qur'an, all claimed glory in the eloquence of speech, and therefore God revealed the Qur'an in the utmost height of eloquence, and ordained it to be the miracle of the Apostle of God, blessing of God rest upon Him.

Indeed in the entire Qur'an, God hath not adduced any proof to vindicate the truth of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, and the religion of Islam, except through the divine verses, which are the most mighty evidence. What proveth this supreme superiority of the verses is that all the people speak with the same letters of alphabet, and yet the Lord of the universe, hath revealed the words of the Qur'an in such wise that should all the dwellers on earth combine together and desire to bring forth one comparable verse in refutation of the verses of the Qur'an, they would be powerless to do so, and they all would fail.

The wonderful mystery of this lieth in the fact that God hath revealed the Qur'an out of the Tree of the Will, which is the inner truth of Muhammad Himself, through the tongue of the Apostle Himself. But that supremely exalted Tree revealeth no letter, unless He bringeth into existence, at that very moment of revelation, the spirit of the same letter. For example, should He reveal, "We verily have called into being the proceeding of this creation, by virtue of Our behest, for verily We are supreme over all things," then the utterance of proceeding is attached unto all that is called by the name all things. For none besides God encompasseth all things, that its word could dominate all thing, and by its utterance all creatures would be called into existence.

Likewise, should God reveal, "We verily shall return this creation, according to a promise from Us, for We are potent over all things," the same would be true. For at the moment of the revelation of this word, the spirits pertaining to the return of all things are brought in to existence before the Manifestation of this same verse, so that in the Day of Resurrection He would attain the presence of God to fulfil the return of all things.

None besides God hath the power to do so, inasmuch as that which is uttered by God out of the Tree of the Truth, would instantly create, by itself, the inmost reality of the thing mentioned. Should it pertain to the non-sublime paradise, it would become one of the letters of negation, and should it belong to the letters of the sublime paradise, it would become one of the letters of affirmation. For the word of God is utterly True, and whatever that is mentioned by it, acquireth thingness at once, that it could partake of "truth", and that, therefore it would refer to His utter Truth.

It is for that reason that it is revealed in the past, "Verily the fire is true, and the paradise is true." The exposition of the mode of the creation of the spirit pertaining to the truth-creating Word is made in its own place. Whoso ponderth upon it, he would assuredly witness that the spirits of truth are generated within the inmost realities of the souls and the universe, by the Revelation of the Primal Point through the divine verses. Even as God hath revealed, aforetimes, in this verse of the Qur'an: "We will surely show them Our signs in the world and within themselves, until it becometh manifest unto them that He is the Truth."

And unless one fixeth his gaze upon the inmost reality of all things, which is the spirit of his heart, he will not comprehend the true realisation of, "Behold! Verily the Word of God is true," that it is by the very utterance of the Word that the true thing acquireth truth and reality in its inmost reality. This sublime creative meaning is confined to God, glorified and exalted be Him, inasmuch as none besides Him is the Creator, the Provider, the Slayer, and the Quickener of things.

Likewise, in the kingdom that is created by the Word of God, each authoritative word that would negate the letter of negation and affirm the letter of affirmation, is solely a shadow of the verses that are revealed by Him. Nay, rather, those words of authority are naught but that which is manifested from the Manifestations of the divine verses or from Their Words. For at the very moment that God mentioneth the word faithful, he is at once fashioned by that utterance, and when He revealeth the letters of the non-sublime paradise, their spirits are thereby readily created.

This is the wonderful reason why the verses of God are the supreme incontrovertible testimony unto all beings, and why they constitute the most mighty clear evidence and the most great conclusive token to vindicate His power and knowledge.

There is no doubt that in the Dispensation of the Point of the Bayan, the pride and glory of those endued with understanding is in their knowledge of the divine unity, the subtleties of inward knowledge, and the exalted expressions of those who are faithful to the viceregency of the Imams. Therefore, the Lord of the universe hath ordained His testimony to lie, even as the testimony of the Apostle of God, in the very revelation of the verses themselves, and hath streamed forth from His lips words concerning the utmost summit of divine unity and the uttermost height of transcendence, in such wise that anyone who is endued with the spirit of divine unity hath shown forth his fidelity unto Him, except those who fail to comprehend His words of love with His Beloved.

Likewise God hath manifested from Him endless modes of true wisdom and knowledge, that none besides God hath appreciated or recognised their value. Although the very manifestation of the Day Star of the Truth is by Itself that which barreth all the contingent beings from the lofty station of recognising Him, but He drawth all the beings by virtue of the radiance of His illuminating effects, through the words and verses that God hath enshrined within Him.

Otherwise, Hath He any equal to be recognised by, or any peer to be praised by, or any like to be likened unto, or any associate to be associated with, or any simile to be resembled to? Glorified then Be God above such claims, a most mighty glorification! For naught is seen in Him but God, while We all verily adore Him.

In this Revelation the Lord of the universe hath deigned to bestow His mighty utterances and resplendent signs upon the Point of the Bayan, and hath ordained them as His matchless testimony for all created things. Were all the people that dwell on earth to assemble together, they would be unable to produce a single verse like unto the ones which God hath caused to stream forth from the tongue of the Point of the Bayan. Indeed, if any living creature were to pause to meditate he would undoubtedly realize that these verses are not the work of man, but are solely to be ascribed unto God, the One, the Peerless, Who causeth them to flow forth from the tongue of whomsoever He willeth, and hath not revealed nor will He reveal them save through the Focal Point of God's Primal Will. He it is, through Whose dispensations divine Messengers are raised up and heavenly Books are sent down.

Had human beings been able to accomplish this deed surely someone would have brought forth at least one verse during the period of twelve hundred and seventy years which hath elapsed since the revelation of the Qur'an until that of the Bayan. However, all men have proved themselves impotent and have utterly failed to do so, although they endeavoured, with their vehement might, to quench the flame of the Word of God.

Should today anyone ponder, he would assuredly witness that those who have acknowledged the sufficiency of the testimony of the verses, and have proclaimed them unto all mankind, they are the testimonies of God. Even if the binding testimony of these holy souls may not be outwardly manifest, but the utmost excellence of their inner understanding and mystic knowledge is not concealed to anyone. For the lowest disciples of the late Siyyid hath excelled in their depth of understanding the most renowned of the highest leaned and philosophers on earth. Furthermore, those who have recognised the sufficiency of the testimony of My verses, be of Siyyid's disciples or not, are the ones whose utmost righteousness no one hath doubted.

However, such mention is due to the feebleness of the people, otherwise the testimony offered by God can never be compared with that which is testified by any one of the peoples and kindreds of the earth; and beyond a shadow of doubt the testimony witnessed by God is not manifested save through the One Who is appointed as His supreme Testimony. Moreover, the proof of revealed verses doth, alone and of itself, conclusively demonstrate the utter impotence of all created things on earth, for this is a proof which hath proceeded from God and shall endure until the Day of Resurrection.

And if anyone should reflect on the appearance of this Tree, he will undoubtedly testify to the loftiness of the Cause of God. For if one from whose life only twenty-four years have passed, and who is devoid of those sciences wherein all are learned, now reciteth verses after such fashion without thought or hesitation, writes a thousand verses of prayer in the course of five hours without pause of the pen, and produceth commentaries and learned treatises on such lofty themes as the true understanding of God and of the oneness of His Being, in a manner which doctors and philosophers confess surpasseth their power of understanding, then there is no doubt that all that hath been manifested is divinely inspired.

Notwithstanding their life-long diligent study, what pains do these divines take when writing a single line in Arabic! Yet after such efforts the result is but words which are unworthy of mention. All these things are for a proof unto the people; otherwise the religion of God is too mighty and glorious for anyone to comprehend through aught but itself; rather by it all else is understood.

By the Essence of God Who hath been Peerless, and will forever remain Incomparable! The Writings of that Sun of the Truth is more radiant than the lights of sun in the daytime, while the works of those who are guided by His supreme guidance, should they attain the most exalted summit of knowledge and true recognition, resemble the light of stars in the night season.

I beg the pardon of God for this comparison! For how the Eternal Ocean can be known through the originated sea, and how the Primal Utterance (dhikr) can be recognised by the utterance of limitations? Immeasurably glorified and exalted be God above all that is described by allusions in the kingdoms of earth and of heavens!

All these were mentioned on account of people's limitation. Otherwise, that which shall be adduced as binding testimony in the Day of Resurrection, is naught but the verses, even as it was adduced as sufficient proof in this Day of Resurrection.

Thus in this Resurrection, God hath asked through the lips of His Word, "Whose Book is the Qur'an?" All His faithful replied: "It is God's Book." Then He asked them, "Is there any difference seen between the Furqan and the Bayan?" to which those endued with understanding heart answered, "Nay! By God! All are from our Lord, and none will take heed except those who are endued with vision."

Then thus was revealed by God: "That was My Word through the tongue of Muhammad, the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, and This is My Word through the tongue of the Lord of the seven letters, the Gate of God. He who hath believed in That, he hath no place to flee to, should he desire to remain firm in faith, except to believe in These verses, otherwise his inmost reality and his deeds would be dissipated and lost, as it was in the day in which naught was mentioned before God." He then revealed this:

"O My Creatures! Ye all perform, throughout your lives, with utmost striving and endeavour, my commandments for the sake of attaining My good pleasure. If ye observe the derivative precepts, that is solely because I have revealed them in the Book; if ye recognise the Imams of guidance, or seek My nearness through visiting Their shrines, that is merely because Their names have been alluded to in the Qur'an, if ye acknowledge unto the prophethood of Muhammad, the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, that is only because He was My Messenger; if ye circle around Ka'bih, that is merely because I have called it My House, and if ye magnify the Qur'an, that is solely because It is My Word.

Likewise, in general, whatever praise any of My servants addresseth towards anyone, even if he is just a man amongst the community of men, it is solely because of his bearing allegiance unto Me, as it is understood by My servant. Yet, notwithstanding all this, he hath been shut out by a veil, hath erred grievously, and hath been veiled from My Next Manifestations.

For nothing existeth, except its reality ultimately returneth unto the human temple that is fashioned by My Command, and the reality of human temple returneth, through successive stages of mediation, unto My prophet, and the prophethood of that Prophet is not vindicated, except by the Book that is revealed unto Him, and the testimony that is conferred upon Him. But, today is the Day of My own Revelation, appearing by My Self.

However, this mention of My Revelation as "by My Self" is like the mention of Ka'bih, when I have called it My House. Otherwise, My Essence is sanctified above any firstness or lastness, and it is exalted beyond any manifestation or concealment. Rather, today, that which returneth unto this sacred Soul Who reciteth, on My behalf, My verses, shall return unto Me, and that which returneth not unto Him, shall not return unto Me. This is the meaning of "My Revelation by My Self", and "My concealment by My Essence". For none else is possible at the rank of the contingent reality, and nothing higher can be conceived in the realm of true exposition and knowledge.

How veiled are ye, O My creatures, that by virtue of bearing allegiance unto Me, ye all assume, within your habitations, to be blessed with My good pleasure, and yet without any right, ye have consigned the Supreme Sign which refereth unto Me, He Who reciteth, by My leave, My verses of power, hidden in the treasury of His innate Nature, unto a mountain \[Makú\], not one of whose inhabitants is worthy of mention.

With Him, which is with Me, there is no one except him who is one of the Letters of the Living of My Book. In His presence, which is My Presence, there is not at night even a lighted lamp! And yet, in places \[of worship\] which in varying degrees reach out unto Him, unnumbered lamps are shining! All that is on earth hath been created for Him, and all partake with delight of His benefits, and yet they are so veiled from Him as to refuse Him even a lamp!

In this Day therefore I bear witness unto My creatures, for the witness of no one other than Myself hath been or shall ever be worthy of mention in My presence. I affirm that no Paradise is more sublime for My creatures than to stand before My face and to believe in My holy Words, while no fire hath been or will be fiercer for them than to be veiled from the Manifestation of My exalted Self and to disbelieve in My Words.

Ye may contend: 'How doth He speak on My behalf?' Have ye not perused the unseemly words ye uttered in the past, as reflected in the text of My Book, and still ye feel not ashamed? Ye have now seen the truth of My Book conclusively established and today every one of you doth profess belief in Me through that Book. The day is not far distant when ye shall readily realize that your glory lieth in your belief in these holy verses. Today, however, when only belief in this Faith truly profiteth you, ye have debarred yourselves therefrom by reason of the things which are disadvantageous unto you and will inflict harm upon you, whereas He Who is the Manifestation of My Self hath been and shall ever remain immune from any harm whatever, and any loss that hath appeared or will appear shall eventually revert unto yourselves.

Take pity upon yourselves. Ye ascend to heaven if ye assume that therein lieth My good pleasure, and now that My good pleasure is vindicated by the very testimony that proveth the faith of all, ye have been veiled therefrom, on account of those who bear allegiance to the Qur'an! . By My Holy Essence! I affirm that no paradise is more sublime for these creatures than My Revelation and My verses, while no fire will ever be fiercer for them than being veiled from My exalted Self and disbelieving in My Words.

And if ye contend: 'We are not yet convinced of our powerlessness." Traverse the East of the earth and the West thereof! Even though this is a meaningless word, inasmuch as today the truth of all who dwell on earth returneth unto the realms of Islam, and the very impotency of the most eloquent of these realms is a sufficient proof of the powerlessness of all.

And if they claim that they are not powerless, then why they fail to produce a single verse like Our verses, from the primordial innate nature, and not through acquisition or theft? Although before each Manifestation of Truth, it is expected that the contenders bring forth that which they can, to the extent that the sorcerers did at the time of Moses. But praise be to God that from the Day of Revelation until today, not even that much hath been brought forth by the divines of these realms. They think that they traverse the path of utmost good pleasure of the Truth, and yet they are shut out as by a veil from He Who confirmeth the Truth by His inimitable verses of power!

This disgrace sufficeth the learned divines of Islam, that they exhibit Islamic knowledge on account of their bearing allegiance unto Islam, and yet they are veiled from the One Whose Word hath fashioned and confirmed Islam itself! Had they been content to veil themselves, had they wronged no one, and had they decreed naught but that which is in the Qur'an, they would have been guilty for casting their own souls in fire. But now, besides their own torment, the torments of those who have considered them the learned of Islam, nay, rather the punishments of all who have been veiled from the Manifestation of God, would be theirs.

Were they to ponder upon the incontrovertible verses of God, they would have seen the impotency of their own souls. Then neither the king of Islam, nor those beneath his authority, would have been content to be shut out as by a veil from God. For the glory of all people is in obedience unto God, and had they refused to distort the truth before them, matters would not have ended in this way.

However, there should be no doubt that ultimately God shall make the Truth, through the sufficiency of His supreme testimony, manifest and victorious unto all. Even as today, should anyone who beareth allegiance unto Islam, either of those endued with authority or of those endued with leaning, desire to vindicate the conclusive and binding testimony of the verses, he would be able to do so in less than the twinkling of an eye:

If he hath the power to do so, he would assemble together all the learned, and would tell them: 'It was because of your decrees that I have become veiled from the One Who is invested with verses. There can be but two options: Either ye claim to produce verses like His, in that case His Book and verses are available, and if not, this single verse that is inscribed here is sufficient: "Glorified be Thou O My God! Thou verily art the King of all kings. Thou assuredly bestowest kingdom unto whomsoever Thou willest, and Thou divestest it from whomsoever Thou pleasest; Thou assuredly exaltest whomsoever Thou willest, and Thou abasest whomsoever Thou pleasest; Thou assuredly assistest whomsoever Thou willest, and Thou assuredly disgracest whomsoever Thou pleasest; and Thou assuredly enrichest whomsoever Thou willest, and Thou strikest with poverty whomsoever Thou pleasest. Thou undoubtedly renderest victorious whomsoever Thou willest against whomsoever Thou pleasest. In Thy grasp lieth the kingdom of all things. Thou createst whatsoever Thou willest at Thy behest. Thou verily art the Omniscient, the Omnipotent, the Almighty." Now speak as he hath spoken, from innate nature, and write as he hath written, without any deliberation or stillness of the pen.

On the other hand, if ye fail to bring forth verses like Him, it conclusively proveth that all your decrees have been false and wrong, and that the One invested with these verses is the Truth from God.""

There is no doubt that the Almighty hath sent down these verses unto Him \[the Bab\], even as He sent down unto the Apostle of God. Indeed no less than a hundred thousand verses similar to these have already been disseminated among the people, not to mention His Epistles, His Prayers or His learned and philosophical treatises. He revealeth no less than a thousand verses within the space of five hours. He reciteth verses at a speed consonant with the capacity of His amanuensis to set them down. Thus, it may well be considered that if from the inception of this Revelation until now He had been left unhindered, how vast then would have been the volume of writings disseminated from His pen.

If ye contend that these verses cannot, of themselves, be regarded as a proof, scan the pages of the Qur'an. If God hath established therein any evidence other than the revealed verses to demonstrate the validity of the prophethood of His Apostle--may the blessings of God rest upon Him--ye may then have your scruples about Him. Whereas God hath revealed: "None dispute concerning the verses of God save those who disbelieve, so let not their turn of fortune in the land deceive Thee. The people of Noah…rejected the signs before them. Each nation hath plotted darkly against their Messenger to lay violent hold on Him, and disputed with vain words to invalidate the truth, therefore I seized them; how was then My retribution! And thus did the word of Thy Lord prove true against those who disbelieved, that they are the inmates of the fire."

Concerning the sufficiency of the Book as a proof, God hath revealed: \`Is it not enough for them that We have sent down unto Thee the Book to be recited to them? In this verily is a mercy and a warning to those who believe.' When God hath testified that the Book is a sufficient testimony, as is affirmed in the text, how can one dispute this truth by saying that the Book in itself is not a conclusive proof?

Should the people say about the incontrovertible verses that which hath been said by those gone before them, it could be naught but one of the two: Either, their purpose is to refuse to acknowledge the truth, in which case, no proof would profit them, even as God hath revealed, "Even if they see all signs of power, they will never believe in them," and elsewhere hath revealed, "Surely those against whom the word of Thy Lord has proved true will not believe, even if every sign should come to them, until they witness the grievous torment."

Or, their purpose is to be cautious in matters of faith, in which case, attaining certitude would be easy to accomplish, "But in what revelation will they believe, if they reject God and His verses?" He can attain that certitude either by standing before His court, and requesting answer, in the mode of the verses, to whatever question in any topic he desireth, to hear with his own ears that before the Supreme Origin, there is no deliberation, forging, or artificial consideration of rhymes. Or, he can send someone to sit in His presence for an hour, and to write down that which is revealed of the verses of God. Then he should ponder upon those words to understand, beyond the shadow of doubt, that such verses cannot be produced out of human meditation and a mere rhyming of the words. And had it been possible to produce such verses, surely someone should have done it against the Qur'an, from the beginning of Islam until today, just as there would have been one, from the beginning of this Cause until today, to take this path of rebuttal.

Likewise, should there be any hair-splitting objection based upon syntax, pronunciation, or Arabic grammar, it has to be readily rejected, inasmuch as these rules are themselves derived from the words of God, whereas the revelation of the verses is not bound by them. There is no doubt that the Author of these verses hath disclaimed these rules, and the knowledge thereof, for Himself. Nay, rather, no testimony is more weighty and conclusive before those endued with true understanding, than the very absence of such knowledge, and the revelation of this unconventional form of verses and words. For the fruit of the conventional kinds of knowledge is the understanding of the Book of God, and therefore, knowing them hath never been, nor will ever be, necessary for the Exalted Tree Who revealeth the supreme Book Itself. Rather, all rules of grammar attain binding authority by virtue of that which is revealed by God.

How vast the number of people who are well versed in every science, yet it is their adherence to the holy Word of God which will determine their faith, inasmuch as the fruit of every science is none other than the knowledge of divine precepts and submission unto His good-pleasure. How these types of knowledge could be fruitful by themselves, when those possessing them have appeared amongst the Arabs more frequently than amongst the Persians, whereas there is no excellence and glory in such matters. Instead, true excellence is in attaining the good pleasure of God, knowledge of His unity, and abiding beneath the shadow of obedience and acquiescence unto His Will.

There is no doubt that whatever that is done by most of the people is motivated by their private desire to attain the good pleasure of God. Whereas not many can recognise that which is the good pleasure of God, except those who recognise that which is the good pleasure of His Supreme Testimony. Today, the good pleasure of God is solely confined to the good pleasure of His Supreme Testimony and those who abide beneath His shadow, even though those besides them "think that they verily are rightly guided."

However, that which is testified by God will remain enduring forever, and that which is done by the non-followers of the Cause of God will be dissipated. If today there is any mention of those who in the early days of Islam rejected the Qur'an, of the Christian monks and the eloquent Arabs, there would also remain in future, some mention of those who are veiled today.

Today no deed is of more profit to man than to gaze with justice and fairness upon the verses of the Bayan and to behold with the eyes of certitude the utter truth of the Truth, that haply he may not be shut out as by a veil from attaining the presence of this Manifestation, Whose presence is the very presence of God and Whose good pleasure is the same as His good pleasure. For all have been fashioned for this glorious purpose, as God hath revealed: "It is God Who hath reared the heavens without pillars thou canst behold; then mounted His throne, and imposed laws on the sun and moon: each traveleth to its appointed goal. He ordereth all things. He maketh His signs clear, that ye may have firm faith in the Presence of your Lord."

There is no doubt that any mirror that turneth unto the Sun, it will be radiated, otherwise, the Sun riseth and setteth by itself. But the supreme excellence of all things is to achieve the glorious fruit of their very existence, which is the attainment of the presence of God as well as the faith in His words. Otherwise all things come to naught, by themselves.

And it was this very Exalted Tree Who planted the Tree of the Qur'an in the hearts of the people, for the sake of this glorious Day. Today, all the people boast and pride in bearing allegiance unto Him, and yet they are committing against Him that which they are doing! In the realm of the religious matters, this is the meaning of the sacred utterance, "There is no power nor strength except in God. " For should they repudiate their confession of faith, which is not a true allegiance, they would be more feeble than a helpless fly. And this disgrace sufficeth those who are veiled that they commit their shameful deeds by virtue of bearing allegiance unto Him, and instead of harvesting the fruit of their existence, which is rendering His Cause victorious, they refuse to assist Him. Nay, they are not even content with non-assistance, for had they been content therewith, the habitation of this exalted Tree would not have lied in this mountain.

God sufficeth all the people. He judgeth amongst them in justice. And His judgement is the very same judgement that is now revealed in these words, which separateth, until the Day of Resurrection, between those who have turned unto Him, and those who have turned to one other than Him. Whatsoever that is decreed by God shall be fulfilled. He is the best Helper, the best Protector, the best Reckoner, and the best Judge.

Gate Two of the Second Unity

On this, that none can encompass the knowledge of that which God hath revealed in the Bayan, except Him Whom God willeth

The substance of this gate is this, that none will encompass that which God hath revealed in the Bayan except Him Whom God shall make manifest, or the One that is taught such knowledge by Him (Him Whom God shall make manifest), as well as the Exalted Tree from Whom the Bayan hath shone forth. For should all the oceans in the heavens and on earth turn into ink, all the beings pen, and all the souls those who reckon and describe, they would be powerless to interpret, in its truth, even a single letter of the Bayan, inasmuch as God hath destined neither a beginning nor an end for any letter thereof.

And none is permitted to interpret in regard to that which is revealed by God in the Bayan, the Letters of the sublime paradise except as Him Whom God shall make manifest and His Letters of the Living, and the letters of non-sublime paradise except as the gates of His fire. For all the Letters of the sublime paradise will be gathered beneath His shadow, and all the letters of the non-sublime paradise shall be assembled beneath the shadow of negation.

And the past Dispensation is like the future Dispensation, for there is no change in the Cause of God, even as the Dispensation before that of the past is like the Dispensation after that of the future. The entire Qur'an hath consisted of 114 Súrih, and each 6 Súrih hath been revealed in praise of the exalted station of one of the letters of the word "In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful." (Bism-i-llahi'R-Rahmani'R-Rahím) Thus the first 6 Súrih are the praise of the Point, and the last 6 Súrih describe the letter Mím.

Therefore, all the letters of the sublime paradise refer unto these 19 Manifestations, and all the letters of the non-sublime paradise revert unto the 19 manifestations of the gates of fire, and all the 19 gates of fire return unto the first gate of fire, even as all the Gates of paradise return unto the Primal Gate.

Thus all the gates of fire and paradise are gathered together in the word "There is none other God but God." All letters of the non-sublime paradise are combined in the utterance of negation (there is none other God), while all the letters of the sublime paradise are present in the utterance of affirmation (but God). The entire Qur'anic letters of non-sublime paradise perish beneath the shadow of the first gate of fire, whereas the entire Qur'anic letters of the sublime paradise are immortalised beneath the shadow of the Word of Affirmation. Thus God bringeth to naught whomsoever He willeth, and immortaliseth whomsoever He pleaseth, for He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the Omnipotent.

It is not permissible to interpret the Bayan except by this interpretation that is manifested by its Tree. Therefore, all the good names revealed in the Bayan befit the lights that radiate in the hearts of its believers, while all the letters of the non-sublime paradise revealed therein, stream forth in the essences of its non-believers.

The Bayan hath always resembled, and will forever continue to resemble, the human soul, endued with life, and all its letters of light and fire are illustrated within the universe and in the souls. Therefore, today, anyone who desireth to distinguish the letters of light from those of fire can do so, inasmuch as this is the Day of the Revelation of God. However, after the ascension of the Exalted Tree, none can make such distinction in real truth, except in accordance with the appearance. Whoso transgresseth not the precepts of the Bayan, he is to be taken as amongst the letters of the sublime paradise, and whoso transgresseth them, he is to be numbered as those of the non-sublime paradise, until the Day when God shall save this creation, by manifesting His own Self in the day of Resurrection. At that time, that which is judged by the Point of the Bayan in His Resurrection, is the real truth of His prior creation: He who recognizeth Him, he is assuredly numbered amongst the letters of the sublime paradise, and he who faileth to recognise Him, is registered in very truth amongst those of the non-sublime paradise. Thus God separateth between the two in truth, for verily He is the best Discriminator.

And it will come to a point where there would remain no mention of the letters of the non-sublime paradise except in the Book, and the very tree of negation would reckon himself as one of the letters of the sublime paradise, and unknowingly will curse his own soul, until the Day Star of Truth shineth forth, and then his disbelief will be made manifest.

Even as those who have been present in this Resurrection, have witnessed this truth with the eyes of certitude, for today all declare that they believe in God and the words of the Qur'an, whereas the Exalted Tree of Truth Who is the Revealer of the Qur'an resideth in this mountain, alone with only one soul in His presence. How manifestly, in the Revelation of the Sun of Truth, the hidden truth is disclosed, and the veils lifted! Those who would not even conceive of non-resignation to the good pleasure of God, decree against the Mine of radiant acquiescence, that which the pen is ashamed to mention! Whereas the good pleasure of God can only be manifested through His good pleasure. Be warned O ye the men of insight, and fear the Cause of God.

Gate Five of the Second Unity

On this, that any good name that verily God hath revealed in the Bayan, refereth, in its primary truth, unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, while any evil name that is verily revealed therein by God, intendeth, in its primary truth, he who will be in His Day, the letter of negation.

The substance of this gate is this, that any good name that is revealed in the Bayan, refereth, in its primary meaning, unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, then in its secondary meaning, unto the First to believe in Him, until it reacheth the last level of existence. For example, where the word earth is to be mentioned in the Bayan, it meaneth the earth of His Soul, and then it descendeth in stages, till it reacheth the earth of the physical dust that is associated with Him, His habitation, which is, in the Book of God, the loftiest chamber of the Paradise.

In like manner, any non-good name that is revealed therein, intendeth, in its primary meaning, the tree who is negated for opposing Him. And should there be a reference to earth in relation to an inmate of the non-sublime paradise, it would refer to his soul, and it would descend in stages till it reach the earth of the dust that is his habitation, which is the nethermost abyss of hell in the earth of fire, even though the throne of power may lie upon it.

Even as any mention of the good that is revealed by God in the Qur'an, intendeth, in its primary meaning, the Apostle of God, and any mention of the non-good, refereth to the first negation, which hath opposed the First Affirmation. And if the earth of the inmate of the sublime paradise is mentioned, it meaneth the earth of His soul, until it endeth in the earth of the dust that hath been the habitation of His body. However, they all return unto the Qa'im, a descendent of Muhammad, peace be upon Him. For any good name that is mentioned in the Qur'an, it intendeth, in its primary meaning, the Qa'im, even as it is interpreted in the Bayan, as Him Whom God shall make manifest.

Likewise, any mention of the non-good that hath been revealed in the Qur'an, though it be the mention of the earth, hath intended the first to turn away from the Qa'im. The same principle that is true in the Qur'an, is also confirmed before God in the Bayan. For whatever good name is embraced by the Knowledge of God, refereth, in its primary truth, unto the Primal Will, even as that of the non-good intendeth he who faileth to recognise Him. Thus, today, any earth that is mentioned in the world of existence, refereth unto the Point of the Bayan, descending from the earth of His Heart to the earth of His Spirit, and from the earth of His Spirit to the earth of His Soul, and from the earth of His Soul to the earth of His Body, and from the earth of His Body to all things, gradually and in stages, till it endeth in this very earth above this mountain, which is three by five shibr units. At this time, this same place is the jewel and essence of all types of dust-earth. Should His habitation change, such earth would change as well, until He is established in a permanent Seat.

The same principle applieth to that which is the hellish shadow of the inmates of the sublime paradise, letter by letter and point by point. Therefore, this is the loftiest earth of paradise, and that is the nethermost abyss of fire. I seek refuge in God from that which is not loved by God, and I Beseech God, for all that He loveth. He verily is the Generous, the All-Bountiful.

But the Qur'anic good names shone forth, in stages, from the Apostle of God, upon each of His Viceregents, while the same happened amongst the inmates of non-sublime paradise. Thus, the loftiest earth of paradise reached the seat of the martyrdom of the Prince of Martyrs, peace be upon Him, whereas the nethermost abyss of fire became the throne of the kingdom of the one who opposed Him. This is the irrevocable judgement before God.

The same is true in each of the Revelations of the Supreme Testimonies of God. Today, all the good names, in its primary meaning, lieth in the Point Himself, including even the earth that was mentioned as an example. Then in its secondary meaning, it lieth in the Letter of Sín, until it reacheth to the last level of existence. Fear then God, O ye all the People!

Gate Six of the Second Unity

On this, that the Bayan shall constitute the unerring balance from God until the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. He who followeth it, he is registered as light, and he who deviateth from it, he is recorded as fire.

The Substance of this gate is this, that the Bayan shall constitute God's unerring balance till the Day of Resurrection which is the Day of Him Whom God will make manifest. Whoso acteth in conformity with that which is revealed therein will abide in Paradise, under the shadow of His affirmation and reckoned among the most sublime Letters in the presence of God; while whoso deviateth, were it even so much as the tip of a grain of barley, will be consigned to the fire and will be assembled neath the shadow of negation. This truth hath likewise been laid bare in the Qur'an where in numerous instances God hath set down that whoever should pass judgement contrary to the bounds fixed by Him, would be deemed an infidel, with all the manifold torments that pertaineth to such category.

This is the decree against those who transgress the commandment of God. Then how much more grievous it must be the judgement against those who wrong the very Manifestation of God, when He hath revealed, "I have not created the jinn, and the men, except that they may adore Me." There should be no doubt that no act of obedience is accepted except by obeying the Supreme Testimony of God. Otherwise the deeds of those who have shown enmity against the Family of God, would have been mentioned before God, whereas today all concede that their acts of worship have come to naught, and their deeds have been in vain. Even as today the non-Shí'ih act in conformity with the laws of the Qur'an, but their very deviation from the Viceregency of the Imams, rendereth their deeds naught before God.

In these days how few are those who abide by the standard laid down in the Qur'an. Nay, nowhere are they to be found, except such as God hath willed. Should there be, however, such a person, his righteous deeds would prove of no avail unto him, if he hath failed to follow the standard revealed in the Bayan; even as the pious deeds of the Christian monks profited them not, inasmuch as at the time of the manifestation of the Apostle of God--may the blessings of God rest upon Him--they contented themselves with the standard set forth in the Gospel.

Had the divine standard laid down in the Qur'an been truly observed, adverse judgements would not have been pronounced against Him Who is the Tree of divine Truth. As it hath been revealed:

"Almost might the heavens be rent and the earth be cleft asunder and the mountains fall down in

fragments." And yet how much harder than these mountains their hearts must be to have remained unmoved!

Indeed no paradise is more glorious in the sight of God than attainment unto His good-pleasure. Praise be to God that this glorious bounty is today singled out for the people of the Bayan, and henceforth he who will not deviate from its precepts, he will remain in such bounty until the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. And he who, God forbid, will transgress, he shall wrong none but himself, inasmuch as the All-Possessing God is independent from all beings. And after the commencement of His Revelation, all the Bayan is naught but utter obedience unto Him, and clinging to no balance besides Him. Even as in the Day of the Revelation of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, all the Christian religion was the very obedience unto Him, and not staying with the Christian balance, inasmuch as in that Day staying with the previous balance shall be judged as falsehood. Whoso chooseth to be guided, he benefiteth, and whoso chooseth to be veiled, he perisheth, for the All-Possessing God is independent of all beings.

Gate Seven of the Second Unity

On the Exposition of the Day of Resurrection

The substance of this chapter is this, that what is intended by the Day of Resurrection is the Day of the appearance of the Tree of divine Reality, but it is not seen that any one of the followers of Shí'ih Islam hath understood the meaning of the Day of Resurrection; rather have they fancifully imagined a thing which with God hath no reality. In the estimation of God and according to the usage of such as are initiated into divine mysteries, what is meant by the Day of Resurrection is this, that from the time of the appearance of Him Who is the Tree of divine Reality, at whatever period and under whatever name, until the moment of His disappearance, is the Day of Resurrection.

For example, from the inception of the mission of Jesus --may peace be upon Him--till the day of His ascension was the Resurrection of Moses. For during that period the Revelation of God shone forth through the appearance of that divine Reality, Who rewarded by His Word everyone who believed in Moses, and punished by His Word everyone who did not believe; inasmuch as God's Testimony for that Day was that which He had solemnly affirmed in the Gospel. And from the inception of the Revelation of the Apostle of God--may the blessings of God be upon Him-- till the day of His ascension was the Resurrection of Jesus-- peace be upon Him--wherein the Tree of divine Reality appeared in the person of Muhammad, rewarding by His Word everyone who was a believer in Jesus, and punishing by His Word everyone who was not a believer in Him. And from the moment when the Tree of the Bayan appeared until it disappeareth is the Resurrection of the Apostle of God, as is divinely foretold in the Qur'an; the beginning of which was when two hours and eleven minutes had passed on the eve of the fifth of Jamadiyu'l-Avval, 1260 A.H.,\[22 May 1844\] which is the year 1270 of the Declaration of the Mission of Muhammad. This was the beginning of the Day of Resurrection of the Qur'an, and until the disappearance of the Tree of divine Reality is the Resurrection of the Qur'an. The stage of perfection of everything is reached when its resurrection occurreth. The perfection of the religion of Islam was consummated at the beginning of this Revelation; and from the rise of this Revelation until its setting, the fruits of the Tree of Islam, whatever they are, will become apparent. The Resurrection of the Bayan will occur at the time of the appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest. For today the Bayan is in the stage of seed; at the beginning of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest its ultimate perfection will become apparent. He is made manifest in order to gather the fruits of the trees He hath planted; even as the Revelation of the Qa'im \[He Who ariseth\], a descendant of Muhammad--may the blessings of God rest upon Him-- is exactly like unto the Revelation of the Apostle of God Himself \[Muhammad\]. He appeareth not, save for the purpose of gathering the fruits of Islam from the Qur'anic verses which He \[Muhammad\] hath sown in the hearts of men. The fruits of Islam cannot be gathered except through allegiance unto Him \[the Qa'im\] and by believing in Him. At the present time, however, only adverse effects have resulted; for although He hath appeared in the midmost heart of Islam, and all people profess it by reason of their relationship to Him \[the Qa'im\], yet unjustly have they consigned Him to the Mountain of Makú, and this notwithstanding that in the Qur'an the advent of the Day of Resurrection hath been promised unto all by God. For on that Day all men will be brought before God and will attain His Presence; which meaneth appearance before Him Who is the Tree of divine Reality and attainment unto His presence; inasmuch as it is not possible to appear before the Most Holy Essence of God, nor is it conceivable to seek reunion with Him. That which is feasible in the matter of appearance before Him and of meeting Him is attainment unto the Primal Tree.

God hath ordained dust to be His House, that in the day of Resurrection, those who are brought forth before the Exalted Tree of Truth, may not find it difficult to acknowledge that they are brought forth before God, or that attaining His presence is attaining the presence of God.

An infinitesimal part of a moment (A ninth of a ninth of a tenth of a tenth of a moment) within the Day of resurrection is better than all the years that pass between the two Resurrections. For the fruit of those years is manifested in the Day of Resurrection. Thus the fruit of 1270 years of Islam is to be manifested from the inception of this Revelation till the end thereof, which is the beginning of the setting of the DayStar of Truth. Likewise, the fruit of this Dispensation, from the inception of this Revelation until the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, returneth unto the Next Resurrection, which is His manifestation.

O people of the Bayan! Take pity on yourselves, and bring not to naught in the Day of Resurrection, the entire duration of your Night, even as did the veiled ones of the Qur'an, who gloried for 1270 years in allegiance to Islam, and yet in the Day of Harvest, which is the Day of Resurrection, they were judged as non-Muslim, rendering them naught until the Next Resurrection.

How many a soul who, all his life, hath imposed upon himself austerities and earnest strivings to attain unto God's good pleasure, and were he to see the Qa'im, a descendant of Muhammad, in his dream, he would glory in the dream. Yet now that the Qa'im hath appeared with the Revelation of God, which is more manifest than any manifestation, with the testimony of verses and resplendent evidences that have been the very proof of Islam, he not only refuseth to attain the presence of God, not only faileth to manifest the fruit of his faith, and not only refraineth to rise for that which is the purpose of his creation, but worse, he pronounceth judgement against the same One that through Whom he turneth unto God, day and night, and uttereth "Thee we worship." And were he to be content with that, his transgression would have ended there, but he would not even do so, instead he would desire to inflict grief upon the favoured ones of God!

O people of the Bayan! Refuse ye to do that which is done by the people of the Qur'an, and bring not to naught the fruits of your Night. Should all ye who believe in the Bayan, proclaim, in the time of the Revelation of His verses, 'God is our Lord, and we join no partner with Him. For verily this is what God hath promised us through the Manifestation of His Self. Therefore, we shall not call unto anything besides Him,' and should ye all obey Him, with all your being, then ye would manifest the fruits of the Bayan, otherwise ye are not even worthy of mention before God.

Take pity on yourselves. Even If ye rise not to assist that Manifestation of Lordship, at least refuse to inflict grief upon Him. For He will be manifested as I have been manifested, and shall resurrect the creation of the Bayan, at a time that ye cannot even conceive to lose your faith. Hasten ye, in that Hour, to acknowledge God and recognise His verses, for they are naught but acknowledging Him Whom God shall make manifest, and recognising His words.

Let nothing whatsoever shut you out as by a veil from your Beloved, for any judgement that is pronounced by His words, shall remain binding till the Day of Resurrection, and it is by virtue of that judgement that the inmates of paradise will partake of the delights in heaven, while the inmates of hell will be tormented in fire.

And now that is the Day of Resurrection, the Seat of the decisive separating Decree lieth in this mountain. Notwithstanding that all perform their deeds for the sake of what they think is His good pleasure, yet they now desire hardships for Him that they never desire for themselves! Therefore, should ye covenant with your God that ye desire naught for any soul, but that which ye desire for yourselves, then in the Next Resurrection, even if ye fail to attain God's presence, at least ye would not sadden the Supreme Sign of God either. If ye renounce harming Him, He would forgo whatever benefit that is due to Him from all those who believe in the Bayan! Although I know that ye will not do so, even as in this Resurrection, I forsook the benefit due to Me from the believers in the Qur'an, but ye failed to renounce harming yourselves. And before God there is no fire more grievous for you than this, that ye turn to God, day and night, through Me, and yet ye sentence Me to that which ye will never desire for yourselves! Soon God will judge between Me and you in justice, for He verily is the best of judges.

Gate Eight of the Second Unity

On the Exposition of the truth of death, that it verily is true.

The substance of this gate is this, that before God there are infinite meanings, in endless grades of being, for death, that none besides Him can reckon. Only one of these meanings, in the common outward usage, is the death that is known by all, which is the moment of the seizure of human soul. However, whatsoever that is designated by the name death before God, is true. But that which men are enjoined to acknowledge its truth, is not this commonly understood death amongst the people. Rather, it is to die of all things other than the Exalted Tree of Truth, at the Hour of His Revelation.

But this true death can only be realised in five stations: Either by the word 'There is none other God but Him,' or 'There is none other God but Me,' or 'There is none other God but God,' or finally 'There is none other God but God unto Whom all are confident believers.' And the truth of the death is this, that at the time of the manifestation of the Exalted Tree of Divine Unity, where the above five stations of divine unity are merely His five stations, all die by negating the letter of negation, and affirming the Letter of Affirmation.

Should all the oceans in the heavens, on earth, and in that which lieth between them, turn into ink, they would be unable to sufficiently inscribe this most subtle mystery. However, its essence is this, that he whose will is naught but the Will of Him Whom God shall make manifest, his wish naught but His Wish, his destiny naught but His destiny, his decree naught but His Decree, his permission naught but His Permission, his term naught but His Term, and his book naught but His Book, he is truly taken by death. For His Will is the very Will of God, His Wish is the very Wish of God, His Destiny is the very Destiny of God, His Decree is the very Decree of God, His Permission is the very Permission of God, His Term is the very Term of God, and His Book is the very Book of God.

Thus he who has attained annihilation in the Point of the Bayan, he hath truly acknowledged that death is true. Otherwise, that which he hath recited from the Qur'an and the prayers hath not yielded him any fruit. How many the men who were saying that death is true, but their will failed to become His Will, and therefore, they came to naught, and the falsehood of their word was manifested before God.

The same principle is true with regard to the other stages till it reacheth the station of the Book. Thus when His Book, which was the very Book of God, was revealed for those who considered themselves the most learned of their time, they committed that which the Pen is ashamed to even mention. They did so, notwithstanding that, day and night they were saying 'verily death is true,' performed the laws of His previous Book, bore allegiance to Islam, accepted payment for their learning, and by virtue of a claim to a broken relation to the Qa'im, they received that which God hath ordained for Him in the Qur'an

Whereas even the very air they breathe is not lawful unto them, for that is not inhaled out of the faith in God! This is the result of knowledge devoid of action, according to the Book of God. Had they understood death, they would not have deviated from their confession. For they say that the death is true, and yet they are veiled from all various modes of revelation of the Exalted One Who hath created the very truth itself!

This is the death that in the Day of Resurrection benefiteth all, and after the end of such Day, is the Night of Isthmus, till God revealeth the Sun of Truth. Verily that which is intended by Isthmus is the interval between the two Revelations, and not what is commonly understood by the people as something that happeneth after the death of their physical bodies. For verily knowledge of that which succedeth this earthly life is not enjoined upon men by God, inasmuch as none besides God knoweth what He shall hath destined for men after their death, whereas that which they are enjoined to do, they must be able to comprehend.

Should one submerge in the sea of true death, he would witness infinite marvellous wonders in endless levels. For example had one attained death at the time of the Apostle of God, he would have seen that all attributes that pertain unto one who disbelieveth in Muhammad, from the world of detachment till the realm of limitation, are utter negation and pure fire, whereas all attributes that pertain unto He Who Believeth In Muhammad, from the world of detachment till the realm of limitation, are the attributes of the Tree of Affirmation, and the Paradise of Prophethood. Thus the first has not attained death, whereas the Second hath. The first hath perished in negation inasmuch as he hath failed to attain death, and the Second hath been immortalised in affirmation by virtue of His annihilation. Today the fruit of the death of those believers is manifest, for the mention of those early believers is beloved before God and before His faithful creatures. Nay, rather, all today's believers are multiplied by them. Likewise, the result of the non-death of the non-faithful is that there is no mention of them anymore, and if there are people who have been multiplied by them, they themselves are not content with this relation, instead they recant it. Should today anyone testify against the truth of the First Tree, the same thing that was testified by them against Him in the Day of His Revelation, they themselves would reject such a person and implore God's tormenting wrath for him.

But in fact in the year 1270, just as the Exalted Tree of Truth hath advanced and ascended, in like manner the letters of negation have become more abased and fiercer in their opposition. But since their outward appearance hath changed, none can distinguish them except the Supreme Testimony Who is now manifest by the bidding of God. For He discerneth all things in their real habitations, and were He to desire to discriminate between the atom of fire and the atom of paradise, He would assuredly be potent to do so. Should anyone conceive in his heart that which is not worthy of the Point of the Bayan, he would be judged, at once and at that very moment, as amongst those who have not attained death. To this delicate degree is the subtlety of this Cause, nay, rather, it is even more subtle than this, and none is warned save those endued with sight.

But the idea of death can be applied to diverse levels of being, from the supreme essence of divine unity to the lowest station of limitation. Therefore, should one find in place of the letter Alif, the letter Ba, and then he erase it and correct the mistake, such deletion would indeed be a function of the angle of death, which thus appear at the level of the letter Ba,. For the letter Ba, in order to turn to that which it must, ceaselessly beseecheth God, to seize it, and then quicken it. When God willeth to grant its call, He inspireth one of His loved ones to seize the spirit of the letter Ba from it, and to confer upon it the spirit of the letter Alif, so that the word may be read correctly. For verily before such change, the meaning of the word is distorted, inasmuch as in the phrase "God is the Most Great (a'zam)," the word God must be succeeded by the letter Alif, and if instead, the letter Ba is written, the intended meaning would not be manifested.

The same rule applieth to all phenomena, universal or particular, as it is understood by anyone who is endued with discernment. Thus, shouldst thou find on top of this paper, any visible trace of non-whiteness, and thou efface it, then such dying therein would indeed be the life of this tablet, a death pertaining to its own station, like fading away from man's soul that which is harmful to his faith.

Should there be a scroll before one who disbelieveth in God, it would be incumbent upon anyone who claimeth to have attained true death, to die from it, and never gaze upon it, inasmuch as that scroll is verily one of the tokens of fire and is placed therein. Likewise, should he behold a tablet before one who believeth in God, it would be incumbent upon him to preserve it as he preserveth his own soul, inasmuch as that tablet is one of the tokens of light.

Verily the truth of the Cause is the most hidden above all the hidden, at the same time that it is the most manifest above all the manifest. He who recogniseth death, he ceaselessly attaineth death before God, by willing naught but that which is willed by God, and that death is naught but his annihilation before the Point of the Bayan, inasmuch as the Will of God is not manifested save through His Will.

This is the truth of death for those who desire to annihilate in God. God hath not fashioned in the world of creation, anything more glorious than the death before Him. For all will yearn to will naught but the Will of Him Whom God shall make manifest, yet in the Day of His Revelation, they shall fail to stand faithful to their own love and word. Even as all those who were faithful to the Qur'an, reared themselves according to this principle that should Muhammad, blessings of God rest upon Him, return to this world, they would never question His word, saying why or wherefore. But He indeed hath now returned with an incontrovertible Revelation that is more exalted than His First Revelation, inasmuch as verily this Revelation is the very Resurrection of His previous Revelation. Yet the very same people who bear witness "Verily Muhammad is the Messenger of God," all have been shut out as by a veil, and they have failed to acknowledge Him. Nay, rather, they even refuse to acknowledge for Him the very allegiance to Islam that they claim for themselves, for had they acknowledged it for Him, they would not have inflicted upon Him the sufferings they have assailed Him, for verily this is not what a Muslim would desire for a Muslim.

This is the disgraceful estate of these people before God. Though the same testimony that once proved His previous Revelation, vindicateth His truth in this Day, yet all are veiled from Him. None can reckon the number of the myriad who bear allegiance unto His religion, but all have failed to recognise Him in His return, save those willed by God, until happened the shameful things that happened.

As for those who have not recognised Him, there is no fire more grievous than this, that they are veiled from the very One Who ordained Islam to be their religion, and the Qur'an to be their Book. For the glory of Muhammad in His Resurrection is in this, that He verily hath attained the presence of His Lord, hath transmitted His messages, and hath wholly devoted unto Him with all that is in His power. This is the glory that is the source of all pride for all beside Him.

Should anyone say, "we could not recognise Him in the inception of His Revelation," it would be replied: "it is assuredly known to all that He was the First to respond affirmatively in the world of dharr, when God said 'Am I not Thy Lord?', and He replied, 'Yea, glorified art Thou, none other God is there but Thee, for Thou verily art the Lord of all worlds.'"

Were they to say, "we could not recognise the Revelation of God," it would be again unacceptable, for the Qur'an, which was undoubtedly the Book of God, and they all acknowledge today that it is the Book of God, is available to all. Therefore, the mere hearing or seeing that divine verses are manifested from a Soul, should leave no doubt for the possessors of heart, that such Soul is the Manifest Self of God, and that the previous verses were from Him, even as the later verses are also from Him. Therefore, today He Who first hath responded is the First amongst the creatures, even as they said aforetimes, that Muhammad, blessings of God rest upon Him, was the One Who first responded, and He was the First amongst the creatures, as this is attested today by all.

Should they contend, "that response hath occurred in the First world of Dharr," it would be evident that this is indeed the First world of Dharr, inasmuch as the lofty realm above the Throne of heaven, is exactly the very earth which is the sacred habitation of the Manifestation of God. For the nearness or remoteness of God hath always been, and will continue forever to be, of equal degree in relation to all beings. Nothing is nearer than any other thing in relation to God, be it the Throne above the heavens, as it is imagined by the superstitious, or the sacred habitation of the Exalted Tree Who speaketh forth from God.

Therefore, such false supposition is naught but pure idle fancy and vain imagination. Otherwise, according to the view of the dwellers of the concourse of truth, the First world of Dharr refereth to the very Dayspring of Revelation. Even as all recite, when visiting the shrine of the Prince of Martyrs, this written tradition: "Whoso hath visited Husayn, in utter recognition of His truth, is like a man who hath visited God upon His Throne." It is manifest unto those who are endued with understanding heart, that the same Seat hath been the Throne of God, which is naught but the Throne of Muhammad, the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him.

Methinks, none can be seen who hath ascended beyond the world of limitation. For all that is heard of all the worlds, are fashioned in this world. Thus the mere fact that in this world, the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon Him, becometh the First to believe in Muhammad, blessings of God rest upon Him, is the conclusive proof that He hath been faithful in all worlds. For all worlds are realised beneath the shadow of this world, and therefore, before those endued with understanding heart, they are all manifest therein. Well is it with him who beholdeth all things in their truth, who refuseth to imagine a vain idea that is utterly false before God and before men of truth.

The revelation of the Divine Reality hath everlastingly been identical with its concealment and its concealment identical with its revelation. That which is intended by \`Revelation of God' is the Tree of divine Truth that betokeneth none but Him, and it is this divine Tree that hath raised and will raise up Messengers, and hath revealed and will ever reveal Scriptures. From eternity unto eternity this Tree of divine Truth hath served and will ever serve as the throne of the revelation and concealment of God among His creatures, and in every age is made manifest through whomsoever He pleaseth. At the time of the revelation of the Qur'an He asserted His transcendent power through the advent of Muhammad, and on the occasion of the revelation of the Bayan He demonstrated His sovereign might through the appearance of the Point of the Bayan, and when He Whom God shall make manifest will shine forth, it will be through Him that He will vindicate the truth of His Faith, as He pleaseth, with whatsoever He pleaseth and for whatsoever He pleaseth. He is with all things, yet nothing is with Him. He is not within a thing nor above it nor beside it. Any reference to His being established upon the throne implieth that the Exponent of His Revelation is established upon the seat of transcendent authority. This is the true Throne wherein God mounteth, and not this supposed physical throne, be it the seat or the couch upon the earth, or the empyrean sphere, or the firmament sphere (the Couch) in the heavens.

He hath everlastingly existed and will everlastingly continue to exist. He hath been and will ever remain inscrutable unto all men, inasmuch as all else besides Him have been and shall ever be created through the potency of His command. He is exalted above every mention or praise and is sanctified beyond every word of commendation or every comparison. No created thing comprehendeth Him, while He in truth comprehendeth all things. Even when it is said \`no created thing comprehendeth Him', this refers to the Mirror of His Revelation, that is Him Whom God shall make manifest. Indeed too high and exalted is He for anyone to allude unto Him. And He Whom God shall make manifest is the First amongst His creatures, while here the word "His" refereth unto His Heart, and both He and His Heart are created by Him. God hath always been the Lord, without the existence of any servant, the One God without anyone to adore Him, the Omnipotent without the existence of any subject, the Omniscient with nothing to be known, and the Lord of Unity without anything to be numbered.

Even when it is said, "God hath always been the Lord of Unity without anything to be numbered," it refereth to a time after the revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, when Souls numbering the word unity (vahid=19) have recognised Him, Souls Whose hearts point to naught but His Unity, and without the existence of any one besides Them to be numbered amongst the faithful. The same is true with regard to all the names and Attributes.

But gaze not upon the realm of limitations. For God hath always been the Lord of Unity. Even if thou failest to acknowledge this truth with regard to this Revelation, thou readily attestest thereun in relation to the previous Revelation, and witnessest all the Names and Attributes in the very Apostle of God. Shouldest thou say 'He is verily the king,' thou wouldst recognise that there is a king within His community, who considereth himself one of His servants. Yet the kingdom of His Soul is far exalted to be associated with the name of this king. Shouldest thou say, 'He verily is the powerful,' thou wouldst behold many men endued with power, who are beneath the shadow of obedience unto Him, all glorying in bearing allegiance unto Him. Yet the power of His Essence is immeasurably sanctified to be associated with this power. Shouldst thou say, 'He verily is all-knowing,' thou wouldst witness many men endued with knowledge, who glory in bearing allegiance unto Him. Yet the knowledge of His Essence is far glorified to be associated with the knowledge of these learned. And shouldest thou say, 'He verily is the ruler,' thou wouldst readily see miriyad of those endued with authority, who are honoured by such rule beneath the shadow of His sovereign command. Yet the sovereignty of His Inmost Reality is immeasurably magnified above any association with these rulers who merely rule on His behalf.

In like manner, gaze upon all the Names and Attributes with thy own very eyes. Therefore, when God's servant knoweth anything, there is none Who knoweth except Him, and when he is potent over anything, there is none Who is potent save Him. For in each Dispensation, all who are guided by that Revelation, are naught but the modes of that Manifestation of God. Therefore, wert thou to look at all Revelations from the First, which was that of Adam, till the infinity, thou wouldst not see anything endued with thingness except through God. But thou art unable to recognise the Manifestation of Divinity except through the Exalted Tree of His Revelation, which is naught but the Primal Will, inasmuch as none else is possible in the contingent world.

This is the meaning of the word of the Prince of the Martyrs, peace be upon Him: "O my God! I have recognised through the diversity of tokens, and the alteration of states, that Thy purpose for me is to recognise Thy revelation in all things, that I may not ignore Thee in anything."

For this is the fruit of the existence of any man, that he may see all things dependent in existence upon the Primal Will, and that he may witness in everything naught but the revelation of God, in accordance with the degree of the thingness of the thing which beareth the divine revelation. Otherwise, the relation of the Revelation Itself to all beings is one and the same. For one kind of Revelation is the revelation of the verses of God. But the same Source that revealeth verses which affirm the prophethood of the Prophet, revealeth verses which attest to what befiteth the one who is other than the Prophet. However, the relation of such Revelation to the two is but the same, except that the former abideth in the uttermost sublimity of affirmation, whereas the latter dwelleth in the nethermost abyss of negation. Shouldest thou comprehend this truth in the revelation of words, thou wouldst be able to behold the same truth in the realm of the revelation of the inmost realities of all beings.

But this is not intended to imply that thou canst witness the Essence of God within things, inasmuch as that is utterly impossible. He, glorified be His mention, is immeasurably exalted to be in anything, with anything, before anything, after anything, above anything, or beneath anything. Whatsoever bringeth thingness to things, is created by His Will, while the Will subsisteth by Himself. All the Names hath always been, and will forever continue to be, beneath the shadow of Will, while the will abideth beneath the shadow of God.

The station of the Will is the station of the Point of the Bayan. And naught is manifest in anything except one of the modes of His Revelation. But it is not the intention of the Speaker of this word to affirm that the Essence of the Will, which is the Essence of the Apostle of God, can be observed in everything. Rather, it can be witnessed in everything that its thingness is realised through Him. For example, should one spend a thousand mithqal gold for going to pilgrimage to the House of God, naught would be seen in his act save the ordinance enjoined by the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, from God.

Likewise, wert thou to ask about the realisation of the inmost reality of the gold, thou shouldst know that it necessarily returneth unto a precept which in turn returneth unto the Exalted Tree of Truth, in one of His many Revelations. For there is nothing defined by the word thingness, except that its thingness is generated by the Will, while the Will subsisteth by Himself, through the grace of God, exalted and magnified be Him.

The Will is the "Circular letter Kaf," which hath always rotated, and will continue forever to rotate, around His own Self. It is He Who hath never referred, nor will ever refer, to aught but God, glorified and exalted be Him, unto Whom belongeth the Most Excellent Names in the kingdoms of the heavens, the earth and that which lieth between them. None other God is there but Him, the Omnipotent, the Best-Beloved. But for each divine Name there is one who beareth that Name. For instance when it is said 'God, glorified and exalted be Him,' there should be two manifestations of these two names (glorified, exalted) to be mentioned before the Primal Will, existing from the everlasting till the everlasting, that they may refer unto naught but Him.

Well is it with him who beholdeth naught except he witnesseth the revelation of His Lord therein, who tranquiliseth in naught but God, who gazeth upon naught save his Lord, and who never believeth about God that which he believeth about His creatures. For verily God, glorified be Him, have never been in anything, from anything, upon anything, or towards anything. He is never praised through anything, while all things besides Him are His mere creation. None other than Him will ever know Him in His inner being, and none will ever celebrate befittingly the unity of His Essence, except Himself. All that the Will hath verily known is naught but His knowledge of Himself, and all that all things have verily comprehended is naught but their knowledge of the splendours of the revelation of the Will in themselves.

As God, glorified and exalted be Him, is exalted in His Essence, He verily can never be recognised, known, glorified, or sanctified. There is no path unto Him for any one except through confessing his utter powerlessness to recognise Him, and abiding beneath the shadow of His oneness and absolute independence. All things have always belonged to Him by virtue of His Inmost Reality, His Essence, His Substance, His Transcendence, His Firstness, His Lastness, His Seenness, His Hiddenness, His absolute Purity (kafúríyyat), and His indivisible Unity (sadhijíyyat), while verily in the utmost sublimity of His sovereign Self-Subsistence, and the utter glory of His majestic Sanctity, He remaineth glorified above any praise and description, and sanctified above any attribute and exaltation.

He is, and hath from everlasting been, one and alone, without peer or equal, everlasting, incomparable, ever-living, self-subsistent, ever-abiding, eternal, and ever-faithful. He hath assigned no companion or child unto Himself, while all besides Him are His mere creatures, created by Him through His Command. He verily hath always been, and will continue forever to be, independent from His Self, by virtue of His Self! Then how can He be not independent from all besides Him? And He hath been from time immemorial till everlasting, independent from His Essence by virtue of His Essence, then how can He be not independent from aught but Him? Glorified and exalted be Him, as it behoveth the sublimity of His sanctity, and the glory of His praise. He verily is the Most Exalted, the Most Sublime.

Gate Nineteen of the Second Unity

On this, that all that is in the Bayan is a present from God unto Him Whom God shall make manifest. Exalted art Thou, O my Lord the Omnipotent! How puny and contemptible my word and all that pertaineth unto me appear unless they be related to Thy great glory. Grant that through the assistance of Thy grace whatsoever pertaineth unto me may be acceptable in Thy sight. Thou verily art the best of the gracious ones.

The substance of this gate is this, that in each Dispensation, the writings of the Manifestation of Truth is a present from God for Himself in His Next Revelation, which is the manifestation of His being in the Next Resurrection. Likewise, all that God hath sent unto the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, is today visible in those who believe in the Qur'an, while the mirrors of their hearts, were a mere present from God unto the Qa'im, a descendant of the Family of Muhammad, peace be upon Them. For example that which God hath revealed unto Jesus, was a gift from God unto Muhammad the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, inasmuch as the purpose of His Book was naught but the very souls who recognised Muhammad, as well as all that returneth unto them, though it be an infinitesimal part (a ninth of a ninth of a tenth of a tenth) of an atom of dust."

In like manner, all that cometh into existence in the Bayan, of diverse beloved modes, is a present from the Point of the Bayan unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, Who is but the very Next Revelation of the Point of the Bayan. And this supreme glory and pride would suffice all, if He accept a person or a thing, by granting them the honour of association with Himself. But today, the present pertaining to the Dispensation of Gospel is not accepted by even the least significant of the very lowest of the Qur'anic manifestations, how much less it would be accepted by the Manifestation of Truth. In like manner, the least significant of the very lowest of the Bayan refuseth to accept the most sublime of the past, unless he entereth beneath the shadow of the Testimony that the believer of the Bayan hath entered.

Likewise, He Whom God shall make manifest will not accept anything pertaining unto the Bayan, except the things that become related unto His Book. The same principle applieth to endless Revelations of God. In each Dispensation, all the modes that return unto the First Revelation, are but a gift from God unto Him for the day of His Revelation in the Next Resurrected Life.

How utterly remote is the man who breaketh his relation unto Him, and ceaseth to be a true gift. Thus today, should the believers in the Qur'an desire to present the gift of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, they all should recognise the Bayan, otherwise, they would severe from themselves the attribute of glory and sublimity. Such severance is not because of any external admonishment by the Exalted Tree, saying, wherefore ye are veiled from attaining the presence of your Beloved. Rather at that very moment, it is He Who remaineth the supreme Object of desire of your hearts, inasmuch as ye even refuse to engage in your worldly pursuits unless ye consider the good pleasure of God therein. Yet today, when the Exalted Tree, Who is the Mine of divine good pleasure, hath been manifested, ye are veiled from the Fruit of your existence, unto Whom your souls return. What ye do harmeth only your own selves. For the All-Possessing God is independent from you and from all that pertaineth unto you. As for ye, should ye relate your souls unto God, ye would thereby become immortalised, and partake in glory; otherwise ye would perish naught but your souls. Behold then ye, and attain certitude.

Gate One of the Third Unity

On this, that anything that existeth is His possession, and He, more than anything besides Him, holdeth the rightful authority over it.

The substance of this gate is this, that the Lord of the universe hath created all things for the sake of the Exalted One Who refereth unto Him. He is the Mirror of Truth, Who hath always been, and will continue forever to be, the One Who revealeth God. All things have been fashioned in the past, and all things will be fashioned in the future, solely through Him, while He subsisteth by His own Self, by virtue of the grace of God. All things are dependent in their existence upon Him, and nothing attaineth thingness, except through Him. Therefore, His truth and legitimate right surpasseth those of all things, and all besides Him are His possessions by virtue of the fact that all beings are absolutely held in the hands of the Most Holy Essence. Thus, He holdeth in His hands more right to all aspects of all things than the things do to themselves.

The fruit of this knowledge is this, that were the Point of Truth to bestow all things upon a thing, His decree would be absolutely binding, be it actually fulfilled or remaineth just a mere command. For example, Had the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, conquered, all that is on earth, He would have held more rightful authority over them than that of their owners. Such is the meaning of the absolute possession of all things by God, when the people attest, "His is the Kingdoms of the world and that of the Revelation."

Likewise, should He Whom God shall make manifest take possession of the inmost realities of all things, He would hold more rightful authority over them than the things themselves do in relation to their inmost realities, even though He is far exalted and glorified to even glance at anything, inasmuch as all things look up to His bounty and grace. He is independent of all things by virtue of His Self, while He remaineth dependent upon God by virtue of His Essence.

The fruit of this gate is this, that in the Day of His Revelation, if He pronounce a law, all would be mindful of His supreme truth and right, that none may say unto Him why or wherefore. Should He enjoin a decree concerning anything, it would befit no one to speak of any right of ownership before Him, inasmuch as He holdeth in his hands more rightful authority over that thing than the thing doeth to itself. At first He will not command except according to the decrees of the Bayan, till the time cometh when He chooseth to renew His sovereign covenant with all, which layeth low the necks of all things. Should He command that a man, who is according to the law of the Bayan entitled to inheritance, may inherit not even a carat, that would assuredly be the law of God in the Bayan for that man. And if he receive any share, he would transgress the Command of his Lord. In like manner, were today the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, to proclaim that a law which hath been revealed in the Qur'an in a certain way, must be now fulfilled in another way, there could be no doubt that this command is the law of the Qur'an, even if it is revealed in this Day. For that which hath been revealed before, hath also been from Him, and in the estimation of those who recognise God, the past and present laws are one and the same. This is what is worthy of His supreme right and authority.

As for the right that the people deserve, the Pen is ashamed to even mention it. Behold! All perform the Friday Prayer solely by virtue of His Command, yet should He command one of them not to pray in the position of leadership, or that another soul is more entitled to lead the prayer, he would refuse to obey Him. While he beareth allegiance of faith unto His earlier command, yet he even refraineth to accept Him as one who believeth in His earlier Cause (Islam), otherwise this would not have happened.

This was the right that is worthy of the creatures. But the authority that behoveth Him is this, that should He announce a new word, to replace the declarative word of the divine unity, previously deposited by Him in the hearts, He would hold more authority over His previous declarative word than that very word doeth over itself. Even as in the Revelation of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, He cancelled the word of the divine unity that was previously imprinted in the hearts, and thus the splendours of His new Qur'anic declarative word was revealed upon all the hearts. Had He not possessed the supreme right over that word, He could not have removed it.

When He manifesteth in this supreme way, His absolute lordship in regard to the most sublime station of the servants, how that which is derived therefrom is even worth mentioning! Should one fix his gaze upon the Sun of Truth, he would recognise his own limit, nay, rather, he would glory in being related to Him, even if it is the very relation of servitude and subjection, like that of all other things. For the loftiest glory of all tings is this, that it is He, and none but Him, Who is the Supreme Lord of all things.

Therefore, if one show no vain pride in the Next Revelation of the Day-Star of Truth, he would be numbered as steadfast and exalted in His previous Revelation. On the other hand, the same truth is evident and clear in those letters of Gospel who glory not in the letters of the Qur'an, and enter not beneath His shadow, though they pride themselves in bearing allegiance unto Gospel! The same principle is true with regard to the Revelation before His previous Revelation, till it reacheth that of the First Adam, which is without any beginning, as well as in the Revelation after His Next revelation till it endeth in the Last Revelation which is without any end. Say! God createth all things, and then He returneth them all. There will never be any mention after God, even as there hath never been any mention before Him. Will ye not then believe?

Gate Two of the Third Unity

On this, that things are created by His Word, should It be uttered by Him, for verily His Word is the Truth.

The substance of this gate is this, that no word of any contingent being resembleth the word of the exalted Tree of Truth, inasmuch as the inmost reality of things is created by virtue of His word. For example, if that Exalted Tree had not spoken of the guardianship of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon Him, that very successorship would not have been created. Even though He hath been from time immemorial, the God's Guardian, but the Source and the Beginning of the Revelation is His word in that Dispensation, and not a word earlier. In like manner, all that is non-truth, from the first fire till the last, are fashioned by His word, otherwise, if He had not proclaimed, "Verily this is not true," they would not have been realised either in the universe, or in the souls. Therefore, both light and fire revolve around His word.

Likewise, in the Revelation of the Bayan, if the first fire had not been mentioned, how could it have been created? And likewise, if the word light had not been uttered, how its guardianship could have been proven? Behold, how many gates of fire appeared in the Dispensation of the Qur'an, after the disappearance of the Exalted Tree of Love. Then why there is no longer any mention of them? Witness how fire is proven for them, and the universal disowning of them is manifest unto all.

For those endued with understanding heart, there hath been no doubt, nor there ever will be one, that should He speak of the Letter of the Sublime Paradise, the universal soul of light would instantly be created, in its own station, through that utterance, to celebrate divine unity with utter sincerity and devotion. And should He, by virtue of His justice, utter the letter of non-sublime paradise, the universal soul would be generated in fire, in its own station, where the pen is ashamed to even mention that which it deserveth.

There is no greater bounty in any Revelation of Truth for the people in that Dispensation, than this, that the Supreme Manifestation of the Will would not gaze upon anything unbefitting of Him (dún-i-istihqaq). For if He would, then He definitely shall pronounce the due judgement on it, which would call that decree into being, and become the fire for the people of that Revelation. Were the people to know how profitable is it that no non-truth is gazed upon by Him, they verily would strive, with their utmost power, that the non-truth may not be mentioned before Him. Otherwise, the non-truth would be judged, turn to fire in that Dispensation, and the people would perish therein.

Likewise, had all the people exerted their utmost endeavour in the inception of this Revelation, that naught may be mentioned before the Exalted Tree but that which is worthy of Him, there would have been made no mention of fire, to become the everlasting abode of those who are veiled. For the fire is created by His utterance. Otherwise, why there is no mention of that letter of non-truth that hath preceded this second letter of non-truth, even though both have wronged people equally? Rather, the moment that this latter performed, in defiance of truth, an unbefitting act before the Truth, his existence hath been called into being by virtue of this relation, and therefore, until the Day of Resurrection all will disown him, and he will perish in the fire of his negation.

On the other hand, there is no bounty greater than this, that in each Revelation of Truth, the people of that Dispensation firmly grasp the words of God, inasmuch as their inmost realities are fashioned by them. For example, should He reveal a verse, without reference to any specific thing or command, like, "God's is the kingdoms of the heavens, the earth, and that which lieth between them. For God is potent over all things," then a manifestation would be created in the Bayan, who will reflect this verse, nay, rather, there would be generated endless manifestations beneath the shadow of that manifestation, even as there are a number of verses like this in the Qur'an. Yet, there hath been countless manifestations of authority from the time of Revelation till today. Thus infinite shadows are created beneath the reflection of each verse.

But if the verse concerneth a specific law, then all would act in conformity with it till the Day of Resurrection, like the law of khums, or other enjoined laws. Therefore, His word is what createth things, and is unlike the words of men. For in His word, naught is seen but God, and none besides God is the Creator of things, Provider of things, Slayer of things, Quickener of things, Fashioner of things, or Generator of things. Behold! His is the kingdoms of the creation and that of the Revelation, aforetimes, and hereafter. For He is the Lord of all worlds.

Should one attain the time of the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, no bounty would be more exalted for him or anyone else, than this, that the attributes pertaining to fire would not be mentioned before Him, otherwise, the indomitable determination of God would call the fire into being. On the other hand, each soul must strive to receive, to the degree of his own inmost reality, his sustenance from the mine of His grace, till His Next revelation, and thus to be honoured in the interval between the two Revelations by His bestowal, though it be a single verse, for the spirits pertaining to that word, will assuredly be manifested in his station. "And Whose word is more true than that of God?" Could ye but recognise it.

Gate Three of the Third Unity

On this, that The Bayan and whosoever is therein revolve round the saying of Him Whom God shall make manifest, even as the Alif (the Gospel) and whosoever was therein revolved round the saying of Muhammad, the Apostle of God. In like manner, that which God hath revealed unto Muhammad in His First Revelation, and whosoever is therein, circle around His saying in His Next Revelation.

The substance of this gate is this, that the Bayan hath no end in view but Him Whom God shall make manifest, inasmuch as none save Him hath ever repealed, or will ever repeal, this Book, even as none but Him hath ever revealed, or will ever reveal, it. The Bayan and such as are believers therein yearn more ardently after Him than the yearning of any lover after his beloved. Even as the Qur'an and the spirits that pertain thereto, yearned after the Revelation of its Revealer, and have never had in view, nor will ever have in view, any end but Him. Today the Furqan sendeth salutations unto those letters who have uplifted it, and caused it to enter in the Bayan, whereas it beseecheth its Revealer to torment those spirits who have not entered the Bayan, and have failed to give the Furqan its due portion.

Likewise, the Bayan sendeth salutations unto those amongst its faithful souls, who are its letters of the sublime paradise, who will recognise Him Whom God shall make manifest, and elevate the Bayan towards His Book. On the other hand, it beseecheth God, glorified and exalted be Him, to torment the letters of the non-sublime paradise, those who at the time of His Revelation, will refuse to bow down, for the sake of God, before Him, and are veiled from attaining God's presence by some excuse.

Should one behold with the eyes of the heart, he would hear today this crying out from the Qur'anic letters: 'Help us! Help us! O our Lord and the Lord of all things! Overtake us, and deliver us from the fire of our relation to what we have been related to. Then relate us to Thyself, and cause us to enter in the Bayan, for verily we seek Thy grace.' Even as this was the very word of the letters of the Alif in the past, and the same shall be cried out by the Bayan in the future.

May bounty and grace rest upon he who will not waste the due right of the Bayan, will not bring its torment and wrath upon himself, and will kneel down before its Supreme Revealer. For in the Day of the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, the Bayan will gaze upon its believers, and ask them: 'Is there any spirit related unto me, who would step forward in this Day, and acknowledge Him Whom God shall make manifest, and thus be faithful to the covenant of his Lord that is established in me?' It would be rejoiced if its faithfuls recognise its Revealer, and would be grieved if its faithfuls grieve its Revealer. Thus, nothing is more afflicted with anguish today than the Furqan. All recite it, yet they fail to receive its blessing, and attain naught but its torment, even as those who were reciting the Book of Alif in the day of the Revelation of the Furqan.

O the people of the Bayan! Refuse to do the like of that which is done by the people of the Furqan, and be not veiled by anything from your Beloved, inasmuch as the supreme exaltation of the Bayan, and that of its spirits, is its ascent unto Him. Cry not in clamorous protest, "Help O Bayan! Help O Bayan!" Ponder upon the Cause of God, and bow down before the same One unto Whom ye kneel down at all times. For the Bayan will never be content with you, unless ye recognise Him Whom God shall make manifest, inasmuch as He is the One Who hath revealed the Bayan and all the other Scriptures. Then it will intercede before Him on behalf of its believers, and its intercession is surely accepted by its Revealer.

Ere the inception of the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, none will call unto God by the Bayan, except that his prayer will be answered. But after that, should he call unto God by the Bayan, infinite times, his prayer would never be answered. As to the Bayan and whosoever is therein, of those who are loved by Thee, and not those who are not, I beseech Thee O God, by Thy bounty and grace, to bestow, in the Day of Thy Revelation, Thy mercy upon the Bayan and upon whomsoever believeth therein. O God! Exalt the Bayan and whomsoever believeth therein, in that Day, by that which will be revealed from Thee. For verily Thou art the best of the mercifuls.

Gate Seven of the Third Unity

On this, that any reference to the meeting of God or attaining the presence of the Lord, that is revealed by God, intendeth naught but the meeting of Him Whom God shall make manifest. For verily God, by virtue of His Essence, can never be seen.

The substance of this gate is this, that the Eternal Essence, by virtue of His Essence, can never be known, described, praised, seen, or His unity celebrated, though all are known, described, praised, seen, celebrated, and seen through Him. And all that is mentioned in the Heavenly Books of attaining His presence, refereth unto the meeting of the One Who is manifested by His Revelation, who hath always been, and will continue forever to be, naught but the Point of Truth, that is, the Primal Will.

Thus all that is mentioned in the Qur'an of attaining the presence of God or that of the Lord, hath always implied, and will always continue to imply, in its primary meaning, meeting the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him. Then it descendeth in stages beneath its primary meaning, till it applieth to the countenance of anything that refereth to naught but God, beneath the shadow of that primary meaning. Therefore, that which is revealed with regard to the Imams of guidance, "Whoso recognise You, hath recognised God." And the like thereof, will be unlocked by the knowledge of this gate.

In like manner is the tradition concerning the faithful, which stateth that his gladness is the gladness of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, while the gladness of the Apostle of God is the gladness of God, and that his grief is the grief of the Apostle, while His grief is the grief of God. But in its primary meaning, this faithful refereth to naught but the Gates of guidance, and then it applieth to every believing soul, to such a degree that should there be a staff in the hand of a faithful, then nuaght would be seen in it except God, inasmuch as it is related to him. On the other hand, should it be in the hand of a non-faithful, naught would be seen in it except fire, inasmuch as it is related to him, and so are the dust on which he abideth, and all things that are related to him.

All are created for the sole purpose of attaining the presence of God, which is, in its primary meaning, naught but to attain the presence of the Will, while it apllieth to others beneath the Will in a shadow-like manner, and not independently by their own inmost realities. For He always resembleth the sun, and all besides Him liken the mirrors in which the image of the sun is manifest. Should any mention of encounter be applied to anyone besides Him, it would be due to the presence of the shadow of the sign (verse) of His unity within him, otherwise it is not permissible to use such lofty name for aught but Him.

Whosoever attaineth the presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest, he hath attained the presence of God, and hath been blessed with encountering his Lord, should he be faithful unto Him. Otherwise, he who saw the Fifth Countenance at the very moment of His martyrdom, hath also attained the presence of God, but of no avail for him, rather, had he not, it would have been infinitely and till infinity better for him than that meeting of Him without faith.

Likewise, compared to attaining the presence of the Primal Will, attaining the presence of the Primal Wish, is like the shadow of the sun in the mirror, and the same rule extendeth till the last level of existence. How can encountering the shadow in the mirror can be compared with encountering the countenance of the sun, though the former is but the latter, and the shadow refereth unto naught but the sun? But this is the low rank of the contingence before the Revelation of Eternity, and the insignificant estate of the originated before the intrinsic worth of the ancient Pre-Existent.

Therefore, he who associateth attaining the presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest with meeting of anyone besides Him, or joineth with Him, in regard to meeting Him or in any of His descriptions, any equal, peer, like, partner, or rival, he hath failed to recognise Him, and is not worthy of even mentioning. And however high the ascent of anyone, none can transcend his contingent station, and therefore will never be able to befittingly recognise Him. When His recognition is utterly impossible, how much less possible is it to recognise the Eternal Essence. Glorified be God above the sayings they say of Him, a mighty glorification! Exalted be God above the praises they praise Him, a lofty exaltation!

Gate Eight of the Third Unity

On this, that all that is in the Greater World is in the Bayan

The substance of this gate is this, that whatever that is embraced by the name thingness, its name, and the spirit pertaining to the name, and not the spirit pertaining to the thing, which is the essence of the thing, is in the Bayan. And all that is in the Bayan is in this verse:

"Had We sent down this Bayan unto those who are in the kingdoms of the heaven, earth, and that which lieth between them, all would have believed at once in God, their All-Merciful Lord.

Verily There is none other God but Him, the Ever-Living, the Omnipotent, the Self-Subsisting.

It is God besides Whom there is none other God but Him, the All-Subduing, the Manifest, the Incomparable, the Inaccessible, the Exalted, the Holy. His are the excellent Names. All who are in the heavens, on earth, and in what lieth between them, celebrate His glory. Glorified and exalted be Him above the descriptions they describe Him.

Say! Verily it is God Who is the King, the Sovereign, the All-Powerful, and the Omniscient. His are the sublime Examples. All who are in the heavens, on earth, and in what lieth between them bow down in adoration before Him. Verily He is the Almighty, the Best-Beloved."

This verse consisteth of 19 Names that refer unto God, while all other Names and Examples are mentioned beneath their shadows. In like manner, there are 19 letters of negation, which are the 19 gates of fire, as opposed to the 19 gates of paradise.

Whoso believeth in the Bayan, reciteth these four verses, representing the stations of creation, provision, death and life, recogniseth the Letters of Unity (19) Whose hearts are derived from these Names, seeketh shelter in God from the gates of fire and is clear of them, and refereth any mention of good things in the Bayan unto those Lofty Names and Examples, while any mention of non-good things he refereth unto the silence of the letters of negation, methinks he hath recited the entire Bayan, and acknowledged all that is revealed therein.

And these four verses return unto this verse:

"God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His are the kingdoms of earth and of heaven, sovereignty and dominion, might and divinity, power and the ruby-colored realm of potency (yaqút), and ascendancy and the earthly creation. . He quickeneth and slayeth, then He slayeth and quickeneth. He is verily, the Ever-Living Who perisheth not, the King Who vanisheth not, the Just Who oppresseth not, and the Sovereign Who weakeneth not. He is the Peerless Lord, He Who holdeth in His grasp all that is in heaven, on earth, and in what lieth between them. Verily He is potent over all things."

And the above verse returneth unto this verse:

"God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His are the kingdoms of creation and that of Revelation. He quickeneth and slayeth, then He slayeth and Quickeneth. He is verily, the Ever-Living Who perisheth not, Who holdeth in His grasp the kingdom of all things. He calleth into being whatsoever He willeth through His decree. He is, verily, potent over all things."

And that verse returneth unto "In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy." And all the letters of this opening phrase (bismillah) returneth unto the Point of the letter Ba', even as in the Beginning all have shone forth from the Point. All the Bayan is the differentiation of the Point, and His manifestation in the mirrors. He resembleth the Sun, and all the letters resemble the mirrors, which reflect Him. No letter reflecteth any First except Him, and no Last but Him; no Seen except Him, and no Hidden but Him. In like manner, whoso hath entered beneath the shadow of faith in the Qur'an, naught is seen in his inmost reality except the shadow of the sign (verse) of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, inasmuch as it is by His grace that he hath embraced His Faith.

The entire Bayan is the manifestation of the Point, and the Point is the station of the Will, that is the Manifestation of God, and they all refer unto Him Whom God shall make manifest. For He is the One unto Whom the entire Bayan and all who are therein, shall return in utter humility and utmost submissiveness. And it is solely Him that is to be seen in the mirrors of the Bayan. For example, should there be in the Bayan a manifestation of justice, it would be He Who is the Just, and should there be a manifestation of mercy, it would be He Who is the Merciful, and if there be a manifestation of sovereignty, it would be He Who is the Sovereign, and if there be a manifestation of knowledge, it would be He Who is the All-Knowing, and were there to be a manifestation of might, it would be He Who is the Mighty, inasmuch as naught is seen in the mirrors, but the sun, though they have ever reflected and will ever reflect His sublime station only in a shadow-like manner.

All the letters of the sublime paradise of the Bayan return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, Who is the First Gate of the paradise, and the Most Great Name Who is manifest by divinity. Likewise, all the letters of the non-sublime paradise return unto the first gate in fire, for they all derive perishing from his name. Were a discerning observer to ponder, he would behold all good in the palm of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and all the shadow of blatant error in that of the one against Him, even as all good is today manifest in the Point of the Bayan, and before Him it was manifest in the Point of the Furqan.

No glory is mightier for the Bayan and its faithful souls, than this, that in the Day of the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, naught would be seen in them except Him. Otherwise, there is no doubt that the previous Revelation is manifest in them, and naught is seen in them but Him, even as today none doubteth the Point of the Furqan, whereas, the Point of the Bayan is exactly the very Revelation of the Point of the Furqan, but to a higher degree of excellence. Nay, rather, it is He Who is manifest in all the Qur'anic mirrors, but it is the utter majesty of His Revelation that hath made Him veiled, and the utmost sublimity of His light that hath made Him concealed, as it is through Him that today all Qur'anic manifestations seek nearness unto God, and it is solely His good pleasure that they all desire, how much less to wish to pronounce judgement against Him!

Therefore, naught shall save those who are in the Bayan except beholding Him Whom God shall make manifest, and not Him Who verily hath been manifested, in the mirror of their own inmost realities, inasmuch as it is solely He Who is manifest. Therefore, at the very time that those in the Bayan abide in the cradle of glory, exaltation, sublimity, power, and sovereignty, all are naught but the modes of His Action who live in the Bayan. It is His Excellent Names that are the guides of Bayan's paradise, and it is the names of the one other than Him who are concealed in fire, nay rather they are the visible manifestations of His fire. Thus they can witness at that very time of glory, that the king in the Bayan is a manifestation of His Name, who ruleth by virtue of His word, and so are the manifestations of glory, wealth, power, exaltation, and all the glorious features.

Even as this same truth is now manifest in regard to the Point of the Bayan. At this very moment that He abideth in mountain, He witnesseth that naught is present in all but His revelation, that all do whatever they do by virtue of His authority, be it the Qur'anic manifestations or others. However, inasmuch as they are veiled from their own Beloved, then, they eternally torment in the fire of their veil, and are deprived of the delightful joy of recognizing Him.

Thus should anything in the world of creation attain contentment, it would be He Who hath been contented, and should anything become discontent, it would be He Who hath become discontent, inasmuch as naught is seen in that thing except the Sun of the Will, through Whom it acquireth thingness, in the past, present, or in the future. Otherwise, were the revelation of the Sun of the Will to be removed, it would be utter nothingness, nay rather, even the being of the word nothingness, an existence to the degree of the utterance of nothingness, which is the very perishing and non-existence, is impossible without Him, otherwise, it would not even be mentioned.

This is the true meaning of the word of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him: "O Thou My God! Show Me the true realities of things, as they are in themselves." This is not to say that the Point of the Bayan is Himself visible in the true reality of different things. Rather, His revelation in the station of dust is dust, in the station of water water, in the station of air air, and in the station of fire fire, without anything reduced from Him or added unto Him. For should infinite mirrors turn towards the sun, be it made of ruby, diamond, crystal, glass, or whatsoever imagined to be a mirror, it would reflect the sun without the slightest addition or reduction in the sun.

For example, if the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, had not proclaimed His mission, by the leave of God, during the 23 years of His life after the Revelation, so numerous a people would not have attained guidance. Yet, the fact that He did, took nothing away from Him, nor added anything unto His Inmost Reality. And if He had not proclaimed His mission, He would have returned, after His pre-destined Term, unto His holy realm, where He would have continued to shine forth, as He hath been shining forth from the time immemorial.

Thus, all come into existence through the supreme bounty of the Point of Truth, without even a single drop subtracted from, or added to, His ocean of bounty. Likewise, should His revealed words, be written infinite times, in the utmost refinement imaginable, and infinite number of the people were guided through them, nothing would be subtracted from, or added to, those supreme words, and they would remain unchanged. Thus God destineth the lights of the sun to resemble the sun, to the degree of its utterance. For verily God is potent over all things.

Gate Twelve of the Third Unity

Verily, the Point resembleth the sun, and all letters resemble the mirrors before it. And verily all that is contained in bismillah is in the Point. He who saiths 'God! God! He is my Lord, I shall not join any partner with my Lord,' he hath praised God through that which is ordained for the station of the Point.

The substance of this gate is this, that the word Point, refereth unto the Inmost Reality of the Primal Will. However, if in place of the 'In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy,'

It is mentioned 'The Glory of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy,' then the Inmost Reality of the Will is denoted by the letter 'Ayn. For should the letter Ba' be differentiated, its first manifestation would be the letter 'Ayn, as it is evident in the difference between 'through all things' and 'upon all things.' This is the hidden meaning of the word of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon Him, "I am the Point beneath the letter Ba'." But this is a correspondence in terms of letters and numbers and not in terms of His inmost reality or essence.

Thus, in the Day of the Revelation of the Point of Truth- Who was manifest in the Dispensation of the Qur'an by the name of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him- the mere comprehension of this fact that He is like the sun, while all who are guided by Him are only the suns manifest in the mirrors, sufficeth the gathering of the fruit of this gate within the realm of knowledge, and not in that of action.

However, the harvesting of the fruit of this gate in action is fulfilled by this, that today which is the Day of the Revelation of that same Point in the new Dispensation of the Bayan, each of His faithfuls gazeth upon that which is the cause of his glory and pride, as merely a shadow in the mirror before the True Sun in the heaven. Therefore, should he, or a believer in the Qur'an, say "God is the Most Great," compared to the same saying by the Point of the Furqan in His Next Revelation, it would be like seeing the shadow of sun in the mirrors, compared to beholding the True Sun in heaven. Alas! This fruit was not realised in this Dispensation, and if it did amongst a few, it was only in the realm of knowledge and not in that of action.

I gave the example of that which is the most sublime cause of the glory of the servant, that all the derivatives may also be derived therefrom, that haply in the Day of the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, the believers in the Bayan act in conformity with the message of this gate, which is the essence of all knowledge and action, and see no thingness in themselves except through Him. Even as the thingness of the inmost reality of their hearts, spirits, souls, and essential bodies hath come into existence by the Revelation of the Point of the Bayan, inasmuch as it is He Who hath deposited these verses in the beings of His creation, that they may turn unto Him by virtue of those signs.

This is the essence of all knowledge and faith, could anyone but behold, gather the fruit of his existence, and attain utter death before each Revelation, even as all are now dead before the command of His previous Revelation. Thus today, these people who believe in the Apostle of God, consider themselves even unworthy to be mentioned before Him, while they regard their allegiance unto Him as their supreme pride and glory, and the evidence of their submission unto God's Will. Yet, they are veiled from this truth that the Revelation of the Point of the Bayan is naught but Muhammad's Next Revelation, to a higher degree of excellence.

Should one be blessed with this knowledge and act accordingly, he would never be veiled from any Revelation, would attain the presence of the Beloved in each Dispensation, and harvest all the fruits thereof. Blessed is the man whom God hath taught this knowledge and assisted him to act accordingly. Had this knowledge been known by the people, they would not have equalled the excellence of the Commander of the faithful, peace be upon Him, with the excellence of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, even though in the sun of His excellence naught is seen but that Sun of Truth. And this statement of the famous author who hath meant by sea the sea of the Will and not that of the Eternal Essence, testifieth unto this same truth: "The Sea is the Sea as it hath existed in eternity, while the phenomena are naught but diverse waves and forms." These are the very shadows manifest in the mirrors which point unto the True Sun, inasmuch as in the station of the world of contingency, that is the realm of the mirrors, naught else is possible.

But the First mirror which revealeth the Sun of Truth, in all worlds, is the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon Him, Who hath appeared in each Revelation by a different name, till the present Dispensation, wherein he is the Mirror of this Revelation. Well is it with them who enter beneath his shadow, for verily they are the companions of Power (qadr), the guides unto the name Almighty, and the companion of the Day of Badr. They have ascended unto a horizon that none in the world can excel them, except such as God hath desired. For verily when God ordaineth a thing, then He at once calleth into being that which He willeth, more exalted than what He had willed aforetimes. He verily is potent over all things.

The fruit of this knowledge is this, that if at the time of the appearance of Him Whom God will make manifest all the dwellers of the earth were to bear witness unto a thing whereunto He beareth witness differently, His testimony would be like unto the sun, while theirs would be even as a false image produced in a mirror which is not facing the sun. For had it been otherwise their testimony would have proved a faithful reflection of His testimony.

I swear by the most sacred Essence of God that but one line of the Words uttered by Him is more sublime than the words uttered by all that dwell on earth. Nay, I beg forgiveness for making this comparison. How could the reflections of the sun in the mirror compare with the wondrous rays of the sun in the visible heaven? The station of one is that of nothingness, while the station of the other, by the righteousness of God--hallowed and magnified be His Name--is that of the Reality Who calleth the thing into being, by the grace of God.

Should one receive the reward of His testimony unto the unity of God, "There is none other God but God," such glorious reward would be far greater than the reward of all testimonies ever offered by all things unto the unity of God. Nay, I implore God's pardon for making such comparison. Rather, it is a mere example thereof. Nay, that which He testifieth unto anything, is the testimony of God concerning that thing, and that which He uttereth, is God's utterance regarding that thing.

If in the Day of His manifestation a king were to make mention of his own sovereignty, this would be like unto a mirror challenging the sun, saying: \`The light is in me'. It would be likewise, if a man of learning in His Day were to claim to be an exponent of knowledge, or if he who is possessed of riches were to display his affluence, or if a man wielding power were to assert his own authority, or if one invested with grandeur were to show forth his glory. Nay, such men would become the object of the derision of their peers, and how would they be judged by Him Who is the Sun of Truth! As it is evident that there hath been countless kings on earth like him, whether in the Revelation of the Bayan or in the Revelations before it, where all, in whatever Dispensation, return unto the Point of the Will. The same is true with regard to those who are endued with knowledge, power, or glory.

Therefore behold, recognise, and act in such wise in relation to all names and attributes, nay, rather in relation to anything that is worth to be called a thing. And claim no existence before Him, inasmuch as that is out of sheer non-existence and utter ignorance. Witness the contemptible station of those who conditioned their acceptance of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, upon the acceptance of Him by the monks of the Book of Alif. Likewise gaze upon the Bayan, and behold how the people heedlessly desire to make their recognition of the Point of the Bayan, contingent upon the recognition of the very divines whose only source of guidance is a recognition of His previous Revelation in the Qur'an, behind the veil of 1270 years, and that only through infinite grades of mediation! And this is true for the case of recognition. Then how the pen can even move to mention the case of non-recognition? For they desire to make the faith of the inmates of fire, the condition of the faith in the Creator of both the paradise and the fire, to acknowledge the word of God through their acknowledgement, and to make their testimony the precondition of their own testimony unto the truth of the One Who bringeth into existence the very truth, Whose testimony is the very testimony of God unto all things, the belief unto Whom rendereth all a believer, and the non-belief unto Whom negateth faith from all.

Should anyone pronounce Him to be a non-believer, when indeed the name believer is just one of His names, what could be said about his utter abasement? Even they are unworthy to be called an animal, for the animals are often clean, but such a man, according to their own decree, is not. By Him Whose power causeth the seed to germinate and Who breatheth the spirit of life into all things, Who is uniquely exalted by virtue of His glory, sanctified by His grandeur, and singularly glorified by His majesty and sublimity! No fire is more grievous than their being veiled from the very Beloved that day and night they turn unto Him, while no paradise is more delightful than beholding the Sun of Truth, regarding all besides Him as the shadows in mirrors, and acting accordingly.

Should one who hath pronounced judgement against God, realise that which he hath committed, he would be able to reckon the grave degree of the agony of being veiled within his very own being. And this will surely happen, even if that would be during the most darksome Night, and his recognition of that very fact. God guideth unto the certain path of truth, whomsoever He willeth, and He loveth not to mention the one who hath failed to recognise Him and His verses. And God loveth the righteous.

Gate Thirteen of the Third Unity

On this, that it is not permissible to ask questions from Him Whom God shall make manifest, except in writing. Should one who believeth in the Bayan be able to write and do so, it would be a great bounty for him, which is not the case for those who do not. God is witness unto all things.

The substance of this gate is this, that it is not permissible to ask questions from Him Whom God will make manifest, except that which well beseemeth Him. For His station is that of the Essence of divine Revelation, to such a degree that even the very Revelation in Revelation is manifested beneath His shadow. Whatever evidence of bounty is witnessed in the world, is but an image of His bounty; and every thing owes its existence to His Being.

Should anyone desire to behold His knowledge, let him gaze upon the learned in the Bayan, inasmuch as it is their knowledge of His Book in His Previous Revelation that bestoweth upon them the learned status; and should anyone wish to witness His power, let him observe those endued with power in the Bayan, inasmuch as it is the revelation of the power of His previous Revelation which hath made them powerful. Likewise, those endued with glory are created by the manifestation of His glory, the men of majesty are generated by the manifestation of His majesty, and those endued with might are produced by the manifestation of His might.

The Bayan is, from beginning to end, the repository of all of His attributes, and the treasury of both His fire and His light. And the spirits of the Bayan upon the earth, are the guides in His previous revelation, who refer unto naught but His words, inasmuch as they are all created for the sake of His Next Revelation. For example, His name the Generous which is revealed in the Bayan, is created for the Name the Generous in His Revelation, even as the name the Bountiful in the Qur'an was created for the Name Bountiful in the Bayan. The same principle is true with regard to all other names and examples, those of the truth for that of the truth, and those of the non-truth for that of the non-truth.

Were anyone to truly recognise Him, he would utterly die before His Will. And for all men, there hath never been, nor there ever will be, any testimony vindicating His truth more mighty than His very own Being. For all verses and all words shine forth out of the sea of His grace, are illumined through the billowing ocean of His bounty, and radiate out of the deep waters of His glory.

Should anyone desire to ask questions, he is allowed to do so only in writing, that he may derive ample understanding from His written reply and that it may serve as a sign from his Beloved. Even as those in the Bayan who are adorned with this noble trait are beloved before Him, both in their inner condition and their outer expression. However, let no one ask aught that may prove unworthy of His lofty station. For instance, were a person to inquire the price of straw from a merchant of rubies, how ignorant would he be and how unacceptable. Similarly unacceptable would be the questions of the highest-ranking people of the world in His presence, except such words as He Himself would utter about Himself in the Day of His manifestation.

Methinks I visualize those who would, prompted by their own deluded conceptions, write to Him and ask Him questions about that which hath been revealed in the Bayan, and He would answer them with words not of His Own, but divinely inspired, saying:

'Verily, verily, I am God; no God is there but Me. I have called into being all the created things, I have raised up divine Messengers in the past and have sent down Books unto Them. Take heed not to worship anyone but God, He Who is My Lord and your Lord. This indeed is the undoubted truth. However, alike shall it be to Me; if ye believe in Me, ye will provide good for your own souls, and if ye believe not in Me, nor in that which God hath revealed unto Me, ye will suffer yourselves to be shut out as by a veil. For verily I have been independent of you heretofore, and shall remain independent hereafter. Therefore it behooveth you, O creatures of God, to help your own selves and to believe in the Verses revealed by Me.

Verily he who faileth to recognise Me and believe in that which God hath revealed unto Me, he resembleth, in the estimation of God, he who hath failed to recognise the Lord of the seven letters and the Bayan, even though he previously had believed in Muhammad, the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, and in the Furqan. Just as today ye abhor to relate yourselves to such man, in like manner, should ye but know, ye would enter in the religion of God, and would not be content to remain within the Bayan, now that God hath revealed His verses unto Me. He verily is potent over all things.

I am verily the Point of the Bayan Who was manifested before. God hath verily manifested Me now, even as He manifested Me aforetimes, to recompense those who believed in Me and the Bayan in the past. Hasten then ye in the Cause of God, and fear Him. Behold in Me naught but God, My Lord and your Lord, the Lord of the heavens, the earth, and all things, the Lord of all that is visible and all that is invisible, the Lord of all worlds. Verily that which ye possess is like the shadow of the sun in the mirror, hinting at the true Sun in heaven. All that ye argue in your books resembleth the shadow in the mirror before that which We have previously revealed in the Bayan and that which We are revealing now. Fear ye then O servants of God!'

Thus limit your questions from your Beloved to that which regardeth the sublimity of the celebration of divine unity, the height of the sanctification, the excellence of the glorification, and the loftiness of the magnification, in thought, words, action, outer expression, and inner condition. For your Beloved loveth the hearts which refer unto naught but God and His Love, and He loveth the spirits, souls, and the bodies that point unto naught but His Letters of the Living, Who are exactly the very Letters of the Living of the Bayan, Who are in turn the same as the Letters of the Living of the Furqan. Likewise these holy Books have been identical with the Book of Alif (Gospel), the Book of Ta'(Pentateuch), And the Book of Za' (the Book of David), ending in the Book of Adam.

For from the Manifestation of Adam till the inception of the Revelation of the Point of the Bayan, no more than 12210 years have passed from the age of this world. But there should be no doubt that, before this Adam, there have been infinite worlds and Adams in God's creation, to the degree that none besides God hath ever reckoned, or will ever reckon, them. In all these worlds the Manifestation of the Will hath been none other than the Point of the Bab, the Lord of the seven letters. Likewise their Letters of the Living have been naught but the Letters of the Living in the Bayan, their names none except the names of the Bayan, and their images none other than the images in the Bayan. And it is the Point of the Bayan Who is known in each Dispensation as both the Prophet and the Book that is attributed unto God. Yet, all are veiled from recognising Him, and all are heedless of His Book except the faithful in the Bayan.

In like manner behold the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, inasmuch as He is the very Primal Will in all worlds, and His Book is the Book of the Primal Will in all worlds. He Himself refereth unto naught but God, and His Book speaketh of naught but God, and His Names have never been, nor will ever be, aught but manifestations of the Name of God, glorified and exalted be Him, and His images abide not except beneath the shadow of God, glorified and exalted be Him. His are the kingdoms of the creation and of the Revelation, aforetimes and hereafter, None other God is there but Him, and We are verily devoted unto Him.

The Point of the Bayan is exactly Adam, the very First in wondrous creation, in such wise that the very ring which is in His hand, is the same ring that God hath preserved it from that day till today, and the very verse which is imprinted upon it, is the same verse which had been inscribed thereupon. Yet what was just said is due to the weakness of the people, otherwise, the station of that Adam equaleth the station of the seed of this Adam. For example, a youth who is 12 years of age, would never say that I am that seed which descended from such and such heaven and was planted in such and such earth. And were he to say so, he would degrade himself, and those endued with knowledge would judge him to be wanting in reason.

Thus, the Point of the Bayan is not saying today that 'I am the Manifestations of the Will from Adam till Today,' for this would be like the word of that youth. Therefore, the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, refused to mention that 'I am Jesus,' for the Revelation of Muhammad representh the evolution of Jesus from His past station, advancing unto that of Muhammad. Likewise at a time that the Beloved will be praised as 14 years of age, it is unbefitting of Him whom God shall make manifest to say that 'I am the One Who was 12 years old,' and if He say so, it would be due to the weakness of the people.

For things are ceaselessly advancing, and not regressing. But at the stage of the seed, that 14 years old Youth had been Adam, and He hath gradually progressed till today He is 12 years of age, and he will progress beyond this age, in stages, till He reacheth the age 14. However, if today any of the believers in the Qur'an will be pleased to state that 'I am one of the believers in the Gospel,' then the Point of Truth would also be pleased to say the like. The same principle is true with regard to the Bayan, and the Bayan is also the same in relation to Him Whom God shall make manifest.

The Revelation of God hath been manifested and will continue to be manifested in infinite times and in endless forms, each appearing as God willeth. But the subsequent Revelation is the maturation of the antecedent Revelation. Therefore, at the time of the maturity, the mature station is far more excellent to attribute the station beneath itself unto itself, inasmuch as the mature station encompasseth the lower station, as well as its own station. For example, the letter Ghayn (1000) containeth the 900 of the letter Za' (900), but the latter is devoid of the 1000 of the former.

Behold the Cosmic Numbers with the same gaze. Therefore, in the inception of each Revelation, enter, by the grace of God, glorified and exalted be Him, in that Revelation, for then thou possessest the previous Revelation. Otherwise, thou wouldst be shut off as by a veil from the wondrous new bestowal of God and perish in the previous religion. Likewise, the Will which hath appeared from Adam till the Point of the Bayan, possesseth all the previous Thrones attributed to Him, but He now possesseth the Throne that is related to the Point of the Bayan as well. However, those Thrones possess not that which He doth in this Revelation. But the Throne of His self, and the Thrones of His Guides, and those of anyone who hath been sincere in faith, nay, rather, anything that hath abided in the sublime paradise of the previous Cycle, have assuredly entered the paradise of the next Revelation. Hence they all enter today, by the grace of God, glorified be His glory and exalted be His sovereignty, in the Bayan. Thus the insincere are veiled, the decree of paradise is denied unto them, and the judgement of fire is realised for them.

For the paradise in each age is naught but the perfection of that age. And today, perfection is in the Bayan, and in nothing else, while in the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest perfection lieth in His Book, and such progress continueth indefinitely. Each subsequent Revelation containeth within itself its antecedent Revelation, as well as that which itself possesseth. Thus in each Revelation of the Will, the utmost striving of the Manifestation is naught but to turn all unto His Revelation, to deliver them from fire, and bring them into paradise. This end hath been realised in each Dispensation in accordance with the available means, and it remaineth to be seen what the courage of the braves and the decorative ornament of the artists in the Bayan will accomplish: if by virtue of their utmost exertion, they would bring all into the paradise, or that the Cause of God would stream forth to the degree of the means available unto them.

I swear to the sanctified Essence of God, glorified and exalted be Him, that in the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, should those endued with power and knowledge unite in recognising Him, He would not be content that any of the people of the Bayan would be left faithless on earth, how much less the others. Strive then ye and render the Absolute Truth victorious, that there remaineth none who hath not entered the paradise. This is the most mighty bounty and the most great attainment in each Revelation, that all on earth recognise God's Religion beneath the shadow of that Revelation, which is the moment of the good pleasure of the Will Himself. Otherwise, He continueth to beseech the grace of God till such victory hath been realised. And it assuredly will happen. For God hath always been, and will continue forever to be, potent over all things. In each Revelation He ordaineth the means in accordance with the benefit of all creatures, but at the end He shall turn all that is on earth into a part of the Most Mighty Paradise. He verily is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.

Gate Sixteen of the Third Unity

It is not permissible to engage in religious act except in conformity with the writings of the Point.

It is not permissible to engage in religious acts save those ordained in the writings of the Point of the Bayan. For in this Dispensation, the writings of the Letters of the Living all proceed directly from the Sun of Truth Himself. Divine verses \[ayat\] especially pertain to the Point of the Bayan, prayers \[munajat\] pertain to the Messenger of God \[Muhammad\], commentaries \[tafasír\] to the Imams of guidance, and educational discourse \[suvar-i-'ilmíyyih\] to the Gates. However, all of these proceed from this Ocean so that all people can behold the exalted sublimity of these Writings of the Primal Truth. And in the eyes of God and of the Possessors of knowledge, there is nothing more glorious than the precedence in faith, which is the most precious of all things, and all bounties are under its shadow. And from the time of the setting of the Sun \[of the Bab\] until the Rising of the Sun of Him Whom God shall make manifest, there will be no more binding Writings, and the Letters of the Living and all the believers in God and in the Bayan will be under their shadow \[the Writings of the Point of the Bayan\].

However, should anyone ascend in understanding a law amongst the laws of God, whether a root pillar or a derivative one, and write a book, he would be gathered beneath His shadow, on the condition that he transgresseth not the laws of the Bayan. Otherwise, before God and before those who are endued with knowledge, he would not be even worth mentioning. Rather, in this Dispensation, all must primarily strive to fix their eyes upon the essential questions, to be short in words and arguments, and to enjoy that which is revealed from the Point of the Sun of Truth.

For His words resembleth the radiant lights of the Sun, compared to the dim lights of stars. Can anyone associate them together? Glorified be God above such association, a mighty glorification, and exalted be God above such comparison, a great exaltation!

But endeavour to learn the knowledge pertaining to the letters, the parallels between the numbers of the Names of God, association between similar words, and the associations amongst the similar writings, in their proper place. For it is permitted unto anyone of you to arrange the order of the Bayan, in the sweetest possible manner he can, even though it would appear in a thousand forms. However, they all return unto the Bayan, inasmuch as not even a single letter should be added thereto or omitted therefrom, though the pattern of preservation and division of related parts will differ from one copy to another. Methinks, it will be seen that in the future no order will be applied thereto except that it will be a sweeter and superior to the first order.

Well is it with him who fixeth his gaze upon the Order of Baha'u'llah, and rendereth thanks unto his Lord. For He will assuredly be made manifest. God hath indeed irrevocably ordained it in the Bayan, till the time that God abrogateth that which He willeth, and revealeth that which He desireth, for verily He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

But the best form of arranging the Bayan is one which is ordered on the basis of visible tokens. For example should there be ten prayers which consist of ten lines, they could follow each other. Likewise it is preferable that the five rivers would not be mixed together: Verses to remain within their own sublimity, prayers in their loftiness, commentaries in their habitation of glory, the words \[of knowledge\] in their holy horizon, and the Persian words in the height of their exaltation. As this hath been, and continueth to be, evident unto the subtle observers of the exigencies of harmony and association. This is one of the bounties of God unto the learned in the Bayan, that they may be occupied with this, until God shall remove their difficulties by revealing the very One through Whom, day and night, they turn unto God, their Lord.

Should He be manifested and yet He make Himself known to none, the Bayan that is arranged by Him would be like the Sun amongst the stars. This happeneth when He beholdeth all to be wrapped in their veils, even as the Point of the Bayan wrote three commentaries on the Qur'an: two commentaries in the mode of the verses, till the end, and a commentary on the Súrih of Cow in the mode of the educational discourse, in such wise that the entire commentaries made of the Qur'an from the inception of its revelation till its abrogation, equaleth not even one letter of His commentaries. Whoso associateth the radiant light of the sun with the dim light of stars, he is devoid of any eye to be worth mentioning before God. Will ye then not behold?

Gate Seventeen of the Third Unity

It is not permissible to write any of the Writings of the Point, save with the most excellent writing. Should there be in possession of anyone a single non-excellent letter thereof, his deeds would come to naught, and he would not be numbered amongst the faithful.

The substance of this gate is this, that all the writings of the Point bear the name Bayan, but in its primary truth this name is singled out for the divine verses. However, in its secondary truth it refereth to the prayers, in its tertiary truth to the commentaries, in its fourth-degree truth to educational forms, and in the fifth-degree truth to the Persian words. However, this exalted name, on the basis of the intrinsic worth, is solely confined to the divine verses.

Thus it is permissible that some would bear the name 'Abdu'l-Bayan (the servant of the Bayan), inasmuch as the name God (Allah) is derived from the matter of the Bayan, and the first who called himself by the name Bayan was God, glorified and exalted be Him, as He hath revealed, "I verily am God, there is none other God but Me, the One, the Bayan. Indeed the entire mystery of the Bayan is manifest in its name, for the numerical value of the word Al-Bayan, together with its integrative from of unity, equaleth the numerical value of the word for God (lillah), rendering the word Bayan a mirror for the Point of the Bayan, Who is in turn the supreme Mirror of "for God", as well as a mirror for Him Whom God shall make manifest, inasmuch as He is the supreme Mirror of "for God."

All that is in the Bayan, which equaleth the number of "for God', is solely for the sake of "for God". When the integrative from of unity is concerned, the Bayan is naught but Him, and when each one of the 19 Letters of the Unity are mentioned five times, the number of the word Gate (Bab), They become the entire number of this exalted word, inasmuch as it is They Who have always been, and will continue forever to be, "for God". However, They all return unto the First Gate, Who is manifest in the Point of the Bayan. For that which is visible in the mirrors shall never equal the True Sun in heaven. Verily there is none other God but God, the Lord of the heavens and earth, the Lord of all things, the Lord of all that is seen and all that is unseen, the Lord of all worlds. Verily your God is assuredly the One True God, none other God is there but Him, the All-Merciful, the Exalted, the Inaccessible.

It is not permissible that anyone inscribeth even a single letter of the Bayan except with the most excellent writing. However, for each individual, the most excellent is defined according to his capacity, and never that of those above or below him. The purpose of this law is this, that the spirit pertaining to that letter of the Bayan may be exalted to the uttermost height of excellence possible in the world, within its own station, that amongst the faithful of the Bayan nothing would be seen except that it hath attained perfection in its own station.

Thus, just as today the letters of the Gospel are distinguished amongst other communities in the art of ornament, the dwellers in the Bayan should become likewise, in such wise that should there b a faithful of the Bayan in the far East of the earth, he would be beloved in his station, on account of his beauty and the beauty of all that he possesseth. And this is the most mighty path for attracting the people of other religions to the true Cause of the all-merciful God. However, these are all binding to the extent that one hath the means to do so, not to inflict pain on himself in perfecting things. For God loveth not to behold a believer in the state of grief, rather, all are assuredly obligated to the extent of their capacity.

Methinks, it can be seen from this very mountain, that the people of the Bayan possess the Bayans adorned in utmost refinement, enjoy reciting therefrom, and have become prepared by those Bayans, to attain the presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest with their adorned Bayans, which is naught but attaining the presence of God. But avoid any claim to existence before Him, inasmuch as that hath been, and will continue to be, furthest from the norm of modesty and shame. Fear ye then God, O the people of the Bayan, altogether.

Gate Three of the Fourth Unity

On this, that alteration (bada') is God's, and it is true

The substance of this gate is this, that no form of the worship of God can rival the worship that is based upon the faith in divine alteration, inasmuch as the belief in alteration is the acknowledgement of the unconstrained power of God to whatsoever He willeth. Should one who adoreth Him in the most exalted way imaginable in the realm of creation, happen to acknowledge the truth of the alteration, this very act of worship, his acknowledgement, would be reckoned far mightier than his exalted worship. For were He to desire to make him enter the fire, He would be assuredly potent to do so, and no one would be able to say why or wherefore regarding His action, inasmuch as He is just in His Decree. Conversely, should one who rebeleth against Him, in the most grievous way imaginable in the realm of creation, fail to fix his gaze upon His alteration, this very transgression is far more grievous in His sight than all that is committed by him. And were God to desire to make him enter the paradise, who would have the right to say why or wherefore concerning His action, inasmuch as He is all-praised in His Decree?

However, God's alteration is immeseaurably exalted above any association with the alteration of His creatures. For the creature's alteration is due to their powerlessness, whereas God's alteration is out of supreme power. Therefore, in each Revelation of the Will, His alteration is manifest. For notwithstanding the fact that in the past Dispensation He hath decreed faith and paradise for the its believers, in the New Revelation He subjecteth all to the decree of alteration, and judgeth them to be non-believers, to reveal His absolute might. Otherwise, His court of glory transcendeth the difference between the Qur'an and the Bayan, the laws of the Furqan and the laws of the Bayan. Rather, this alteration is solely due to the supreme height of His power, and the uttermost sublimity of His sovereignty, that all may know that they have always been, and will continue forever to be, in the grasp of the might and power of their Lord, that naught they possess except by His leave (Permission).

But this divine alteration is naught but the alteration of the Will, inasmuch as the Essence of the Eternity hath always been, and will continue forever to be, unchanged. Manifestation and concealment are the attributes of the Will, and firstness and lastness are the schemes of His Wish. Should He be praised as First, His firstness would be His very lastness, and His manifestation, the very concealment.

Be veiled not, O beholder of the Bayan, by the use of these words, that the name first is used at one time in relation to the Unseen Essence, at another in relation to the Primal Utterance, sometimes in relation to the First Creature, and at yet another in relation to the first fire. For the firstness that is mentioned at the station of the Will is the First Creature that is mentioned at the level of the Eternal Essence. Likewise, compared to the firstness of the Will, the firstness that is mentioned with regard to the creatures resembleth the shadow of the sun in the mirror. In like manner, reference to the first in fire, refereth to the firstness in the creation of perishing, and not that of enduring subsistence. Therefore, beware not to be veiled by the manifestations of the names, inasmuch as nothing, with all that is attributed thereto, will ever surpass beyond its own limit.

After thou hast understood the alteration of the Eternal essence as the alteration of the Will, and His Confirmation as the Confirmation of the Will, thou must gaze upon the evident alterations in each Revelation, which hath ever been, and will continue forever to be, billowing like an infinite fathomless ocean. Thus, all who are present in this Revelation have witnessed such manifestations in the ocean of the Will, even as it was manifest in the Furqan by the name abrogation.

As to that which is mentioned in certain traditions that once a thing reacheth the stage of the Decree there will be no alteration for it, it meaneth that if faith attain the fourth stage, which is the pillar of magnification (takbír), there would be no alteration in that which is decreed, solely as a token of grace from God. But as it regardeth the divine justice, alteration hath always been, and will continue forever to be, true of all things, and will never part from anything at anytime, except by the will of God. For God is verily potent over all things.

And by the stage of Decree, in the pillar of magnification, is intended the ascension of the Will, Who from the shining forth out of the pillar of glorification, till His setting in the pillar of dust, is completed within His own self. For example, during the life of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, the very act of ordaining and manifesting of alteration, remaineth the very truth, till the time of His ascension, yet, thereafter, that which is made lawful by Him remaineth lawful till the Day of Resurrection, namely His Next Revelation in His Resurrection, while that which is forbidden by Him remaineth forbidden till His Next Revelation in His Resurrection. Thus, after Him, His Witnesses have remained submerged in the ocean of His Decrees, and had there been exceptions, it would have been in cases where They would have been certain of the good pleasure of God. Thus had anything been mentioned by Them, it would have been exactly the very alteration of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him. But in fact no such thing hath ever happened, rather, They have never transgressed the laws of the Book of God even to the degree of a mustard seed.

However, after His setting, His concealed gifts of guidance are present with the faithful, but no one is illumined by them inasmuch as no one recogniseth Him. But in His days of concealment, He enjoineth naught but that which He hath commanded during the Days of His manifestation.

This was the meaning of God's alteration, glorified and exalted be Him, that the servant should never abide upon the seat of hope (raja'), even if he hath ascended to the utmost height possible in the world of contingency, inasmuch as fixing his gaze upon the divine alteration exceleth all his ascent. Likewise, should he descendth to the abyss of abasement, he should not be established upon the seat of fear (khauf), rather, he must gaze upon the God's alteration, inasmuch as failure to do so is more grievous than the abyss in which he hath descended.

However, the revelation of this alteration is solely from the repository of the Will, and naught besides Him, as it hath become manifest in the Bayan. Should the Bayan mention for anything the decree of paradise, it would remain its due destiny till the Day of Resurrection, and should it pronounce non-paradise for anything, it would remain perished in the fire of His justice till the Day of Resurrection. Then at the time of Resurrection, should the very tree of fire attain faith, he would turn into the tree of paradise, and should the tree of paradise be veiled, he would turn into the tree of fire, as those who have been present in this Cycle hath witnessed this truth.

In each Revelation strive your utmost exertion to be blessed with a good mention of God in His Book until the next Revelation, inasmuch as attaining this, is far more excellent than spending thousands and thousands on the lofty seats (maqa'id-i-murtafi'ih) to perpetuate one's name for the future. Who knoweth, these seats may perish, and there would not remain any name for him, if it is done for the non-truth, otherwise his reward hath always been, and will continue to be, with God. For God verily will reward the doer of good.

Gate Six of the Fourth Unity

On this, that He verily shall not be asked of His doing, while all besides Him shall be questioned of all things.

The substance of this gate is this, that there hath never been, nor there will ever be, any revelation or concealment for the Eternal Essence, while none besides Him hath ever had, nor will ever have, any revelation or concealment either. None is permitted in His sublime Court, so that He may be even praised as "He shall not be questioned", and He is sanctified above any action, to be associated with His Essence, so that He may be praised by "He doeth," or "He ordaineth"!

Nay, rather, He created the Primal Will, even as He created all things through the Will, while fashioning the Will by Itself. Likewise, He hath related all things unto the Will, and the Will unto Himself, on account of the sublimity and glory of the Will, even as He hath called Ka'bih His own House, whereas all places are equal before Him. Therefore, the distinction of Mecca is due to the sublimity and glory of the attribution unto Him. In the like manner, He hath made the Will the manifestation of "He shall not be questioned", for in His knowledge there is nothing more exalted than the Will to be worthy of such bestowal. The same is true of "He shall not be forced", "He shall not be referred unto", and the like.

Thus He hath destined the Will to be the Manifestation of "He doeth what He willeth, and ordaineth what He wisheth," inasmuch as His Essence (the Essence of the Will) is the same as His Will, and He hath never willed, nor will ever will, aught but that which is willed by God. And that which is willed by God will never be manifested except through that which is willed by the Will, even as that which is wished by God will never shine forth except through that which is wished by the Will. And none besides the Will can be worthy of such bestowal inasmuch as all are created through Him (the Will). Should God single out two beings as His Will, then the Manifestation of Unity would never be revealed in the world of creation, and the order of the kingdoms of the heavens, of the earth, and of that which lieth between them, would come to naught.

Rather, from the beginning that hath no beginning till the end that hath no end, there hath always been, and will continue forever to be, one single Will, Who shineth forth in each Dispensation by a specific Revelation, becoming the Manifestation of "He shall not be asked of His doing, and He doeth what he willeth." As to the Letters of the Living, naught will be seen in Them except His Will, even as in the letters multiplied out of the Letters of the Unity, naught should be seen except His Will. Should the heart of a believer conceive of that which is other than the object of His Will, he would not be reckoned, for that very moment, as an inmate of the paradise of that Revelation, and he would be numbered as one who hath rebelled against Him.

For the utmost glory of the mirrors is this, that naught would be seen in them except the Sun, and if that which is seen is the mirror itself, then it would never be worthy to be mentioned before the Sun of Truth. But if the Sun is witnessed therein, then the movement of the Sun would be its movement, inasmuch as it hath possessed, and will continue to possess, no essence but His essence, no praise, except His praise, no action, save His action, and no turning but His turning.

In the Revelation of the Furqan, Muhammad, the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, was the Primal Will, and the Letters of the Living of that Sun of Truth were the very Will of Him, submerged in His Will, inasmuch as They have always been, and will continue forever to be, revolving around His Command, and they willed that which was willed by Him. In like manner, until today, of all the letters multiplied from the Qur'anic Unity (19), those who have attained any nearness, have attained it on account of submerging their will in that of Muhammad, blessings of God rest upon Him, otherwise, they are not worthy of mention.

Thus all the grievous acts of hate which was committed within the Islamic Dispensation, were done by the actors who imagined that they are following His will, otherwise, they would have not even possessed the power and strength of a fly. The same had been true during the Dispensation preceding Muhammad, blessings of God rest upon Him, and the same is true in the Revelation of the Bayan when the Sun of Truth shineth forth in the name of gatehood, until the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest. For all that will happen will be done through His will, and should anything be performed against His good pleasure, it would be done out of the thought that it conformeth with His will, otherwise in this Revelation, nothing would have any power without it.

This is the meaning of "there is no strength nor power except in God, the Exalted, the Mighty." Had that not been true , no Absolute Truth would have been grieved in any Revelation, inasmuch as at the end of each dispensation, the people of that Revelation seek utmost resemblance with the will of the Manifestation, that they may will naught but that which is willed by Him. Then it is not possible that they recognise their Beloved, and yet to desire aught but His love and the object thereof.

Shouldst thou desire to wintness this with the eyes of the truth, behold that if one cut off from himself the allegiance of faith, he would be severed from power over his own self, how much less to pronounce judgement of severance against anyone else, be it in the realm of the revelation or that of the creation. For example, a Muslim who negateth Islam from himself, he would be powerless to pronounce the decree of the law of Islam against himself, how much less against others. Likewise, at that moment of severance, he must be standing upon a particular religious path, even if it returneth to a distant religion of Adam. Then whatever judgement he may pronounce, it returneth unto the law of Adam, and since at the time of Adam, He was the Manifestation of the Will, then even this very judgement is pronounced by virtue of the power of God. For God hath negated any power or strength for aught but Himself. This is an insight for anyone who desireth to flee form all but God, and to recognise the truth in the realm of the revelation.

The same is true in the realm of the creation. Should one desire to comprehend it truly, he should witness that if he is not within the Bayan, he would be utterly devoid of any strength and power, inasmuch as the essence of all men are brought in the Bayan, therefore, there remaineth no strength nor power in anything besides the Bayan, to constitute an exception. For in truth, there remaineth no strength and no power, which is in God, in the community of Jesus, otherwise, there should be amongst them some who would be judged as true, whereas it is not. The same is true with regard to Islam after the Revelation of the Bayan, and in regard to the Bayan after the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, inasmuch as in that day all strength and power is in God, which will only be revealed out of that Truth Who is the Manifestation of the Will. Therefore, there would be left no more strength or power in truth, for the people of the Bayan, save by abiding beneath His shadow.

Likewise, comprehend that in all the endless Revelations of God, whatever strength and power that may have ever existed in falsehood, it hath been solely due to its relation to truth, even as today, they do the evil things they do with the illusion of that same relation, otherwise in each Revelation, there is no strength nor power except in God, namely, in that which is revealed from Him. Shouldst thou behold with the eyes of the heart, thou wouldst witness that all strength and power belongeth to Him Whom God shall make manifest, in God, glorified and exalted be Him, and that this Revelation is by His grace and assistance, just as all Revelations from Adam till today have been by grace and assistance of this Revelation.

Gaze not upon the places and limits, inasmuch as the Will is the supreme Sign of God, and from time immemorial it hath referred unto God. Had not the First Adam been assisted by This Manifestation of the Will, He would not have attained faith beneath the shadow of This Faith, even as all Prophets are faithful in each Revelation. Likewise, were This Revelation to be unassisted by the grace of Him Whom God shall make manifest, how could They return, in the Day of Revelation, unto Him, and be wholly detached from aught but Him? For should there be thousands and thousands of Revelations afterwards, nay rather, indefinitely, limitless in their range, with no end for them, by them, of them, in them, and towards them, all would be assisted by the grace of the Last Manifestation of divine Revelation, Who is exactly the very First Adam, Who hath no beginning in the world of creation.

This is the hidden mystery of the truth. Should one swim in this sea, he would behold that there is no strength nor power except in God. Then he seeth both ideas of God's absolute determinism (jabr) and human absolute freedom (tafvíd) as barred from truth, treading the path that is wider than the distance between the heavens and the earth. He recogniseth in each age, the Manifestation of "He doeth what He willeth, and He ordaineth what He wisheth", and acknowledgeth Him upon His declaration. And he weepeth throughout the times of Concealment, till the Day of His Next Revelation, inasmuch as therein true recognition is inaccessible to all. Thus he boweth down before the Manifestation of "He shall not be asked of His doing, while all are questioned at His behest" upon His declaration. He shall not be veiled from Him, and will not be separated from Him even to the extent of the separation between the Letters B and E. For he can see that whatsoever that is manifest in each Revelation is manifested by His word, and fixeth his gaze upon the Essence of the Cause, and not on the multiplied tokens of each Revelation.

For in the sight of such wayfarer, the utmost paradise of union, which naught can be imagined to surpass it in the world of creation, is the new Revelation, while he can directly behold all past Revelations within that Revelation. For example, if one had fixed his gaze upon the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, he would have been able to witness all the Prophets in that same gaze, and he would have observed all the next Revelations in His Revelation, to the degree possible therein.

Such a person is worthy to recognise Him Whom God shall make manifest, and to say unto Him, when turning towards God, 'O my God! Thou art the First, and there hath been naught before Thee,' for all past Revelations have ended in the Bayan, and all that is in the Bayan endeth in Him Whom God shall make manifest. Then where there could be any truth before Him worth mentioning? Indeed, had there been any truth other than His truth, the faithful of the past religions would have not been judged as non-believers.

'And Thou art the Last, and naught existeth besides Thee,' for in His Revelation, all His subsequent Revelations, are Him and naught but Him, 'And Thou art manifest in sovereignty, and naught is above Thee,' for each Manifestation is manifest in His age through Him, and not through His non-believers, inasmuch as had there been any one manifest besides Him, he should have been judged as surpassing Him, whereas he is not even reckoned as a faithful, how much less His superior,

'And Thou art the hidden, and none existeth besides Thee,' for had there been anyone hidden besides Him, he should have been the essence and the possessor of a thing, whereas in the day of His Revelation any essence or possessor of anything is a mere nothing, save through Him, even as every possessor of anything cometh to naught in the new Revelation, unless he entereth that Revelation, Who is the Manifestation of God,

'Thou verily art potent over all things.' For there existeth no manifestation of power besides Him, inasmuch as had there been any, there should have remained a sovereignty form a sovereign, whereas in each Revelation, all previous manifestations turn into abject nothingness if they fail to enter therein.

Therefore, the true mystic knowers of God, attain the ultimate delightful joy of their existence upon the Revelation of the Sun of Truth, while they weep from His setting till the next dawning, on account of His concealment, with the utmost suffering unrivalled by any other pain. For all suffering are under the shadow of this supreme vexation. Behold the separation of infant from milk. He suffereth so much inasmuch as the milk preserveth his physical being, then how much more one should suffer if he would be veiled from that which preserveth his very heart? All the phenomenal types of love visible amongst the people are due to the shadow of love that is manifested in the soul. See how the separation from it so effectively causeth vexation amongst all the tokens of the kingdom of the Sovereign Lord of existence. Yet, the love pertaining to the soul is not even worth mentioning compared to the love pertaining to the spirit, just as the love pertaining to the spirit is not even comparable with the love pertaining to the heart!

By The sanctified Essence of God! All are wandering perplexedly in the world of nature. Should they ascend above it and enter the world of essential body, they would not be able to stand an infinitesimal part of a moment of separation from the Manifestations of magnification, nay, rather they always unpack the saddle (rahl) of their journey of annihilation at the Last Resting Place (qabr-i-akhir). In the like manner, should they enter the world of love pertaining to the soul, they would retreat in the vicinity of the Manifestations of the celebration of divine unity, and were they to advance from there, they would turn into the inmates of Manifestations of praise. Should they ascend therefrom, they would seclude themselves in the love of the manifestations of glorification, and were they to ascend therefrom, they would fix their gaze upon the Manifest in these Manifestations, and bow down in adoration before God.

For all love that is preceded by faith, turneth into paradisical love, otherwise, it is to be seen naught but the love of the thing in fire. How pure and essential is this Essence, and how detached and transcendent is this Detached reality, and how indivisibly pure is this pure Simplicity, and how delightfully pure is this Essence of unity (kafúr), that all delightful joys are created beneath the shadow of His sovereignty, and receive existence out of the relation with Him. For all true delight and joy is in submitting to His good pleasure, even as the man partaketh, when he knoweth that this is His good pleasure, of the cup of affliction, as if he is quaffing from the cup of the pure wine in the heaven. Then how much more he would rejoice if he partaketh of His love, besides which all love is utter nothingness!

Thus, in the time of each Revelation, the explorer inmate of this paradise is wholly surrendered to that glorious Countenance, while from the time of His setting till His rising, he is beset with the sorrow of separation. But before him, and before all who are endued with knowledge, his grief on account of the remoteness from Him, is far more delightful than any pleasure experienced by others.

How can the pen stream forth concerning the lifting of the veils, where all are drowned in the sea of veils, and they have not yet ascended from the world of transitory and accidental body, which turneth to dust after the death? Then how much less they ascend from the essential body, and even less from the stations ordained by God to be above it. Therefore, those who partake of such substantive glorious delight are scarcer than the philosopher's stone. Nay, rather, none can be found except those who only delight in things whose pleasure is limited to the duration of their life, should they possess them, otherwise, it is not destined that all would even always attain the object of their transitory pleasure.

The fruits of all the Bayan is this that ye recognise the Point of Truth upon His Revelation, for ye shall behold all good beneath the shadow of such recognition, and that ye will not be veiled from Him, for then ye be deprived of all good. At least, Traverse ye in the world of the essential body, that haply ye may be able to befittingly attain His presence in at least one morn. Otherwise, in the realm of the transitory and accidental body, day and night all have been, and will continue to be, with Him, inasmuch as He is concealed within His own Throne amongst these creatures. And that same place is the sublime paradise, and the supreme heaven, even as it hath been before His Revelation, and will continue to be after His Revelation, as well as after His setting, in whatever exalted throne that is destined by God for Him.

All the people of the Bayan are like the fishes who live in the water of His commands, by His grace, and see naught but Him, nay, rather see their own lives through Him, and yet they are veiled from Him.

In reciting each command, gaze ye upon its fruit, that in each Revelation ye may not be shut out as by a veil from Him, inasmuch as this is the fruit of all knowledge and of all deeds, should one but behold. Well is it with Him who is mentioned by God, for verily when he is so mentioned, all things shall mention him, for God remembereth the best. He is the Manifestation of the Will, Who is in this Revelation the Point of the Bayan, and in the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, none but Himself, Who is exactly This very Soul in the Resurrected Revelation, Who shall be manifested to a higher degree of excellence.

Should one be mentioned by Him, it is he who is mentioned by God, and none but him. Wander not aimlessly in your vain imaginings, for ye will not find anything. For verily the Cause of God shall be revealed from His treasuries, and He is the Lord of the treasuries of the Cause of God, aforetimes and hereafter. Will ye not be thankful?

Gate Eleven of the Fourth unity

Whoso transgresseth the precepts laid down in the Bayan, he will not be reckoned as a believer, no matter his position, a learned, a king, a slave, or a servant.

The substance of this gate is this, that at the moment of the revelation of the Bayan, God hath gazed upon all His creatures, and therefore, hath ordained precepts for all people in every level of standing, so that no soul in the paradise of the Bayan would be grieved or constrained to the least degree. Rather, He hath commanded a universal precept for all things, that whoever possesseth power over anything, must elevate that thing to its uttermost perfection, that it would not be deprived of its own paradise. For example, the paradise of a paper in which a few excellent lines are inscribed, is this, that it would be refined with utmost kinds of gold-illumination, adornment, and excellence that is customary for the most exalted patched scrolls. Then the possessor of that paper hath elevated it to its utmost possible degree of glory. Should he know of a higher degree of refinement and fail to manifest it in that patched paper, he would deprive it of its paradise, and he would be held accountable, that wherefore despite possession of power, thou hast withhold the effusion of grace and favour.

Whoso transgresseth the precepts of the Bayan, no matter whether the most exalted or the most abased amongst the creatures, he would not be judged as faithful. However, watch yourselves lest ye pronounce such judgement against Him Whom God shall make manifest, inasmuch as until the time that He would make Himself known to anyone, which is the supreme paradise of that soul, he would command in conformity with the laws of the Bayan, but upon the time of Revelation no one is permitted to say why or wherefore in regard to His command, for the precepts laid down in the Bayan are all from Him.

But be watchful for the Revelation, for His Revelation resembleth the Revelation of the Bayan, letter by letter, and verse by verse. Thus He shall assuredly shine upon the inmates of His dominion in stages. Thus in the Revelation of the Point of the Bayan, the first effulgence embraced only two souls, till it gradually reached unto all. Be attentive and watch for the hour of Revelation, that should it be manifested unto one, he would not be cleft asunder out of the majesty of the Revelation, seeing all the people of the Bayan rise from their seats for His name, and then hearth all of a sudden that the one who hath been day and night with him is none but Him. Rather, behold the truth of this same principle in regard to the Point of the Qur'an, and in all the Revelation preceding Him till that of Adam, as well as in the infinite Revelations to come.

But seek refuge in God lest ye be the first who conceive of non-truth with regard to His Truth, and attain the supreme excellence of the precedence in faith, even if ye witness that He is not yet recognised by anyone. For even in that very moment of unity, the moment that He is not yet recognised by anyone, the Testimony of God is complete and perfect, could ye but comprehend. Ye observe that the most mighty testimony of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, which is naught but the Qur'an, is today recognised by countless number of the faithful, yet this very same testimony was present in the early Islam, and till seven years no soul acknowledged that Most Great Day-Star.

Take heed and be watchful at all times not to transgress the precepts of the Bayan. This same principle was also confirmed in the Qur'an, as it hath been revealed, "Those who judge not in conformity with that which is revealed by God, they are assuredly numbered amongst the disbelievers." Likewise in two other verses the same people are described by two other abased attributes. Notwithstanding that, ye witness the extent of their transgression from the laws of God.

But watch yourselves that ye never heedlessly extend the judgement of this verse unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, for at that time, "that which is revealed by God" is naught but His command, even as at the time of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, "that which is revealed by God" was the Qur'an, and not that which was revealed in the Gospel. In like manner, today that which was revealed by God in the Qur'an is but that which is revealed by God in the Bayan, and not that which is revealed by God in the Qur'an.

It is for this reason that all imagine that what they do is "for God", whereas in truth all their doings is "for one other than God". For the Essence of Eternity is immeasurably sanctified above the reach of any judgement for or against Him. Rather, in its primary truth, this pertaineth to the Manifestation of the Primal Will, as it is explicitly testified by the Qur'an: "In truth, they who plighted fealty unto thee, really plighted that fealty unto God." The same principle is true in all other modes of action, and therefore, a judgement against Him is a judgement against God.

Nay, even the Members of the Sacred Family, have descended this same principle, and have applied it, in its secondary truth, unto themselves as well, even as the Long Friday visitation tablet is filled with assertions like this: "He who recogniseth You, hath recognised God, and he who faileth to recognise You, hath failed to recognise God. He who loveth You, hath loved God, and he who hateth You hath hated God." Today only God reckoneth the number of times that the adherents of the Shí'ih sect recite this visitation tablet, yet the Imams have Themselves returned unto this world, and none recogniseth Them, while day and night they continue to recite this tablet without the slightest trace of understanding!

This is certainly not due to any incompleteness of the testimony of God, even as in the day of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, the promise of Jesus to the Christians was fulfilled, that "Who shall come after me, bearing the Name Ahmad," and yet until this very day they have halted within Christianity and eagerly await the fulfilment of that promise, as thou canst witness myriads and myriads of the people who are in the West, who have remained in that same belief. This is due to the fact that they have not pondered upon the testimony of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, which was the Qur'an, otherwise, at the time of the Revelation, all would have witnessed that the promise of Jesus was fulfilled. Inasmuch as they were shut out as by a veil from Him, they turned into permanent inmates of fire, but they imagine that they are still faithful to their religion and are awaiting.

O people of the Bayan! Take pity upon yourselves, that the same disgrace would not come about at the time of the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest.

Describing the manifestations of divine decree, the Members of the Sacred Family have even applied that principle, in its tertiary truth, to Their Shí'ih followers. For all this visible grandeur that the Doctors display in Islam, is solely due to the word of the Imam, peace be upon Him, in His long tradition, whose fruit is this: "He who repudiateth him, hath repudiated Us, and he who repudiateth Us, hath repudiated the Apostle of God, and he who repudiateth the Apostle of God, hath repudiated God."

Nay, rather, They have further extended the same principle and have applied it to the faithful in general, even as it is mentioned in the tradition regarding the interpretation of the Súrih of the Cow, whose essence is this: "Whoso bringeth joy to a believer, he hath brought joy unto God." Behold then how the people have been content with descent in four degrees, and yet in regard to the supreme Station of Truth, in Whom naught is seen but God, in Whose praise is revealed the verse, "Be not forward in the presence of God," they commit so grievously. Though some have understood this verse to be a reference to forwardness in the presence of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, but this is contrary to God's intention, for in that same verse, the Apostle is also mentioned. Rather, it refereth unto the Sun of Truth, Who is the most exalted side of the Apostle, in Whom naught is seen except God.

All these diverse points are solely mentioned in this gate for the sake of gathering fruit, that none may be veiled from the purpose, the Desired One, for God is the best of Judges.

Gate Sixteen of the Fourth Unity

On the Sacred House

The substance of this gate is this, that there hath never been, and will never be, any physical place for God, and that in each Revelation of the Will, it is the earth that He hath attributed to Himself, that hath become His House, and the seat around which the angels of heaven and the people of the earth revolve. Nay, rather, all circle around His Command which is manifested in that piece of dust. If this sanctity was intrinsic to the dust itself, there must have been no change of the House of God in the past, and it must never change in the future. Though it is evident to those endued with understanding heart, that even the dust-House of God resembleth the Command, and that the Command is like the sun: should there be infinite change in the seats of the House, it would remain one and the same House.

Therefore, the change therein is like the relation of each Revelation of the Will to the Next Revelation. Otherwise, the dust that in the Day of Adam was attributed to God, is the very dust that is related unto Him in this Day. Even as the same Command that pertained unto that House, is the very Command that pertaineth to The Sacred House in This Dispensation. This House is in truth, naught but the glorious Seat of the establishment of Him Whom God shall make manifest, which is exactly the very House of He Who hath been Manifested, which is in turn the same as the seat of Ka'bih. Its measures equal the numerical value of the Name God (Allah=66) in Dhar', width by length, without reckoning the walls.

Had it been in the power of the faithful, it would have been ordained that the House would be raised from diamond upon the water, and its dust would be made out of Elixir, and its water out of the crimson-coloured perfume! However, inasmuch as no such power is witnessed, any form befitting the utter exaltation is acceptable. But should the outward and the inward be made out of mirror, it would be closer to purity than the other forms that are manifest today amongst the men of industry.

In the country of Fars, there is a Mosque in the center of which rises a structure similar to the Ka'bih, (Masjid-i-Jum'ih). It was built only as a sign indicating the Manifestation of the Will of God through the erection of the house in that land. \[Allusion to the new Mecca, i.e., the house of the Bab in Shiraz.\] Blessed be he who worships God in that land; truly we, too, worshipped God there, and prayed for him who had erected that building.

There is a mosque in the land of the letter Fa' (Shiraz or Fars), whose centre is built like the Ka'bih. It was constructed in such form solely to foretell, before the Revelation of the Cause of God, the exaltation of the House of God on that land, that it would be a sign for that earth of the divine bounty for it. Well is it with him who mentioneth God upon it, for I have mentioned God upon it for the one who hath raised it. Thus God rewardeth the doer of good. God mentioneth those who mention Him, though it be like that, for verily He remembereth the best.

But the command to exalt the House intendeth naught but this, that those who discern signs, vindicate through this House, the House of the celebration of oneness, glorification, exaltation of divine unity, sanctification of praise, and magnification. Thus, they must erect this latter House and fix their gaze upon the Manifestations thereof, so that at the time of the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, they shall not be veiled from the One Who is the Source of the sanctity of the House.

Even as it was this same Exalted Tree Who, 1270 years ago, ordained all to pilgrimage, and thus each year 70 thousands souls revolve around it. But behold how many years have passed from the Revelation of the supreme Source of the sanctity of the House, yet not even a single soul hath recognised His purpose of revealing that command, and none hath gathered fruit.

Whereas the true House of God is the hearts of His faithful, who are naught but the faithful unto Him Whom God shall make manifest. Today, it is the believers in the Bayan who act in conformity with that which is revealed in the Qur'an, and not the believers in the latter. Had the people circled around the House of Truth, the command concerning the pilgrimage of the House would not have been enjoined. Inasmuch as they have failed to do so, the necks of the creatures have been shackled with the sovereign decree that they must revolve around the dust which is attributed unto Him, that they may comprehend their limits, and in the Day of His Revelation they would not be veiled from Him.

This is the fruit of pilgrimage that they may arise to fulfil His Command, that haply in the Day of His Revelation, by the aid of such ascent, they would ascend towards Him. Alas! For the Dispensation of the Qur'an no such fruit is harvested, inasmuch as while 70 thousands souls circle around that House, at this very time the supreme Source of the sanctity of the House resideth in the mount of Makú, yet except one soul, none is present before Him! It is evident that the fruit is not gathered. In truth, it was befitting that at the time of Revelation, all the faithful in the Qur'an, who by virtue of His Command revolve so frequently around a mere dust, would revolve infinite times and until the end that hath no end, around the Command of His own Self. How very strange that the same letter of Shín (Satan), who hath traversed the long distance to His House on foot, now pronounceth this kind of judgement against Him, and those who have spent so much of their possessions for pilgrimage to His House, now they bar Him from even a tiny piece of land to reside therein! This is the contemptible estate of the people, who have always wandered, and continue to wander, aimlessly and without the slightest trace of consciousness, and then in the day of the harvest, they seem like a dead corpse, failing to be aware of the purpose of God in His ordinances.

Awake O people of the Bayan, and be prepared for the Revelation of the supreme Source of the sanctity of the House. For He is proud of those who revolve around His House during the time of Concealment. He beholdeth them, and sendeth unto them His pardon, on the condition that on the way to pilgrimage they all treat each other with courtesy and excellent conduct.

It is thus that I myself saw, on the voyage to Mecca, a notable who was spending considerable sums of money but who hesitated to spend the price of a glass of water for his fellow-traveller. This happened on the boat where the water was scarce, so scarce in fact, during the voyage from Bushihr to Mascate, which lasted twelve days with no opportunity to get water, that I had to content myself with sweet lemons.

Take heed and watch yourselves not to grieve any one under any condition, inasmuch as the hearts of the faithful are nearer unto God than the House made out of clay. Seek ye to draw nigh unto God in His House, inasmuch as prayers therein are answered. Whoso spendeth the price of one Carat for pilgrimage, while recognising the Lord of the House, he would be recompensed two thousands in this world. And whoso can go, without being afflicted with sorrow on the way, and refuseth to go, at the hour of death his spirit would be seized from him, and will be reckoned as a believer of the previous Book.

However, nothing is more important in the path of pilgrimage, than adornment with virtuous conduct, so that should he be accompanied by another, neither he himself would be grieved, nor he would grieve the other. I have seen (on the way to Mecca) acts of the vilest kind, in the eyes of God, which were sufficient to undo the good resulting from the pilgrimage. These were the quarrels among the pilgrims! For quarrels are forbidden at all times and under any condition, and the ways of the faithful have never been, nor will ever be, aught but forbearance, patience, shame, and tranquillity. Verily, the House of God has no need of such people!

Be warned and watch yourselves that the Religion of God is wider than anything. He whose habitation is separated from the House by sea, is exempted from pilgrimage. Were he to gain sufficient means for pilgrimage, he should pay the cost thereof to a faithful soul amongst his relatives, an act which would render him exempt, while his pilgrimage would be accepted before God.

This gracious law is enjoined that the one who stepeth in the court of God would not be grieved on the way, for one cannot imagine on the sea anything but discomfort. One cannot have all the necessities as in land travel. Nay, rather, should the merchants restrain the sea voyage, it would be more conducive, in this religion, to their tranquillity, but only if that is feasible, otherwise, the order of the world will be disrupted. The mariners are obliged to live thus but by their services they come nearer to God, and God rewards actions performed on the land and on the sea but He grants a two-fold recompense for those services accomplished by one of the servants on the sea, because their work is more arduous. And this on the condition that they are faithful to the religion of God, and treat each other in accordance with the bond of love. Verily God rewardeth the doer of good.

It behoveth the sovereign of the kingdom in which the Sacred House of God lieth, nay, rather, it behoveth all the kings, to establish offices in all parts of their territory, from the beginning to the end, to carry the news and correspondences of that land from one extreme to the other. Even as in the West, such system is organised in utmost excellence, and they know of the news, which otherwise can take several months to reach, in just a few days and nights. However, it is befitting that the king would make this accessible to all, that all can be informed of the news swiftly. For He Whom God shall make manifest will assuredly be manifested, and should the means of receiving news and books be prevalent amongst all, the servants of God would attain the blessing of guidance more swiftly. Were one to hear the news of the Revelation earlier, to the extent of an infinitesimal part (a ninth of a ninth of a tenth of a tenth) of a moment, and recognise Him, it would be better for him than becoming the possessor of all that is on earth and then offering them in the path of God.

It is for this reason that such ordinance is decreed, that haply in the Day of the Revelation of that Most Mighty Day-Star, the means to facilitate the attainment of the glory of guidance for His servants would be prepared. However, until such system is universalised, its benefit would not reach those who serve the kingdom, unless there be a time that it will be accessible to all the people. Otherwise, even today the kings have their own special careers. But it is fruitless, for the poor are barred from such service.

It behoveth every sovereign to be informed of the condition of all different parts of his territory, and provide the means of information accessible to all the inhabitants, so that should there be one of the followers of that Most Mighty Day-Star in the remotest corner of that land, he would be empowered, through the system that is effective in the kingdom, to turn unto the Sun of guidance. For God verily loveth those who create order.

Gate Three of the Fifth Unity

On true exposition of the knowledge concerning the years and the months

The substance of this gate is this, that the Lord of the universe hath fashioned all types of years by His behest, and hath ordained that from the inception of the Bayan, each year to equal the numerical value of the word all things (kullu shay'=361=19x19), to consist of 19 months, where each month equaleth 19 days, that from the moment of the shining forth of the sun in vernal equinox, corresponding to the first sign of Zodiac, the sign of Aries, till the end of its voyage at the end of winter, corresponding to the last sign of Zodiac, the sign of Pisces, all beings would traverse through all the 19 stages of the Letters of Unity.

It is thus that He hath called the first month that of Baha' (Splendour), and the last month that of 'Ala' (Loftiness), and hath established His religion in accordance with this same number. Thus, He hath destined each month to be the spring of one of His laws, that the inmates of this paradise may partake of divine delights in the utmost joy that is possible in the realm of creation. Therefore, in the first three months, the months of glorification, the fire of the hearts of existing beings is created, and in the next four months, the months of the celebration of praise, the spirits of the contingent beings are created, a time during which they are provided for. In the subsequent six months, which are the months of exaltation of unity, God causeth the beings to die, not a physical death, but the death from negation, and the life in affirmation. Finally, in the last six months, which are the months of magnification, the Lord of the universe, glorified and exalted be Him, quickenth those people who have died from the love for one other than Him, and have remained steadfast in His love.

The first three months are the fire of God, the next four months, the air of eternity, and the subsequent six months are the water of divine unity which streameth forth upon the souls of all things, descending from the air of eternity, an air which is in turn derived from the fire of God. The last six months pertaineth to the dust, that all that is manifested out of the three previous elements, may be preserved in the dust element, and then, the fruit would be harvested.

In like manner, all the creatures are multiplications of this unity in unity (19x19). The first month is the month of the Point, and the 18 months belonging to the Letters of the Living circle around it. Amidst all the months, the month of the Point resembleth the sun, while all other months resemble mirrors which reflect the radiant lights of that supreme month, in such wise that naught is seen in them but that month. God hath called that month the month of Baha (Splendour), meaning that therein lieth the splendour and glory of all months, and he hath singled it out for Him Whom God shall make manifest. Each of its days is related by God to one of the Letters of the Unity.

The first day, which is the day of Nawrúz, is the day of "There is none other God but God." That day is like the Point in the Bayan, out of Whom all are called into being, and unto Whom all shall return. Its Manifestation in the Dispensation of the Point of the Bayan is the Lord of the seven letters, Who is ordained by God to be the Throne of Him Whom God shall make manifest in this Revelation. For He is the One Who is shining forth in this Throne, and He is the Revealer of these glorious verses, He is the One in Whom naught is seen but God, glorified and exalted be Him, He is the First, yet not defined by it, and He is the Last, but not described by it. He is the Seen, and not praised by it, and He is Hidden, and not recognised by it, and He is the One Who is the Source of the thingness of all, while His thingness is by the grace of God.

He who is blessed in His day to witness unto divine unity 361 times, he would be guarded in that year from the afflictions which will be sent from the heaven of destiny. God verily protecteth all things.

The fruit of this knowledge is this, that just as these months, which are a mere token attribute of the creatures, have turned to naught but that which pointeth unto the Letters of the Unity, all other creatures of God should be the same, that no one would see any thingness in himself, except through the Manifestation of the Cause of God. But this should not be limited to a mere knowledge. Rather, one must harvest the result, and in the Day of the revelation of these same Manifestations, though he possesseth all earth, he would see naught in himself except these Manifestations, and submit unto Them, even if They appear, like in this Revelation, in cheap cotton-garments. This is that which profiteth the virtuous.

Gate Four of the Fifth Unity

On the ordinance concerning calling people by the Names of God, the name of Muhammad, blessings of God rest upon Him, the name of 'Alí, Their twin names, the name of Fatimih, the name of Hasan, or the name of Husayn, peace be upon Them.

The substance of this gate is this, that God hath graciously permitted His servants to call themselves by names that refer unto Him, like 'Azíz (The Almighty), and Jabbar (The All-Compelling), and the like of them. But the best names are the names that would indicate relation unto God, like Baha'u'llah (Glory of God), Jalalu'llah (Splendour of God), Jamalu'llah (Beauty of God), Núru'llah (Light of God), Fadlu'llah (Grace of God), Júdu'llah (Bounty of God), and similar Exalted names, as well as 'Abdu'llah (Servant of God) and Dhikru'llah (Remembrance of God). This type of naming is a gate that one can ascend therein endlessly.

Should one desire to choose a name in the sea of prophethood, guardianship, or love, he should limit his choice to one of the five names. However, the combination of the names Muhammad and 'Alí is the most mighty name, and the most wondrous sign.

But the divine Cycle shall advance in stages, until such Revelation when all things will be called by the Names of God, that no name would be assigned to anything unless it resembleth one of the Names of God, glorified and exalted be Him, like halím (forbearing), which is a food, but resembleth a name of God, lauded and magnified be Him. It is thus that in this Cycle of the Bayan there shall be made many constructions like this, even such permission is granted unto all. For in the Day of the Revelation of the Sun of Truth, should people attain the utmost limit of perfection, they shall not call anything except by a name that is like one of the Names of God, glorified and exalted be Him. And if such level of perfection would not be attained, it assuredly will happen in the Revelation subsequent thereof.

This will happen in stages and gradually, until all heaven, earth, and that which lieth between them, would be filled with the Names of God. What difference it maketh, whether a dust refereth unto God or a man doeth so, for both are His creatures, except that the former is created for the latter. For God hath invested the human spirit with the spirit of the celebration of God's unity by all things. For example, should a faithful sit on a land, the spirit of that land would attain utmost tranquillity and delight. On the other hand, should a non-believer sit thereon, it would be sore-vexed to such a degree that none can reckon it but God, and it ceaselessly beseecheth God to remove him therefrom. Thus the example of dust was given that thou wouldst be able to ponder the same principle in regard to all things.

Well is it with the people of that age, who call nothing but by a Name of God. That Age is worthy to be praised as the beginning of the worlds of paradise!

No created thing shall ever attain its paradise unless it appeareth in its highest prescribed degree of perfection. For instance, this crystal representeth the paradise of the stone whereof its substance is composed. Likewise there are various stages in the paradise for the crystal itself... So long as it was stone it was worthless, but if it attaineth the excellence of ruby--a potentiality which is latent in it-- how much a carat will it be worth? Consider likewise every created thing. Man's highest station, however, is attained through faith in God in every Dispensation and by acceptance of what hath been revealed by Him, and not through learning; inasmuch as in every nation there are learned men who are versed in divers sciences. Nor is it attainable through wealth; for it is similarly evident that among the various classes in every nation there are those possessed of riches. Likewise are other transitory things.

True knowledge, therefore, is the knowledge of God, and this is none other than the recognition of His Manifestation in each Dispensation. Nor is there any wealth save in poverty in all save God and sanctity from aught else but Him--a state that can be realised only when demonstrated towards Him Who is the Dayspring of His Revelation. This doth not mean, however, that one ought not to yield praise unto former Revelations. On no account is this acceptable, inasmuch as it behooveth man, upon reaching the age of nineteen, to render thanksgiving for the day of his conception as an embryo. For had the embryo not existed, how could he have reached his present state? Likewise had the religion taught by Adam not existed, this Faith would not have attained its present stage. Thus consider thou the development of God's Faith until the end that hath no end.

Render then thanks unto God through each one of His Revelations in each Dispensation, inasmuch as that is a thanksgiving unto God which is beloved in His sight. God guideth unto the absolute path of truth, whomsoever He willeth.

The fruit of this ordinance is this, that by virtue of continuos remembrance of these names, ye would not leave the shadow of Those Who bear these names, that haply in this Revelation one may become, through his attraction unto He Who beareth his name, worthy of being a name sign who would solely point unto Him Whom God shall make manifest.

But be warned lest thou be shut out as by a veil, by virtue of a mere name, inasmuch as in this Cycle, the one who martyred the Prince of the Martyrs, peace be upon Him, appeared by the very same name of that Essence of Holiness, and there is no doubt that in the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, all would be called by these beloved names. However, only he who shall remain firm in pointing unto Him, will be His name, for his inmost reality is fashioned out of the ocean of His bounty, who is worthy to be called by a most excellent name. Otherwise, he is a shadow of blatant error, beneath the nether ground, who shall perish in negation.

Thou hast witnessed in this Day of Resurrection, that myriad of souls were called by the name of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, which no name can surpass it in the world of creation, and yet they were veiled from their Beloved. God is a witness unto all things.

Know thou that He Whom God shall make manifest resembleth the touchstone which separateth pure gold from all besides it. For example, if one be called by the supreme name Baha'u'llah, and He recognise His Baha, Who is the First to recognise Him, then of all names, this name would be registered for him. Otherwise he would perish in negation, as if there hath never been any mention of him.

Gate Nine of the Fifth Unity

On this, that whenever one desireth to use anything, he should mention thereupon one of the names of God, inwardly, manifestly, or by awareness.

The substance of this gate is this, that inasmuch as nothing possesseth thingness except through the grace of God, glorified and exalted be Him, and that a day is destined for each thing to attain unto its utmost perfection, when all its potentialities would be manifestly actualised, and it is only then that it is worthy to be called by a name of God, within its own limit, and not the limit of that which is above it, and inasmuch as God hath commanded the people of the Bayan to elevate all things unto their uttermost limit of perfection, therefore, He hath granted them permission to call everything, through the letters of their names, by the Names of God, lauded and magnified be Him, that none would see in anything aught but the Countenance of the Revelation of the Will, in Whom naught is seen but God.

For example the lowest rank in the mineral kingdom is that of the stone (sang, consisting of three Arabic letters s, n, and g). Then in its letter Sín (s) naught would be seen but the All-Glorious (subbúh), in its letter Nún (n), the Light (núr), and in the letter Kaf (k, g) the All-Bountiful (karím), whether it would be mentioned by words, or conceived in the heart, or by awareness thereof, without either uttering in word or conceiving in heart. And should he be unable to do so, he should mention "In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy," and God, glorified and exalted be Him, will accept from him that which He hath intended of this ordinance, that naught would be seen in anything except Him Whom God shall make manifest, Who is the Source of the Names and Attributes of God, that haply in the day of the Revelation of that Sun of Truth, no possessor of identity claim any identity of himself, and would not behold in himself aught but Him, inasmuch as he hath always been, and will forever continue to be, dependent in his existence upon Him.

Take heed that this implieth not that one can see His reality in himself. Nay, rather, everyone resembleth a mirror which is facing the sun. He witnesseth the sun within himself, but only the shadow of the true sun. When faced with Him Whom God shall make manifest, regard all that is called a thing, from the uttermost world of detachment, till the nethermost realm of limitation, in the same manner, inasmuch as any excellence that is possessed by any one is due to the shadow of the Sun of His Revelation in His previous Revelation. For there hath never been, nor will ever be, any One manifest except Him.

It is thus that in the day of His manifestation, he loveth to behold in His knowledge, that all have ascended to their utmost limit of perfection in the Bayan, and that there is no atom of dust in the nethermost depth of the sea, except that it hath come under His possession through the faithful, amongst His beloved creation, and thus all have become pure mirrors, capable of reflecting the revelation of the Sun, so that upon the shining forth of His radiant lights, which are His verses, all would refer unto Him. This is the fruit of this law, should anyone but ponder. God verily illumineth the hearts of His righteous servants.

Gate Ten of the Fifth Unity

Verily God hath ordained the Temples for men and the Circles for women, to inscribe therein that which they desire from the Bayan.

The substance of this gate is this, that God hath ordained two mighty bounties for the people of the Bayan, and graciously hath favoured them therewith. Unto men is conferred the temple, whose manifest aspect is the letter Ha' (5), and whose inner side is the letter Vav (6). It is permitted to inscribe therein that which hath shone forth from the Sun of the Point, that every one is empowered to obtain that which he can, out of the sea of His bounty. For the effect of that which is written down in that temple, would be manifested in the soul of that person, letter by letter, and point by point.

And unto women (manifestations of the letter Ba ), the circle of the Countenance of the Sun of Truth is conferred, ordaining it to be five unities (5x19=95), and each unity (19) a unity (1), that it would refer to the letters of the word "for God" (lillah=95), confirming that "Verily all that is in the heavens, on earth, and in that which lieth between them, is for God. God embraceth all things," so that the Countenance of the Sun of Truth may shine upon their very hearts, that haply in the Day of the Revelation of that Most Mighty Day-Star, they would not point unto aught but Him.

Thus He hath granted them permission to inscribe therein of the words that have dawned from the Sun of Existence, that which they desire, inasmuch as the effect of whatever they write therein, would be manifested in that soul, letter by letter and point by point. The original form of this circle hath proceeded in the manner that the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon Him, hath mentioned the Names that is derived from the letter Ha'. Thus from the point, the name Ever-Living (Hayy), from the first derivative of the point, the name Self-Subsistent (Qayyúm), from the letter Alif, the name Sovereign (Sultan), and from the letter Jím, the name Holy (Quddús) is derived. But for that reason in this Revelation He hath revealed the principle of "In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy," that from the station of the point till that of the letter Jím, all the four stages of creation, provision, death, and life would be encompassed. Therefore, should anyone act in conformity with that which hath proceeded from that Ocean of Bounty, he would witness the realisation of his goals, on the condition that the Will of God hath destined their fulfilment.

The fruit of these two commands is that all comprehend that all the Bayan equaleth the creation of the Greater world, by virtue of its manifestation through temple or circle, without exceeding the limit of the letter Ha' (5), so that in the first five years of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, they would be blessed with the utmost bounty of recognising that Sun of Truth. For all that is written in the temples and the circles is naught but His praise and His sanctification from all that is uttered by those against Him.

But should anyone who is blessed with the possession of temple or circle, which is the bestowal of His grace, fail to manifest the fruit of that which is inscribed in the five lines, the six concentric circles, or the 19 chambers, no mention of such fruit would be made for him or her. For such a person hath brought to naught the fruit of his own existence. All these is simply for this purpose, that none of the people of the Bayan would transgress the limits of five , inasmuch as in the temple five embraceth the letter Vav (6), and in the circle, the letter Vav preserveth the letter Ha' (5).

This is the goal of their revelation, that haply at the time of the manifestation of that Sun of Eternity and the Ancient Countenance, all people attain such height that the possessors of temples would be wholly detached unto Him within five (letter Ha'), and the possessors of circle would do likewise within six (the letter Vav). Though should the Cycle advance, five years would be reduced to five months, nay rather, to five weeks, or five days, or five hours, or five minutes, or even five times of a tenth of a ninth, or whatever that can be mentioned in swiftness of nearness unto Him. For between the Will and that which is fashioned by Him, there is no distinction of separation. Rather, God hath always created between them the distinction of description, like the distinction between fire and its burning. Can it be that fire is flamed but it faileth to burn, or that the lamp is lighted, and yet its lights fail to illumine the place in which it is lighted? Ponder, in like manner, all the appropriate examples from the uttermost essence of existence to the nethermost rank of limitation.

Gaze not, at any time, upon all these temples and circles, except as one single Temple, even as at this very moment thou beholdest naught in the entire Qur'an but the Temple of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him. For had it not been for Him, naught thereof would have been generated, be it the faith in Him, in His Manifestations, and in all that is revealed from God unto Him. In like manner, in each Revelation, behold with the eyes of certitude, this Indivisible One Essence that streameth forth within the inner reality of all things. Therefore, in the Day of the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, should anyone witness in a temple aught but His Temple, he hath been veiled from Him, though He is more manifest unto him than the manifestation of his self unto himself. And whatever he doeth, even at the time of being veiled from Him, he desireth naught but Him! This is the meaning of the phrase, "unto God shall return every Cause," could ye but comprehend.

Gate Three of the Sixth Unity

On this, that God hath verily ordained His servants to build in each village a House for warm bath

The substance of this gate is this, that inasmuch as in this Revelation happened that which happened, and inasmuch as all have been blessed by the favour of cleansing by virtue of the command of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, yet they desired for the Source of that command, that which is evident, it is, therefore, ordained in the Bayan that no place would be inhabited unless a house of cleansing and refinement would be constructed therein. Thus if one day a faithful is assailed by affliction, he would be able to act, in the religion of the Bayan, in conformity with the utmost height of cleansing and refinement. For, in this religion no other command is as rigorously enjoined as the duty of refinement, and it is forbidden that one bringeth anything into being in a state of imperfection, when he hath the power to manifest it in utter perfection.

For example, should one build an edifice, and fail to elevate it to the utmost state of perfection that is possible for it, there would be no moment in the life of that edifice, when angels would not beseech God to torment him, nay, rather, all the atoms of that edifice do the same. For each thing, within its own station, yearneth to attain unto the utmost height of excellence in its own level. Thus, when a man is in a position of power to realise its yearning, and he faileth to do so, he would be held accountable therefor. This is enjoined that haply should someday in His Resurrected Revelation, the Sun of Truth pass by a place, he would behold the signs of the submission of His faithfuls unto Himself.

It is ordained in this religion, to design the gates of each place in a manner that a tall man can enter through them without bending their head. It behoveth them that they always build every single place in the same manner that they construct the Lofty Seats, namely in utmost exaltation, so that haply in the Day of the Revelation of God, nothing that causeth grief would be witnessed in His kingdom. For all the fruits of the Previous Revelation and the years that hath passed of that Dispensation, should be manifested in the Day of Resurrection.

As to the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, it is God Who knoweth that in how many years after this Revelation, He shall make Him manifest. However, from the inception of the Revelation till nineteen years (number of the unity) take heed and be watchful, inasmuch as each year, the revelation of the faith of the believers would be manifested by a different letter, after which they would not be able to manifest the fruits of the past Revelation, except through the Next revelation. Even as anyone who hath been present from the early days of this Revelation, hath witnessed that they refused to let the Manifestation of the fruits of 1270 years to reveal Himself beyond the station of the gatehood (Bab).

Were anyone to fail in revealing the fruit of his existence, it is he himself who would be shut out as by a veil from Him. However, hasten in His Revelation, in utmost swiftness, inasmuch as the Cause of God is swifter than anything else. Manifest ye all, upon hearing of His Revelation, the fruits of the Bayan by any means in your power, for should there be a delay, to the extent of the twinkling of an eye, all that ye have done would perish. Who knoweth, your present deeds may even fail to be accepted, unless they are manifested as the deeds of the next fruit. God verily doeth what He willeth, and ordaineth that which He pleaseth.

Gate Eight of the Sixth Unity

On this, that he who adduceth any proof other than the Book of God and the verses of the Bayan, as well as the powerlessness of all to produce the like thereof, he is veiled from any proof, and he who reporteth any miracle other than the verses, is veiled from any testimony, and he who claimeth to reveal divine verses, should not be opposed by anyone. All must recite this gate once in every 19 days, and ponder, day and night, upon that which is revealed therein.

The substance of this gate is this, that should anyone adduce any proof other than the verses of God to vindicate the truth of the Point of the Bayan, he would be veiled from the most mighty proof and the most exalted path. Though in each Revelation, all the attributes of the very Tree of Truth barreth all others from any resemblance, association, likeness, equivalence, or similarity unto Him, yet inasmuch as the eyes of the heart of the multitude fail to behold the supreme exaltation of His own Self, and inasmuch as the divine verses are revealed in a manner that if all desire to understand, they would be able to do so, therefore, He hath ordained the testimony to be but one, namely the verses.

The purpose of this gate is this, that in the Day of the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, He would not be told why or wherefore. Likewise, in all that is revealed in the Qur'an, the sole proof that is adduced is the revelation of the verses, and had all comprehended that, today acknowledging the Truth would have been an easier lot for them than this clinging to the authority of strange miracles, the report of which they themselves have devised, when in truth there is no warrant for any of them in the Book of God.

Nay, rather, if He reject any miracle, acting in conformity with that which is ordained in the Book of God, that would eternally be, as it hath always been, the Command of God. Thus it is enjoined upon all to gaze upon this gate once in every 19 days, that haply in the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, they would not be veiled by any condition besides the modes of the verses, which is the most mighty testimony and proof.

But be warned lest ye gaze upon it once every 19 days, and yet the Desired One revealeth Himself, and ye fail to recognise Him due to your veils. Just as ye read every morning the covenant prayer, and yet by your excessive utterance "may God hasten His coming, may God hasten His coming," ye conceal from yourselves your real hate of Him, and imagine that ye love Him. Now it is almost more than three years, and the Cause of God hath been manifested, and yet today ye have imprisoned your Desired One in the mountain.

Yet, He hath appeared with the same testimony that the religion of all Muslims is founded upon it, to the degree that after the termination of God's revelation unto Muhammad till the manifestation of these verses, none hath appeared who produced a single verse. Ye are so deprived of insight that ye fail to comprehend that none besides God can reveal any verse. Therefore, now that ye witness that the same testimony is manifested, ye must know of a certainty that the Point of the Bayan is the same Primal Truth unto Whom the Qur'an was sent by God in the early days of Islam, and thus ye discern that God now desireth to once again reveal unto Him His verses.

Had ye firmly believed in the testimony of your religion, ye would have pondered this truth, inasmuch as there are but two options therefor. God verily hath explicitly revealed in the Qur'an the powerlessness of all in regard to this supreme testimony. But ye cast an indiscriminate glance around you, and inasmuch as ye behold Him as one amongst the multitude of the people, ye imagine that such Revelation is impossible, therefore ye become veiled from Him, even though God is sending down His verses in this Day of Return, in exactly the same manner that He revealed them in the Day of the Beginning. Should ye behold with this gaze, ye would acknowledge the truth in less than the twinkling of an eye. But inasmuch as ye gaze upon the created beings, ye find it impossible. Yea, it is impossible for the creatures, but not for God, inasmuch as He doeth whatsoever He willeth, by virtue of His supreme power.

It is perfectly evident that after the setting of the Sun of Truth none can produce the like of His verses, even as in the 1270 years of the Dispensation of the Qur'an all have become certain of the powerlessness of all. In like manner, it shall also be impossible that after the setting of the Sun of Truth, a single verse would be manifested by anyone but Him, out of primordial nature and supreme power, and without acquisition and the other conditions prevalent amongst the men of knowledge.

Notwithstanding this impossibility, that none besides Him Whom God shall make manifest will be able to claim such a mighty Cause, it is enjoined in the Bayan that should anyone make a claim and verses are manifested from Him, no one should oppose Him, that haply no grief would assail that Sun of Truth. Had this command been observed in the Dispensation of the Qur'an, the deeds of all would not have suddenly come to naught. For in dealing with the Lord, should one fail to become for God, yet he also refuse to become against Him, he would only be judged by his own misdeed and not by those of all the people.

Therefore, if ye now hear of such claim and fail to be certain, refuse to commit that which grieveth Him, even though it would be a false claim by someone other than Him, although this is an impossible supposition. However, the mere mention of His exalted name should suffice His lovers to refuse to inflict sorrow upon the claimant, as a token of respect for Him. For the truth is but one of the two: Either the claimant is truly Him, although naught else is possible inasmuch as none besides Him can reveal verses out of primordial nature, then why should anyone reject God while all his deeds, day and night, are performed in ardent waiting for Him. Or, making an impossible assumption, the claimant is falsely attributing himself unto Him, then leave his judgement unto God, inasmuch as the created beings have no right to judge against him, as a token of their glorification of the name of their Beloved, even though no one can make such a claim. If in the Dispensation of the Qur'an any claim to revelation of the verses hath happened, then it could happen in this Dispensation as well!

His verses are, by themselves, sufficient proof of the radiant lights of the Sun of His Being, just as the powerlessness of all is the mighty evidence of the utter need and dependence of all unto Him. The reason for this command is this, that haply in the Day of the Revelation of that supreme Truth, the feet of the people would not falter upon the bridge, and that they would not pronounce judgement against the Fashioner of their existence, adducing against Him the very shadow of His verse in their heart, and rendering naught, at once, all their inmost realities and deeds, without even perceiving it.

Should all act in conformity with this law, it would befit God to reveal the Truth unto them, and to cast, by virtue of the evidences that shine forth from Him, conclusive testimony and proof in their hearts, that the faithful can proclaim their certitude of His truth, and the non-faithful would be empowered to declare their hesitation, inasmuch as hesitation with regard to truth is naught but untruth.

Should the people of the Bayan observe this command, it would suffice to cause them salvation in the Day of Resurrection. For in that Day, all on earth, acknowledging the verses that have shone forth in their heart from the Sun of Truth, shall declare "We verily act for God." However, the truthful are only those servants who fix their gaze upon He Who hath fashioned, by the grace of God, glorified and exalted be Him, those verses, Who is none but the very Sun of Truth. And it would be His verses, which are His radiant lights, that shall separate amongst all things. This is the supreme testimony of God that is fulfilled unto you. Be then fearful, O servants of God!

Gate Nineteen of the Sixth Unity

On this, that it is incumbent upon all to reply when they are written to, and answer when they are questioned, and to heed all that is derived thereof.

The substance of this gate is this, that it is enjoined in this Revelation that should anyone receive a letter from any other, it would be his duty to write him back, by his own hand or that of another on his behalf, and delay or separation is not approved. In like manner, should one ask a question, it would be incumbent upon the addressee to give a guiding answer, that haply in the Day of the Revelation of God no one may be shut out as by a veil from Him. Thus when he revealeth, from God, "Am I not your Lord?" all would answer "Yea." For the duty to reply is enjoined for this purpose, but its influence will extend till the last atom (dharr) of existence.

The same is true with regard to writing, inasmuch as there is no doubt that in the Day of Resurrection, His Books will be sent down unto all the people. Be warned lest anyone fail to answer the call of his Beloved, on account of his being wrapped up in veils. For it is by answering Him that man's inmost reality would be created in the dharr of hearts, through acknowledging of the oneness of God, and in the dharr of spirits through witnessing unto prophethood, and in the dharr of souls through testifying unto viceregency, and in the dharr of bodies through confessing unto gatehood.

In each Revelation those who answer are distinguished from those who remain silent, otherwise, all answer in regard to the previous Dispensation. For example, can anyone be found today in the world of Islam, who would not utter the two declarative words of faith, and would not acknowledge that which is derived thereof, like viceregency and the laws of the Qur'an? Nay, this is unthinkable. But it is in the Next Revelation that the sincere men of truth would be distinguished from the insincere men of untruth, by virtue of their answer to the call of God.

That is a man endued with vision, who answereth the call of God in all worlds and all stations, should it be through writing, through utterance, or through action, which is the most mighty means of reply. And it is by virtue of the blessings of the answering of such soul, that all are enjoined to answer each other, to such a degree that if an infant cry out, it would be incumbent to answer him with any means possible. Likewise, should one's condition silently call upon others, it would be the duty of the men of discernment to answer his call. In like manner should one's seat of habitation call for answer, or any other manifestation discernible to men of vision, it would be binding upon them to reply, that at no time, no one may witness that which would cause him grief.

This command is binding that haply in the Day of Resurrection, when the eyes of hearts recognise not their own Beloved and Desired One, save those desired by God, they would not, unknowingly, inflict Him with grief, so that all of a sudden that which vindicateth religion would be raised, and yet they would be veiled by clinging to the secondary derivatives thereof. For in each Revelation, this is the veil that shuteth out those who are veiled. But God guideth whomsoever He willeth by His grace, for verily He encompasseth all things.

Gate Two of the Seventh Unity

On the motive of action, inasmuch as it behoveth everyone to engage in no action, unless he uttereth these words: "Verily, I assuredly arise or sit for God, the Lord of the heavens and earth, the Lord of all that is seen and all that is unseen, the Lord of all worlds." And should he recite it in his heart, that would also be rewarded.

The substance of this gate is this, that no behaviour turneth into a real action, unless it is performed for the sake of God. It is for this reason that it is enjoined upon all actors to utter this word at the time of their action: "Verily I do this for God. The Lord of the heavens and earth, the Lord of all that is seen and all that is unseen, the Lord of all worlds." Should he recite it in his heart, it would be rewarded as well.

However, no act will become for God, unless the actor recogniseth the Tree of Truth, inasmuch as the above verse is one verse amongst His verses, and be warned lest in the Day of Resurrection ye be veiled from Him by His verse that is manifested in your soul. Even as in the Dispensation of the Qur'an, he who acted for the sake of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, and that of His Letters of the Living, he hath acted for the sake of God. And it is not appropriate that anyone doeth anything for anyone, unless he doeth it for God, and it will not be for God, unless it is for the sake of the Revelation of that time.

Thus today all who act in conformity with the Gospel, act to attain the good pleasure of God by the command of Jesus, and although before the Day of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, such acts were for God, but at the very moment of the Revelation they turned into acts for one who is other than God. Nay, rather in that Revelation he must have acted for the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, inasmuch as it is only then that acting for God is realised.

In like manner, the people who are now acting in accordance with the Bayan, and recite this verse, should they, in the day of the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, act for Him, they would act for God, otherwise their actions would come to naught, as if they have not done anything. This is the case in regard to the root pillars of religion, discern thou thyself, the requirements of the acts related to the derivative branches thereof.

Likewise comprehend the appropriate modes of action pertaining to this world, which must turn into acts for God. For example, thou partakest of food, and thou desirest to do so for the sake of God, whereas thou art shut out as by a veil from the very Tree that pointeth unto God, not heeding the truth that this verse that is manifested in thy soul hath shone forth from that Tree, and thus it returneth unto Him in His next Revelation. There are even times, that thou barrest Him from that which thou doest in thy being for Him! Regard thou all other modes of thy deeds in the world. Thou claimest they are for God, whereas thou art veiled from Him.

Gaze in like manner, upon the modes of action in religion, till it reacheth the essence of the declarative word which testifieth unto divine unity. For in the Day of the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, shouldst thou act for Him, thou would act for God, whether it be the act of declaring "There is none other God but God," or just drinking water. Otherwise, shouldst thou fail to act for Him Whom God shall make manifest, then by uttering "there is none other God but God" thou wouldst enter the fire, and by drinking water, thou wouldst drink of the non-paradise drink.

It is for this indivisible essential principle, that at the time of the Revelation of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, it was decreed that the followers of all other religions act for the one other than God, even though they all have believed in the past Book of God and His past Messenger, and even though today they continue to believe therein, as all can see. The secret of this mystery is this, that from the Day of Adam, the One Who was followed by the faithful was none other than the Apostle of God, and all the Revealed books naught but the very Qur'an that is sent down unto Him. This meaneth that in truth they have been veiled from the previous Revelation and His Book, inasmuch as they have failed to recognise that He is the same past Manifestation Who is manifested in the Next Revelation.

Likewise, at this time shouldst thou act for God in the Bayan, and refuse to make thy acts against the Letters of the Unity, and behold all dependent upon the Primal Letters, nay, rather, witness in Them naught but the manifestation of His Revelation, then thou wouldst be reckoned during the darksome Night as one who acteth for God. However, at the time of the appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest, wert thou to perform thy deeds for the sake of the Point of the Bayan, they would be regarded as performed for one other than God, inasmuch as on that Day the Point of the Bayan is none other than Him Whom God shall make manifest. Likewise, His Letters of the Living are exactly His Letters of the Living, for Whom thou hast been acting. Then how is it that when They appear, thou failest to act for Them?

It is for this reason that at the beginning of every Dispensation a vast multitude, who fondly imagine that their deeds are for God, become drowned and ungodly, and perceive this not, except such as He guideth at His behest.

It is better for a man to guide a soul than to possess all that lies between East and West. Likewise better is guidance for him who is guided than all the things that exist on earth, for by reason of this guidance he will, after his death, gain admittance into Paradise, whereas by reason of the things of the world below, he will, after his death, receive his deserts. Hence God desireth that all men should be guided aright through the potency of the Words of Him Whom God shall make manifest. However, such as are conceited will not suffer themselves to be guided. They will be debarred from the Truth, some by reason of their learning, others on account of their glory and power, and still others due to reasons of their own, none of which shall be of any avail at the hour of death.

Take thou good heed that ye may all, under the leadership of Him Who is the Source of Divine Guidance, be enabled to direct thy steps aright upon the Bridge, which is sharper than the sword and finer than a hair, so that perchance the things which from the beginning of thy life till the end thou hast performed for the love of God, may not, all at once and unrealized by thyself, be turned to acts not acceptable in the sight of God. Verily God guideth whom He will into the path of absolute certitude.

Gate Three of the Seventh Unity

On this, that repaying debt is an obligation which should not be delayed.

The substance of this gate is this, that extending loan to the faithful hath always been, and will continue to be, beloved before God. Likewise is the repayment of the loan, which is incumbent upon all. Indeed, should it be in one's power to repay his debt, the act of repayment would be more beloved in the sight of God than any other thing, And delay therein is not permitted.

The fruit of this law is this, that the divine words of glorification, celebration of praise, sanctification, exaltation of unity, magnification, and all other parts of religion are tokens that are bestowed as a loan by the Supreme Truth unto His created beings. Therefore upon His Revelation, it is the duty of all to return them unto Him, from the lofty word of the declaration of divine unity till the last token of limitation. Were one to repay at once, upon the Revelation, his debt, naught would be reduced from him, unless he would behold better thereof in the universes and in souls.

How remote is a man who refuseth to repay the right of another! Then how much more it must be with regard to the right of God, when a servant come to believe in Him, and yet in the due Day of Return, despite his claim of faith, he would fail to recognise the Revealer of religion and the Bestower thereof! This is the contemptible condition of the creatures, couldst thou but behold it with the eyes of certitude. God judgeth in truth, and He verily is the best separator.

Gate Eighteen of the Eighth Unity

On the fast. Make ye mention of God during the 19 days, at the end of each year, when ye are fasting.

The substance of this gate is this, that before fasting thou must comprehend God's purpose thereof, that what is the fruit of the fast. Hast thou been present at the time of the Revelation of the Qur'an, and asked the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, of the reason for the command of fasting, He would assuredly have granted thee the same answer that is given here: the purpose of fasting is to fast from anyone who is not for God.

For example, at the time of the Apostle of God, blessings of God rest upon Him, if thou loved not anyone who loveth Him not, and wert not for anyone who is not for God, and then fasted in that condition, the reward of fast would assuredly have been granted unto thee. Likewise, extend this same principle, letter by letter, to the Letters of the Unity of the Qur'an, till it endeth in the Last Letter Who embraceth the Manifestations of the entire Unity, so that had thou fasted from other than Him, thou assuredly wouldst have been fasting in that day for God.

In like manner gaze upon the Revelation of the Point of the Bayan. Shouldst thou hear of this Revelation, and attribute non-truth unto it in thy heart, the root pillar of thy Faith would be removed at once, how much more it must bring to naught thy fasting, which is one of the derivative branches of thy Faith. For when thou heard of the Revelation, God's testimony was complete for thee, inasmuch as the one who proclaimed it to thee, hath adduced verses as the proof, and thus, thy veiling from Him hath been thy refusal to answer the call of God in the fourth dharr.

For at that time, He revealed Himself by that title, and described Himself as the revelation of one of the Gates. It is for that reason that the first dharr was manifest in the fourth dharr, inasmuch as in that very fourth dahrr, He revealed the supreme word "Verily I, Myself, am God, none other God is there but Me." Should there be a man of discernment in the world, he would be able to tread the path and attain certitude that the Last is exactly the First, and the Seen is the very Hidden, but only in the rank of the First and not in that of the Second. For the Names of each rank conformeth to its own rank and would not surpass its limit. For example, behold the kingdom of the firstness: from the First of Existence till the Last of existence are mentioned therein. But the firstness that is mentioned with regard to the First Himself, can never be compared with the firstness that is mentioned in regard to the Last of Existence. In like manner comprehend all the ranks of Names and examples, and judge accordingly.

Wert thou to fast in this Revelation, thou must fast from the love of the one other than the First letter, inasmuch as naught is seen in all the Letters but that Single Letter. Inasmuch as obedience is solely decreed unto the First Unity, and not unto the multiplied numbers, therefore, regard as fasting those who are for Them, and reckon those who are for other than Them, as non-fasting. Likewise, witness in Their Countenances the gates of the paradise, and behold in the 19 who dwell in shadow, the gates of fire, inasmuch as fast is indeed fasting from them.

For example, in the Day of the appearance of the Commander of the faithful, peace be upon Him, all were fasting, yet only those were judged as fasting who were abiding in His love, and were fasting from His non-love. In each Revelation, all the people of that Dispensation perform the laws of that Revelation, but upon the inception of the Next revelation, the efficacy pertaining to the root pillar of the previous religion is removed, how much more cometh to naught the derivative branches thereof.

By saying that upon the inception of the New Revelation the previous laws are removed, it is intended that the previous religion is now manifested through the New Revelation, otherwise in truth it is not removed. Thus in this Revelation, only those who were abiding in the love of the Second, have fasted during the month of God. Otherwise, all in their own limitations obey the law, but of no avail. Had all the faithful in the Qur'an, failed to fast and yet the calamity which is afflicted upon Him had not, it would have been far more beloved in the sight of God than all their fastings and the disgrace that happened. For had His martyrdom not happened, the root beginning of their faith would not have been judged as removed, but now even though they perform the laws of the religion, it is decreed as removed.

When fasting, it behoveth the one doing so, to take heed lest he would be veiled from the good pleasure of God, so that should during his fast, the Tree of Truth shine forth, and command non-performance thereof, he would obey unhesitatingly. For this fasting that he now performeth is solely due to His command in His previous Revelation. In like manner regard all the deeds. Guard thyself from drinking, eating, intercourse, contention, even in words, and injustice, even to the extent of a carat, and pronouncing judgement against God. Be especially careful with regard to the last three prohibitions, inasmuch as from the inception of the Revelation till the beginning of the Next Revelation, whoever pronounceth judgement against the Point, he hath pronounced judgement against God, which rendereth his fasting naught.

The same is true with regard to the Day of the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, inasmuch as there is no doubt that at that glorious time all the people of the Bayan will be fasting, but should they pronounce judgement against Him, the root beginning of their religion would assuredly come to naught, how much more it will be in regard to one of its token laws.

Be watchful from the sunrise till the sunset, and fix thy gaze upon the name of the Unity (19). No faithful, male or female, is required to fast before reaching the age 11(the number of the name He, Huva), except till the time that sun reacheth its zenith. And should they fast beyond that time, they would not be reckoned as fasting. After the age 11, it is required till the age 42 (the number of the age yea, bala), and beyond that there would be no fasting.

Behold each of the parts of the ordinances of God. Had all on earth combined together, they would have been unable to decree, in truth, in an infinitesimal part (a ninth of the ninth of the tenth of the tenth) of a moment, anything other than it. But witness now how the ocean of divine bounty is billowing for His servants, without their desert. For had it been due to their own worth, they would assuredly have remained in their past veils. For the source of recognition is His grace, so that had He refused to make Himself known, they would have continued to perform the past deeds till the Next Resurrection.

Fast ye for God, your Lord, that haply in the Day of Resurrection, ye would be far from those who fail to recognise Him Whom God shall make manifest.

Gate Four of the Ninth Unity

God hath enjoined upon the people to remember Him in their heart. Say! All are questioned thereof.

The substance of this gate is this, that the essence of all knowledge is the knowledge of goodly characters and traits. Man must act in conformity with it, that by virtue of such knowledge of ethics he would neither witness any grief in his soul, nor inflict sorrow upon any other soul. All the reasons for ordaining righteousness, abstinence, and other attributes, return unto this principle. For example, should one be afflicted with poverty, but choose contentment and patience, his self-esteem would remain intact, and he would not be grieved, and therefore when the days of his need hath passed, he would not see any abasement. On the other hand, should he show his poverty he would, at the best, receive assistance from someone which would remove that which is grieving him, but then when he beholdeth himself, the received assistance would never equal the abasement brought about for him. Regard in like manner, all the good traits and attributes in all stations.

The reason why remembering God in heart hath been enjoined in moments of devotion is this, that thou mayest give thy best attention to the remembrance of God, that thy heart may at all times be animated with His Spirit, and not be shut out as by a veil from thy Best Beloved. Let not thy tongue pay lip service in praise of God while thy heart be not attuned to the exalted Summit of Glory, and the Focal Point of communion. Thus if haply thou dost live in the Day of Resurrection, the mirror of thy heart will be set towards Him Who is the Day-Star of Truth; and no sooner will His light shine forth than the splendour thereof shall forthwith be reflected in thy heart. For He is the Source of all goodness, and unto Him revert all things. But if He appeareth while thou hast turned unto thyself in meditation, this shall not profit thee, unless thou shalt mention His Name by words He hath revealed. For in the forthcoming Revelation it is He Who is the Remembrance of God, whereas the devotions which thou art offering at present have been prescribed by the Point of the Bayan, while He Who will shine resplendent in the Day of Resurrection is the Revelation of the inner reality enshrined in the Point of the Bayan -a Revelation more potent, immeasurably more potent, than the one which hath preceded it.

Shouldst thou mention Him in such manner, in thy heart and by virtue of thy faith in Him, the reward of such remembrance would be 95 times that of thy manifest remembrance. However, in the Day of His Revelation, make mention of the Absolute Truth manifestly, inasmuch as in that Day mentioning Him manifestly is 95 times more excellent than mentioning Him in heart. This is the essence of the remembrance before both he who mentionth and He Who is the Object of remembrance, couldst thou but comprehend. Make then mention of God in your heart with your utmost power.

Take heed and watch the objects attended by thy heart which hath always been, and will continue forever to be, susceptible of infinite degrees. If thou hast been of the true people of vigilance and introspection, thou wouldst know that in the highest degrees of vigilance, the objects of heart would resemble those of the manifest objects of perception, until a stage in which the remembrance of one's heart would be the same both in sleep or waking.

Shouldst thou attain such an exalted stage, and yet fail to recognise the Sun of Truth, it would not profit thee, but shouldst thou recognise Him, and thou fail to attain such stage, it would profit thee.

Excess in devotional reciting is not approved, be it in heart or in tongue, nay, rather, wert thou to make mention once with exultation and rapture, it would far excel a thousand mentions without them. The precise measure of such balance is known to each person in his own soul.

However, the real purpose is making mention of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Those men living at the time of This Revelation, who have claimed the attainment of vigilance and introspection, they are of no weight whatsoever before God. The binding precepts of God are solely those that have been revealed in the Bayan. Fix not your gaze upon these kinds of names who lack any truth, inasmuch as the people who made such claims were shut out as by a veil from this Revelation. On the other hand, those who had never gazed upon these directions, even had not heard of the word vigilance and introspection, were saved by their recognition.

Take heed then and watch yourselves. And make mention of God in your heart and your manifest expressions, for ye would be tranquillised by the remembrance of God. Claim ye not that which will not profit you before your Lord in the Day of Resurrection, unless ye prostrate before Him Whom God shall make manifest, which is naught but prostrating before God. Fear Me then, O ye people of remembrance!

Gate Ten of the Ninth Unity

On the purification of the earth of the souls

The substance of this gate is this, that everything hath its own kind of purification according to the divine knowledge, and that all would be purified by the remembrance of God, should they recognise Him Whom God shall make manifest. As to the hearts, they would not be purified except through faith in the Three Letters, and the spirits except through faith in the Four Letters, and the souls except through faith in the Six Letters, and the essential bodies except through faith in the last Six Letters.

And all purification lieth in the declarative word of the divine unity, by whose help thou art empowered to purify these Signs of Unity (19) from the hellish signs in Their shadow. In like manner the same word enableth thee to witness affirmation and non-affirmation in all things, that thou would be able to purify them all.

For example, should the handkerchief in thy hand be the least spoiled, its purification would not be realised except through that which is destined in its own level. In like manner behold all things, from the sublime summit of existence till the last level of being, so that thou may not be veiled from the remedy of any affliction.

Know thou that in the Bayan purification is regarded as the most acceptable means for attaining nearness unto God and as the most meritorious of all deeds. Thus purge thou thine ear that thou mayest hear no mention besides God, and purge thine eye that it behold naught except God, and thy conscience that it perceive naught other than God, and thy tongue that it proclaim nothing but God, and thy hand to write naught but the words of God, and thy knowledge that it comprehend naught except God, and thy heart that it entertain no wish save God, and in like manner purge all thine acts and thy pursuits that thou mayest be nurtured in the paradise of pure love, and perchance mayest attain the presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest, adorned with a purity which He highly cherisheth, and be sanctified from whosoever hath turned away from Him and doth not support Him. Thus shalt thou manifest a purity that shall profit thee.

Know thou that every ear which hearkeneth unto His Words with true faith shall be immune from the fire. Thus the believer, through his recognition of Him will appreciate the transcendent character of His heavenly Words, will whole-heartedly choose Him over others, and will refuse to incline his affections towards those who disbelieve in Him. Whatever one gaineth in the life to come is but the fruit of this faith. Indeed any man whose eye gazeth upon His Words with true faith well deserveth Paradise; and one whose conscience beareth witness unto His Words with true faith shall abide in Paradise and attain the presence of God; and one whose tongue giveth utterance to His Words with true faith shall have his abode in Paradise, wherein he will be seized with ecstasy in praise and glorification of God, the Ever-Abiding, Whose revelations of glory never end and the reviving breaths of Whose holiness never fail. Every hand which setteth down His Words with true faith shall be filled by God, both in this world and in the next, with things that are highly prized; and every breast which committeth His Words to memory, God shall cause, if it were that of a believer, to be filled with His love; and every heart which cherisheth the love of His Words and manifesteth in itself the signs of true faith when His Name is mentioned, and exemplifieth the words, \`their hearts are thrilled with awe at the mention of God', that heart will become the object of the glances of divine favour and on the Day of Resurrection will be highly praised by God.

Know thou that the purification of thy soul is not merely this, that thou recitest the words that are revealed by God, inasmuch as the root beginning of thy faith is confirmed by the word "There is none other God but God", together with mentioning the Manifestations of the First Unity, and that of the Bayan. Yet the words other than the words of the sublime paradise pertaineth to the first letter of negation, who at the time of Revelation, regardeth himself to be one of the purifiers of the earth of the souls. Nay, rather, the meaning of purification of the souls is this, that thou must purge thyself from whatsoever that is for one other than God, and attain unto whatsoever that is for God.

Should the Revelation of the Bayan reach a stage in which there would be no longer any mention of being for the one other than God, then it would be permissible unto thee to recite not the words other than the words of the sublime paradise. Wert thou to desire to traverse throughout all thy life in the sea of pure love and the sublime paradise, thou wouldst possess sufficient provisions for thy journey. For should all the beings tread the path with only this single word "God is the Most Mighty", they would assuredly reach their destiny, which is naught but Him Whom God shall make manifest, inasmuch as he is the One Who is manifest in the manifestation of this word.

And know thou the negation of each Revelation entereth fire in the Next Revelation and not during the Revelation itself. For example, the negation of Gospel became manifest in the Revelation of the Qur'an, and the negation of the Qur'an in the Dispensation of the Bayan, universally and not empirically. Likewise, the negation of the Bayan will not be manifested except through the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, inasmuch as in that Day all shall claim to be amongst His letters of the affirmation, and wholly clear of those of negation. But 'well is it when the touchstone of test appeareth,' inasmuch as at that time all shall be purified in such wise that the heavens, the earth, and that which lieth between them, will all bow down before the majesty of such universal separation. Thou hast witnessed this in the Revelation of the Bayan, and shouldst thou be present in that Day, thou wouldst behold that all the fishes of the ocean of the Bayan owe their lives to that supreme invigorating Water, and yet they would be veiled from Him. Purify ye then your souls with the utmost of your true power.

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

Praise be to God Who hath sent down the Book unto His servant in truth, that it may be a radiant lamp unto all the worlds. This, verily, is the path of Ali which, in the Mother Book, hath been established as the straight and true path with thy Lord. Verily, in the Mother Book with Us it standeth transcendent, and upon the Most Great Truth it hath been, in the presence of the All-Merciful, rendered wise. This is the truth from God, and concerning the pure Faith it hath been inscribed in the Mother Book round about the Mount. This, verily, is the Truth, the Path of God in the heavens and on earth; whoso desireth, let him take unto God a way in truth. This, verily, is the true Faith, and God sufficeth as witness, and those endued with knowledge of the Book. This, verily, is the Truth of truths, concerning the Most Great Word from the Ancient of Days, and it hath been sent forth from around the Fire. This, verily, is the Mystery in the heavens and on earth, and concerning the wondrous Cause it hath been written down in truth by the hands of God, the Exalted, in the Mother Book.

God hath ordained that this Book should come forth as a commentary on the Best of Stories through Muhammad, son of Hasan, son of Ali, son of Muhammad, son of Ali, son of Musa, son of Jafar, son of Muhammad, son of Ali, son of Husayn, son of Ali, son of Abu Talib, unto His servant, that it may be an eloquent testimony from God, from the Remembrance, unto all the worlds. I bear witness, even as God beareth witness unto Himself, that He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and the angels and those possessed of knowledge stand firm round about the Remembrance in equity - there is no God but Him, and He is God, the All-Knowing of all things.

Verily, the pure Faith is this Remembrance preserved; whoso desireth Islam, let him submit his cause that God may inscribe him in the Book of the righteous as one wholly submitted, and concerning the pure Faith he shall be, in truth, praiseworthy. Whoso denieth Islam, God will not accept from him any of his deeds on the Day of Resurrection, not even the smallest thing of truth. And it is binding upon God that He should burn him with the novel Fire of God, through the decree of the Book, by the judgment of the Gate - an irrevocable doom. God is He besides Whom there is no God, and He is God, the All-Seeing of the believers. God is He besides Whom there is no God, and He is God, the Witness over the believers. God is He besides Whom there is no God, and He is God, the All-Knowing of the believers. God is He besides Whom there is no God, and He is God, Who encompasseth all the worlds.

Verily God will not accept any deed from anyone unless he comes to the Gate, bowing in prostration before God, the Ancient One, around the Gate, in a praiseworthy manner. God hath verily permitted thee according to the truth - therefore prostrate thyself and draw nigh, for verily the Fire is in the Point of Water, prostrating before God, the True One, on earth, witnessed by all.

O concourse of kings and sons of kings! Turn ye away from God's dominion, all of you, in accordance with the truth, in a seemly manner.

O King of the Muslims! After the Book, aid Our Most Great Remembrance in truth, for verily God hath ordained for thee and for those who circle round thee, on the Day of Resurrection, a station of questioning upon the Bridge, according to the truth.

O King! By God, the True One, if thou shouldst show enmity unto the Remembrance, God will verily judge thee on the Day of Resurrection among the kings with fire, and thou shalt find none other than God, the Most High, as a helper, according to the truth.

O King! Purify the Holy Land of those who reject the Book, before the day when the Remembrance shall come unto it suddenly, by God's leave, the Most High, with mighty and severe command.

Verily God hath prescribed for thee that thou shouldst submit to the Remembrance and His Cause, and conquer the lands by His leave in truth, for thou art shown mercy in this world's dominion, and in the next world thou shalt dwell among the people of the Garden of Good-Pleasure around the Holy Place.

O King! Let not sovereignty deceive thee, for every soul shall taste of death - this hath been written down as a decree from God according to the truth.

Be content with God's true judgment, for verily sovereignty in the Mother Book is inscribed by the hands of God concerning the station of the Remembrance, according to the truth.

Aid ye God with your souls and your swords under the shadow of this Most Great Remembrance, for this pure Faith, with strength according to the truth.

O Minister of the king! Fear God, besides Whom there is none other God, the True, the Just. Withdraw thyself from the king, for verily We shall inherit the earth and all that dwell thereon by God's leave, the All-Wise, and He is in truth a witness over thee and over the king. We have assured you by God's leave that if ye obey the Remembrance with pure sincerity, ye shall have in the Day of Resurrection a mighty kingdom in the Garden of Eden. And verily this kingdom of yours is vain - God hath made the goods of this world for the idolaters, but with God your Lord is a goodly return, which hath ever been established in truth upon the truth. And verily We have in the Garden of Eternity an exalted kingdom, which We bestow upon whomsoever We will among Our servants - upon those who have been, in this Cause, helpers of God and His signs in truth. O concourse of kings! Deliver Our verses to Turkey and to the land of India, swiftly and in truth upon truth, and to whatsoever lieth beyond their lands in the East and the West, powerfully and in truth upon truth.

O servants of the All-Merciful! God created you not, neither hath He provided for you, save for a mighty purpose which hath been established with God in the Mother Book in truth upon the truth. Follow what God hath revealed unto Us of the ordinances of the Gate in that Book, submitting unto God and His Command, content in truth. Know ye that if ye help God, He will help you on the Day of Resurrection through the Most Great Remembrance upon the Path, with a gracious help. By God! If ye do good, ye do it for your own selves, and if ye deny God and His signs, verily We through God can dispense with all creation and dominion, in truth. O people of the earth! Whoso obeyeth God's Remembrance and this His Book hath indeed obeyed God and His friends in truth, and shall be recorded in the hereafter as one of the people of the Garden of Good-Pleasure with God. Verily We have set in motion the mountains upon the earth and the stars upon the Throne round about the Fire in the Pole of Water by the leave of the Remembrance, through God, the Truth, and none among you hath power over another. He is the Almighty over His servants, and He is God, the Knower of all things.

Surih of the Divines

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful

Alif Lam Ra. These are the verses of the Clear Book. Alif Lam Mim. That Book is from God, the Truth, concerning the Remembrance, which hath in truth been sent down around the Fire. Verily We have made the verses in that Book clear, as a reminder and glad tidings to the servants of the All-Merciful who are faithful to God and His verses in truth - those who oppress not their parents but stand in awe of them in sincerity, according to a measure of the Book's knowledge, like a just sovereign who dealeth sternly with his kingdom; those who fear their Lord on a day whose evil hath been inscribed in the Mother Book. Verily We fear from the All-Merciful on a grim day whose name is recorded in the Mother Book - a day when no soul shall have power over anything for another, and the command that day shall be God's, the Most High, and God is witness over all things.

Verily We have made the verses a proof of Our Word unto you. Can ye produce a single letter like unto them? Bring your proof if ye can truly perceive God's truth. By God! Should humans and jinn combine to produce the like of one Surah of this Book, they would fail, even were they to assist one another.

O concourse of divines! Fear God in your opinions from this your day, for the Remembrance among you from Us is in truth a judge and witness. Turn away from that which ye take from other than God's Book of truth, for ye shall in truth be questioned at your station on the path on the Day of Resurrection. God hath made conjecture in all the Tablets a manifest sin. God may forgive you for what ye have earned for yourselves before this day - verily He is forgiving and merciful toward those who turn unto Him.

God hath forbidden you from making judgments contrary to truth and from exercising independent judgment without pure knowledge from this Book. We have sent down unto you this Book as a witnessed truth, that ye may know what God hath ordained regarding Our grace, from which ye were far removed without right. Verily ye shall have a station on the path on the Day of Resurrection where ye shall in truth be questioned. God will question His servants concerning what they do in God's religion without the judgment of truth concealed in that Book.

Soon will God show you the verses of the Remembrance suddenly upon the earth in manifest truth. O concourse of the People of the Book! Fear God and be not deceived by your knowledge, but follow the Book from the Remembrance in truth. By God, the Truth! No soul hath followed it but hath followed all the scriptures sent down from heaven from God, the Truth - and God is informed of what ye do. No soul hath denied the Book but hath denied the unity of the All-Merciful and disbelieved in the Prophets and scriptures sent down from heaven in truth. Such a one's abode shall be the Fire in truth, and God hath decreed this judgment in the Mother Book as an irrevocable truth.

Had God willed, He would have guided all mankind. God hath made Our verses clear to the worlds, and the Remembrance is truth from God in truth, and God hath power over all things. When people denied Our verses, they showed ingratitude to God, the Most High. Those who disbelieve shall learn of their place in a valley of Sijjin, which God hath named in the Mother Book as Hell. Verily, We shall cause you to taste of boiling water and subject you to the scorching fire, as decreed in the Book. This, indeed, is the truth from God - a recompense for your stubborn opposition to Our signs and the remembrance of God, the Most High. This is a fitting retribution for your wretchedness in relation to God and His signs. The command of your Lord, the All-Merciful, is truth itself, and God's promise shall be fulfilled in truth. Praise be to God Who hath sent down the light from His presence upon Our servant, that he might be a straight line of truth among the worlds. We reveal unto thee what God hath revealed unto Us; verily, thou art inscribed as exalted in the Mother Book with God. Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth in truth; He forgiveth whom He willeth and chastiseth whom He willeth, for God hath power over all things. Fear ye the Day when ye shall return unto God, when judgment belongeth to God alone. On that Day shall every soul receive what it hath earned, and We wrong not any thing by so much as the husk of a date-stone. The Remembrance hath believed in what was revealed unto him from his Lord, and the believers - all have believed in God and His signs, making no distinction between any of His signs. The submissive ones have truthfully said: "Our Lord! We have heard the call of God's Remembrance and have obeyed it. Forgive us, for Thou art the Truth, and unto Thee is the true return." O ye believers! We charge you in truth only with what ye are able to bear. Dominion belongeth to God alone. God desireth to lighten your burden and shower His mercy upon you. No soul acquireth aught but We have recorded what it hath acquired, preserved in the decree of the Book. Say: Our Lord is God, our Lord is the Truth, there is no God but Him. Forgive us through Thy mercy and have compassion upon us; verily, Thou art our Protector. Ordain for us our return unto Thee in truth, as a true destination. God, there is no God but He, hath created the letter Alif for His servant with commanding power. God, there is no God but He, hath ordained the letter Lam for His wisdom according to the decree of the Book. God, there is no God but He, hath made the letter Ra for the expansion of His Cause as He willeth in the Mother Book, decreed in truth around the Fire.

The Surah of Faith

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

Verily We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an that ye might understand. Ta Ha. God hath sent down the Qur'an unto His servant that men might know that God hath power over all things. He it is Who hath sent down the Criterion in Arabic, free from crookedness, unto His servant in pure truth as a revelation, that He might show you of His signs and the interpretation of utterances upon the straight path with unerring truth in wondrous wise. Verily this is an exalted path in the heavens and earth, established in wondrous truth by God, the Most High. He is God, there is no God but Him. He hath sent down unto thee this Book with the Most Great Remembrance, confirming the messengers and that which God revealed in the scriptures. There is no altering the remembrance of God, the Truth, and it is the truth in the Mother Book, concealed round about the Fire. If this Book were from other than God, the Truth, Who sent it down, they would find therein much discrepancy. Glory be to God our Lord! Nothing is hidden from Him in earth or heaven, and We have numbered all things in this Book by God's leave in hidden wise, and it hath been inscribed from God in truth. As for those who disbelieve in God's exalted Gate, We have prepared for them, by God's true decree, a grievous punishment. And He is God, the Mighty, the Wise. Verily We have sent down unto Our servant this Book from God in truth, and We have made its verses clear and unambiguous. None knoweth their interpretation save God and whom We will of His sincere servants. Ask ye the Remembrance concerning its interpretation, for He is, by God's grace, knowledgeable about His verses according to the Book's decree. Our Lord, we praise Thee after Thou hast guided us. Grant us from Thy presence of Thy mercy, for Thou art in truth the All-Powerful, the Bestower. Verily those who disbelieve in God's Most Great Remembrance, neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them aught besides God, the Truth, and they have no power besides God. These are the companions of the Fire by God's just decree, wherein they shall abide forever and ever. God aideth with His victory whomsoever He willeth of His servants. And We have made fair-seeming unto you, in your wrongdoing against God, the love of women and sons and wealth - yet all this is but the comfort of mortal life. God hath appointed a goodly return for those who aid God's Remembrance, the Most High, with their hands and tongues and wealth out of love for God, the Self-Sufficient. And He is God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. When the People of the Book dispute with thee about aught, say: I have no knowledge save what my Lord hath taught me. Verily I have submitted my face unto God, the Originator of the heavens and earth. And whoso is too proud to serve Him by turning away from My remembrance - it behooveth God to burn him with the Most Great Fire in truth, with justice deserved. And ye desire only what God desireth for you. Verily He is All-Knowing, All-Wise. The polytheists among you say: The Fire shall not touch us save for numbered days. But when We gather them on the Day of Resurrection around the Fire, they shall witness against themselves that their Lord's punishment was indeed foreordained in the Mother Book from the Gate's presence. Verily sovereignty belongeth unto God - He giveth sovereignty unto whom He willeth and withdraweth sovereignty from whom He willeth. And He is God, powerful over all things. Verily We abase the unbelievers as they wish and exalt the believers as they wish. God hath placed good in your hands in truth, and God hath made your hands in the Mother an upraised right hand. Verily in the innovation of night and day, and their interweaving, and the bringing forth of the living from the dead and the dead from the living are signs for the remembrance of God, the Most Great. Thus hath it been inscribed in the Preserved Tablet with God, the Most High.

O servants of the All-Merciful! Take not the unbelievers as friends in place of those who have precedence among the believers. Whoso meeteth God having disbelieved in the Book and this Our Remembrance shall find no protection from God, and the Truth Itself hath warned you, for unto God, the Truth, shall all worlds return.

If ye fear your Lord, the All-Merciful, concerning what your hands have wrought through Satan's doing, then hasten to forgiveness from your Lord before the Day when ye shall find your deeds presented before you. Verily God knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and earth in truth, and He is independent of all worlds.

O servants of God! The All-Merciful doth warn you to speak naught of God save the truth. He knoweth what ye conceal within yourselves and what ye reveal, and He is truly compassionate towards His servants with a true compassion.

O people! If ye believe in God alone, then follow Me in this Most Great Remembrance from your Lord, that God may forgive you your sins. Verily God hath ever been All-Forgiving, All-Merciful to the believers.

Verily We choose the Messengers through Our Word and We prefer some of their seed above others through the remembrance of God, the Great, according to the hidden decree of the Book. We have given thee authority over the Gates by God's leave, the All-Hearing, and He is witness over all things.

We breathed Our spirit upon Mary and accepted from the wife of Imran her vow unto God, the Most High. He is indeed aware of His believing servants. We gave glad tidings to the Prophet Zacharias of Our name Yahya (John), who would confirm the Word of God, the Most Great. This is from God, and We made him thereby a lord and chaste one in the Mother Book.

The likeness of creation before God is as the likeness of Our Command: when We will a thing, We but say unto it "Be!" and it is - thus recorded in God's Praised Book round about the Fire.

God hath taught thee knowledge of the Book from the Furqan, the Gospel, the Torah, the Psalms, and what lieth beyond them of the Scrolls. Thou wert stationed before thy Lord at the gate of the Point of the hidden letter B.

We have revealed unto thee tidings of the unseen and sent down unto thee this Book in truth. We have forbidden thee the unclean things and made lawful unto thee the good things, that people might believe in thy remembrance, hoping for the might of God's ancient Faith in truth. God is knowing of all things.

Those who imagine they can touch thee with any knowledge have fallen dead from heaven to earth, uprooted, and God is witness over all things.

God hath made thy essence touched by Our essences, and thy being radiant with light from the Ancient Being of God, our Lord. He is powerful over all things.

The polytheists plotted against themselves regarding thy remembrance, but they harm none save themselves. God hath fulfilled His covenant: "I shall purify thee and cause thee to die and raise thee unto God, the Truth." Thou shalt judge by God's leave on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein people differ about God's remembrance, the Most High. God is witness over all things.

When some of the city's people said "We are God's helpers," but when the Remembrance came to them suddenly, lo! they turned away from helping Us. Verily God is my Lord and your Lord, the Truth; therefore serve Him. And this is a straight path with thy Lord. Soon will God judge between the people with truth, then they shall find no difficulty within themselves concerning God's pure judgment, for the matter had already been decreed in the Mother Book. And when the matter reaches intensity, then dispute by God's leave with the idolaters and say: "Come, let us call upon our Lord, Who is none other than He, with our souls and your souls, for verily God is the Truth, a witness over us, and He is the One Who is informed of all things." By thy Lord! If thou wert to engage in mutual imprecation with the unbelievers, people would behold the horizon of heaven, and We would surely send down upon them, by God's leave, a thunderbolt of fire. Were it not for thy prayer, the earth and some who dwell thereon would have been consumed, for God hath power over all things. Say: O People of the Book! Come to a word common between us and you: that we shall worship none but Him, and that we shall not associate any partners with Him in His worship, and that we shall not take each other as lords besides God. Verily He is the One God, there is nothing like unto Him, and God is the Witness over all things.

We narrate unto thee the most excellent of stories through what We have revealed unto thee in this Quran, though before it thou wert among the heedless. O thou pure one! Verily We have set forth the stories for those who seek Us from before the Gate, loving and responsive. Verily We have sent down the Book with truth upon truth, that people may in this Book be inscribed under the name of the Remembrance. Verily We have sent down the Book to every nation in their tongue, and We have sent down this Book in the tongue of the Remembrance, with truth upon truth, wondrously. And verily it is the truth from God, and in the Mother Book according to the decree of the Book it hath been inscribed in most eloquent Arabic. And verily it is the most articulate among the most eloquent ones, and it is the Most Great Talisman in truth, and verily in the Mother Book it hath been inscribed as a mystic talisman. And verily We have made thee unto all worlds a brilliant sun and an illuminating moon and a chaste mortal and a mighty pillar unto all worlds, that perchance mankind might become, through God and His verses, with truth upon truth, a surety. But mankind were not with the verses of God, the Truth, upon truth, well-pleased. And mankind have been, concerning God and His verses, in other than truth, wondrous. O servants of God! Hath not Our servant shown you in truth a promise concerning what God intended for you in the upright religion, as was meet? And verily God hath made the verses Our verses, and according to the station of the Remembrance hath the decree of the Book been inscribed in the Mother Book, and this is one of them for him who hath from the All-Merciful a covenant upon his neck, with truth upon truth, straight. And he hath entered through that Gate by leave of God, the Praiseworthy, pure and unsullied. O people of the City! Ye are the ones who associate partners with your Lord if ye believed in Muhammad, the Apostle of God and Seal of the Prophets, and His Book the Furqan, unto which falsehood approacheth not. For verily We have sent down unto Our servant, by God's leave, this Book like unto it. If ye believe in it, then your belief in Muhammad and the Book aforetime was, in truth, recorded as a lie with God. And if ye disbelieve in it, then your disbelief in Muhammad and His Book, according to your own selves, was assuredly known with certainty, with truth upon truth. O people of the City and those Arabs who dwell round about! What aileth you, how have ye disbelieved in Muhammad after His passing, openly without truth? Did not God and His Prophet take from you a covenant regarding the successorship of His friend in many places of the earth, with truth upon truth? If ye believed in God, besides Whom there is no god, what aileth you, how do ye judge for yourselves other than what God revealed in His Book of truth aforetime preserved? By your Lord! If ye believe not in Our Remembrance and this Book, then be assured that your abode is the Fire, wherein ye shall abide forever. And ye shall have no helper besides God, the Most High, on the Day of Judgment. For some souls among you died in unbelief aforetime, and ye believed not in Muhammad, nor did those around you after His ascension, except that ye disbelieved in the successorship. What aileth you that ye ponder not the Quran with truth upon truth in its revelation? Verily God promiseth you Paradise, while Satan calleth you through your religion which leadeth you to Hell-fire. So let him who willeth among you believe, and let him who willeth disbelieve. And verily God is Independent of all worlds. And power belongeth unto God, the Mighty, from ancient times. O people of the City! Fear ye God against a day when ye shall avail yourselves naught.

Verily, power belongeth unto God, the Mighty, from time immemorial. O people of the City! Fear God on the day when ye shall have no power over anything, and Our decree hath been inscribed in truth, by the truth. What aileth you that ye have disbelieved in God, your Creator, besides Whom there is none other God - He Who created you and sustained you through His bounty, and Who hath ever been, in truth, your witness? Do ye not ponder over the Qur'an in its revelation? Do ye not reflect upon the Furqan in its interpretation? Fear ye God, from Our stern grasp of truth. If ye persist in your ways and return not unto the remembrance of God, the Most High, in truth, upon truth, and soon - God will show you in the Day of Resurrection a fire that shall encompass your souls; on that day ye shall find no helper besides God, the Most High. Do ye feel secure apart from God, the Truth, in two souls, when God encompasseth all things? O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Strike then upon the people of the City a striking about the two examples regarding the two souls. God hath ordained for one of them two gardens of trees raised high around the Gate. One of them watereth the two pools, and the other drinketh water from the two cups, and they were both, by God's leave, stationed around the fire in the two waters. And for the other were two rivers in the land of the two wests, and he had walls in one of the two gulfs. And he said to his companion, the first one: "Which of you two is right concerning the latter matter?" "Indeed, I do not believe the Truth will remain established in these two hours." Thus he persisted in disbelief with certainty, against his own soul and the two souls after him. By God, the Truth, judge ye fairly - which of the two souls among the two parties was praiseworthy around the fire? Verily the Truth made known to him in the Sacred Mosque the vision of justice concerning the Most Great Truth. "Dost thou disbelieve in Him Who created thee from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then fashioned thee into a man with limits?" O people of polytheism! Why do ye set up for yourselves another gate besides the Gate? By God, the Truth, your abode shall be the fire, by the decree of the Book, condemned and forsaken.

Surih of Joseph. In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.

When Joseph said to his father: "O father! I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon, I saw them bowing down before me." Indeed, We showed him in that vision a great station. And verily We do relate unto thee of the tidings of the unseen from the preserved Book of God as witnessed. And when We found him to be of Our sincere followers, God clothed him with the likeness of Our Beauty as a luminous shadow. Not at all, not at all did God intend anything in the heart of the Book besides Us as beautiful truth. The All-Merciful intended by the mention of Joseph the very soul of the Prophet and fruit of the Virgin, Husayn son of Ali son of Abu Talib, as witnessed. God showed him above the Throne in the consciousness of the heart that the sun and moon and stars were bowing before him to God, the Truth, as witnessed. When Husayn said to his father one day: "I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon, I saw them encompassing me, prostrating to God, the Ancient, in truth." God, besides Whom there is no god, speaks the most truthful words with truth in wondrous wise. Perchance the people were patient with the signs of their Lord in truth. Praise be to God Who interpreted Husayn's vision in truth in the land of the heart around the Truth as witnessed. And verily God ordained his martyrdom through the testimony of Unity by Himself from Himself in truth, accepted. For God made him witness by Himself the testimony of Unity from Himself in truth as witnessed. The All-Wise informed of the mystery of his vision in what was revealed in the Qur'an to His Beloved as a hidden truth. Verily the Qur'an of dawn was witnessed. And the stars of the Throne in God's Book prostrated for the slaying of Husayn in truth, and their number in the Mother Book was one and twenty. He is God Who made Unity in the realities of things from His rays in truth, willingly or unwillingly. And He is the One Who created the letters by Himself in truth as a symbol. And He is the One Who ordained the letters of the Divine Identity for His Oneness upon the Most Great Truth as one and twenty. And He is the One Who made the Imams the Word of Unity in writing as a line. And He is the One Who decreed the prostration of the sun and moon and stars in the Mother Book as written in the decree of the Book. God, besides Whom there is no god, your True Master, was the most truthful of speakers in utterance. And verily God intended by the sun Fatimah, and by the moon Muhammad, and by the stars the Imams of Truth, known in the Mother Book. They are the ones who weep for Joseph by God's leave, prostrating and standing. And the people weep like passing shadows for Husayn by leave of God, the Truth, prostrating equally. And whoever prostrates to other than the All-Merciful or associates anything with God in worship, it is right for God to make him enter the Fire, abiding forever. This is the truth, a recompense from your Lord for your being obstinate towards Our signs. God, besides Whom there is no god, is the Truth, and God was the Lord of the worlds, worshipped in truth. And in the origination of the signs and the hours and the souls and the horizons are signs for those of understanding among you who are witness to the remembrance of God, the Most High. Fear God and speak not concerning the Most Great Remembrance of God anything besides God, for verily We have taken His Covenant from every prophet and his people through His remembrance.

In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

Say nothing in remembrance of the Most Great Remembrance of God except through God, for verily We have taken His covenant from every Prophet and His people regarding His remembrance, and We send not the Messengers save with this firm covenant. We judge not with truth concerning anything except after His covenant regarding this Most Great Gate. God shall soon remove the veil from your insight at the appointed time; then shall ye look upon the Remembrance of God, the Most High, with intensity.

The idolaters shall say: "Verily, we have wronged ourselves after God had warned us in His Book." And on that Day ye shall be stationed in the heart of the Fire. There shall ye find no escape, and when ye ask the Master for water, He will cause you to taste water in the pure Fire - heat upon heat - and water from the essence of Zaqqum. When ye drink but a drop thereof, your limbs shall be torn from your bodies, and ye shall wish for death, but God hath not ordained this for you save as recompense for your having associated partners with God in this world. Verily God encompasseth all things.

As for those who fulfill God's covenant and purchase not any of the verses for a paltry price - these are guided by God's Remembrance, the Most High, and these are truly the companions of Paradise in God's Book, and thus hath it been inscribed in the Mother Book. These are they who believe in God and His verses with pure and sincere truth. God shall soon reward them on the Day of Resurrection with a double portion and a goodly final abode, elevated in truth upon truth. This, verily, is the truth from your Lord, an abundant recompense. This, verily, is Paradise, which God hath ordained as reward for your deeds, for that which ye performed in God's true religion, praiseworthy in truth upon truth.

Do ye imagine that other than this Our Remembrance is the truth from God when it is not from God in truth? Or do ye utter falsehood concerning God? What aileth you, that ye deny God, the Praiseworthy, so openly and repeatedly?

The Surah of Testimony

He said: "O My son! Do not recount your vision to your brethren lest they devise a plot against you. Verily Satan is a manifest enemy to man." Yesterday mention was made of the mercy of thy Lord unto His servant Ali. Verily We have sent down the Book unto Our servant that men might become witnesses to the remembrance of God, the Most High, in this Gate. God desireth naught from His servants in this Day save His true decree as revelation. If ye love God, follow Him and God will love you. The recompense of the Greatest Remembrance of God hath been inscribed in His Book by the hands of truth. Whoso performeth an atom's weight of good, We shall surely recompense him on the Day of Resurrection with a bountiful reward based on truth through truth. And whoso performeth an atom's weight of evil, We shall cause him to taste, by God's leave, the fire which God, the Ancient of Days, hath named 'scorching heat' in the Mother Book.

And when Ali said: "O My son! Tell not thy brethren what God hath shown thee of thy affair, out of mercy for their souls and patience for God, the Most High, in truth - and He is God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. If thou shouldst tell them somewhat of thy affair which God hath decreed for thee, they would devise a plot against thee, sacrificing themselves in God's love instead of thee as witnesses. God hath willed as He hath willed that thy face be reddened with thy blood upon the earth, truly dyed with truth. God hath willed as He hath willed to show thee thy hair dyed with thy blood and thy soul unjustly slain upon the earth before the truth, and thy body naked upon the earth. God hath willed as He hath willed that thy daughters and womenfolk be seen as captives in the hands of the unbelievers contrary to justice. God hath willed as He hath willed that the faces of thy followers be seen reddened before thee with the blood of their souls, and their bodies wounded and cast upon the earth unjustly.

Therefore reveal not a word of what God hath ordained in thy being of the most hidden secret of the testimony of Oneness unto thyself. For if thou shouldst inform them of thy hidden affair, even a little in truth, they would sacrifice themselves for the love of God instead of thee in their longing for God - and God is truly kind to His servants in truth. God, there is no god but He, most truthfully and wondrously relateth. Perchance the people were praising and thanking their Lord, the Most Merciful, for His signs in the paths of the Gate in truth.

Indeed, Joseph's brethren learned a word of the secret of his affair - a secret veiled and enshrouded in mystery. Thus have the traditions of the Prophets and martyrs run their course in being slain in His path, and God is witness to all things in truth. Satan's unbelief after the slaying of Joseph hath passed, and by that deed he was accursed before the Most Merciful and His chosen ones and in all the tablets in very truth. After his unbelief he devised a grievous plot against the Most Great Word contrary to truth. God shall soon dispel his plot and cast him into seas of darkness, wave upon wave, in dire punishment. Those who have wronged Us shall know that they cannot outstrip Us by a single letter in the knowledge of the Book, for We encompass all beings through God, the Most High, in very truth.

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

Verily God hath reckoned thee in the Mother Book among the Hidden Five, a mystery most mysteriously concealed. God hath taught thee knowledge which none before thee hath comprehended, and We have taught thee knowledge of creation from the All-Merciful, uniquely fashioned. That which God willeth not shall never come to pass, and naught existed in thy Lord's knowledge. God hath uttered truth with truth as a discourse. Did We not make a covenant with you, O servants of God, in Our true covenant with truth upon truth - a weighty covenant - that ye should speak naught concerning God save the truth, with the Most Great Truth, in confirmation and submission? And We took from you in the realm of the atoms a binding covenant, out of love for Our followers, from One Who is wondrous in truth. And the Command was, from God's presence, magnificent. God hath ordained for you in this Book a matter by the Most Great Truth as obligatory. Yet the people were heedless and in discord regarding this Most Great Gate of Our mighty Cause contrary to truth, and He is God, the Most High, the Great. God is independent of you, and He is God, the All-Encompassing. Have not the servants of God conveyed to you Our remembrance with truth by truth from Our mighty Cause repeatedly? O people of the earth! Fear God regarding this Leaf detached from the Divine Lote-Tree, for this is truth itself, just as God and His chosen ones are truth itself, and God is witness over all things. God hath decreed for His servants that they worship none but Him around the Gate, and this is the pure religion upon the straight path, a beneficence.

The Surah of Visitation

Thus does thy Lord choose thee and teach thee the interpretation of sayings and perfect His favor upon thee and upon the family of Jacob, even as He perfected it upon thy forefathers Abraham and Isaac. Verily thy Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing. Ta Sin. God hath sent down the Criterion unto Our Remembrance that He might be unto all worlds a bearer of glad tidings and upon the Straight Path a warner. We have, of a truth, perfected Our favor upon the dwellers of the heavens and earth through the bounty of the Remembrance, in truth, as a blessing. God hath made the supreme blessing in this your Day to be the remembrance of God, the Most High, and God is witness over all things. Thus have We chosen thee in truth and taught thee from the interpretation of the Book that which beseemeth none besides thee. Thou wert indeed foremost in answering God, the Most High, at the gates, in truth upon truth, renowned. God chose Husayn from among His servants and made him in truth, by the truth, an Imam and martyr. He surpassed his brethren in the knowledge of the All-Merciful by a convincing letter concerning the mystery of what was hidden in the concealed line of the hidden secret. God perfected His favor upon Husayn and his successors by making their excellence like unto His own excellence, in truth over all the worlds together. He it is Who accepteth from his visitor through the true visitation of Himself, and Who hath called unto his place of martyrdom in truth by His throne - there is no God but He - without similitude in truth, and God hath not ordained for his mystery any interpretation upon a single letter. He it is Who hath promised His visitor the meeting with Himself, and God's promise was in truth, upon truth, fulfilled. He it is Who hath ordained the fourfold in the fourfold from the paths of visitation in the visitation, in truth upon truth, and the matter in the Mother Book was decreed around the Fire. He it is Who chose for Joseph a letter from the mystery and for his parents before him a letter from the line hidden around the mystery. He it is Who was, and there was naught else besides Him mentioned in truth upon truth. He is the Ever-Existing Who hath never ceased to be, nor shall there be in His rank anything existing in truth upon truth. He it is Who hath taught thee from the interpretation of sayings as thou didst wish, as We wished, in truth upon truth from the truth, wondrously. He it is Who hath raised geometry from that Gate in honor of the Gate, and God hath power over all things. Follow, then, what God hath sent down unto you in truth concerning the station of the Remembrance, openly through the Most Great Truth and upon the Most Mighty Truth secretly. We desire for your souls naught save the Garden of Eden existing in truth around the Ridvan. By your Lord the Truth! We desire from you no recompense for the Most Great Gate nor gratitude upon the truth, save patience and powerlessness before God, the Most High, and He is God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The lands have been filled with the outpouring of your Lord, the All-Merciful, in bounty. We have aided you even as We began you, and We read not in the Book of God save your denial of Our signs from the presence of the Remembrance, repeatedly. What aileth you that ye remember not within yourselves a remembrance from God, the Truth, even a little? How can ye deny God when ye were dead, knowing naught from the knowledge of the Book in truth upon truth?

Ye were as dead, knowing naught of the knowledge of the Book in truth and through truth. He it is Who created you, then sustained you, then causeth you to die, then giveth you life as He willeth. The Most Great Word is from God. Fear ye not the Day when no master shall avail his master in aught, and the Kingdom on that Day shall belong in truth to the All-Merciful and to the family of God and their true followers, as hath been inscribed in the Mother Book.

On the Day when the Spirit and the angels shall stand in ranks around the Remembrance, by God's leave, in extended array. None shall enter Paradise save he who beareth in his neck a mighty covenant from God. They who have uttered evil words untruthfully have indeed disbelieved through delusion. None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian - by God, such are their vain imaginings, and the decree hath been known in the Mother Book.

Soon shall they encounter from the All-Merciful a command that standeth as a witness to the truth. These shall neither have power nor ability to profit or harm themselves apart from the Remembrance, save him whom the All-Merciful permitteth and who speaketh, by leave of Our presence, a word of truth as a recompense. Do men imagine that We were far removed from creation?

Nay! On the Day when We shall bare the leg, that men may behold the All-Merciful and His Remembrance nigh at hand in the gathering place, then shall they say: "Would that we had chosen a way with the Gate! Would that we had not chosen, instead of the Gate, men who were not upon the truth as a refuge! Indeed the Remembrance came unto us from before us and from behind us and from our left hand, yet were we veiled from Him."

This is the Surah of Unity. In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.

In truth, in Joseph and his brethren there were signs for those who inquire. All praise be to God Who hath exalted His verses in His glorious Book, and He is God, the Ever-Watchful over all things. Verily We have made clear the verses in that Book for those possessed of hearts among the people of understanding, who have been found standing alone around the Gate. God hath indeed exalted Joseph through Our name, and God hath made him in the Book a guardian, stationed around the Fire. God hath made Joseph and his brethren the Word of Unity, and the All-Merciful hath ordained them as twelve letters, and this Word hath been inscribed in the Mother Book with thy Lord, written in the Line around the Line. God hath distinguished Joseph with the letter Ha as a recompense for his steadfastness before the All-Merciful on the appointed Day, standing alone upon the earth in truth with the truth. God hath made Unity for those who seek at Our gate and for those who stand in the depths of Oneness by Our leave, who have been upright around the Gate in truth. God, there is no God but He, the Truth, and He is God Who hath ever been worshipped in truth with the truth. Fear ye God, O servants, concerning a Day wherein ye shall, by God's leave, the Most High, be questioned around the Fire. No word doth escape you but that angels from Us are present by the leave of the Remembrance as witnesses, and Our servant hath never been hidden from the sincere servants of God. God hath appointed the Day of Resurrection for you as a time of justice. Verily on the Day of Judgment the Balance shall be set up by God's leave before Us with perfect truth and upon the straight and balanced Line. Soon will He inform you on that Day concerning what ye have been doing in God's religion, openly and secretly. O servants of God! Did We not make with you in Our Word a clear covenant in truth with the truth, that ye should not speak vainly concerning Our servant? \[...\]

By the Lord of heaven and earth! He is verily the Truth from Our presence, and We have assuredly taken Our covenant, by God's leave, with all the peoples, lest anyone should say: "Had God sent unto us a messenger during the absence of His Remnant, we would surely have followed him and would have been guided by his decree unto the Truth."

Fear ye God, O servants, concerning the Day when the decree of the Book hath been ordained as conclusive in the Mother Book. Why do ye entertain false imaginings regarding the Most Great Remembrance of God and Our Word? By your Lord, the Truth! Ye comprehend not a single letter of that which God hath taught Him in the Mother Book, by the Truth, from His presence, from time immemorial.

Remember ye the remembrance of your Lord, the All-Merciful, at the two ends of the day and in the watches of the night, even as God hath commanded you aforetime in His Book, and the decree of God hath been ordained as conclusive in the Mother Book.

\[Surih of the Mystery\]

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

When they said that Joseph and his brother were dearer to their father than they were - though they were a group - verily their father was in manifest error. God hath indeed sent down the Book wherein is the explanation of all things, as a mercy and glad tidings to Our servants who possess insight into the knowledge of the Book through the remembrance of God, the Most High, in truth. When they spoke the letters of "There is no God but God" and said that Joseph was dearer to their father than they were - this was by virtue of what had preceded in God's knowledge as a letter concealed in mystery, veiled by mystery, hidden in the line, absent in the secret of secrets, transcendent above what was in their hands and the hands of all the worlds. And verily we were in truth a group regarding what God intended concerning Joseph the Prophet, Muhammad the Arab, written around the line. And verily God preferred their father through His grace, and God ordained the secret of secrets from the mystery of His Command, through what was in the hands of the worlds, as a clear revelation unto the people of fire from the mystery of the letter Ba - an error. The All-Merciful on the throne is established, and He is God who hath power over all things. Verily God created all things through His power, in truth by truth as a creation, and He is the One who originated the heavens and earth and what lieth between them by His command, in truth from around the fire as an innovation, that people might know that God's Command hath existed in the Mother Book in truth by truth from around the fire. And He is God who watcheth over all things through His power. And He is God who encompasseth all things. And He is God who hath intended in the most hidden mystery, upon the mystery of the line, at the Point of the Gate, an interpretation. And He is the One who hath made the choosing from the Gate for the Heights to be witnessed in truth by truth. O servants of the Most Merciful! Shake toward yourselves the trunk of this palm tree by the leave of God, your True Lord, which God hath made in the Mother Book to be exalted in truth by truth from the truth. And He is the One who causeth to fall from His presence unto your souls fresh dates, truly and newly plucked. We have indeed made reference to His remembrance before the Most Merciful on a day that was ancient in the Mother Book. And on that day ye were not forgotten in the Book, nor around the fire neglected. And say not "How can one speak on God's behalf who is but twenty-five years old in truth by truth?" Hear then, by the Lord of heaven and earth, I am indeed God's servant. He hath given me clear proofs from the presence of the Remnant of God, your Expected One. This is My Book which hath been inscribed with God in the Mother Book in truth upon truth. God hath made me blessed wherever I may be, and hath enjoined upon me prayer and patience so long as I remain among you alive upon the earth. And those who make claims about God based on certain traditions concerning the Gate, against the Gate, deviating slightly from the truth - are they able to produce the like of this Book from God, the True One, witnessed in truth upon truth? The Truth by truth declareth: There is no God but God, alone with no partner. None is like unto Him, neither peer nor similitude. And He is God who hath ever been ancient in truth upon truth. Were humans and jinn to gather together to produce the like of this Book in truth, they would never be able, even if they had all the people of earth and their like besides as helpers. By thy True Lord! They shall never be able to produce the like of even a portion of its letters, nor of its interpretations from some of the mystery, even as much as the film of a date-stone. Verily God hath sent it down through His power from His presence \[...\]

Verily God hath sent it down through His power from His presence, and men are unable to produce its like, even as similitude unto similitude, let alone as a likeness. This is of the tidings of the unseen which We reveal unto thee. Verily thou wert, by God the All-Praised, in the precincts of the Fire, praised. And verily thy Lord shall bestow upon thee on the Day of Resurrection the decree of truth upon all, from His presence, according to truth, by the truth, exalted. Cause whomsoever thou willest to enter into God's mercy, and turn away from the peoples round about Hell, and leave them in the Fire, upon the truth, prostrate. Do ye believe in part of the Book and disbelieve in part? Hath God given you leave for this, or do ye fabricate falsehood against God, inasmuch as ye have been, through Satan's knowledge, apart from truth, contrary to truth, by the truth, deluded? Verily We have sent down the Remembrance, and God and His angels were thy guardians, by the truth. Fear God, O servants of God, and be in God's religion sincere, upon the truth, a witness. Verily they who fear their Lord in secret - they were before the All-Merciful and His friends, upon the truth, by the truth, in the precincts of the Gate, pure. God shall soon teach them their ordinances whereof they have need for themselves, openly, from the truth unto the truth, nigh. Verily God hath revealed unto me: If ye love God, then follow me in this religion, by the truth, upon the truth, from the truth unto creation, upright. And verily your Lord God hath said in truth: Verily I have been, unto My believing servants from the people of the Gate, upon the truth, by the truth, merciful. And exalted be God above what the wrongdoers say concerning the verses of the Gate, with great exaltation. Say: The Cause of God hath come; hasten it not, for verily the Cause of God hath been, upon the truth, by the truth, nigh. And verily God's promise hath been, by the truth, fulfilled.

The Surah of the Cloud

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

Slay Joseph or cast him into the earth so that your father's countenance may become free for you and ye may be a righteous people thereafter. This is the Most Great Remembrance of God in the mention of our Lord, the Exalted, the Praiseworthy. Glorified be He Who hath sent down the Book as He willeth through what He willeth, and He is God, powerful over all things. When Thou didst will, it was but as We willed, and God is witness over all things. Verily We bestowed Our favor upon Joseph and his brethren with clear signs from the mystery of that Mighty Gate. When they said: "Conceal the sign of Joseph whom God hath placed among you that ye might be men of truth and power in the earth," or "Cast him into the land of oneness that your father's countenance may be freed for you, and that ye may become thereafter a people pure in sovereignty through the hidden secret." He it is Who hath manifested among you a soul from among yourselves, and verily We made him a noble human being of truth. Verily We made the heavens and the earth as signs for Our servant, and God is witness over all things. God will soon show you His signs in the seat of truth, with truth from Us, mighty signs indeed. Verily We have sent down the verses in the scrolls, and God is, in truth, knowing of His signs and the Remembrance. Verily We have shown you God's signs in the horizons and in yourselves that ye may testify that He is the Truth, and God hath made the path for those who, at their Lord's gate, shall in truth be questioned. God hath sent down this Book upon His servant that he may be, by Our leave, a witness over all worlds in truth. Verily We have encompassed in this Book all that God hath sent down unto the Prophets and the truthful ones in all the tablets, all in very truth. We have withheld from Our decree concerning you according to what ye have neglected from God's Book, a letter deeply hidden in concealed mystery. The people have denied what they had not outstripped Us in regarding obedience to the Merciful, and God is witness over all things and over the truth. Soon shall We manifest Our servant unto you in a cloud of light, for those who await God's true Remembrance morning and evening. These are they whom God hath made clear-sighted in His pure religion and steadfast on the straight path. Among the people are those who say "We believe in God and His Most Great Remembrance," and God is ever cognizant of His servants in truth. They have disbelieved with their tongues after their souls were convinced, and God hath taught them within their own souls that they are fresh disbelievers in God, the Exalted. Soon shall the fire and its rocks encompass them in the valley of Hell by leave of God, the Exalted, and nigh. This is your recompense from God for having been hypocrites in God's true religion, and God is witness over what ye do. O people! Hath not the news come to you of those before you? And I warned you of the severe chastisement of the Merciful in very truth. Did He not promise you from God a garden whose breadth is as the breadth of heaven and earth, prepared for Our servants who believe in the Remembrance of God, the Exalted, and are pure in truth upon truth? Therein shall ye have what your souls desire, by Our leave, in truth - fresh bounties. Glorified be He besides Whom there is no God, the Lord, like unto Whom there is nothing.

He was, in truth, upon the truth, pure and unsullied. Therein shall ye find, by Our leave, whatsoever your souls desire - in truth, upon the truth, fresh and pleasing bounties. Glorified be He besides Whom there is none other God, the Lord. Naught is there that resembleth Him, and He was, in truth, upon the truth, the One Worshipped. We, verily, have warned you, by God's leave, of a Remembrance from which ye were, contrary to truth, debarred. O people! Turn ye towards the Remembrance of God, the Truth, enquiring about the Gate, and unto God, the Truth, upon the truth, penitently returning. By the Lord of heaven! God hath ordained your provision in this heaven - in truth, upon the truth - a measured portion sent down. Why do ye not emerge from your vain imaginings after the Truth hath come unto you from God, the Most High, the Great? He it is Who hath ordained the sun for light and the moon for radiance that ye may seek of His bounty the goods of this life - in truth, upon the truth - in praiseworthy fashion. God hath ordained the abode of the hereafter for those who desire God and His servant upon the paths of the Straight Line round about the Fire, extended. Know ye, O servants of God, that your Lord, God, the Truth, hath perfected His proof against you according as ye were, in truth, upon the truth, watchful of God and His signs. The true believers are they who desire naught within themselves save the All-Merciful and His Remembrance - in truth, upon the truth - as their Beloved. Verily the Mystery of the Glorious One hath come unto you in your secret thoughts and open declarations from God, for this mighty and wondrous Cause. God shall teach you concerning His Cause that which none before Him hath ever comprehended - in truth, upon the truth - with full knowledge. He it is Who hath sent down from heaven blessed water upon the earth, pure and purifying. And He it is Who hath created from water a mortal and made him kindred by blood, and in truth, upon the truth, patient.

The Surah of the Line

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.

Said one among them: "Slay not Joseph, but cast him into the depths of the pit; some traveller will find him, if ye must do some deed."

Praise be to God Who hath created the heavens and the earth in truth, layer upon layer, that mankind might know that their Lord, the All-Merciful, is verily the Truth, and that God hath power over all things. He it is Who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clot, then from a morsel of flesh, then brought you forth as another creation. Blessed be God, the Best of creators, the All-Wise. He it is Who guardeth you in three veils of darkness and bringeth you forth from your mothers' wombs when ye know naught of the knowledge of the Book save a little portion.

Turn ye unto your Creator and slay your souls in the path of God, the Truth, in humility before God, the Most High, for God is mighty and praiseworthy. He it is Who hath sent down these verses from His presence in truth as glad tidings to all the believers. He is God, the Worshipped One, there is no God but Him, in truth, and God hath knowledge of all things.

He it is Who giveth you glad tidings of His servant's name in truth, by the truth, and verily in the Mother Book with God he is exalted and wise in truth. He it is before whom God hath appointed none to share the mystery of His name, in truth, by the truth. God indeed saluted him on the day of his birth, the day of his mission, and the day of his gathering on the land of the heart, among those around the Fire, in truth, upon the truth, alone.

This is the Mystery of mysteries from the presence of the Wondrous One, besides Whom there is no God, the Most High, and God hath power over all things. God hath indeed ordained the Cause in the Gate through His power, and the decree in the Mother Book around the Fire hath been accomplished. We have indeed made thee the Greatest Sign by God's leave, the Truth, and God is witness over all things. Thou art the Mighty Announcement in truth, witnessed around the Fire.

We have forbidden you from mentioning the Gate by leave of God, your Lord, the Truth, from that which ye uttered untruthfully with grievous crying. On the day We roll up the heaven with Our hands, the matter hath been decreed in truth, and the furnace shall boil by God's leave, the Truth, and God hath power over all things. Then shall ye know of Our Cause that from which ye were far removed in untruth.

On that day shall the believers rejoice by leave of God, the Most High, drawing nigh. Soon shall the believers from the people of the Gate receive glad tidings through what God hath given them of the Spirit, and the Spirit in the Mother Book was around the water as fragrance. God hath indeed appointed for you this Day on the land of the Path, upon the bridge over the Fire, as a fixed time.

When said one of Joseph's brethren - and he was Hassan, son of Ali, who in the Mother Book was around the Fire with the Ancient Fire, greatly - "Slay not Joseph, but cast him into the depths of the pit of Oneness, concealed around the Fire." God desired from the pit the water hidden in the air of the hidden mystery, upon the mystery, in the Mother Book, inscribed around the line. The people know not what Joseph's brethren did for God regarding Joseph, the Most High, who in truth is witness. God hath indeed ordained for Joseph wayfarers from Gate to Gate, according to the decree of the Book, concealed around the Fire.\[...\]

Verily God hath ordained for Joseph a journey from Gate to Gate according to the decree of the Book around the Fire, concealed. And God hath made the pilgrims to Husayn a caravan unto the Sacred Precinct, save by leave of God, the Most High (and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise). They who journey from the Gate unto God in the depths of Oneness, upon the truth with the truth, in the precincts of the Gate, alone - these have found Husayn upon the edge of the hidden mystery, with truth, in the depths of the well, witnessed. These are they who journey in the Mother Book through the mention of the Mystery around the Fire, with truth upon truth, inscribed. Verily God created Joseph and his brethren in the realms of holiness from a sprinkling upon a name from the drop of creation, from that water brought into being. When We found in Joseph love for the Most Great Remembrance, We clothed him, by God's leave, in the garments of prophethood, according to what was decreed for him in the Mother Book around the Fire. We have never been far removed from creation. We relate unto the servants that Command from which the people have been, in truth, turned away. God hath desired in this your Day this Most Great Word, this One Who speaketh from God, with truth upon truth, wondrous. When the people believed not in God and His signs according to truth, We preserved him in the depths of the well around the Fire, concealed. God hath ordained that some wayfarers from among you should find him - those who were, in the Mother Book, with truth upon truth, foremost in responding to the Gate around the water, praised. This is a decree from God with truth unto creation, and the decree was in the Mother Book ordained. Verily God hath made you submissive in His religion, if ye be, in God and His signs, with truth upon truth, in that patient.

They said: "O our father! Why dost thou not trust us with Joseph, seeing that we are indeed his sincere well-wishers?" Remember God, the Most High, Who was in truth speaking and witnessed around the Fire in the Mother Book. God hath revealed unto me: "Verily, I am God, there is no God but Me. I have ordained the excellence of the Remembrance as My excellence over all the worlds. We have ordained for the believers, by God's leave, gardens from among the Gardens in the land of Ridvan, surrounding the House in ranks. And We have made Hell to encompass the unbelievers, according to the decree of the Book. By your Lord, the Truth! We have transformed the bodies of the unbelievers into forms unlike their own in the depths of the Fire's coffin, by leave of the Ancient God - a transformation in requital for what their hands have wrought, for they were ungrateful to God and His exalted signs before the Gate. Do ye feel secure against God's Self, the Most High, finding in truth a place of return? God hath made manifest thy signs to the peoples of earth and heaven, all together through the Gate. None believe in God and His signs in truth except a few of the foremost believers among the people of the Gate. Most people have been decreed by the All-Merciful's leave to be among those who join partners with their True Lord. None believe in God and His pure Remembrance except very few of the earliest ones. We have made thee a support for the servants and a mighty bulwark for the lands, by leave of the Ancient God. By God, the Truth! None among the believing men and women will follow thee except those who bear in their necks God's covenant and Our covenant, with pure and unsullied faith. God, there is no God but He - commit thy purpose unto God, for He is the Truth and God hath power over all things. He is the Truth, there is no God but He, the Lord of the mighty Resurrection. God offered Our authority to the heavens, earth and mountains; they refused to bear it and were afraid of it. But man - God's Great Remembrance, this Ali - undertook it. Thus in God's preserved Book he was recorded as one apparently unjust, and among people who knew him not he was recorded as one apparently ignorant. God hath made clear His mystery between the lines at the Point of Fire, but none remember save those who come eagerly to the Remembrance before the Gate, seeking God the All-Praised - and God is witness over all things. He it is Who hath originated thy true self as the manifestation of Our grandeur, according to the knowledge and decree of the Book. We have made thee wise in the Mother Book before God, the Most High. God hath made thee the manifestation of Our attributes in truth, without qualification or limitation - and God hath power over all things. God hath concealed His servant's mystery in the Fire's pole within this Book, as God ordained in the knowledge of the Unseen from His most hidden mystery, inscribed upon the line around the veil. Soon will the All-Merciful grant you a mighty reward for concealing Our Cause in truth. When Joseph's brothers said to their father at the great assembly: "Why dost thou not teach us Joseph's knowledge \[...\]"

Allah hath veiled His servant's secret in the heart of the Fire within this Book, according to what God hath ordained in His hidden knowledge - a secret inscribed around the veil in concealment. Soon will the All-Merciful reward you abundantly for keeping Our Cause hidden, in truth and by the truth. When Joseph's brothers said to their father in that most great scene: "Why dost thou not teach us Joseph's knowledge, for verily we are witnesses before God, the Self-Subsisting?" And God is witness over all things.

Verily God hath made Us a witness to Husayn through the hidden secret of Oneness around the Fire. God hath spoken of this verse concerning the decree of the Most High and His sons, according to the decree of the concealed Oneness in the cloud of the hidden Essence, in the secret of the Eternal Throne radiating from the Ancient Light, according to the decree of Divine Unity inscribed around the water.

The people disbelieved in God after Husayn arose in the land of Taff, proclaiming from the station of love, detached from all save God, the Ancient One. And God is knowing of all things. The people turned away from God and from the rewards of the twin Paradises, accursed with Satan's unbelief. They followed in their polytheism Satan's dominion, turning away from God, the Truth - and He is God, the Mighty, the Praised One - God, there is no God but He, the Truthful in utterance through the tongue of the Gate, in truth and by the truth, worthy of all gratitude.

Soon shall We punish those who warred against Husayn on the banks of the Euphrates with the severest chastisement and mighty retribution, in truth and by the truth. What aileth you, O hosts of Satan? Did not the Truth come to you upon his steed on the Day of Ashura, after he had proclaimed unto you, in truth and by the truth, God's most great Cause from his own self, with utmost intensity? Did he not humbly seek water for himself and for his infant child, prostrate upon the earth in sublime truth, weak in that mighty Cause?

O people of polytheism! Is there not among you a soul who feareth God for His own sake and would bring water to water, while life remained, in truth and by the truth, for God's sake - even a small drop? God knoweth Husayn's heart and its burning from mighty thirst, and his patience in God, the One, the Ancient. And God was witness to this in truth.

By God the Truth! We found his heart that day hotter than a piece of iron heated in the ancient fire. And God hath not testified to anything save as He testifieth to His own self. So await ye God's mighty seizure, in truth and by the truth, in the land of Hell. God hath cursed the people who slew him in uttermost pain and extreme oppression. What have these polytheists to do with Our souls? Soon shall We show them in the gathering place God's supreme power within Us in truth, and We have decreed for them the greatest Fire in truth, forever and eternally abiding.

The Truth hath spoken in truth: "I shall fill Hell with them as recompense for what they have earned before God, the Truth. Never shall We decree the lifting of punishment from them throughout endless eternity, by God the Truth - not even the smallest speck of a date-stone's weight."

Surih of Paradise

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play, and we shall surely guard him.

Ta. Sin. Mim. Blessed be He besides Whom there is no God. In His hand is all authority and He is God, powerful over all things. We have ordained for every life, in truth and by the truth, a reversal, and with every hardship through truth and by truth, an ease, that people may know that the Gate of God is the truth and He is God, the Witness over the believers. He it is Who has made the sun and moon to move by a reckoning of fire, and We have ordained for them in the Book of Command, through stations of determination, in truth and by truth, at the Pole of Fire, a balancing. It befits not the sun to overtake the moon in its course, nor the moon to overtake the sun in its light. For each is an appointed term written by permission, and there is nothing whose decree is not written in the Mother Book from that Gate. He it is Who has sent down from the clouds of His power these verses from an olive tree neither of the East nor West, neither earthly nor heavenly, upon those lines at the equator on equal paths by the permission of the All-Merciful around the Gate. O servants of the All-Merciful! If you believe in God the Truth, doubt not in the matter of the Remembrance, for God is your True Lord, powerful over all things. We have indeed explained the verses in that Book by truth for those of insight among the people of the Gate, who were known in God's mighty Book around the Fire. These are they who believe in their Lord according to the straight truth and who stand firm on this path of Ali on the Day of Resurrection. They are those who set up no other god with God and who fulfill God's true covenant on the line of justice in a praiseworthy manner. These are the people of Paradise, by God's leave, dwelling therein eternally. They see naught but spirit upon spirit from the remembrance of God, the Exalted, and He is God, the Mighty, the Great. They recline upon crimson cushions around the Gate. They see therein neither sun nor air, but the angels meet them with God's remembrance, the Exalted, in the name of God, the Living, as witnessed. This is a day God your Creator promised His servants, and they say from Our presence upon them: "Peace, peace." O servants of the All-Merciful! Did We not make the earth spread out for you in truth? And We made the heaven above you preserved at the center of the Throne. We have indeed created you by permission of God, the Ancient, possessor of glory, in truth, in stages. What ails you that you hope not for dignity from God, the Great? Did We not make the sea to surge? Did We not make the earth submissive that you might bring forth from it what you sow for yourselves from the Gate's bounty, thankful to God, the Truth? What ails you that you believe not in God's remembrance, the Exalted, in truth and by truth, save a little? What ails you, how do you falsely deny God's verses, the Praiseworthy, arrogantly mocking without right? Soon shall the Fire encompass you in the depths of the coffin by permission of God, the Exalted, and He is God, the All-Knowing, the Ancient. God has prepared for the polytheists among you, on the line of justice and in truth, an enduring punishment, painful in truth. And when Joseph's brothers said to their father in truth: "Send our brother with us tomorrow by a secret of your hidden secret around the concealed line." \[...\]

When Joseph's brothers said to their father in truth: "Send our brother with us tomorrow, according to one of your hidden mysteries, concealed within the lines." And verily we desired to be with Joseph tomorrow in truth, with truth, through truth, witnessed in the circle of fire. And this is the Day wherein God hath decreed, and We spoke to the Most Great Word concerning the fourfold mystery, in truth and through truth, for God the Ancient of Days, besides Whom there is no other God, and verily God is witness over all things. And when they said: "O our father! Send him with us tomorrow in truth, that he may dwell at the point of snow on the mountain of cold around the point of union, and at a point of fire from the mountain of justice around the water of separation, in truth and through truth." And verily we were, in truth, through God the All-Praised, his faithful guardians. And verily our followers shall ask Us about the manifestation of Our Cause through this Most Great Gate, in truth and through truth, without a single letter from the knowledge of the Book, repeatedly. And verily they say: "Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play," and verily we were, in truth and through truth, in His Cause at the Mighty Gate, preserved through God the Preserver. God is Most Great! How little was their patience at the Gate, for the Gate, at a point of the Gate, for God the Most High! And verily We know that which no one knoweth besides Us and the Person of the Gate, and verily God hath ever been, in truth, All-Knowing. Do you not reflect upon the creation of the heavens and your own selves, with a swift reflection, in truth, with truth, through truth? Verily God created not the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them in truth and through truth in vain or for sport. He is God, the Truth, besides Whom there is no God. He hath desired from you that ye worship none but Him in the path of this Gate, with pure devotion, in truth and through truth, and verily God is independent of all worlds. God, the Worshipped One, besides Whom there is no God, alone, with no partner. Verily He is the Truth through truth, the God of all the worlds together. Were there any gods besides Him in truth, they would have needed, contrary to truth, something besides the truth, thrice.

The Surah of the Holy

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

He said, verily it grieveth me that ye should take him away and I fear lest the wolf devour him while ye are heedless concerning him. Alif Lam Mim Ta. The Remembrance of God was witnessed in the Most Great Word, standing round about the Fire. Hearken then unto that which thy Lord revealeth unto thee. Verily He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and God hath power over all things. God hath sent down the Book wherein is the explanation of all things, and a mercy and glad tidings to Our first followers who were concealed round about the Fire in that Gate, through the remembrance of God, the Most High. God will soon show you your true Lord upon His throne on the Day of Resurrection upon the straight path, and ye shall surely witness that His power extendeth equally over all worlds. There shall the people recognize the true Command of God regarding the Gate, mighty in truth around the Fire. And on that Day ye shall surely bear witness against yourselves of your servitude, and ye shall not find for yourselves even so much as the film of a date-stone as a helper in truth. Thou didst not will when thou didst will, but God willed as He willed through what thou willed, in the remembrance of God, the Wondrous, as a revelation from the Point of Fire. We have made the stories of the Book, by God's leave, from a mighty soul who was in the Mother Book all-knowing, and verily God hath power over all things. The Command hath come unto you from God, blessed in truth - do ye conceal the truth and work falsehood? What aileth you that ye believe not in God, the Praiseworthy, your Creator, Who verily witnesseth in truth what His servants do? The All-Merciful shall soon cause you to taste in the Resurrection a Fire that blazeth fierce from the flames of Hell, as recompense for your denial of the verses of the Book from God, the Truth, which We revealed unto Our servant, while ye responded with naught but sighing and ingratitude. O servants of God! Hath not the news of the ancients come unto you, though I have repeatedly made known unto you the decree from God in truth? He is the One like unto Whom there is nothing, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise. Did We not guide you in the ways of those before you? Yet ye shall never find any change in Our practice in truth. Such was God's way with those who passed before you, and by your Lord, people shall never find any alteration in God's way. Verily We bestow Our grace upon whom We will through God's remembrance of the Truth, upon such as are mentioned round about the Gate in the Mother Book in answering the remembrance of God, the Most High. We have raised him to a holy place, witnessed in truth, that he might be a sign in truth for those before you and after you by leave of God, the Ancient, supremely great in truth. He is the Witness over you by Our leave, and soon shall the Most Great Remembrance of God show you in the Resurrection what ye have earned for yourselves, both secret and open, by God's leave, according to what the Book hath recorded, as a guardian in truth. Be patient in God, for verily God is cognizant of all beings. O Remembrance of God, be patient for God's sake with beautiful patience in truth. We have made thee a watcher and reckoner over mankind by leave of God, the Most High. Soon shall God inform them in the distant land, by leave of God, the Praiseworthy, nigh in truth. By your Lord, We are nearer to you than your own selves - what aileth you that ye see not with clear vision the remembrance of God, the Impregnable, in truth? On the Day when the leg shall be bared, the people shall call upon Us by leave of the Remembrance round about the Gate, humbled before the truth in perdition.

God shall soon inform them in the far-off land, by the leave of God, the Praiseworthy, with the truth, by the truth. By your Lord! We are nearer to you than your own selves, yet you fail to perceive through the remembrance of God, the Inaccessible, with clear vision. On the Day when the leg shall be bared and joined to the other leg, the people shall call upon Us, by leave of the Remembrance, around the Gate, humbled before the truth, upon the truth, in utter loss.

Verily that Day is truth with your Lord. Say: Whosoever wishes may take unto God, his Lord, the Self-Sufficient, a path in that truth, by the truth. Soon shall the All-Merciful call you to prostrate before Him, but you will be unable. Who then can protect you from God as a true guardian?

There, all authority belongs to God, the Truth, and you shall have no helper besides the All-Merciful, in truth, by the truth. Soon shall God show you His signs in the orb of the sun, according to the decree of the Book, in the paths of the Gate, with truth, by the truth. The thunder glorifies His praise, and the angels through fear of Him, and He is God, encompassing all things.

There is nothing that does not glorify His praise, though you understand not even a letter of the knowledge of the Book, in truth, by the truth. God, there is no god but He, has revealed unto me that this is the truth from God, and God has not decreed any alteration for Our words in aught of the Book concerning the Point of the Gate.

He is God, the Truth, Who has ever been witness over all things. We have made the verses in that Book, by leave of God, the Praiseworthy, firm in truth, by the truth, and sealed. We have not sent down therein a single ambiguous letter, as God has ordained for the believers in this Book concerning the Gate to be witnessed.

Verily it grieves me that you should take it away after God has manifested it in truth, by the truth, in that Book from His presence, exalted. And I fear lest the wolf should devour it while you are heedlessly far from the truth through Satan's delusion. Were it not for fear concerning His Cause, from what God knows in your hearts contrary to truth, the Cause would have been as manifest as the sun at its zenith.

They said: "If the wolf should devour him while we are a strong band, then indeed we would be losers." Ta Ha Sad. He is God, there is no God but Him. Naught is there like unto Him. His is the creation and the command, and God is knowing of all things. By the Lord of heaven and earth, verily this Book is from God, the Truth, and sufficient is God as a witness to His servant concerning the truth. Verily God is the Self-Sufficient, and ye are the poor before the All-Merciful, through what God hath ordained in this Gate as a decree. Follow, then, what God hath revealed unto you in His Book of Truth, with manifest power, and fear God regarding this Gate of Truth, and be ye the best of helpers in the paths of the Gate, for God, the Exalted, the Praiseworthy. God hath indeed ordained for you the Command in His Book according to the mystery of the Book, by the truth within truth, around the water as a decree. Therefore overlook the faults of men and pardon abundantly, for God is witness to what ye do. God hath indeed loved from among the believers in this Gate those whose attributes are as recorded in the Book of God, the Exalted, by truth within truth, around the fire. He it is Who hath ordained your sustenance in heaven as an apportioned bestowal. If ye desire God and the abode of the Hereafter, then by your Lord, the All-Merciful, God hath appointed none besides His exalted servant as knower of the Book's truth from truth, concerning the mystery of the letter Ba. He it is Who hath ordained your affairs in His mighty Book upon the even path around the Gate in perfect order, that ye may seek of His bounty and give thanks morning and evening, abundantly, according to the judgment of the Book. He it is Who hath manifested His verses to His servants by God's leave in God's glorious Book, by truth within truth, the Praiseworthy, upon the straight path in wondrous wise, that ye may learn from the pure Remembrance of God and concerning what ye need in the path of His love, as one who asks and gives thanks. God hath indeed willed in this Book all good through the name of the Gate, according to the mystery of fire in the Mother Book as a decree. He it is Who hath made our hearts repositories of His Command and our breasts vessels of His mystery by His power, and God is powerful over all things. He it is Who hath confirmed our deed in His praiseworthy Book unto the people of insight among the believers in a decisive verse from the Qur'an: "Thou didst not throw when thou threwest, but God," for by truth over the Command He is ever the Powerful Doer. Verily those who earn sin through falsehood after the truth hath come to them from God, the Exalted, the Powerful - We shall soon cause them to enter a great Fire in the Day of Resurrection, upon the heat of fire with fire. The recompense of evil is the like thereof, and I wrong not the servants by even the speck on a date-stone. And those who perform righteous deeds before Our Remembrance, God shall soon give them from His bounty manifold and thousandfold increase, for God is powerful over all things. O people of the Furqan! If ye be people of the Qur'an in truth, and this Remembrance is in truth the essence of the Book, then return unto it by leave of God, your true Lord, for God hath made the return in the afterlife a witnessed thing. God hath decreed what He hath executed, and the Command was indeed fulfilled in the Mother Book around the fire, when Joseph's brothers said to their father: "If the wolf should devour him, then indeed we would be mentioned in truth upon the earth around the fire."

And verily in the Mother Book the matter concerning the Fire had been ordained, when the brothers of Joseph said unto their father: "If a wolf should devour him, then we shall, in truth and of a certainty, be gathered around the Fire upon the earth." And We have revealed unto thee from what God hath concealed within the inmost reality of this verse, that perchance the people may believe in God and His verses with true and mighty faith. When the letters of "There is no God but God" bore witness unto Ali on the Day of Beginning, they were seen around the Fire in the land of the heart. "If a wolf should devour him, then we are in truth a strong company for him" - and God hath power over all things. We have not made the mystery of Joseph to be envied around the waters upon the land of Euphrates. We desire not to be other than witnesses to His call upon the earth, in truth and with justice. What think ye of Us? Can ye cause Us loss in the sight of God, the True One? We have made Our verses, by God's leave, to be a guardian over all the worlds, in truth and with justice, around the Fire. God hath permitted them both revelation and interpretation as they wish and through what means they desire, in truth and praised. We have preserved them from allusion and from that which ye were, contrary to truth, abandoned. God doth testify, and God sufficeth as a witness to Our verses, in truth and with justice. By God the Truth! They desire naught save what God their Lord hath desired, in their inner and outer lives, in truth and with justice - and God is witness over all things. Know, O servants of the Most Merciful, that We have expounded Our verses in this Book, in truth and with justice, around the Gate, that perchance the people may be praised by God, the Most Praiseworthy, and that perchance they may be thankful unto God, the Most High. Say: Call ye upon God and His name the Most Merciful in the path of the Gate, for unto God belong the most beautiful names from the presence of the Gate, which have been veiled around the Fire.

The Surah of the Throne

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

When they took him and agreed to put him in the depths of the well, We inspired him saying: "You shall inform them of this deed of theirs when they least expect it." God hath sent down the Book wherein is the explanation of all things, a mercy and glad tidings unto all the worlds through the truth. Praise be to God Who hath sent down the Book through truth according to Our Word, that people might be remembered in the Mother Book as being around the Fire in that Gate. This Book of Ours speaketh unto you with truth, yet most people believe not in God and His verses concerning that Gate, and God is witness over all things. O servants of the Most Merciful! We have given you glad tidings, by God's leave, in the Most Great Remembrance, from the Ancient Decree through truth - a weighty command concerning that Gate. God desireth naught from you on this day save obedience to God's true Command through the truth - an everlasting reward from God, the Ancient One. Whoso obeyeth God in Our Cause, for the love of God's Remembrance and in submission to the Gate, shall meet God upon the Throne, well-pleased and well-pleasing. But whoso turneth away from Our Cause in denial and rebellion against the truth, the Most Merciful shall make them taste of the tree of boiling water springing from the depths of Hell - bitter food indeed. No pure covenant with God remaineth for such a one. Whoso desireth God's covenant must fulfill Our covenant regarding this Remembrance with manifest knowledge of the Book, with mighty truth. Fear ye, O servants of God, the Day when the Command shall come to you suddenly from God, the Truth. On that Day, people shall possess no dominion save by God's leave through Our servant, and God is knowing of all things - except those who bear Our Book in their hearts and who have answered the call of the Remembrance from before, steadfast in the true and lasting Covenant. The Remembrance hath fulfilled His covenant with those who came to Him in truth, following the straight path. Fear ye, O servants of God, the severe chastisement of God, your Lord, the Most Merciful. Verily God hath prepared for Us fetters, chains, bitter fruit, and grievous punishment for those who deny the Book and Our Remembrance in their weakness, and who believe in it only in jest and falsehood. These are they who join partners with God, and they have no decree from God save the severe Fire of God's wrath. I inform you, O servants of God, of Our severe grasp upon mankind on the Day of Judgment. Whoso turneth away from God's Remembrance, adorning falsehood with vain delusions - by the Lord of heaven and earth, We shall make him taste on the Day of Resurrection, according to the decree of the Book, fire upon fire from the tree of fire in the depths of the coffin, as hath been ordained in the Mother Book. When Joseph's brothers took him to the land of Unity, as was inscribed in the hidden mystery around the Line, they placed the letters of Unity, the letter Ha, in the depths of the well of the heart's mystery, veiled around the Fire. And verily We inspired him saying that We would inform them of this deed of theirs, and God shall show them this Letter in the seat of mystery around the Gate, witnessed.

We have indeed inspired him, that We may inform them of this Command of theirs. Soon will God show them this Letter in the seat of mystery, around the Gate, as a witness. Verily the Letters of Unity perceive naught save the perception of God in the seat of the heart, as truth from their Lord, and God was in truth a witness unto them. God hath indeed veiled that Word with a veil of the mystery of concealment around the Throne, hidden. Those who seek God and His signs in the paths of the Gate, upon the Letter Ha - these are they who are witnessed in truth around the Fire. God hath created Joseph and his brethren from the Blessed Tree of Unity, and people know not from their expressions the mystery of what was inscribed with God, the Truth, in the Mother Book, around the Fire. Do they not know that they act only by leave of God their True Lord, and that God hath ever been, in truth after negation and affirmation, the One Worshipped? The All-Merciful will not question you on the Day of Resurrection about what they do for themselves, but God will question you about what ye do in secret and in public, and God is indeed aware of what ye do. God, there is no god but He, Most True in narration, wondrous. God hath not ordained for people in the inmost mystery any portion of all the signs save inability before the Truth - and unto God belongeth submission in truth. God hath made His friends praiseworthy in their deeds, in very truth, and God hath power over all things. Behold, O servants of God, We have placed Our servant, by God's leave, in the depth of the pit, concealed in truth around the Fire. God hath placed in that Gate a mystery within the most hidden mystery, treasured. Soon shall ye know what ye knew not before, in truth, in the garment of the Sun, by leave of God, the Exalted, soon. O believers, whatsoever fruit of the Messenger He giveth you, accept it, and whatsoever He forbiddeth you, forgo it, for God hath made him wise in truth before Us. God hath made the Remembrance encompass mankind through His knowledge, and God hath power over all things.

The Surih of the Gate

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful

And they came to their father in the evening, weeping. That Book, there is no doubt in it, is a guidance from God, the Truth, to all the worlds. We have made it a guidance for Our servants, who were, concerning that Gate at the Gate, witnessed in truth around the water. And verily We give you glad tidings of a Soul from Our souls, who was, in truth, purified around the Fire. When the Truth comes to you, follow it, for God has made it to be reckoned in the Book from Us in truth. We have made him knowledgeable about the science of the Book by God's leave, the Most High, from the Point of Fire. And We have strengthened him from God, besides Whom there is no God, and God has power over all things.

O servants of God! If you ask him something and he does not answer you in truth, do not grieve, for he has been, by God's command, from Us, dwelling praised in truth. We have shown you the Truth in your vision concerning the Command, and had you informed them of the unseen, they would have disputed about the Command. And God, your Lord, the Truth, knows what is in the breasts. We do not change the blessings upon any people until they first change what is within themselves regarding Our bounties. So taste the punishment of the Fire for having been rejected from that Gate. Verily your Lord is powerful and all-knowing over His servants. Soon We shall destroy the wrongdoers like the people of Pharaoh, with justice through severe chastisement and great exemplary punishment.

Grieve not at the thoughts of the deniers in your presence, but rely upon God, your Lord. Verily He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing in truth, and your Lord has power over all things. O people of the earth! Whatever you have spent in the path of God, the Truth, you shall find it preserved in the hands of the Preserver at that Gate. O people of the earth! Believe in the Light which God has sent down with Me in pure truth, and follow not the footsteps of Satan, for he commands you to associate partners with God, your Lord. And God forgives not that partners be associated with Him, though He forgives whom He will for anything else, and He is God, the All-Knowing of all things.

God has ordained for the believing emigrants the forgiveness of the Remembrance and the greatest good pleasure, according to the decree of the Book around the Gate. We have ordained for blood relations that some have more rights over others, as God has decreed in the Mother Book, inscribed in the mystery of the Gate. O believers! God has not sent down any verse in the Book, nor in the horizons, nor in the souls, except that people might know in truth that the Remembrance is truth from God, and He is God, the All-Knowing of all things from ancient truth.

O people of the earth! By your Lord, besides Whom there is no God, God has left no proof for any soul after the Remembrance and this Book, so be patient in truth for God, the Praiseworthy, at that Gate. And now, in truth, the perishing ones perish with clear evidence, and the believers live by clear evidence, and He is God, having power over all things. O people of the Throne! Hear My call from around the Fire: "Verily, I am God, there is no God but I, so worship Me and establish prayer for the Greatest Remembrance, purely, apart from the people, for your Lord God, the Truth, is the Truth."

Establish the prayer for the Most Great Remembrance with sincerity, apart from all people. Verily your Lord, God, the Truth, is indeed the Truth, and those whom you invoke besides Him are the companions of the Fire, according to justice. And verily the Remembrance has been established upon the pure path with upright writing around the Fire.

O people of the earth! Fear God and let not Satan deceive you from the Truth, for verily the Remembrance is the Truth through the Truth, and you and what you invoke besides Him have been inscribed in the Mother Book as people of the Fire.

O people of the earth! Have you not reflected upon the creation of the heavens and the earth? If there were two gates in them from the Remembrance, they would have corrupted. And verily God has arranged the kingdom through His Gate of Truth, and God is indeed knowing of all things.

O believers! Fear the Day of Truth. We shall gather you around the Fire and question you concerning what you have done with the Remembrance. By the Truth, We shall make the polytheists taste the heat of the Fire with severe punishment, and We shall fully reward the patient ones with the finest reward in the Land of Saffron, according to the decree of the Book, from the judgment of the Gate, in comfort.

We have indeed revealed it to the people with truth, and nothing is required of the people except submission and humility, and nothing is required of the Remembrance except a wondrous declaration of the truth from God, the Exalted.

He is the Remembrance from God to give you glad tidings of His promise and to warn you of His vengeance, and He is the One concealed in the Mother Book, preserved at the Point of Fire according to what was in the mystery of the Book.

He is the Remembrance before you, to your right, and to your left, by God's leave in truth, that people might be mentioned in truth around the Gate through the wondrous verses in this Book.

This has been for you a known station on the Path. Therefore fear God, O people of understanding, regarding God's hidden mystery upon the line in this Book, according to what God has ordained, concealed around the Fire. God desires from you no recompense in this Book for the Remembrance, nor gratitude for the Truth through the Truth.

Except love for the near of kin, for those who have been inscribed around the Gate in the Mother Book. We have desired to make the believers witnesses upon the earth by leave of God, the Exalted, and God has power over all things.

God has made the Remembrance better for you than your own selves, that He might recite unto you the verses of God, purify you, and bring you out of darkness into light. He is God, witness over all things. This is from the tidings of the unseen which We reveal to him, that people might be witnessed around the Fire in that Gate through the wondrous Remembrance in truth.

Glorified be He besides Whom there is no God! God has given to His servant what He has not given to any of the Gates, all in truth through the truth.

You have been given of knowledge through the Most Great Remembrance, in truth through the truth, only a small portion of the letter around the water.

O people of the earth! Deal not with the Most Great Remembrance as the community dealt with Husayn unjustly in the Holy Land. By God, the Truth, verily He is the Truth, and God is witness over him.

The believers came to Us in the evening after the Book, weeping for the Most Great Gate. Say to them: "Remain steadfast in the depths of unity, for God is indeed aware of what you do."

And God was witness unto this. The believers came unto Us in the evening after the Book, weeping at the departure of the Most Great Gate. Say unto them: Abide ye in the depths of oneness, for God is well aware of all that ye do. And say unto the believers: Follow not Satan, for verily in the Book of God he hath ever been a manifest enemy unto the believers.

They said: "O our father! We went racing with one another, and left Joseph with our belongings, and the wolf devoured him. But thou wilt never believe us even though we tell the truth." KAF. HA. YA. 'AYN. SAD. Praise be to God Who hath created the heavens and the earth in truth, and Whose decree concerning them both hath proceeded from the Point of the letter Ba in the center of the Fire around the Gate. Verily We have sent down unto thee this Book as an exposition of the Truth, and verily We have made thee a sign by God's leave. This Book is sealed according to the decree of the Book, ordained in truth by the truth. Should all mankind assemble together, they could not produce a single letter like unto it, even if they were to assist one another. God is He besides Whom there is none other God, the Ever-Living, the Worshipped, the Ancient, and He is God, the All-Knowing of all things. None can comprehend the knowledge of the Book save as the Remembrance willeth of what We will, and verily God is powerful over all things. God hath created for you this Gate as an extended path, and hath ordained for you a mountain raised high in truth by the truth. And verily God hath desired to lead you out of darkness unto the Book, witnessed in truth, that ye may seek of His bounty that from which ye were cast down apart from the truth. Therefore seek forgiveness of God, your Lord, besides Whom there is none other God, the Truth, and soon shall ye find God forgiving and merciful at the Gate. He it is Who hath sent down from heaven upon you, in truth, water from the Gate in abundance, and He it is Who hath brought you forth from your land these gardens of delight and varied hues by His power. Verily He is powerful over all things. Know ye that your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath knowledge of all things, and there is nothing hidden in the heavens and the earth but We have set it down in this Book, concealed around the Gate. God shall soon inform you on the Day of Resurrection, through the tongue of the Remembrance, concerning what ye used to do in your secret thoughts and open deeds. Verily He encompasseth all things in truth by the truth. Verily God hath made with Us this Book, preserved in truth by the truth. God effaceth what He willeth and confirmeth what He willeth, and verily God hath made the Remembrance to be concealed in the Mother Book around the Fire. Verily those who act in the true Cause of the family of God shall soon witness their deeds remembered before the Remembrance, while those who commit sin in the path of the Evil One - God hath ordained no weight for their deeds on the Day of Resurrection, and God hath prepared for them in the depths of the coffin a great fire. Soon will God show them their deeds as sources of regret unto themselves, scattered dust upon the earth, like a mirage in the desert which the thirsty one supposeth to be water, until, when he cometh unto it, he findeth it to be nothing, and they shall find their deeds in hell as fire upon fire intensified. This is the recompense for having been wretched regarding Our true verses contrary to the truth. O servants of God! Know ye that God's proof in the Mother Book concerning that Gate is eloquent, and God hath made the Cause of the Remembrance none other than Our Cause, raised high in truth by the truth. O people of knowledge! Fear God concerning the Remembrance. God shall teach you, through the tongue of the Remembrance, the interpretation of the Book, wondrously in truth by the truth. God hath sent down the verses in that Book that perchance mankind might be witness to Our signs at that Gate.

God hath made the matter of remembrance solely Our command, exalted in truth by the truth. O people of knowledge, fear God concerning the remembrance. God will teach you, through the tongue of remembrance, the interpretation of the Book, in truth by the truth, in wondrous wise. God hath sent down the verses in this Book that men might be witnesses of Our signs in this Gate. We, verily, have sent down the command unto Our servant according to what was ordained in the Mother Book, in truth by the truth, all together. He was indeed a servant of God in truth, standing firm upon the straight path with justice around the Fire. O people! The command hath come to you from the All-Merciful in truth by the truth from around the Fire in wondrous wise. God hath desired naught in this your day save His servant, the remembrance, as a beloved one in truth by the truth. Therefore fear ye God on a day which was ordained new in the Mother Book. God hath informed the believers of the decree concerning Joseph's brothers after their return from the land of Oneness, regarding what they had done in truth to Joseph. God is indeed aware of all things. When they returned in truth, they said: "O our father! We went racing in the land of the cloud and left Joseph with the goods of Divine Unity from our Lord, besides Whom there is no God, and the beholders consumed him with their glances toward him in the depths of innovation, and they were recorded in the Mother Book by the name of the wolf." And they said the letters of "There is no God but God" belonged to Ali in the land of the cloud, "and thou wilt not believe us in prostration even though we bore witness in truth by the truth in praiseworthy wise." That decree was a truth from God our Lord, as God had ordained the prostration of the stars to Husayn above the dust according to the decree of the Gate around the Fire, as a matter decreed. We were indeed truthful in our witness to the mystery of Divine Unity from Husayn in truth by the truth, and God sufficeth as a witness to ourselves in truth by the truth. God knoweth what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and He is the All-Merciful, established upon the throne, dealing equally with all the worlds in truth.

The Surah of Sinai

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

And they brought his shirt with false blood upon it. He said: Nay, but your souls have made a matter light for you, so comely patience! And Allah is He Whose help is sought against what you describe. O Commander! Hear the call of thy Lord upon Mount Sinai: Verily there is no God but Him, and I am the Most High, as hath been hidden in what God hath ordained in the Mother Book. God hath indeed sent down the Book with the Most Great Truth upon His Word, that people might know that God hath preserved fire within a point of snow. We have raised up the Remembrance from before Us in truth, and We have made him mighty before God and exalted above truth. Fear God, O servants! None of your deeds are accepted without love for His loved one, even in the slightest measure. Know, O servants of God, that We have indeed favored Our servant above many whom We created with great favor, that ye may know that God doeth what He willeth and judgeth as He desireth, in truth and with truth made manifest. We bestowed Our favor upon thee in thy childhood by God's exalted command, when the decree was ordained in the Mother Book. And We have sent down unto thee in maturity this Book, a Book witnessed in truth. God hath indeed guaranteed Our true Cause in thee, and the promise in the Mother Book hath been fulfilled. We have given thee, in truth and through truth, a Book witnessed in the innermost mystery. We are the Speaker behind thee, in truth and through truth, by leave of God the Exalted, the Strong. Therefore, convey to the servants Our command, that which God hath willed concerning thee, praiseworthy in truth. Know, O servants of the All-Merciful, if ye be God-fearing in truth regarding this Gate, God hath favored you above all worlds through Our Cause. So follow what We have revealed unto Our servant in this Book concerning the laws for all peoples, entirely in truth. God desireth naught from you in this Day save His remembrance, with steadfast truth. Did not the All-Merciful promise you His signs at that Gate as a reminder? Did We not tell you that in every succession We have those who are just in truth? What aileth you that ye believe not in Our signs, if ye be indeed careful of God, the Exalted, the Strong? God hath willed in this Book a mystery of Our Cause, in truth a mystery from Our mystery, that people may enter God's houses through their gates, prostrating in truth and humility. God hath desired from the people of the House Our early followers, who in truth were steadfast around the Gate. We have stationed Our followers upon the Heights around the Gate, men in truth who know each person by their mark, by leave of God the Exalted, like pure steeds. O evil servants! What aileth you that ye believe not openly in that Gate of God, the Exalted, the Strong? Did We not create you when ye were not yet mentioned around the Gate in the Mother Book? Did We not extend aid and guide you on the strong path of truth? Did We not bestow abundantly upon you from God's exalted grace? God hath indeed made Our servant's Cause one and near in truth. So await God's help for yourselves. When Our Cause cometh, it shall come upon you suddenly, mighty in supreme truth. This Day is truth from your Lord. There shall ye not possess for yourselves even a fragment of the Book's knowledge, cut off in truth. On that Day, true sovereignty shall belong to the All-Merciful, and ye shall not be able to utter a word in truth.

Wait ye for Allah's victory for yourselves, for when Our Cause cometh, it shall come upon you suddenly with mighty truth. Verily this Day is the truth from your Lord. On that Day ye shall not possess even a particle of knowledge from the Book, cut off in truth by the truth. The Kingdom on that Day shall belong in truth to the All-Merciful, and ye shall not be able to utter a word, nay not even a whisper. This indeed is the path of Ali in the Mother Book, in truth by the truth, and God hath ordained this path around the Fire, straight in pure truth. They ask: "When is it?" Say: "It is with God." Perchance the Cause of God is nigh. When the brothers of Joseph brought his garment with false blood to their father, witnessed around the Fire (and verily God had taught them that the blood of Joseph was recorded as the vengeance of God in the Mother Book, and God had made the unity of the gates before that Most Great Gate as false blood upon a form, as was inscribed delicately in the Mother Book, and We say: "Nay, your souls have made a matter seem fair to you through Us." So patience is befitting before God and reliance upon Him, as God hath ordained, witnessed on the Day of Remembrance, and God is the One Whose help is sought concerning the matter of Joseph the Gate, and verily God hath power over all things.)

And when there came a company of travellers and they sent their water-drawer, he let down his bucket. He said: Good news! Here is a youth. And they hid him as merchandise, and God was aware of what they did. Alif Lam Mim. Hearken then unto that which is revealed unto thee from thy Lord. Verily thou art in the sacred valley, at the point of fire in the heart of snow, encompassing the Truth. God hath decreed what He hath decreed, and the Beginning was witnessed in the Point of the Seal. God - there is no God but Him, and God encompasseth all things. Verily We bestow sovereignty upon whomsoever We will among Our servants by God's leave, the True One, without cause, and God hath ordained no alteration for His Word, through truth by truth. God hath verily made Us firmly established before Him through the Mighty Name. When Our true Cause cometh suddenly, the furnace of hearts shall boil mightily in truth by truth at that Gate. On that Day the believers shall rejoice at meeting Us, in truth by truth, with radiant faces and gladness. The hands of the Jews and Christians are fettered in what they falsely and vainly say about Us. God hath made Our hands outstretched - We give abundantly unto whomsoever We will among Our servants, in truth by truth, from that Gate. And We withhold from whomsoever We will among Our servants, with justice in truth by truth, in praiseworthy fashion. None may speak concerning Us any false and vain embellishments contrary to truth. Know, O servants of God, the Light hath come to you from God, the Exalted, in truth mighty and resplendent, that ye may seek of His grace what God hath ordained in His dominion, in truth by truth, as a decree. Make not your journeys distant from what God hath ordained regarding your journeyings to that Gate, in truth by truth, nearby. God is the All-Knowing and ye know naught of the knowledge of the Book concerning that Gate. Verily We teach those who arrive at that Gate, in truth by truth, such of Our servants as We will, who were pure in the Mother Book. We have verily decreed for the wrongdoers the Fire of Hell, as an irrevocable command from God, the Exalted. O servants of the All-Merciful! God hath placed among you One Who is of Our own Self, a mortal like unto you. If ye love God, then follow Him; God will love you. God's true promise in the Mother Book shall be fulfilled. We have verily sent down this blessed Book from God unto Our servant that ye may believe in Him and help Him on a Day when He shall call you, by God's leave, upon the land of the heart in praiseworthy fashion. By God the Truth! If ye deny Our Remembrance after the Remembrance hath come unto you with mighty proof from your Lord, We shall cause you to taste abundant punishment from God, the Most Great, in the depths of Hell on the Day of Resurrection. Know, O servants of God, that God hath preferred Us above you through His grace, and We have preferred Our servant above you through Our preference for you, if ye be patient concerning His signs in truth. We have verily ordained for you in your Book aforetime many obligations concerning the Most Great Name of God, in truth by truth. So spend in God's path from what God and His Messenger love, both secretly and openly, that ye may be gathered on the Day of Resurrection among the lines of the believers. Whoso turneth away from Our Remembrance, God will not accept any of his deeds.

Whosoever turneth away from Our remembrance, God will not accept any of his deeds, and Satan hath verily been his partner in his affairs, and he hath been rejected by God in that Gate. We have verily placed protection in truth within the hearts of those who believe in Our signs and who glorify God their Creator, morning and evening, through that exalted Gate - and He is God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

Fear ye the All-Merciful, O servants, and perform good deeds abundantly for the sake of God, the True One. O servants of the All-Merciful! Don your adornments at every place of worship - such is God's decree for you in that Gate, in truth and by truth, as hath been ordained in the Mother Book.

We have verily sent forth the caravan of love by God's leave unto this well. When he let down his bucket with the gaze of the heart, he said: "O glad tidings! This verily is the Truth - this is a youth the like of whom no eye hath seen!" O people of the realm of blindness! Hide him as merchandise, turning away from Divine Unity, that ye may be remembered by God, the Most High, around the Fire.

We have verily intended by this Youth the Most Great Word - this pure Arab youth in the land of the heart. God hath preserved him in the depths of the well around the Fire, upon the mountain of hail, in truth and for the Truth. O believers! Fear God, lest ye sell him for a counted price apart from the pure ocean of Divine Unity - and God is aware of what ye do.

Know ye, O servants of God, in truth and by truth, that if ye look upon him with other than the eyes of your hearts, ye have purchased him for a paltry price - a few counted dirhams - and God will not judge in your favor in the Book through the knowledge of the Remembrance, for ye have not entered upon the mystery of the heart. Now ye come to Us with his shirt stained with false blood, but We say: "Nay, your souls have beguiled you into something. Patience is most fitting, and God's help is to be sought against what ye assert" - falsely and deceptively attributing to Our servant that which is not true.

If ye were to recognize him through God's eye within you, ye would be guided even as those before you were guided. Ye bring me his shirt with false blood - a thin shade of red - but God hath accepted this remembrance from you as a bounty, for ye could never change it in truth and by truth in any other way.

Guard ye God's mystery within you, for God hath appointed for you a station upon the Path. Give not wisdom unto the foolish, for they have believed in God, the Most High, and His mystery weakly, upon the ocean of weakness.

O servants of the All-Merciful! Fear ye God regarding Our trusts within you, and preserve them as ye would preserve yourselves - a beautiful preservation in truth and by truth. If ye are unable, then return it to God, the True One, and cast it behind the Red Sea in the realm of blindness, and conceal it at the pole of glory upon Mount Sinai in truth. Soon shall ye find all your deeds with God in this Gate, in a sealed book, hidden and preserved under the seal of the Remembrance.

God, the True One, hath created you by His command - do ye find today any helper besides God, the Most High?

This is the Surah of the Tree.

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

In the Name of God, Who is no god but He, the Lord of the Exalted Throne, and He is God Who hath ever been knowing of all things. God hath sent down the Book containing the word of mysteries unto His servant in truth, that men may know that God hath power over all things. We did forbid Adam and his mate from Our tree in that Gate, and We willed that they should draw nigh unto it according to what We knew concerning them. Thus did they draw nigh, and were deprived of the blessings of Paradise.

O people! If ye believe in Our Remembrance after the Truth hath come unto you with the Book, ye shall be recorded in the Book of the Exalted Ones round about the Gate. And if ye deny God after He hath sent down unto you the Remembrance and this Most Great Book, ye shall be inscribed as followers of the tree of Satan in the Book of the Prison, having shown arrogance against God, the Truth.

Fear ye God and work not falsehood after the Truth hath come unto you from God, the Strong, the Great. Lo! The Truth is come and falsehood hath vanished away, for falsehood hath ever been cast out in the Mother Book.

O people of the East and of the West! Be ye fearful of God in the matter of Joseph, the Truth, that ye sell him not for a paltry price from your own selves, nor for a few pieces of silver from your wealth, lest ye be recorded as being among those who turned away from His remembrance, in truth, round about the Gate. Verily God hath cut off His mercy from the slayer of our ancestor Husayn upon the plain of Taff, alone and forsaken. Indeed, Yazid son of Mu'awiyah did purchase falsely the head of Joseph, the Truth, for a paltry price from himself and for counted pieces of silver from his dominion, through the party of Satan. Thus did they deny God with a grievous denial.

God shall take vengeance upon them during Our return, and in the world to come He hath prepared for them a grievous chastisement in truth. O servants of the All-Merciful! God hath prescribed for you, at the mention of Husayn, weeping like unto the weeping of the bereaved, and verily God's judgment concerning vengeance for him hath been decreed in truth. When ye hear his mention yet aid Us not in weeping, ye have purchased Joseph, the Truth, for a paltry price - pieces of silver not accounted in the Book with God. Were ye not bound in God's covenant on the day of the Greater Particles concerning the right of Joseph, the Exalted One, to be among those who weep round about the Gate?

Turn not away from the gatherings wherein God's remembrance of this true calamity is made, for if ye turn away unrighteously, We shall turn away from you on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and on that day ye shall say in truth: "Alas for our negligence concerning God, the Most Great!" and ye shall find none besides Us on that day to intercede for you in truth.

Verily the unbelievers who speak of God without the word of the Gate, speaking vainly without truth, and who say falsely concerning Our friends that after their martyrdom they are dead - these are they who have purchased God's verses of truth for a paltry price, unrighteously and for little gain. Hath not the All-Merciful taught you that the Gate of God hath never been vanquished in the Mother Book? Have We not made known to you that Our Gates in the Mother Book have ever been alive with God, the Ancient One?

By God, the Truth! Unto Us is your return in truth, then upon Us resteth your reckoning in truth, concerning that Gate which hath been inscribed round about the Letter B. What aileth you that ye ponder not the Qur'an in truth, seeking its true interpretation? Verily We shall reckon with you, by God's leave, on the Day of Resurrection, layer upon layer.

And those who speak falsely about Our loved ones, saying they were dead after their martyrdom - these are they who have sold the verses of God for a paltry price, unjustly and for little gain. Has not the All-Merciful taught you that the Gate of God was never subjugated in the Mother Book? Have We not made known to you that Our Gates in the Mother Book have ever been, in truth, alive with God, the Ancient One? By God the Truth, unto Us is your return in truth, then upon Us rests your reckoning in truth, concerning that Gate which was inscribed around the letter Ba. What ails you that you ponder not the Quran with true understanding? Verily We shall reckon with you by God's leave on the Day of Resurrection, examining thoroughly layer upon layer, and with truth upon truth, hair by hair. Fear God concerning Our Remembrance with true and mighty piety from the Gate. Soon will the All-Merciful place you upon the path of the Fire and question you heavily concerning the mention of Our servant. Not one of you but shall approach it, pausing without right, and this has been decreed by God as an ordained judgment in truth. Then God will deliver those who were God-fearing, leaving the wrongdoers therein - a decree from the Book fulfilled in truth. And your Lord, the All-Merciful, is never in the least unjust to His servants. If you do good, you do good for your own souls - this is the truth that exists from God your Lord upon the paths of the Gate around the water. And if you do evil, you do it against yourselves - this decree from you is inscribed in the Mother Book around the fire. Verily We commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam of the Gate, and the angels all prostrated in truth upon the ground of the heart together, save Iblis who refused and grew proud concerning Our command, and was thus in the Mother Book rejected from that Gate. O Remembrance of God! Say: Seek refuge with God from the evil of the whisperer who whispers in people's breasts, for verily your Lord, God the Truth, is ever watchful over all things. Say: Seek refuge through the Most Great Word in the protection of your Lord, God, the True Master - verily He is witness over all things. O Solace of the Eyes! Say: He is God, there is no god but He - God the One, the Eternal. He begets not nor was He begotten, and He has no partner in sovereignty. And magnify Him in truth in My soul, the Gate, with great magnification. Verily the hands of the unbelievers are cut off, indicating negation which they established without permission around the Gate - and God is well aware of what you do. God has decreed for these polytheists no portion of the knowledge of the Book save fire from the burning wood in the depths of the coffin, abundantly. See how We have set forth parables for them, yet they stray from the truth and can find no way to God. When they come to you to spread corruption in the land, say to them by the Word of the Criterion: Be as stones for the fire and iron destined for the fire.

Surah of Water

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate \[...\]

And he who bought him in Egypt said to his wife: "Make his dwelling honorable. He may be of benefit to us, or we may adopt him as a son." Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that We might teach him the interpretation of events. And God has full power over His affairs, but most men know not.

God, besides Whom there is no other God, knows the unseen in the heavens and earth, and He is the One Who encompasses all things.

Verily We have ordained death around the Gate as an irrevocable decree of the Book. And verily We know We have ordained death around the Gate as an irrevocable decree of the Book. And verily We know We have ordained death twice in the path of the Most High as a fixed decree from the All-Merciful.

God has created the heavens in truth as layers above the earth, by decree of the Book. Say: You see no flaw in God's creation regarding the Gate except that all has been created in perfect harmony. Say: Turn your gaze around the Fire - do you find any irregularity in God's true command? Nay, then nay! Unto you return all eyes around the water at the Pole of the Point of Glory, extended.

Verily We have ordained by God's leave for the lowest heaven stars around the Pole in truth. And We have made the stars as missiles fixed in the heaven. And when they hear a word from the Greater Depths, they gasp at it and become like molten brass in the depths of the coffin, burned.

And whenever a mystery is revealed from the hidden mysteries inscribed above the Secret, a group enters and a group departs. So glory be to the Most High, besides Whom there is no God, and God is the Most High, the All-Wise.

Those who fear their Lord regarding the Gate, secretly and openly in truth - verily We have ordained for them by God's leave in the Hereafter forgiveness in truth and a great reward.

Does He not know what He has created when He is the All-Knowing of the essence of all things? How could He not know about His creation's innovative origination?

Do you not see the bird soaring in the atmosphere of heaven, how We grasp it at the Gate to teach you the stages of the leaves from the Camphor Tree in truth? Is there any upholder besides God your Master? Glory be to God above what the wrongdoers say. Verily He is All-Seeing of all things.

Do you feel secure from this Gate about other than the Gate among you? Do you find any helper for yourselves besides Him? Exalted be God! Verily the unbelievers shall be led to the innovative Fire.

Is one who looks to God and sees nothing besides Him in truth like one who sees only himself contrary to truth? What ails you that you are content with the rule of false deities instead of God, when verily the Remembrance stands firm upon the Straight Path around the Fire?

Say: Knowledge is only with the Gate from God, and He is God, the True Witness, and God is All-Knowing of all things. And He is God, the Truth, He is the All-Merciful - we believe in Him, and He is the Truth, independent of all worlds.

God has brought you into being around the Gate and has ordained for you hearts and eyes that you might give thanks to God around the Gate to God, the Truth, the Praiseworthy. Can other than God your Lord provide you with drink from the Camphor Water in this world in truth? Exalted be God our Lord, besides Whom there is no God.

By God! Who else but your Lord can bring you in this world the water of camphor, a drink of truth through truth? Exalted is God our Lord, there is no God but Him, and He is the One Who gives His servants to drink from the pure spring in that Gate, and He is the Truth, Who has been witness over all things.

O people of the Throne! Hear My call from the very soul of the Gate: "Verily, I am God, there is no God but I. We have sent down victory in the days of the Remembrance around the triumph, through truth upon truth, and it is near."

Do you not see how people have entered in throngs into the sea of fire from the path of the sea?

Therefore, glorify God in the days of the Gate and seek forgiveness from God, your True Lord. Verily, He has ever been the Forgiver, the Merciful.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say to the idolaters: "If you worship not God, your Creator, besides Whom there is no other God, then by the Lord of the House, He is the Truth, and I have not worshipped and will never worship any but God, our True Master. To you be your religion, and for us the pure religion around the water, through truth upon truth, ordained."

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! God has placed the two springs in your hands: this is the spring of camphor around the water, inscribed, and this is the water of purification from the surging Kawthar around the fire, concealed. Therefore, give life to the people through both waters as you wish, as We wished upon the two mounts through truth, and God, your True Lord, has ever been your Guardian through truth.

Verily, God has ordained in truth upon the Quraysh the journey of winter in the camphor water around the water of camphor, and the journey of summer in the manifest water of Kawthar upon truth.

And We teach him from the interpretation of the Book, a hidden letter from the Letter, from what God has decreed in His Book. Verily, He has been witness over all things.

Surih of the Age

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

When He attained His maturity, We bestowed upon Him wisdom and knowledge; thus do We recompense the righteous. Alif Lam Mim. That Book, there is no doubt in it, is guidance for all the worlds. God hath sent down the Book in truth concerning Him Whom He shall make manifest, that mankind may know that the Word of God hath existed eternally in the Mother Book. Verily We have ordained upon the earth its quaking, and none can turn back God's true command save that the earth cast forth its burdens. On that Day shall man witness what hath been on earth of its possessions. By God! The earth hath related its tidings to the Gate. Say: From God have I inspired it. Whosoever performeth an atom's weight of good upon the earth, We shall recompense him with good, and justice for evil. And those who perform righteous deeds in the vicinity of the Gate - their reward with God their Lord shall be gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide forever and ever. The Gate is well-pleased with them, and they are content with the decree of the Most Great Remembrance in the mystery of the Gate. These are the people of Paradise, and this hath been inscribed in the Mother Book as truth upon truth. By the declining day! Verily the polytheists are in the stupor of remoteness from this Gate, having been confounded apart from truth, save those who repented and turned unto the Gate from around the Gate, humbly, praised in truth. Say: Verily I am the Light that was witnessed in truth at the Mount of the Heart. By your Lord! Were ye to know through the knowledge of the Gate concerning your own selves, ye would surely behold the Fire encompassing your souls in truth upon truth. Then shall ye witness with the eye of certainty, through knowledge, like unto the sun at its zenith fixed in the midst of heaven. And verily the chargers, by Our leave, pant in truth around the water. And verily the raiders, according to the decree of symbols in the Mother Book, strike sparks around the water. And verily man, in truth, with God your True Master, is he who gathereth around the water. And verily the beast, in truth, is he who is cast forth from around the Fire. Doth not the All-Merciful know what stealthily entereth the breasts? Nay! On the Day of Resurrection the Remembrance shall inform you from God, the Most High, in truth, and God is knowing of all things. Verily We have informed you on the Day of Distinction concerning what ye suppose regarding the vicinity of the Gate apart from the Gate, for God, the Most High - and He is God - hath ever been Mighty, Wise. By the Lord of the House! We shall in truth surely question you concerning the Striking One in the vicinity of the Striking One. Is he who is mentioned around the Fire other than the Gate? Nay! On the Day when the mountains become like carded wool, We shall make known to you the Cause of the Gate around the Fire, praised in truth upon truth. As for him whose heart resteth steadfast upon change, he shall be in the life of the Cherubim, rejoicing in truth around the water. And as for him whom symbols have veiled from symbols, he is among the companions of the Fire in the depths of Sijjin, having been mentioned. O People of the Book! Do not divide the religion for yourselves after the Book hath come from God, purified in truth, inscribed in truth. Verily God hath ordained therein precious books, concealed in the mystery of mysteries. None can touch it save after it is published from the perspicuous scrolls from the presence of the Gate, having been witnessed. Such is God's decree from around the Fire\[...\]

Verily God hath ordained therein precious books concerning the most hidden mystery, which none can touch save after the spreading of the pages of clear evidence from before the Gate, as witnessed. Such is God's decree from around the fire, and verily it hath been firmly ordained by the Truth with truth. O servants of the All-Merciful! Doth aught besides this Most Great Word command you to worship none but your Lord God, the Truth, with sincere devotion to Him, turning away from all gates? This is God's eternal religion established with justice in truth throughout all the Tablets, and hath been inscribed in the Mother Book. Whoso transgresseth from this Word, the pure path of God, is among the most evil of creatures and shall be cast into the heart of the fire. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! We have expanded thy breast regarding the Cause in all things, with truth, in wondrous wise. And verily We have exalted thy mention in the Gate that people may know Our power, that God is more glorious than the description of the worlds, and He, God, hath ever been independent of the worlds. Verily God brought Joseph to his full strength through His power in the wonder of his being, without reference to the gathering or severance of separation, according to the decree of the Book as had been ordained in the mystery of origination. We gave him wisdom by Our command and knowledge of Our mystery, and thus do We reward the doers of good among Our servants who are mentioned in truth around the Gate. We intended by "full strength" regarding Our servant that God gave him sovereignty's decree and knowledge of the Book, irrevocably ordained in truth with truth. Verily God rewardeth the doers of good among the people of the Gate with the like of that reward, and God hath power over all things.

Surih of Power

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

And she in whose house he was sought to seduce him, and she closed the doors and said: "Come hither!" He said: "God forbid! Truly my Lord has made good my dwelling place. Verily the wrongdoers shall never prosper." Alif Lam Mim Sad. God has sent down clear proofs in this Book with truth, that perchance the people may not deny Our signs unjustly. We have indeed sent down the Book unto thee in accord with the previous Book, letter by letter, in both revelation and interpretation, with truth upon truth, that people may know that their Lord, the Most Merciful, has power over all things. O people of the Throne! Hear My call from around the Fire in the leaves of these branches. God has revealed unto Me: "Verily, I am God, there is no God but Me. The Remembrance, the Letter Ha, has indeed descended around the Fire on the Night of Power." Can you perceive aught of the true measure of the Night of Power through the Remembrance's truth? Nay, then nay! The Night of Power is better than a thousand months, and this has been inscribed in the Mother Book. The Day of Remembrance with God has no limit, for limits belong to those who are limited, as recorded in the Mother Book. He sets the bounds by God's leave, and He is God, the Witness over all things. The angels and the Spirit descend in that Gate by God's permission, rank upon rank, like an extended line around the Pole. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Greet them, for dawn has broken, and say to the believers: "Is not the morning near, according to the Mother Book?" O believers! The Fig and the Olive have been joined on that firm Mount, and this indeed is the frequented City of Truth, even as it has been written in the Mother Book. We have placed in all things a sign from the Gate, which is the best measure from the Great Mystery, as recorded with God. Then We reduced you to the lowest fire in drinking love from the calf, and this was decreed in the Mother Book as a firm decree. Should people deny thee, say: "Is not God the most just of judges on the approaching Day of Judgment?" Know, O people of earth, that God has appointed two gates with the Gate aforetime, that He might teach you His Cause with truth by truth, witnessed around Him. God has ordained for you in the Gate a gate of permission, that it might bring you to the Gate by His leave, for God is merciful to the believers. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Beseech God in thy Cause, for the people have risen in unbelief, and were it not for God's grace upon them and thy mercy, none would ever purify another. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! The abode of the Hereafter is better for thee and thy followers than this world and its pleasures, for it has been decreed in the revelation. Guide them to the meeting with God in the Paradise of Heaven, for it has been their intended goal with God in truth. Say to the believers: If you find seekers at the Gate, deny them not and give them glad tidings of the Cause and patience, for morning has truly dawned brilliantly around the sun. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Be not harsh with the people of blindness, for they are orphans without the Remembrance of the Most Great Remembrance.

Be patient, for verily the morn hath in truth dawned with luminous radiance from around the Sun. O Solace of the Eye! Deal not harshly with the people of blindness, for they are orphans bereft of the remembrance of the Most Great Remembrance. Guide them to the subtlest waters in a glass vessel most delicate, for they are indeed bondservants to the mystery, and thou art the Truth, possessed of great bounty, and God is witness over all things.

O people of the earth! Verily night hath enveloped all, and day hath been made manifest at the dawning-place of the Sun in truth, and this Day is now at its zenith, with water upon water encircling the fire, made visible.

God hath created no being, male or female, save for the fire of the hearts which speaketh laudably around the ocean. As for him who giveth himself in love of the fire and guardeth himself from the fire, he is among the people of Paradise, recorded as being around the fire.

But as for him who is miserly towards the Gate, who deemeth himself independent of the Gate, who exalteth himself above the Gate, and who denieth the Most Beautiful One Who is the Gate - he is among the people of hell in the land of the Prison, gathered in truth.

Verily the guidance of the Gate's decree is a truth from God, the True One, upon the truth, and the decree hath been determined in the Mother Book. The decree of this world and the next resteth upon the Seal of the Gates at the Point of the Gate around the fire, and hath been conclusively fixed in the Mother Book.

There is no soul but hath been inspired with its wickedness and its righteousness. I am indeed the Mount revealing it in the Mount. This Sun hath risen in truth upon the horizon of blindness, and this Day hath become witnessed for God, the Most High. This Moon hath appeared and been made manifest, and its manifestation through the decree of fire hath been determined in the Mother Book.

Say: O Solace of the Eye! I am in truth the Gate of God. I give you to drink, by God's leave, from the pure spring, the water of manifestation upon the face of the Mount. For this Gate let the strivers strive for God, the Truth, and He is God, powerful over all things.

O Remembrance of God! Read in the name of thy Most Great Lord within thyself - there is no God but He, the Most High, and God is knowing of all things. Read, and thy Lord is Most Knowing of what He hath manifested in thy heart - there is no God but He, the Mighty, and God is witness over thee.

Call unto God in the path of this Gate, the path of God in the heavens and earth and what lieth between them. Verily God hath been unto thee a witness from the Truth of truths. Make manifest the Cause by God's leave through a letter of the most hidden mystery within the veils, upon the melody of the birds from the blindness in the reddened leaves of the Tree of Signs, that people might know the truth of God in the remembrance of the Remembrance from among our followers, the Arabian Muhammad, whose Cause hath been inscribed in all the Tablets.

O ye believers! Know ye not that I see your deeds apart from the Gate cast down upon the earth without truth? By the Lord of heaven and earth, your deeds apart from the Gate are indeed cast aside before God. O people of the earth! Hearken unto God's call from this Arabian Youth whom He hath chosen for Himself\[...\]

O people of earth! Verily your deeds before God have been cast aside, bereft of the Door. O people of earth! Hearken unto the call of God from this Arabian Youth, whom He hath chosen for Himself. He is, in truth, by the truth, ordained to be round about the Fire. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say what thou willest of the mystery of the Glorious One, for verily the ocean, by God's leave, the Wondrous, hath been made to overflow. Verily the allurement which was in His house sought to tempt Him from His own self, from God, the Truth. And the doors were shut against the mystery of the manifestation of the Gate. And the veils of glory said: "Come hither!" from the mystery of mysteries, secretly. He said: "God forbid! Verily God is my Lord. He hath made goodly my dwelling with Him. And verily it is forbidden unto me, for God doth not prosper the work of them that join partners with Him, by the Most Great Truth. And verily God, my Lord, is witness over all things."

Surih of the Seal

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

And she desired him and he would have desired her had he not seen the evidence of his Lord. Thus did We turn away from him evil and indecency. Indeed, he was of Our sincere servants. Verily We have sent down this Book unto Our servant that ye may believe in God and His friends, and that ye may perform righteous deeds in the path of the Gate for the sake of God, the Most High, the Praiseworthy. And verily We have sent unto you a mortal who confirmeth that which ye possess and that which was with those before you in truth. Why do ye not believe in God concerning that which God hath sent down unto His servant? Do ye not fear God on the Day of Judgment for your deeds? Soon shall We scatter you utterly in truth, and ye shall find none besides God, the Most High, the Powerful. And verily God accepteth naught from anyone save from him who cometh unto the Gate through the Gate in pure truth for the sake of God, the Ancient of Days, besides Whom there is no other God, and verily He hath been witness over all things. Follow not any of the idolaters, and leave them in the fire according to what God hath ordained in the decree of the Gate as irrevocable.

O people of the earth! Swear not by the Most Great Name in this secure city - Ali the Great - for verily in the sight of God, the Truth, he hath been great in truth. Say: I am indeed the solution in this Sacred Land - this Sacred Land of God - which hath been witnessed in the Mother Book as the land of the heart. And say: Hath not the Ordainer of destiny created you in this established city? Why then do ye not enter this Gate, prostrating yourselves before God, the One, Who verily hath been praised in truth in the Mother Book? Do people think that the Remembrance seeth not their deeds? Nay, for He is the Witness from God, their Lord, over all the worlds together. Say: Hath not God given you two eyes, a tongue and two lips that ye may learn from the decree of the Gate concerning the two exalted, mighty First Names?

O Solace of the Eyes! Say: God hath placed the decree of those who came before in a ring of red carnelian, and of the believers in a ring of yellow pearl, and of the idolaters in a ring of green iron. God hath placed His decree in thy hands in very truth - dispose of it as thou willest for whatsoever thou willest. And verily God hath been transcendent in truth and all-encompassing. O Solace of the Eyes! Thou art the dawn after the night, on the tenth of the sacred month of Ashura. And thou art the odd prayer after the two even ones, as God hath ordained, witnessed in the Mother Book. And thou art the day after the night, inscribed in the Mother Book around the Fire.

Say: I am indeed the Doer by God's leave in the two Points of the First Ones and in the two Centers of the Last Ones. And I am the Fire in the upright Alif between the two seas. I drowned Pharaoh and Ad and Thamud by God's leave in one of the two gulfs, and I saved Noah and Abraham and Moses in one of the two seas. And I am the mystery in the two mysteries, and I am the line in the two lines, and I am the truth in the two names when the two earths are shaken and the two heavens are cleft asunder and the Remembrance speaketh from the two mounts. On that day - the Day of Truth - the Spirit and the angels shall come in two ranks. And I, in truth, decree for the believers these two gardens, and decree for the idolaters the decree of the sun \[...\]

O people of the earth, do you not behold the signs from God, how they have been sent down in pure truth concerning the Remembrance around the hidden water? He is the heaven in ancient loftiness which We have established, raised around the water. He is the mountains in their firm establishment which We have set up, extended around the fire. He is the earth made subject between Our hands, acting in the kingdom as He wishes according to what God has willed, in truth upon truth, in wondrous innovation. God has ordained naught between Me and the Most Great Remembrance, for He is the Self-Sufficient in truth by truth, and God suffices as a witness between Me and him concerning the Command. Say: Your return unto Me has been inscribed in the Mother Book around the Line. Then upon Me is your reckoning in the land of the Return, according to what God has decreed, recorded around the Throne. Has there come to you the account of the Overwhelming One from before the Gate, praised around the fire by the fire? On that Day, the faces of the believers shall be humble before the Most Great Remembrance, and abasement shall cover them in their standing, but God is ever merciful to the believers. And on that Day, the faces of the polytheists shall be in veils of fire, hidden around the fire. God has ordained no food for them save from a boiling spring that neither nourishes nor avails them aught, and God has prepared for them a painful chastisement in justice upon the truth. O Solace of Mine eyes! Glorify thy Lord, the Most High, the Praised One. He it is Who created thee at the midmost point for the peoples of earth and heaven, around the fire by the fire, upon the Strong Truth by the Wondrous Truth, upright. Say then in the Great Covenant whatsoever thou willest, save what God, the Truth by Truth, willeth. Verily He knoweth what is proclaimed and what is hidden in the breasts, and there around the fire thou wert commanded. O Solace of Mine eyes! Say: Verily I am the Night-Star in the heaven of the Throne, and ye do naught but God hath over you swift watchers. Doth not man consider from what thing We created him aforetime when he was as nothing in Our kingdom? Verily We created him from camphor water, sprinkled upon him from the Spring of Manifestation, in that Gate according to the decree of the Book, by the command of the Gate, accomplished. Verily We ordained the human form from water - water from two waters between two souls - which existed by the wondrous permission of God, the All-Wise. And God, your Lord, hath power to return that clay in truth by truth. Verily We shall unveil the secrets on the Day of Resurrection from within yourselves in truth by truth; there shall ye bear witness unto the Most Great Remembrance through what God hath placed within you of His signs. Verily He is the Truth and is witness over all things. Would ye plot against God's Most Great Remembrance with your vain imaginings, a grievous plot against the truth? By God! Verily those in heaven \[...\]

Verily We have unveiled the secrets on the Day of Resurrection from within your own selves with truth through truth, whereupon ye shall surely bear witness unto the Most Great Remembrance through what God hath placed within your souls of His signs. He, verily, is the Truth and hath ever been, over all things, a Witness. Would ye seek to devise a grievous plot against the Supreme Remembrance of God through your idle fancies, a plot devoid of truth? By God! All who dwell in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them are, before Me, as frail as a spider's web, and God is, over all things, a Witness. They plot against none but themselves, and the Remembrance, through God, is truly independent of all who dwell in earth and heaven.

Surah of Solution

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful

She ran to the door and tore his garment from behind, and they found her master at the door. She said: "What shall be the recompense of one who intended evil against thy household, save imprisonment or grievous chastisement?"

Alif. Lam. Ra. God is He besides Whom there is no God, the Lord of the Glorious Throne. There is nothing like unto Him, and He is God, Who hath ever been All-Knowing.

He to Whom belongeth the mystery of the heavens and earth, and He is the Truth that encompasseth all creation.

Verily this heaven hath, in the Mother Book, according to the decree of the Book, its mansions.

And verily this Day hath its covenants with the believers.

And verily this Witness hath, by God's leave, been made manifest in truth in all the Tablets round about the Fire.

They who have believed in God and performed righteous deeds in the path of the Gate - these are they who have attained forgiveness in the House of God, the All-Loving.

He is the Truth, there is no God but He, the Lord of the Glorious Throne, and He is God, Who hath ever been All-Knowing, the Ancient of Days.

And He is God Who hath caused the Quran to be sent down in the Preserved Tablet as glorious images of the Praiseworthy Gate.

And verily God, from behind all things, doth in truth encompass all things with truth.

O peoples of the earth! Fear ye God from the mighty grasp of this Arabian Youth, this Citizen of Medina, Who hath been, round about the Fire, possessed of tremendous power.

No soul hath recognized Him but hath attained, round about the Water, unto the great triumph.

He is the One known through wondrous verses from God, the All-Wise, besides Whom there is no God, and He is God Who hath ever been Witness over all things.

He is the Mystery in the squared line, mystical round about the Fire in truth, and in the first solution, Hebrew, having been witnessed in every Book round about the Water.

O ye believers! Call upon God your Creator for Our deliverance, in truth and by truth, through this Gate round about the Water abundantly.

If ye be truthful in what ye call upon Us, verily We have sent down from Our presence a mortal like unto you to remind you of the days of God, the Most High, Who hath ever been, in the Mother Book, near at hand.

No soul hath followed Him but We have prescribed for him the balance of truth from Our deliverance, and he hath been in Our pavilion a witness to the truth by the truth.

Is He Who guideth unto the truth more worthy to be followed, or he who findeth not guidance unless he himself be guided? What aileth you? How is it that ye believe so little in Our verses of truth upon truth most wondrous?

O ye believers! What aileth you? How is it that ye remove your journeys far from the dwellings of God? This Gate is your abode, after there hath come unto you in truth, by truth, from Our presence with mighty truth, a weighty Message.

By God the Truth! God hath not prescribed for you, beyond this Our Servant, any town besides Us, if ye be faithful to Our verses in truth upon truth.

God is He besides Whom there is no God. There is nothing like unto Him, and He is God, Who hath ever been Powerful over all things.

Verily God hath forbidden success unto those who desire Us from \[...\]

Verily God hath forbidden success unto those who seek Us from behind the gate, and this verily proceedeth from the work of Satan. And on the Day of Resurrection none beside God, the True One, shall be his protector. This Quran hath been sent down from God unto you in truth that ye might be forbearing regarding Our signs at the gate. O believers! Turn ye all unto God, the Praiseworthy. The Truth, by the truth, upon the truth, declareth: No soul hath turned away from Our remembrance but We shall turn away from it on the Day of Resurrection, and it shall find no helper besides God, the Most High. Let not this vain world deceive you with its delusions regarding God, the Praiseworthy. For this world of yours is vain and rootless in the sight of God, and naught shall profit you on the Day of Resurrection besides God, your True Lord, not even in the slightest measure. Know ye that the Hereafter is indeed the true life with God, your True Lord, were ye but conscious thereof at the gate, in the gate, in truth, as praised witnesses. O believers! Precede not the gate, the gate of God your Lord, for at the threshold ye shall have the garments of your knowledge rent from behind you. Why perceive ye not even a small portion of God's covenant, the Most High, in truth and by the truth? God hath related the story of Joseph when the gate was sought, and the woman rent his garment from behind, and they found her lord at the gate standing there. We interpret through exposition whatsoever We will from God's mighty Book, and He is God, powerful over all things. God hath made Me a witness over the Mother Book and all the Tablets, in truth and by the truth. Through this distant narrative We desire to make a near allusion to the Point of Fire and its course. God hath decreed in the Mother Book for those who make false and deluding references to Us from behind the gate, rending the garment of Our authority without right, they are those who speak evil against their Lord at the gate (as she said "What is the recompense of one who intended evil for thy family save imprisonment or grievous punishment?") which was inscribed in the Mother Book. We delivered Joseph from her evil and increased her in rebellion for what she had contrived within herself, though the end of her affair was praised according to the decree of the Book from the gate. The decree hath come from God in this Book from a line among the lines of the gate, hidden yet true. As for those who unite God with the mention of another, the decree of fire is sealed against them, and the matter hath been determined in the Mother Book. We shall imprison them in a casket of iron, and God hath prepared for them, in truth and by the truth, a grievous punishment from the Point of Fire.

Surih of Lights

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

He said, "It was she who sought to seduce me," and a witness of her own household testified: "If his shirt is torn from the front, then she speaks the truth and he is of the liars."

Remember how God, the Most High, hath set forth in the scrolled mystery, encircling that line which was inscribed in the Mother Book round about the Fire. Verily this Book's ordinances are exalted, a truth from the presence of the All-Informed, beside Whom there is no God, and it was in truth sent down. Glorified then be He Who hath raised up the Remembrance from Our presence unto His presence, nearer than the twinkling of an eye, and there wert thou witnessed round about the Fire.

O people of Paradise! Hearken unto God's call from the leaves of the Camphor Branch round about this Tree of Sinai. Verily, I am God, there is no God but Him. I have established the Remembrance for Myself in truth, and whatsoever hath sought refuge at that Gate, arising in truth from His Command, I have protected it from the Fire. Indeed the promise of your Lord, the All-Merciful, is true, and He is God, the Witness over all things.

Say: God knoweth Our permission granted to the believers round about the Gate concerning every matter. Thou art but God's mystery within the most hidden mystery, and verily God, thy Lord, is knowing of all things.

O Solace of Mine eyes! Reveal nothing from the unseen that would cause people to differ regarding the Gate in ways contrary to truth. Say: This Book is My proof from God - let him who will, believe, and him who will, deny. By your Lord! God's proof is truth and it is the greatest of God's signs in truth unto His servant. After this Book, God's proof unto all the worlds hath been most eloquently established in truth \[...\]

Fear God in mentioning the Remembrance contrary to truth, for verily it hath been decreed by the Fire round about the Fire. God hath willed to create a melody in the leaf which hath emerged by His leave from the thicket of Paradise, that people might witness in the yellow, moving line at the two stations the truth of the Most Great Remembrance. And verily God is witness over all things.

O Solace of Mine eyes! Grant her leave to wear wool unto the seventieth, for she hath been stationed at the Gate, the Gate of Permission. Verily she is a melody from the hidden letter of the B in relation to the Most High. He is God, the Witness over all things.

And I bear witness concerning the Remembrance by the Remembrance on the day when the sun emerged at the zenith of the two points, standing before Him, speaking: "Verily Thou art the mystery of the ancients in the two abodes, and Thou art the line of the latter ones in the two particles, and Thou art the sun of heaven from the Throne in the two cycles, and Thou art the equatorial line of truth in the two spheres, and nothing is seen in truth in all the worlds except that Thou art foremost with the two letters - the hidden letter above the line with the two lines." And verily my Lord, God, beside Whom there is no God, is witness over all the worlds.

O ye believers! Fear God regarding the Word of Truth, for God hath enjoined upon the Muslims to convey the Cause to every land. Go forth from your territories and summon the people through this Most Great Book to the Holy Land. And if ye are unable, then write the Cause upon purified pages in pure red gold ink to every land from the East of the earth \[...\]

And if ye be unable, then write ye the Command on pages of pure white with ink of burnished gold, and send it unto all lands of the East and West of the earth, for verily God's decree in this matter hath ever been stern with truth by truth.

O concourse of divines! God hath, after this Book, forbidden you to teach from aught else. Teach ye the people the ordinances of the Book and turn away from the vain books uprooted among you, for verily the Book of God is the truth and God hath ever been witness to what ye do.

O people of the earth! I have sent down unto you the Gates during Mine absence, yet none among the believers followed them save a few. And I sent unto you in times past Ahmad and in recent times Kazim, but none followed them except the sincere among you. What aileth you, O people of the Book, that ye fear not God, your true and ancient Lord?

Hath God given you permission to transgress against Me, or do ye judge according to the judgment of the Evil One for yourselves? Fear God and let not vain desires uprooted from Satan delude you, for verily God and His chosen ones are truth, while ye and what ye worship besides God are polytheists by the decree of the Book. God shall soon judge between Me and you with truth by truth in the one arena, and He is God Who hath ever been just and wise with truth upon truth.

O ye believers! I adjure you by God the Truth - have ye found from these Gates any decree other than God's decree, the decree of this Book? Doth knowledge delude you in your unbelief? Then wait, for God your true Lord is with you as a watchful guardian with truth by truth.

By your Lord! We shall surely make you pause at the Bridge in the land of baked clay, and We shall surely question you concerning what ye utter with your tongues, perform with your hands, and imagine in your minds regarding the Gates as being a decree from God - with truth by truth - an irrevocable decree. Save those who repented, turned unto God, followed the Remembrance and the Book, and helped God's greatest Remembrance in holy war - these shall soon meet Me with the greatest mercy, for verily I have ever been forgiving and merciful to the believers.

Verily We ordained the two Gates in the circuit of the water as two signs: We effaced the sign of night and made the sign of this day illuminating, that ye might seek your portion from the greatest Remembrance, and verily God hath ever been merciful to the believers.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say to the illustrious divine Ja'far the 'Alavi: Thou art upon the truth if thou art prostrate before the Gate of God - thou wert in the Mother Book praised before God the Truth, and He is God Who hath ever been witness over thee with truth by truth. By thy Lord! Thou shalt never cleave the earth in truth without the Gate, nor reach the mountains in height without the Remembrance - with truth by truth. He is assuredly the Truth from God the Truth through the Most Great Word unto all the worlds. If thou hast followed His Cause, We have verily made thee in this world an exalted pillar unto all beings, and thou shalt assuredly be with Us in the highest companionship in the hereafter by leave of God the Exalted, and He is God Who hath ever been witness over all things.

This is from what God hath revealed unto thee in the path of wisdom. Wait thou then for Our supreme Command with utmost truth and aid this Arabian Youth, Our greatest Remembrance, for verily God's victory and His days have ever been near in the Mother Book.

Say: O people of the earth, ascribe not any partner unto God, for verily this Gate, from before God, the Most Great, hath been singular and witnessed in His Cause. Woe unto those who speak grievous words concerning the Most Great Remembrance! Say: Were there another Gate with Him, as ye claim, ye would surely have sought a way unto the remnant of God, the true Guardian. Glorified be God and exalted above what the deniers falsely attribute to Him. He is the Self-Sufficient above all things, and He is God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

O thou beloved one! Say, by leave of God the Most Great, unto Our servant Abdul-Khaliq the All-Knowing, that God hath guided thee unto His Most Great Remembrance in the known months, though thou perceived naught of His most upright Cause in His greatest deed. Verily God hath shown thee in thy inmost heart somewhat of His most upright Cause, and God hath been, in truth, a witness over thee.

O thou friend! Fear not separation from what thou hast missed in the days of attainment. Turn unto Me with the greatest assistance and be unto God as iron made incandescent by the ancient fire, whereby naught toucheth it save it is consumed by love of the Remembrance. I have seen thee inscribed in the Mother Book as among the people of Paradise in the vicinity of the Gate.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say unto the great elder Hasan al-Arabi of the family of Al-Asfur, whom God hath caused to dwell on the island of the sea: Thou art indeed upon truth from thy true Lord. Aid thou Our word and His true Book, and call the people unto the pure religion, for God hath been witness over thee, and thou hast been inscribed with God among the people of Paradise.

O ye believers! Lower unto your parents the wing of humility out of mercy, and call upon God in truth, the crimson leaf with the Muhammadan tint, that God may forgive them both in truth. When ye are before the Gate, in the precincts of the Gate, ye shall be shown mercy through permission. Say not unto them "Fie" nor turn away from their command. Be in their obedience like snow upon your heart in a day of heat, for God hath made their rights great over the servant, in truth by the truth.

O people of the earth! Fear God regarding this Leaf, detached from the Tree of Oneness, for it is indeed truth, just as God and His chosen ones are truth, and God hath been witness over all things.

O people of the air! This is the Most Great Word, frowning in the Cause, which hath been around the fire by leave of God, the Truth, and He is God, the Most High, the Great.

Verily We have established the heavens and the earth, then caused them to dwell upon the line between the two rows in this Gate, by leave of God, the Praiseworthy, the Ancient, there is no God but He, and He is God, witness over all things.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Make known unto the Concourse of Lights the right of God in thy true self, through the most hidden secret manifest in truth, which hath been witnessed as recognized among them around the fire.

Verily God, my Lord, is the Truth, and naught hath God shown me but I have seen God therein.

And verily I beheld God alone, there is no God but Him, and none beside Him save Him. This is the supreme truth of God concerning My Own Self, established upon the Most Great Truth, and verily God hath ever been witness over all things, when He said: "She sought to make me yield myself to her," and God and His loved ones suffice as witnesses unto Me, by virtue of the Most Great Truth, resting upon the mighty Truth.

The Surah of Kinship

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

Praise be to God Who hath communed with Our servant with truth upon the letters of unity above the lines, which were witnessed at the Dawning-Place of the Manifestation. This is a Book which hath been sent down concerning the most hidden Mystery, veiled by the Most Great Mystery, in the upright line at the dayspring, concerning the essence of mysteries -- a sending down indeed. God is He besides Whom there is no God, the Truth, and He is engaged each day in a fresh creation, and He is God, powerful over all things.

We have indeed observed thy letter in certain days concerning those who are near, and We shall verily judge them on the Day of Resurrection by these pages. God, your Lord, the Truth, is assuredly the Truth, and He shall soon guide them to His mighty path with truth and power.

We have observed thy response to the letter, and likewise concerning the page sent down from the Holy Land. Soon shall We teach the people through the Most Great Remembrance, the remembrance of God, the Exalted, through truth and power.

O merchants dwelling on land and sea! Fear ye regarding the Most Great Word and send to the Most Great Remembrance, after knowing His land, whatsoever hath been written by His hands or written by His leave unto you in the days of commerce. For verily the pages issuing from His hands are tablets from the holy pages, and God hath forbidden all souls from any portion thereof except by His Most Great permission. God is indeed All-Knowing of His believing servants, and this Remembrance, this Arabian Youth, is verily a witness to what ye do.

We have indeed observed thee today in thy greatest writing upon the page sent to the soul near to the evil city. God shall soon guide those who are near to His exalted path by the decree of the Book, by leave of the Gate - a matter decreed. Save him who hath fooled himself after the Book regarding the Most Great Remembrance, for he is indeed far from the Gate.

God shall judge between people with truth on the Day of Resurrection, and the Remembrance wrongeth not anything by anything, not even the husk of a date-stone.

O ye great ones and some of the lesser ones among the kindred of the Most Great Remembrance! God hath prescribed for you, after knowing the Most Great Remembrance - Who hath been among you from His childhood to the known day - to migrate unto Him in whatever land God hath willed for Him. By your Lord, the Truth, besides Whom there is no God, if ye were to be in His presence with sincerity for less than the twinkling of an eye, it would benefit you more than many deeds, and would be more profitable than filling the world with offerings in the path of God, the Truth. So desire ye the Most Great Word and follow not the footsteps of Satan, for God hath called you to Paradise while Satan calleth not the people save unto the Fire. This decree hath been written in the Mother Book.

O Concourse of Lights! Hearken unto My call from this crimson leaf upon this white Tree on that Mount Sinai: "Verily, I am God, there is no God but I. I have named this Remembrance with two names from Myself for the two beloved ones from among My servants, and I have named his grandfather Ibrahim in the Throne \[...\]"

Verily I have named on the Throne his grandfather Ibrahim and his father with a name from among the first beloved ones, and his mother Fatimih the Pure, that those endued with understanding may witness at the Dayspring of the chosen ones the mystery of lights from One mighty and forgiving, besides Whom there is no God, and verily God is powerful over all things.

O people of the cloud! Hearken unto My call from the tongue of the Gate, this Arabian Youth speaking in Sinai with the melody of the Point of Praise - God, there is no God but Him. Verily We preserved thee from the Point of Beginning in pure and sanctified loins until this Day - the sealed Point that was promised.

God hath manifested this Youth among a company of pure and noble ones, that none should doubt concerning His Cause, which is the Supreme Truth, and verily God was wise and knowing concerning the Truth.

O kindred of the Most Great Remembrance! This blessed Tree, reddened with the oil of servitude, hath grown at the point of fire in your lands, yet ye perceive nothing of it - neither its pure and holy attributes, nor its true angelic conditions, nor its firm and perfect movements. Ye imagine in your own minds something other than the Supreme Truth, while with God He is the very Proof of the Supreme Truth, and was in the Mother Book at the point of fire called to account.

O kindred of that Great Word! If ye believe in Him and aid His Cause, verily We shall forgive your sins and shall inscribe for you a double reward for your deeds, and ye shall dwell in the holy precincts near unto God, the Truth, in the vicinity of the Gate. But if ye deny Our Remembrance and this true Book, by the Truth of God We shall surely punish you twice over in the vicinity of the fire, and ye shall find no helper in the hereafter besides God, the Exalted.

Was not this sublime honor from God sufficient for you from the Most Great Remembrance? Therefore repent unto God for what hath proceeded from yourselves against the holy glory of the Remembrance without right. Verily We have faithfully rendered, by God's leave, the Guardian of the believers, your rewards doubled, and verily God is witness over all things.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Convey to the women of thy kindred the decree of the Most Great Word, and warn them of the Greater Fire, and after the Most Great Covenant give them glad tidings of the eternal Paradise of Ridvan from God around the Holy Place, and verily God, the Lord of all worlds, is powerful over all things.

O Mother of the Remembrance! The peace of the Lord be upon thee! Thou hast shown patience in the Cause of God, the Exalted. Therefore recognize the station of thy son, the Most Great Word, for He shall be questioned concerning thy grave and the day of thy gathering, and thou wert inscribed as the Mother of the Believers in the Preserved Tablet by the hands of the Remembrance.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Write for the pure Fatimid women of thy household from the city of the All-Merciful, forbidding departure to the Holy Land in this great year until such time as the Most Great Remembrance permits, according to what He knoweth through God's knowledge concerning the people of His household in that Gate by the Supreme Truth. The people know but a small letter of the knowledge of the Book.

O Concourse of Lights! Hearken unto My call from the Point of Fire in this encompassing sea of white water upon that red earth. Verily I am God, there is no God but Him. I have contracted upon the Throne the mystery of the beloved name from the First Beloved for this Most Great Remembrance\[...\]

The people know but a single letter from the knowledge of the Book. O Concourse of Lights! Hearken unto My call from the Fire-Point in this All-Encompassing Ocean of white water upon that crimson earth. Verily, I am God, there is no God but Him. I have established upon the Throne the beloved mystery of the Name from the First Beloved for the Most Great Remembrance. And verily I have made the angels of heaven and the dwellers of Ridvan on the Day of the Covenant bear witness to the Most Great Truth concerning the Remembrance through the Remembrance. How great is the bounty of the Most Great Remembrance! O thou who art beloved of the Beloved before My Beloved! Thou art not like any other women if thou followest God's command in the Most Great Truth. Know thou the mighty right of the Ancient Word for thyself, and glory in sitting with the Beloved, the Most Great Beloved of God. This glory from the All-Wise, the All-Praised, suffices thee. Be patient in the face of destiny regarding the Bab and His people. Verily thy son Ahmad is with the glorious Fatima in the Holy Paradise, in truth upon truth, having been nurtured in truth with knowledge. And verily those who behold the Light before the Mount above the realm of Glory are, in truth upon truth, veiled. These are they who, by Our leave, see around God's Ancient Mystery the Light before the Mount at the Dawning-Place of the Manifestation, which was witnessed at the Gate. And verily those who see the golden leaf reddened by the stone fire together with the tree formed around the fire by the craft of the Most Great Wise One - these are they who, around the center of the second M from the letter of the name Muhammad the Arab, have been inscribed in the Mother Book as of the truth. O Solace of Mine eyes! Give to those of kinship among the people of the cloud their portion according to the mystery of the mystic line veiled in secrecy around the Fire. Give to the poor ones, the people of the depths of love, in the Most Great Truth, a drop from this water filtered from the fresh golden chalice by leave of God, the Wise One, along the paths of wisdom. And verily God, thy Lord, is witness over all things. Give in truth upon truth to the wayfarers - this is God's path in the heavens and earth and what lies between them - according to the station of each beneath the green horizontal veils, by leave of God thy Lord, the Truth. And verily He has ever encompassed all things through some things in truth upon truth. O Solace of Mine eyes! Stretch not forth thy hand in the Cause, for the people are intoxicated with the Mystery. Verily thou shalt have return after this cycle in the Most Great Truth. There reveal from the Mystery a mystery to the measure of a needle's eye at the Most Great Mount, that the people of Sinai may die at the dawning of a drop of that Dominant crimson Light, by leave of God the Wise. And He is God, Who has ever been thy Guardian in truth upon truth. O Solace of Mine eyes! Look upon the people with piercing vision - dost thou find any soul therein save those intoxicated with the Most Great Mystery? By God the Truth! I have seen them drunk with the mighty wine, save the fewest of those who preceded in My Most Great Covenant. And they, in truth steadfast despite their differences due to their precedence with God the Truth, have been inscribed in the Mother Book. O people of the earth! This My Mystery \[...\]

And they are upon the manifest Truth by virtue of their precedence with God, the True One -- thus have they been inscribed in the Mother Book. O people of the earth! This mystery of Mine is truly arduous, most arduous. No soul can bear it in pure truth except after beholding God and His ancient power over all things, according to the Most Great Truth which hath been witnessed at the Dawning-Place of the Heart from before the Gate. There, by leave of God, the Wondrous, the veils of concealment have been lifted from the holy celestial forms of the Youth of the Sinaic Paradise. At that moment, the servant beheld the Beauty of the All-Merciful to the extent that God had ordained for him, less than the eye of a needle in the Most Great Book. And verily God is witness over all things. O Solace of the Eyes! We have established the heavens and earth through Thy Name, the Truth. Then We caused them to rest upon the line drawn between the two lines in this Gate, by leave of God, the Praiseworthy, the Ancient, besides Whom there is no God, and He is God, witness over all things. O people! Fear God, your Lord, from the heat of the Fire of Hell which is fierce in the sight of God. The Truth doth in truth declare: "Verily shall I fill Hell with you on a Day when We shall say unto Hell: 'Art thou filled?' and it shall say: 'Are there any more?' And the decree in the Mother Book hath been fulfilled." O people of Holiness! Slay not yourselves by mere allusion apart from the Gate, for the Command from before the Wondrous One hath been mighty in the Mother Book. And verily We sent a witness from among her people who testified that if his garment was rent from the front, then she spoke truth and he was among the liars before the Most Great Gate, as witnessed in the Mother Book. And if his garment was rent from behind, then she lied and he was among the truthful in the sight of God, and according to the Truth by the Truth, thus was it conjoined with the decree in the Mother Book.

Surih of the Maiden

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

O People of Persia! Doth not this transcendent glory suffice you from before the Most Great Remembrance? Verily God hath chosen you through this Most Great Word. Disperse not from around Him, for by God the Truth, He is indeed the Truth from God, and He is the Exalted One Who, in the Mother Book, hath been wise.

O ye believers! Draw not nigh unto the possessions of the Remembrance except by His leave, and weigh yourselves with the straight Balance. This is a truth in the Most Great Gate, and verily God hath power over all things. Tarry not for the twinkling of an eye in this Cause, for We shall assuredly question you concerning your hearing, sight, and heart, and verily the Command of God from the Remembrance hath been, in the Mother Book, decreed.

O ye believers! God hath forbidden you to enter houses without the permission of their owners, and enter not the House of the Gate except by His leave. Fear ye God and be of those who turn unto the Truth with true repentance.

O ye believers! Call not to the Remembrance from behind His house, for this is an error in the Book of God, and ye know but a fragment of the knowledge of the Book.

O ye believers! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Remembrance, and draw not nigh in walking with Him except by His leave, and proceed not before Him, and hold not private discourse in His presence, for all these are evils in the sight of God, your True Lord, according to what God hath prescribed in His preserved Book of Truth.

O people of the earth! Hold fast to the cord of God, the Impregnable - Our Remembrance, this Arabian Youth Who hath been concealed at the point of ice upon seas of fire. Remember in His presence, after His permission, God's favors upon you, and conceal not the truth in His presence. Know ye not that God knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and earth, what ye conceal and what ye reveal? He is God, your True Lord, Who hath ever encompassed all worlds.

O ye believers! God hath ordained that ye enter not upon Our servant except by His leave, after your purification in truth and your standing at the Gate, remembering through the magnification of God, your True Lord, upon the pure Truth, a hundred and ten times. God hath decreed for those who turn aside from Our command the fire of hell, and verily God's punishment in the Mother Book hath been exceedingly great.

O people of the Throne! Hearken to the call of your Lord God, besides Whom there is no other God, in supreme truth from the tongue of this Servant, this Arabian Youth, Who hath been, with God the Exalted, wondrously innovative in this mighty Cause. God hath verily revealed unto Me in truth upon this sacred earth: "Verily, I am God; there is no God but Me. Therefore worship Me on the path of this crimson Line, moving in the innovation of the Cause." He hath created all beings that ye might be, in My sight, among My near servants, recorded around the Gate.

O people of the world! Call not upon God regarding His station, for the Line is cut off for all besides Him, and God hath not ordained for anyone the like of what He hath ordained for Him in supreme truth. None after Him is befitting. He is the Light in the two Mounts and the Criterion in the two Cycles, and He is God, powerful over all things.

O people of the Throne! Hear My call from this Arabian, Talismanic Remembrance, Whose station God hath made as fire around the Throne in the sanctuary of the heart.

He is God, the All-Powerful over all things!

O people of the Throne! Hearken unto My call from this mystic and Arabic Remembrance, whose station God hath ordained to be the Fire encircling the Throne in the sanctuary of the heart. He sitteth in truth upon the dust of the earth by God's leave, that He might make known unto men the mysteries of their beginning, until all have testified that their Creator is the True One, God, besides Whom there is no God, and that verily He is His servant and the Gate of His Proof unto all the worlds.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say: I am, by the True God, the truth concerning the truth of your Lord, the All-Merciful, besides Whom there is no God. God and His chosen ones suffice as witnesses unto this knowledge. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Grant permission to the Maid of Paradise to don fair raiment and the most excellent silk veil. Then permit her to emerge from her palace alone upon the earth in the manner of a celestial maiden, and let her hear attributes from the holy fragrances upon the seat of the Throne and the celestial spheres, that perchance the intoxicated ones among the people of earth might become aware of thy Cause, even to the extent of a single hair which God hath placed behind her tresses. Verily God is cognizant of all things.

O people of earth! By the True God, I am indeed a Maiden of Paradise whom Glory hath birthed in a palace of moist and moving ruby. By God, I have seen nothing in that Most Great Paradise but that it spoke of the Remembrance in praise of this Arabian Youth. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, besides Whom there is no God - magnify ye His worth by God's leave, for He standeth at the heart of the Garden of Paradise in the form of glorification within the temple of divine unity. At times I hear His voice from the Ancient Being, and at times from the mystery of His Great Name. When He uttereth the Greatest Name, Paradise trembleth with longing for His presence, and when He glorifieth God, Paradise becometh still as snow upon the summit of a frozen mountain. It is as though I beheld Him moving upon the straight path in all the gardens of His Paradise, in all the heaven of His heaven, and all the earths and whatsoever is therein are but as rings upon the fingers of His servants. Glorified be God, His Creator, Lord of the Ancient Throne! He is none other than the servant of God and the Gate of the Remnant of God, your True Master. Therefore yearn ye for martyrdom in His path according to the true and straight way, for I and those in Paradise truly long with the Greatest Truth for a soul that hath been slain in His path. Verily God seeth whatsoever ye do.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Grant her leave to remove her coarse garments and don her gown in her house, for the people of heaven have trembled at her braided hair beneath her veil. Verily God hath ever been merciful to His believing servants according to the truth. Return thou to the holy place in thy palace, and verily thy reward is with Me in this Book, in a Command written by My hands round about the Fire. God hath ordained between thee and the polytheists, at the time of the recitation of the Qur'an, a hidden veil of truth, by the truth, surrounding the water.

We have indeed preferred some Prophets above others by a word of the Remembrance, and We did verily reveal unto David the Psalms. There is no town but We shall destroy it by God's leave, and We have ever been witness over the worlds according to truth by the truth. God hath not made the vision in thy dream except as a test for mankind \[...\]

Verily God ordained the vision in thy dream as naught but a test for mankind, and verily the accursed tree hath arisen from the mystery of the Quran, and God desireth for the idolaters naught but the fire, a mighty transgression. O people of the earth! When Satan refused to remember God, he was indeed forsaken in the presence of God, the Truth. And verily the accursed one shareth in your souls and your possessions, so fear ye God and place your trust in Him, for the path for those who trust is indeed blocked in truth upon the truth. Neither speak loudly in remembrance nor whisper softly in magnification during battle, and call the people to the two lines, the straight line in prayer, as ordained in the command of the Book. We have verily sent thee in truth around the fire, and in truth hath God sent down the Criterion unto thee around the water, and thou wert indeed inscribed in the Mother Book before the Two Names. And verily those who have been given knowledge, when they recite the Book, fall down upon their faces in prostration unto God, saying: "Glory be to Him besides Whom there is no God! Verily the right of remembrance is in truth the Truth, and the Command hath been inscribed in the Mother Book around the fire." Praise be to God Who hath sent down unto Our servant the Book from the Point of Fire, that God's judgment might be severe upon the worlds after the Remembrance. O Solace of Mine eyes! Warn those from whose mouths hath issued the word of unbelief - and it is a false word before God in truth. Say ye nothing of any connection between Truth and creation, for verily your Lord God is detached from all the worlds. God hath made all that is on earth as a sign for the people of wisdom, that We might fully reward them from before the Gate with what is praiseworthy. Recite unto them from what God hath revealed unto Us from the knowledge of the Book, and God hath not ordained any alteration for Our words from before the Remembrance. By God, besides Whom there is no God! He hath not ordained for you on this day any refuge besides this Youth, in truth upon the truth. O concourse of lights! Be patient by God's leave with those who call upon Us from before the Gate, for God hath ever been merciful and seeing towards His servants. Say: Follow not him whose heart We have made heedless of the command of the Gate, and follow not their vain desires, for they have been inscribed in the Mother Book as among the immoderate ones. Say: The Truth hath come from God with pure truth; whoso God willeth, He willeth for him, and whoso turneth away from the Truth and the Book, verily God is independent of all worlds. O Solace of Mine eyes! Warn the idolaters of the boiling water which is molten brass - evil drink for the opposers and evil is their destined seat upon the coffin. And verily those who find themselves in God's Book at the station of the two limits, the angels have named them by Our leave, in truth upon the truth, as females, and We verily declare concerning them in truth, by what the All-Merciful hath testified regarding them upon the Most Great Truth: "This indeed is of your guile, and verily your guile hath ever been mighty in all the Tablets." Fear ye God and speak naught concerning Our servant except the truth, and God sufficeth, and Our own selves, as witness to the truth of his servitude unto God, the Truth, upon the truth by the truth. When God created Adam and his mate in that Garden, We said unto them: "Draw not nigh unto this Word and hearken from \[...\]"

Hearken unto the songs of the birds immersed in musk-laden waters, warbled from the leaves of Paradise by the leave of God -- verily I am God, there is none other God but Him, and He is God, who hath ever been supremely exalted. This indeed is a Word wherein they that enter shall never hunger, and they that depart shall never be naked, and its people shall hear naught but from it. Exalted and glorified be the Word of God, our Lord, besides Whom there is none other God, and He is God, Who hath ever been supremely wise.

The Surah of Proclamation

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

O Joseph, turn away from this and seek forgiveness for thy sin, for thou hast been among the transgressors. Remember the verses of thy Lord with Us, from One Who is All-Forgiving, Whose mercy embraceth all things, and He is God, independent of all creation. Verily We have sent down the Command among you that ye may know your Creator, Who hath created you and those before you, and ye shall find no change in the true Faith of God. This is Our Book which We have revealed unto Our servant in truth, that ye may judge thereby and sow for yourselves for a Day wherein ye shall possess naught save what ye have reaped in the paths of the Gate, and on that Day ye shall be in need of God, the Most High. God is the Self-Sufficient, and ye are the poor, and there is no God but Him, and He is God, the One worthy of worship in truth. God hath prescribed knowledge for those who fear God their Creator in their private and public affairs, praiseworthy in the paths of the Gate. These are the learned ones in the sight of God, besides Whom there is no God, the True to His Promise, and God is witness unto all things. Verily God is triumphant in His Cause, in truth by truth, and His power extendeth equally over all creation. We have made Our servant Abdullah, Our Remembrance, to prevail over you in the Cause with might. Yet people know not of the knowledge of the Book save a few letters, removed from its inner mystery. Those who wax proud, refusing to prostrate before the All-Merciful, these are the companions of the Fire by the decree of the All-Knowing God, and God is aware of all things. God hath united your hearts through the wisdom from His Gate that ye may aid the Cause of God with your wealth and your souls, and ye shall find no constraint in the Faith of God, for the Command hath been decreed in the Mother Book. O servants of the All-Merciful! By God, there hath come to you a mighty Command from God, the Most High. O people of the earth! If ye hesitate concerning Our Word after this Book, less than what the Book hath recorded in the Mother Book as guardian - by God, We shall cause you to pause upon the Path for a thousand thousand years in just requital for your misdeeds, a precise recompense, and We wrong not creation by so much as the film of a date-stone. Those before you pondered falsely, and We seized from them Our due, with severe justice. What aileth you, O servants of God? How is it that ye believe abundantly in falsehood yet believe little in Our true signs? By God, We desire naught for you save what God hath revealed to Us in His Book. Soon will God show you Our signs upon the Path around the Fire in magnificent wise. God hath given authority to those who believe in His Remembrance and aid His Word in truth by truth around the Gate in praiseworthy fashion. We shall not judge on the Day of Resurrection those who believe not in Him, but We shall judge between you in truth concerning that wherein ye differed falsely and abundantly. He is God, unto Whom there is no likeness, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing, besides Whom there is no God, and He is God, encompassing all creation. God chooseth whom He willeth of Our servants from among those who answer unto God. Believe not in part of the Book while rejecting part thereof, for whoso disbelieveth after this Book, We have decreed for him the severest punishment by the decree of the Book. Fear, O servants of God, the justice of your Lord, the All-Merciful, on a Day \[...\]

O people! Fear God in the day when He shall establish the Balance before you with truth and justice. And whosoever believes in God and His Books and His Messengers and His Signs, making no distinction between any of His signs, has been saved from the great terror and shall enter Paradise by right of truth, without any reckoning.

Be patient, O servants of God, for verily God is with you as a Guardian over truth. God has made Our Cause but a single matter, like the twinkling of an eye, and it is nearer than the glance of vision. God has made Our Cause like unto the letter Kaf in the Primal Word, and verily God has power over all things.

What ails you that you reflect not upon the wonders within yourselves and in the horizons - wonder upon wonder in a hidden glance which was with you but little? We have made a sign from Our servant in all things, concealed in truth around the Gate, that people might know that God is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and God encompasses all things.

O servants of God! Convey the Cause of God from the Gate among you to whomever has a covenant from God concerning the Gate. O servants of the All-Merciful! Remember God, your Creator, through the Most Great Truth from the Gate, and follow not your vain desires after the Truth has come to you from your Lord in this Book through the Most Great Word, for on the Day of Judgment you shall be questioned about the Fire.

Glorify God, your True Lord, as befits His station and as He deserves, in truth, in the path of the Gate, morning and evening, with the Greatest Word, praised around the Gate. O people of East and West! Fear God on the day when the Remembrance calls you from God, the Truth, to battle around the Shrine with the Greatest Word in pure truth, magnifying with magnification God, the Most High, and God is witness over what you do.

O believers! Worship God as He shows you His signs in truth, and await God's Cause in truth every morning and evening in pure truth, for We are with you as Guardian over truth for the Gate. O people of the earth! If you are truthful in Islam, then bring forth a discourse like unto this Book in pure truth. By the Lord of heaven and earth, you shall never be able, even if you were to support one another in the Cause.

Glorified be God, there is no God but Him! None besides God can reveal the Book in truth, and exalted is God far above what the wrongdoers say with great exaltation. O people! Fear God regarding that Greatest Word, for with Him is an earthquake for the earth that shall be mighty. Whoever obeys God and His Word has attained a great victory, and whoever disobeys God and His Gate has strayed far astray.

O people of the Throne! Hear My call from this purified Bird in the atmosphere of the divine cloud, for verily it is knowledgeable of the Book. O Joseph, thou Greatest Gate! Turn away from this tree that has emerged in the Gate upon the earth without truth \[...\]

In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

O Dwellers of the Throne! Hearken unto My call from this purified Bird in the atmosphere of the divine cloud, for verily He hath been, in truth, possessed of a profound knowledge of the Book.

O Joseph! O Most Great Gate! Turn away from this tree which hath emerged from the Gate upon the earth without right, and say unto it: "Seek forgiveness for thy sin, for I have seen thee recorded in the Mother Book as being among the rebellious ones dwelling round about the Fire."

Surah of Might

And the women in the city said: "The wife of the Aziz seeks to seduce her slave-boy from his soul. Indeed, love has pierced her heart. We see her in manifest error." This is pure truth. Remember thy Lord's mercy in His praiseworthy Word, for God hath power over all things.

Verily God hath placed no veil between Us and Our servant in the truth of truth, in aught whatsoever. We have drawn him nigh unto Us and raised him to a station higher than the highest. We bore witness unto him on the Day of Beginning even as God bore witness unto him concerning Our right, that he was, in truth, a praiseworthy servant of God around the Fire.

God beareth witness, even as He beareth witness unto His own Self, that he was among Our followers at a time when none but Us existed before God, the Lord of all worlds, in truth and through truth. I testify by God that he existed at a time when neither day nor age was mentioned in the Mother Book before God.

Know, O servants of God, that God hath made His Cause, in truth and through truth, mighty in the Mother Book. God hath ordained his story in the hidden lines around the veil to be arduous yet near to the truth. Soon will God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, inform you in this Book of His wondrous decrees in truth and through truth around the Fire.

We made him in his youth learned in the knowledge of the Book from the Point of Fire. And We made him in his maturity forbearing over the worlds in truth upon the mighty truth. O people! Doubt not the exalted light of God in any particle of His wisdom, for in the Mother Book it was indeed the intended purpose of the Book.

We made him a shirt from among the shirts of the Beginning, luminous over the worlds. We made him at the Point of the Seal speaking from the station of the Beginning, unique and zealous in truth and through truth. We made him, for Our believing servants among the people of the Gate, All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

God hath clothed him in the robe of might for the truth, that people might witness God in the robe of grandeur through truth, for verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is independent of the worlds. O servants of God! Fear God and be, in the precincts of that Gate, the best helpers of God, the Exalted, the Praiseworthy.

God hath made the Remembrance closer to the people than their own selves in truth, and God is witness over all things. God hath ordained for thee a reward for thy patience in Our Cause, in truth, a sovereignty that befitteth none except thee, for thou wert, through Us, truly knowing.

O Greater Word! Fear not, neither grieve, for We have assured forgiveness of sins to those men and women who respond to thee, concerning all that the knowledge of the Beloved encompasseth, as thou hast willed, by what thou hast willed in truth, and verily God is knowing of all things.

By My life! Turn unto Me and fear not. Thou art the Exalted One in the Supreme Concourse, and thy mystery hath been inscribed upon the Tablet of the worlds around the Fire. Soon will thy Lord give thee sovereignty over all, for His decree encompasseth the worlds.

O Solace of the Eyes! When people come to thee in truth asking that thou seek God's forgiveness for them, by the True One \[...\]

Verily thy Lord shall give thee dominion over all, inasmuch as His decree hath ever encompassed all the worlds. O Solace of Mine eyes! When people come unto thee in truth, seek forgiveness from God on their behalf. By God the Truth! They have found God forgiving and merciful. This is Our Book that speaketh unto you with truth, though aforetime ye were heedless of Our signs concerning this Gate, as inscribed in the Mother Book by leave of God, the Most High. We have verily revealed this Book unto Our servant, that the people round about him may be perpetual witnesses unto the truth. Say: I am not the first among the Gates, nor hath God made me a witness unto the worlds save through His Word of truth. God hath detailed His verses in this Book concerning a mystery among mysteries - none before hath been mentioned thus in the Book. We have sent down verses unto all peoples that they might be remembered near the Gate. We have sent down the Remembrance unto you in truth, and the Command concerning it hath been preserved as a mystery of the Book. God hath protected the believers from the evil of the hypocrites, inasmuch as they were mentioned before the Gate as having faith in the Gate. Were it not for God's grace and His Word unto you, not one among you would ever be purified - a decree eternally sealed in the Book. But God purifieth whom He willeth among His servants - such as have been witnessed near the Gate. God hath willed whatsoever Our servant hath willed in truth, and the decree in the Mother Book hath been fulfilled. O ye believers! What aileth you that ye desire not God in this mighty Gate, the True, the Strong, the Most Powerful? By thy life! We have made thee a witness unto all the worlds through the Most Great Truth. We have given thee from the waters of Kawthar an ocean that hath ever surged above the seas of creation at the Primal Point. O Solace of Mine eyes! Let not thy hand be chained to the mystery within thyself, nor stretch it forth to its utmost in thy Cause, lest the people round the Gate be obliterated and overwhelmed concerning the mystery. God hath ordained no path for any soul unto the Gate save after its dawning for its day and the laying down of its burden of veils and allusions altogether. The women of the city who were veiled said: "This Spirit who was a sign of the All-Merciful through His command seeketh to turn her Lord's command from His purpose. Indeed love for Him hath pierced her heart. Lo! we see her in manifest error." Such was never beloved in the Mother Book. \[...\]

When she heard of their guile, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them, and gave to each one of them a knife. Then she said \[to Joseph\], "Come forth unto them!" And when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands, and they said: "God preserve us! This is no mortal! This is none other than a noble angel!"

KAF. HA. YA. 'AYN. SAD.

This is a mention of the power of God in the Most Great Word, this Youth, whom the believers have truly called 'Ali. Say: He is God, the One! There is no God but Him. Neither slumber nor sleep overtaketh Him. He it is Who hath created all beings through His power, as a token of truth regarding the Bab. And verily God is witness over all things.

We have planted with Our hands, in the Paradise of immortality for this Most Great Remembrance, this Youth, upon the holy ground, trees of sanctity rising threefold toward the Throne of heaven, branching forth like sweet basil. By God! The Remembrance hath found in their fruits, on the day of their first appearance, all manner of fruits that no eye hath seen save His eye, and no ear hath heard save His ear, and that have not entered into the heart of any man save His heart. And verily in the Mother Book this hath been ordained with truth and wisdom.

And We have built with Our hands for this Most Great Remembrance, this Arabian Youth, in the Paradise of the highest heaven a crimson palace of ruby, rising to the Throne of heaven like a polished mirror, wherein each part reflecteth the whole. And this supreme triumph hath been inscribed in God's Primal Book.

Soon shalt thou find that palace with thy Lord upon a ground of white saffron, at the holy dawning-place, vast in its dimensions.

O Solace of the Eyes! Summon the people to the religion of God, the Most Exalted, as God hath willed concerning thee. Verily He encompasseth all the worlds. And remind them of the days of God, which in this Gate have been a mighty remembrance of the Remembrance. And warn the people of God's most great chastisement, which in the Mother Book hath been ordained as a grievous torment in the heart of the Fire.

Soon shalt thou find in truth thy recompense with Us, the like of which God hath not ordained any similitude, nor any equal in truth. We have removed the veils from the eyes of Our servant, who in these days hath been established upon the Most Great Truth, as God hath willed concerning him. Verily He is knowing of all the worlds. He hath seen all that We have seen in his station, without how or limited sign beyond limitation, and all things were witnessed by him in truth.

God warneth you concerning Himself, that ye set up no likeness unto Him through any Gate. He is God, there is no God but Him. Nothing is like unto Him, and God encompasseth all the worlds.

Seek ye forgiveness of God in your dawning hours. Soon shall ye find God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, truly forgiving, and merciful toward the Gate. We have made the night for you as a garment through the Gate, and the day for steadfastness in the Remembrance.

Remember God oft in this Gate, with that which is praiseworthy with your Lord, the All-Merciful. And glorify Him in that Gate morning and evening.

Soon shall ye find your deeds with God inscribed in a tablet by the hands of the Remembrance in very truth.

Verily We have sent down the Book upon the Most Great Word \[...\]

Verily We have sent down the Book upon the Most Great Word, and We have made it in truth a central point upon justice, that the Remembrance might be unto you a sovereign authority from Us, through decisive verses. And We have ordained its decree by God's leave in truth around the water, a thing decreed. This indeed is the truth in the Mother Book with Us, through the wondrous truth, upon the impregnable Word from the Point of Fire, sent forth upon the mountain of hail. We have indeed caused Our word Jacob to grieve in the matter of Joseph with a grieving in truth, and the matter was in the Mother Book momentous. And that was when he paused in Our Cause at the Dayspring of Our power in this Arabian Youth, closer than the twinkling of an eye, and the eye was near unto him in the Mother Book. O people of earth and heaven! You and what you possess of the wondrous mystery were in the Mother Book before the Remembrance but as a speck of the smallest mote. God hath not made you before Our servant save in the form of trinity in a quadrangular shape in a sea of thick blood which was around the Gate existent. O ye believers! If ye know not of his wisdom, verily We shall teach you in truth his wisdom in his patience, and the decree was in the Mother Book momentous. Fear God and draw not near in describing him from the blood of your own selves, for verily he was in the decree from the All-Wise witnessed in truth. When Husayn's sister heard of the standing aloof of her grandfather's followers on the Day of Ashura from God besides Whom there is no other God, she sent unto their souls the sign of love and prepared for them the weapons of war and gave to each one of them a sword wrapped in truth for God, the Truth. Then she said: "O my brother! Show forth unto them of thy majesty less than a needle's eye for God besides Whom there is no other God," and verily He was independent of all worlds. When they beheld him they magnified him and cut their hands in his presence out of their longing for God besides Whom there is no other God, and verily He encompassed all worlds. And they said: "God forbid! This is not Husayn, God's exalted mystery, a mortal! This indeed is the truth and this is a noble king" who was unto the peoples of the heavens and earth in truth generous. O people of the clouds! Say not of those who desire God and come unto Him through His Gate that they seek to seduce a comely Arabian youth, being passionately moved by love for him instead of their own selves. Verily We see them in manifest error unlike the truth. That was but a scheme of your own selves, and soon shall We remove from you the veil after We have prepared for you a reclining place upon crimson cushions and given unto your souls a knife of verdant hue which was unto all worlds illuminating. Soon shall God say unto Our Remembrance: "Come forth unto creation with thy Lord's beauty less than a needle's eye in truth." There shall they magnify him and cut their hands, denying both extremes, and they shall say: "God forbid! This is no mortal! This is He Who moveth in God's earth by His leave, and He is the Truth from God in very truth, and He was in the Mother Book a noble king." And verily He was in the Mother Book a noble king. And if ye enter the depths of oneness by God's leave in the path of the Gate, ye shall surely witness your souls by severing yourselves for God, the Truth, in truth - and He is God Who was unto His believing servants merciful.

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

She said: "This is he about whom ye blamed me! I did seek to seduce him from his true self but he did firmly save himself guiltless. And if he doth not do what I command him, he shall certainly be cast into prison, and be of the company of the vilest!"

Alif. Lam. Mim. Sad.

This Book is the remembrance of God concerning the Most Great Word, in truth, unto all the worlds. Verily God hath detailed His ordinances in the Furqan aforetime and in this Book in truth, and ye shall find no variation in God's supreme decree in this and that, according to the mighty truth.

Verily God hath sent down the Book from His presence and creation is powerless to produce its like. Were We to bestow upon them all the power of sovereignty in truth, yet glorified be God far above what the idolaters assert with great haughtiness.

O ye who believe! Fear God regarding Satan in your souls and your possessions, and trust in God, your true Lord, for verily He hath power over all things. Glorify God, your Creator, in the watches of the night and at the ends of the day, in private and in public, upon the paths of the Gate, according to what God hath ordained in the decree of the Book from the presence of the Gate, the Praiseworthy One.

Verily God hath not revealed in His former Book a single letter except that He hath revealed it in truth in this Book concerning the station of the Gate in hidden wise.

O servants of the All-Merciful! Do ye know better, or God Who created you, then sustained you, and will soon guide you to His Cause in mighty truth? Why do ye hasten in God's true Cause when ye know naught of the knowledge of the Book save a limited portion of its letters?

God, the Truth, He is the One Worshipped, there is no God but Him, the Truth, and God hath power over all things. Ye and what ye worship besides God apart from the Gate are but fuel for hell, and this decree hath been irrevocably set down in the Mother Book from around the Fire.

Do ye not see how God hath made the sun's shadow to prostrate before the Gate unto God, beside Whom there is no God, and He is God, the Witness over all things?

O people of the earth! I bear witness for myself, my forebears, my followers, and this Most Great Word, that God hath created us dependent and sustained, unable to do aught of ourselves, and verily sovereignty belongeth to God, the Exalted in truth, and He is God, the Witness over all worlds.

God and His Messenger and His chosen ones and I and my followers are quit of what they associate with God and what they say concerning us contrary to the word of servitude. Sufficient is God, the All-Merciful, as a true witness over His servants.

Glorified be God far above what the wrongdoers assert with great haughtiness. Sufficient is God as a true witness between me and you concerning this Gate.

And what God hath ordained in the Mother Book hath been a witness unto that Gate over all the worlds.

God is the One, the Eternal, the Single, beside Whom there is no God, and there is nothing like unto Him. So worship Him and trust in Him, for God encompasseth all the worlds.

He it is Who showeth you His signs from the presence of the Gate in the creation of the heavens and earth, and in the creation of your own selves, and the creation of all things. Call not upon any besides God, your true Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.

Do ye believe in part of Our signs \[...\]

Do not call upon any master besides God, the True One, the Truth through the Truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful. Do you believe in some of Our verses while denying what God has ordained beyond them? What ails you that you judge for yourselves without God's leave, with a judgment false and rejected? Sufficient for Our Word is God, His Messenger and Us as helpers of the Truth through the Truth, the Most High, the Strong. Is not God sufficient for His servant when His is the kingdom of the heavens and earth through the Truth? Verily those who are too proud to worship Him possess not even an atom's weight of anything in truth. God has created the kingdom for His loved ones, and We have given the kingdom, by God's leave, to Our Remembrance through the Truth, all together. We bear witness and God suffices as witness to His Word through the Truth.

O servant of God, fruit of Our heart! Grant God's kingdom to whomsoever thou pleaseth among Our servants and withhold it from whomsoever thou pleaseth among Our servants. Verily God is independent of all worlds. O servants of the All-Merciful! We have given you glad tidings of a victory from the presence of the Truth that is near at hand. God's victory and triumph have come, and soon shall people behold men who shall enter into the religion steadfastly from around the Gate, turning unto God. These are they who are brought near in God's Book, from before and after. Soon shall these believers inherit Paradise, abiding therein through the Truth forever and ever.

Verily this Path of Ali is the Truth in the Mother Book and has ever been preserved around the Fire. God has appointed no guardian besides Himself through the Truth. Therefore magnify God as He has guided you to His religion, for He is independent of all worlds. We have ordained for Our Word a station through the Truth that is definitive. None who came before can surpass it in any way, nor can any who come after reach it, neither through allusion nor its negation. This is a decree from God, the Truth, and the decree in all tablets has been determined by the All-Merciful.

Verily creation shall never know Him as befits His station, through the Truth, forever and ever. When the women of the city of Unity cut their hands in the paths of the Gate, the wife of the Chief said: "This is he concerning whom you blamed me unjustly before." O people! If you were to look upon the Sign of Unity with its own eye, you would be among the living ones with God, your True Lord, and would be recorded in the Mother Book as people of the Gate. God has not decreed for people in their blame of Our Remembrance except after recognizing Him in less than the twinkling of an eye. If you were to know all things as they are through Our Will concerning them, you would have but a small portion of the knowledge of the Gate in the Book.

Therefore proceed as God has commanded thee before and turn not to anyone. Establish thyself in the Unity of the depths for God, thy True Lord, for He is independent of all worlds. And when they sought to tempt him from his purpose, Joseph remained steadfast through Our Most Great Word for God, besides Whom there is no other god and unto Whom nothing can be compared. Thus was he recorded in the Mother Book as among those who remain steadfast with God.

The Surih of the Sign

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

"My Lord! Prison is dearer to me than that to which they invite me. Unless Thou turn away their snare from me, I shall incline unto them and become of the ignorant." All praise be to God Who hath sent down unto His servant clear verses from the Book for those who desire God and His Messenger, and who seek naught in the land of the heart save the gaze of their Lord, the All-Merciful. Verily God is witness over all things. God guideth whom He willeth among His servants, and He is mighty and wise toward the believers. Those who deny Our greater signs, God will soon reckon with them - a reckoning upon the fire, swiftly to the fire. Verily God, the True One, will judge between people with truth on the Day of Resurrection, and God is witness over all things. God hath made known His Most Great Word, and We are the People of the House, and God hath ordained naught for any besides Us save submission and powerlessness before God, the True One, their Creator. Verily He is powerful over all things. Fear God in His Cause on the day We shall bring you to account, by God's leave, with truth upon truth, in His exalted right. There shall the people be shaken in the land of the heart, and the thunderbolt shall come with truth upon truth. Soon shall people behold God and His angels from before the Gate, humble and abased. Verily We shall, God willing, on the Day of Remembrance, descend upon crimson mysteries and slay you, by God's leave, with Our swords in truth, even as ye deny and turn away from Our Most Great Word, this Arabian Youth who hath been, in the Mother Book, exalted and wise. We have made Our remembrance in a goodly land whose vegetation hath sprouted forth by Our leave in the land of hearts, with truth upon truth, praised. As for that which is corrupt, God hath ordained for it naught save bitter growth contrary to truth, and the decree in the Mother Book hath been fulfilled. Verily the judgment of all things with God in that Book hath been inscribed in this Gate around the fire. Soon shall ye behold Our Word in truth like the radiant sun fixed in the midst of the sky on a winter's day. Fear God and speak naught concerning God, the True One, save the truth, for soon We shall question you concerning what ye did in secret and in public on the plain of gathering, from the tongue of this Gate, and that soon. Say: Were the sea ink for My words, verily the sea would be exhausted before a single letter of My words would be exhausted, even were I to bring its like as reinforcement by God's leave. O servants of the All-Merciful! Know ye that God hath made Our servant among you, from His presence, a guardian in truth and a manifest sovereign in might. What aileth you that ye believe not in God, your Creator, Who created you, then sustained you, then guideth you to the path of God, the Mighty - this Arabian Youth who hath been, in the Mother Book, praiseworthy? Do ye not know that God's proof is among you, and He is your shepherd from God, the Exalted, in truth, and He, God, your True Lord, hath been from ancient times in truth? What aileth you, how do ye judge concerning Our servant that of which ye know not even a little in truth? Verily We have made him a Remembrance from Our presence unto you, that he may remind you of Our days which God hath named in the Mother Book as His true days, and that soon.

He is God, your True Master, who has ever been eternal from ancient times. What is wrong with you, that you pass judgment upon Our servant concerning matters of which you have no knowledge, even to a small degree? Verily We have made him a Remembrance from Our presence unto you, that he might remind you of Our days - which God has named in the Mother Book as His true days that are drawing nigh - and that he might purify you from the humiliations of Satan through His Name, while you suppose that you are performing good deeds for God, the All-Praised. Nay, nay! God has deemed the doer of good among you to be the one who is, for the sake of God and His verses, truly patient and thankful. Fear God! If you turn away from Our servant, We shall turn away from you. Soon shall you behold Us upon clouds of light, and verily sovereignty has ever been inscribed before God, the Most High, concerning Our Cause. Say: God has placed sovereignty in Our hands like a small coin in your hands. We exalt those among Our servants who are truly devoted friends to Our servant, and We abase those among you who are ungrateful to the All-Merciful and His verses at this exalted Gate. Know, O servants of God, that God has perfected His proof among you after this Book. If you believe in Our Remembrance, you will be believers in your own souls, and if you deny your Lord, the All-Merciful, then verily God is independent of all worlds. By God the Truth! God has placed no proof with you concerning Our servant, and We have sufficed you regarding your proof. Soon shall you acknowledge God's Cause in truth, and you shall never find for yourselves any helper besides this Arabian Youth, Our servant. Verily God has made clear His verses in this Book that you might be patient for the sake of God and His verses at this mighty Gate. We are recording the deeds of those who came before you that were contrary to truth, and soon shall God erase the deeds of the false ones through the decree of the Book from this Arabian Youth at the Gate. O servants of God! Be patient in truth, for verily the Cause has come from God, the All-Praised, through the glorious Word, drawing ever closer. Unto God prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, while the thunder glorifies His praise, and the angels from fear of Him. The matter has been decreed, and judgment belongs unto God, the Single One, as it has been inscribed. Do you not see how your Lord extends the shadow? Had He willed, He could have made it still. Then God made the sun its indicator. O people of the East and West! Follow God's light among you, for it has ever been a true guide upon the mighty path. God has prescribed for you and those before you, and you shall never find any alteration in Our true decrees. We have destroyed the cities for the wrongdoing of their people, yet We were not in the least unjust to Our servants. Fear the day when God will openly call out to you through the tongue of the Remembrance with the Most Great Truth, for verily God has ever encompassed all worlds. And Husayn said: "Martyrdom is more beloved to me than what they call me to - pledging allegiance to the idolatrous soul." And He is God, the Mighty, the Wise. And Joseph said: "If God does not turn their plot away from me, I might incline toward them through their glances," and be among those who turn to God without His face. And He is God, who has ever been ancient in truth.

In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate!

His Lord answered him and averted from him their scheming. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.

Alif. Lam. Mim.

This is a remembrance of thy Lord's path which God hath ordained in the heavens and earth, that people might turn unto Our signs with powerful truth.

God hath prescribed for you this pure religion which hath been in the Mother Book as an upright faith. O people of earth and heaven! Follow the Remembrance of God which He hath sent down to Our servant in truth, and We were with him in the world of the unseen and the visible by God's leave, as an Observer over him from the Book's decree. He revealeth His mystery to none save those who walk before Him and who, through His signs, endure with mighty truth amidst the intensity of fire.

God knoweth the mystery of the heavens and earth. Those who are proud against His worship know not even a little of the Book's knowledge in truth. God hath prescribed unity for Himself - there is no God but He, alone with no partner, and He is the All-Knowing of all things.

We have testified that everything upon which the name of a thing falls is in servitude to God, the Supreme, besides Whom there is no God, and He is God, Who was eternally established in truth. God is the Creator of all things, there is no God but He, the All-Knowing, and God encompasseth all things.

Verily We have sent down to you this Book and have detailed your ordinances therein that you might believe in Our signs in that Gate and be forbearing in truth. Why do you not perceive even a little of Our signs in truth in that Book?

Do you take lords besides God who create nothing in truth? We have created you in truth, yet you possess neither harm nor benefit for yourselves on earth. God hath ordained for you, by His wisdom, death in truth, life, and resurrection in truth.

Remember His signs in what God hath brought forth in the night and day at that mighty, wondrous Gate. Those who disbelieve say within themselves: "Is this Book a falsehood he hath fabricated?" The party of Satan confirms their false claims, and they have become, thereby, disbelievers in God and His signs, deviating from truth at that Gate.

They have come with injustice and falsehood against the truth. Soon will God take from them their false claims from their polytheistic souls and burn them in the fire with intense heat. Soon will God annul what Satan casteth into the hearts of the believers, and We shall verily establish them through Our remembrance at this Most Great Gate, God willing, in truth and soon.

Say to those who fabricate lies against God and speak about God and His signs untruthfully with ornate words of polytheism and delusion: God hath sent down this Book in truth that ye might know that God knoweth the secret of the heavens and earth, and He is independent of the worlds.

The people have disbelieved in God untruthfully in delusion. O servants of God! Take not besides God, the Exalted, the True, the Faithful, any protector, and take not besides God, the True, any guardian. God hath made Our servant a believer, and he was among the thankful ones in truth in the worlds.

Fear God concerning a Day wherein the heat will be intense by God's decree in the Book.

The Surah of Justice

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

He was, in truth, among all the worlds grateful unto the Truth. Fear ye God on the Day when, by God's decree in the Book, the heat shall be fierce indeed, and this decree hath been irrevocably ordained by God concerning the people of idolatry. We have verily ordained for thee, after this cycle, another return in truth - a decree irrevocably fixed upon the truth. Soon shall We reinforce you with hosts whom none but God can see. God hath indeed written for thee, after this return, another cycle for His Most Great Day - an immutable decree founded on truth. We have verily appointed the angels in truth for thy true self, more numerous than both mankind and jinn. The All-Merciful hath decreed for the believers that they shall enter the mosque as they entered it the first time, and utterly destroy whatsoever they conquered. God hath decreed for all: "If ye return, We shall return." And We have made Hell an abode for the idolaters, in very truth. As for those who believe in Our verses from Our presence, God hath prepared for them, in the Garden of Good-Pleasure surrounding the Gate, a great reward. And for the unbelievers We have prepared in the depths of Hell a grievous torment. Joseph called upon his Lord because of their guile, calling secretly at the Gate. We turned away from him and from God's believing servants the guile of women, both before and after, and God doth encompass all the worlds. Soon shall We turn away from the hearts of the believers the guile of Satan and the thought of respite for Our servant in these your days - by the power of truth, and this is nigh.

Then it appeared to them, after they saw the signs, to imprison him for a time. O Thou (Ta Ha)! This is a remembrance of Our mercy unto the servants of God - he who was pious at the Gate. Verily We have sent down unto you a Book as a proof of the Truth, that ye may argue among the people with truth concerning that which God hath given you from His presence, and ye were upon the path of Ali in this mighty Gate, steadfast. Man invokes evil as he invokes good for Our Cause, and man was ever hasty in dust. Verily We have appointed for every soul a book which he shall find hung about his neck, unfolded, and on the Day of Distinction preserved at the Gate of the Remembrance, apart from truth. Read thy book! Sufficient is thy soul this day as a reckoner against thee from God, the Most High. Verily on the Day of Resurrection ye shall have a known station upon the Path. Soon shall ye emerge, by God's leave, from your graves upon the decree of dust, hastening. This your Day is indeed the Truth from your Lord. Soon shall He set up the Balance for mankind before Us with truth, justly and manifestly, and unto truth with truth, in exalted justice. The Day when the heaven shall be like molten brass and the mountains like wool, and no intimate friend shall ask of an intimate friend. How many a soul did I respite while it was wrongdoing, then I seized it while it was certain of God's Command at that Gate, with truth, as a manifest authority. God hath judged those who came before thee with the judgment of the Book, and thou wert stationed upon the Path of Truth on the Day of Beginning. Soon shall God annul what Satan casteth into the desires of those who disbelieve in God and His signs, and He is God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Verily We have made thee more loving towards the believers than their own selves for God's Greatest Day wherein they shall witness the Gate. There they shall find no constraint in themselves concerning what thou decreest among them, and they shall be patient with God, the Most High, around the Gate. Nay, by thy Lord! The polytheists will not believe until thou judgest among them at the Point of Fire. The Command hath been decreed and the judgment in the Mother Book hath been accomplished. Verily We know those who have been given knowledge that they are the truth from God, that people may believe in them, and verily God guides those who believe unto the path of this Ali, in the Mother Book, around the Fire, straight. By thy Lord! We shall surely question all people on the Day of Resurrection concerning their differences about thee, the Most Great Remembrance of God, and God is witness over all things. Is there doubt about God, He Who is the Originator of the heavens and earth? Those near Him grow not proud to worship Him, and they are those who prostrate themselves before God before all worlds at this mighty Gate, powerfully. What aileth you? How do ye judge Our Cause when ye know naught of God's true Command, even a little? By God, the Truth! The Proof of Truth declareth: if ye disbelieve in Our servant after this Book hath been sent down unto you with truth as a manifest proof, ye shall not find for yourselves on the Day of Resurrection any portion of God's covenant and Our covenant, even if it be less than an atom. Fear God and invalidate not your souls with false fabrications from Satan, apart from truth, as a deceptive lie. God hath \[...\]

Do not nullify yourselves through the falsehood of Satan with lies and delusion against the truth. God has promised you Paradise while Satan calls you to the Fire. Therefore, establish your hearts firmly in this Gate for the sake of God, the One, the Eternal, and glorify God before the face of the Gate on the day of battle with sublime glorification. When death approaches, you shall not have power to utter even a slight word concerning God's command which is the truth by the truth. And when the promise of the Hereafter comes, God has prepared for you, in truth and justice, a great Fire, and you shall find no helper on that Day besides the Remembrance, who is the truth by the truth.

O people of the East and West! Can you find for yourselves any portion of proof before God, your Lord, concerning this Most Great Remembrance? By your Lord, We shall surely gather you around Hell, and on the Day of Resurrection, you shall not find for yourselves even a limited portion of proof. Do you think the Remembrance calls you to anything other than the pure religion of God and the tradition of His Prophet? Nay! What ails you that you fabricate falsehood against God? Highly exalted is God above what the wrongdoers say with great exaltation.

O Solace of the Eyes! Say to yourself the truth in My melody, for the Book has fulfilled its term, and the people have truly been gathered in the land of this Gate. O servants of God! Fear God in a matter that has come from God, the Exalted, the Great. We have indeed passed judgment upon Joseph and the Prophets by God's decree in the Mother Book, which was inscribed around the Gate. We have ordained for everything in the Book an appointed term, in truth by the truth. Nothing shall deviate from His decree, and God has ever encompassed all things.

Then it occurred to them, after they had seen the signs, to imprison him for a while contrary to truth, during which time he was detained at the mystery of the Gate. God had ordained imprisonment for Joseph when he contemplated the Most Great Mystery of God, less than what the Book can enumerate of even a portion of anything. We delivered him and raised him to the station of sanctity, which was lofty in the land of the heart.

The Surah of Interpretation. In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.

And there entered the prison with him two young men. One of them said: "I dreamed that I was pressing wine." The other said: "I dreamed that I was carrying bread upon my head, from which the birds were eating. Tell us the interpretation thereof, for we see thee to be among the virtuous ones." All praise be to God Who hath sent down unto His servant the Book, that he might be unto all creation, through the Most Great Word, a witness. God hath given glad tidings unto the believers who perform righteous deeds that they shall have a goodly reward at the Gate, abundantly bestowed from the presence of the Gate. We have sent down unto you from Our tongue this Book that ye may judge between men with truth in the ways of the Gate, for God is indeed cognizant of all created things. We have taken from him a covenant with God that he should judge between you according to the Book of God and Our ways, and ye shall find no judgment from him save the judgment of God which hath been ordained in the Mother Book. Those who deny God and His Word without right shall be gathered in the midst of the fire in a valley of hell. God hath borne witness to the judgment with truth, and We shall be witnesses on the Day of Resurrection to the testimony of the All-Merciful regarding His judgment. Sufficient is God and We, the family of the Most High God, as witnesses to the truth. God hath warned those who attribute a son to God - glory be unto Him! To Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth, and all have come unto Him as servants through the Most Great Word at that Gate, in very truth. Grievous is the word that issueth from their mouths, speaking of God that which is not true, in delusion and falsehood. We have made whatsoever is on earth as an adornment for the believers, that We may test which of them is best in conduct through the Gate. Or dost thou think that the Companions of the Cave and of the Inscription were among Our wondrous signs in that Most Great Name? By God! Truth hath spoken truly a wondrous tale. God hath made the verses to succeed one another after this Youth in the Mother Book, that ye may know that God created you not, nor raised you up, save for Our signs which are mighty in that Gate. We destroyed the generations before you in very truth through the Most Great Word, and soon shall We destroy you for your turning away from the remembrance of God, the Most Great, in very truth, the Most High. When people ask thee concerning the Chiefs, say: "God, my Lord, knoweth best their number around the Gate. Why do ye ask concerning that which God hath not taught you in His Book?" For God is indeed aware of His believing servants. Say: "The Truth is from Us; so let him who will, believe, and let him who will, deny." We have prepared for the wrongdoers an all-encompassing fire. Those who have believed in Our remembrance and performed righteous deeds for God, the Truth, God shall soon grant them the reward of the believers, according to the best of their deeds, by the decree of the Gate, as ordained in the Book. God hath created Paradise for the believers, and God's promise in the Mother Book shall be fulfilled. Therein shall they have bracelets of gold, and they shall wear red garments of fine silk and brocade, reclining therein upon thrones - how excellent a reward and how beautiful a resting-place! O ye believers! Fear your Lord, the All-Merciful, Who created you and teacheth you in this Book the ways of the Prophets.

In this Book God teacheth you the ways of the Prophets and the truthful ones, according to manifest truth, that ye may become, through God the Most High, in that mighty Gate truly learned. Place, then, your trust in God, your true Lord, through the truth, upon the mighty truth, with all your might. If ye claim obedience to God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, then follow Our command, for We have ordained for every people truth upon truth, and ye shall find no judgment more exalted than Our judgment upon the truth. Verily God is the Creator of all things, there is no God but Him. Worship not any but God, besides Whom there is no God, and He is God Who hath ever encompassed all worlds. We, verily, have created you by God's leave, your Lord, and ye perform naught upon the truth through truth, even if it be but little. We, verily, have made Our servant a Remembrance from God, blessed among you, that ye may aid him on the Day of Resurrection, through truth upon exalted truth, with all your might. If ye help God, He will help you on a Day when none besides God, the Truth, shall have dominion over the Most Great Truth, and He is God Who hath ever been witness to all worlds. Fear God and reflect upon the creation of the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them. We have created whatsoever We desire, and there is no repelling Our power over the truth through truth. God made you not to witness the creation of the heavens and earth, nor the creation of your own selves, and We take not those who lead astray as aids over truth through truth for all the worlds. O people of the earth! Hold fast to the foundations of knowledge which We have sent down to you in this Book, that ye may be guided to the path, that your work may be made easy, and that ye may become, through God the Most High, truly learned, and may become, through God's command, truly wise. O servants of the All-Merciful! Vie ye with one another in good deeds through the Gate - this Word of God the Most High Who hath ever been, in the Mother Book, forbearing. Spend in God's path of that which ye love for yourselves; soon shall ye find with God, through truth, from your deeds in the land of good-pleasure, a beauteous kingdom. Verily God hath created the gardens for the believers among you, for those who have witnessed the signs of God the Most High in a path from the Gate around the Fire. When two young men entered the prison with Joseph, one of them in the square form and the other in God's light in triangular form - they were inscribed around the Fire upon the mighty Word - the first said: "I saw myself pressing the wine of Manifestation in a cup of pure gold, by leave of God the Most High, besides Whom there is no God; verily He hath ever been powerful over all things." And the other said, in a form of polytheism: "I saw in my dream that a measure of bread was above my head, and birds were eating therefrom. Tell me its interpretation, for I see thee among those who know interpretation, and thou art verily, through truth, accounted among the good in God's sight." Verily God hath ordained for creation different visions: among them are those of the highest heaven who read their book by leave of God their Lord, truthful ones in the Gate; and among them are those of the lowest depth who read their book as liars above the uprooted earth. The decree hath been fixed in the Mother Book, and for each of these there is an interpretation in God's Most Great Book from which they never deviate, and this decree hath been fixed in the Mother Book. Remember God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, and worship Him in hours of the day and like hours of the night, for good deeds with God have ever been inscribed in the Mother Book around the Gate.

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

He said: "No food shall come unto you both as sustenance except that I shall inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you. This is of that which my Lord has taught me. Verily, I have forsaken the faith of a people who believe not in God and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter."

O Ta Ha! Remember the name of thy Lord, besides Whom there is no other God, the All-Knowing. And He is God, powerful over all things. O resplendent Light of God! Follow not the idolaters and leave them in their transgression, for God thy Lord is verily aware of them in truth. Follow what has been revealed unto thee from thy Lord, for God is indeed well-acquainted with His believing servants.

Place thy trust in God thy Lord, for He is verily mighty and powerful in truth. Sufficient is thy Lord as witness and protector. Fear ye, O servants of the Most Merciful, the Day when the Command shall come unto you from God, the Truth, from the distant land - in powerful truth, drawing nigh.

If ye help God, then verily God is your helper in truth, and ye shall be stationed upon the Most Great Path around the Fire in truth. But if ye disbelieve, We shall clothe you with garments of fire in Hell, and God shall judge you with the Greatest Fire, forever and ever. Verily, We have prepared for the disbelievers in the Fire maces of iron, by the decree of God, besides Whom there is no God. Verily He encompasses all worlds.

Whenever they desire to escape therefrom, they shall be returned thereto, and God shall cause them to taste, through His justice, a burning torment in truth. Verily God does what He wills through His grace and judges whom He wills with fire, according to the decree of the Book, for the sake of the ordained Command of the Gate.

God has willed for you the Hereafter, while ye desire the vain life of this world. What ails you that ye perceive not? Verily the Hereafter with God is true life indeed, and God is powerful over all things.

Whosoever turns away from the remembrance of this Youth, Our servant, after the Command has come from God, the Exalted, the Powerful - and this Book is indeed mighty in powerful truth - it is as though he has fallen from heaven and is snatched by birds or carried by the wind to a place which God has named in the Mother Book as remote.

Say: If ye but knew what We know from God, the Truth, ye would choose naught for yourselves save the Hereafter, wherein ye shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and your raiment therein shall be, by leave of the Glorious One, of silk.

O people of the earth! Know ye not that God knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and that the knowledge of the Tablets has been, in this your Book, concealed around the Gate in truth? Verily, those who worship other than God shall never attain authority on earth in manifest truth. They have no knowledge, and We decree for the wrongdoers naught save the severe fire of Hell.

Those who call upon other than Us possess not even a little power in truth. Weak indeed are both the seeker and the sought! They have not valued God with His true worth, while the heavens shall be folded up by Our hands on the Day of Resurrection, and the earth on that Day shall be entirely within Our grasp in truth. Verily God, your Lord, the Most Merciful, encompasses all the worlds.

O people of the City! \[...\]

Verily God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath ever encompassed all creation. O people of the City and the Bedouins who dwell round about it! God hath completed His proof unto you. How is it that ye disobey God, your True Creator, in your private and public acts, following oft the conjectures of Satan? Do ye not fear the Day when the Balance shall be set up before you in truth, with truth, the Most High, with perfect justice? On that Day shall the faces of the sinners be blackened, and God hath ordained for them in the Day of Resurrection naught but an all-encompassing fire.

God gave you life, then causeth you to die, then giveth you life again. Why do ye not ponder the Qur'an in truth in the ways of the Gate as it was sent down? Why do ye not ponder the Qur'an in the ways of the Gate in its interpretation?

Glorify ye God, besides Whom there is no other God, in your private and public acts, according to the Most Great Word from the Gate, for verily He hath ever been independent of all creation through God.

O ye believers! The Most Great Light of God is nearer to you than your own selves, and those who are related are nearer to one another in the Book of God than aforetime. Be ye content with God, the Most High, the All-Powerful, the True One.

Verily We have taken thy covenant from the Prophets and the angels and all mankind in truth with the truth. God shall soon take from mankind on the Most Great Day a binding covenant in truth with the truth. Soon shall We question the truthful concerning their truthfulness and give them from God in the Garden of Eternity a bountiful reward.

O people of the East and West! Remember the favor of your Lord, the All-Merciful. By your Lord! The Truth hath come unto you in truth through the Most Great Truth, and the matter had been decreed in the Mother Book.

Await ye the Most Great Day of God when eyes shall be dazed and hearts shall reach to the throats. There shall the idolaters think of God untruthfully, in delusion and falsehood. There shall the All-Merciful try you through the Remembrance, and ye shall be severely shaken upon the land of the Euphrates.

Verily We have made the Remembrance as Our own Self and as a mortal like unto you, by God's leave, as a powerful and true witness over you.

And Joseph said unto them both: "No food shall come unto you as sustenance from God, besides Whom there is no other God - and He is God Who hath ever encompassed all creation - but I shall have told you the interpretation thereof from the mystery of the Gate regarding the interpretation of the Book, a wondrous utterance concerning the mystery within the inmost mystery, before God's decree, the Most High, shall come unto you from the presence of the Most Exalted Gate, from the Point of Fire, in wonderful wise." This is of that which my Lord hath taught me through the tongue of Fatima the Radiant, in truth with the truth. Verily I have forsaken the religion of a people who believe not in God and His signs, and who, in relation to the authority of Fatima the Radiant, have been unbelievers around the Fire in the Mother Book.

The Surah of Thanksgiving

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

I follow the faith of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It is not for us to associate anything with God. This is of God's grace upon us and upon all people, though most people are not thankful. Alif Lam Ra - these are the verses of the Book from One Wise, Who was indeed knowing of all things. We have made this Book a mercy for those who do good deeds for their souls and turn to God through the gates of repentance, a beautiful and praiseworthy turning on the straight path. These are guided by their Lord, and their dwelling place is paradise, as God has ordained in the Mother Book. Among the idolaters are those who purchase idle tales to mislead people from God's path - these will not believe in God and His signs, and God has prepared for them in the Hereafter a great punishment. When Our verses are recited to those who know you not, they turn away in arrogance as if they hear them not. Glory be to God, the Most High, the Supreme, there is no god but He - it is as if God created in them but a faint awareness. God will question you about what you did in secret and in public on the straight path, and the decree in the Mother Book is final. Know that God's covenant on the Greatest Path by the Supreme Truth at the Gate must be answered. Say: Who can protect you from God, your True Lord? By your Lord, they will find no protector or helper besides God on the Day of Resurrection. The Most Merciful has decreed in His Book that you have in the remembrance of God a beautiful pattern for those who hope in God and the Last Day, and God is witness over all things. Soon will the Most Merciful remove your veil - then you will behold the remembrance of God and His covenant with your own eyes, with intense clarity. We have willed for the believers the Greatest Word for whomever God chooses for Himself in faith and true submission. O people of the City! Remember God and glorify Him on the straight path morning and evening. He it is Who sends blessings upon you, as do His angels, that He may bring you out of darkness into light - and He is Merciful to the believers. Your greeting on the Day of Resurrection from God regarding the Remembrance will be "Peace" - and He has prepared for them in the precincts of Paradise a lofty station. Whatever you desire you will find it by God's leave, and in Paradise you have a station at the Gate that is written in the Mother Book. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Give glad tidings to Our believing servants that they have from God a great bounty. Pay no attention to the idolaters of the earth, ignore their harm, and trust in God - sufficient is God as Knower and Witness of His servant. O servants of the Most Merciful! Thank your Lord Who created you and those before you, before a Day when you will have no power to do anything for yourselves apart from God's decree - the Most High, there is no god but He, and He is God, powerful over all things. Whoever is grateful, is grateful for his own soul's good, and whoever denies - truly God is Independent of all the worlds. Do you not see the heavens and earth were joined together, then We split them apart through the Greatest Word \[...\]

The earth and the heavens were joined together as one piece, then We clove them asunder through the Most Great Word. And We made from water every living thing - such is the truth and to it all must return. O ye who believe! Follow Our light, for God hath commanded the denizens of the Throne and of heaven to seek forgiveness for those who follow Us through the Gate by means of the Most Great Word. And God is witness over all things.

There is naught but that its treasuries lie with Us, and We do verily send down upon whomsoever We will among the servants of God, our Lord, according as God hath willed concerning them. And verily the bounty of God thy Lord upon thee hath been ordained as magnificent in the Mother Book.

The grace of God from before the Gate upon all the worlds hath been ordained as magnificent in the Mother Book. Whoso among you obeyeth the Remembrance in what We have commanded you - ye are they that have obeyed God, besides Whom there is none other God, and He verily encompasseth all creation. And should ye disobey the Most Great Remembrance of God Who is among you, ye shall be numbered with those who have turned away and shown ingratitude.

O believers! Rise up in the early dawn, prostrating yourselves before God, besides Whom there is none other God, standing firm in truth. Let not the world beguile you from whatsoever good your souls have earned. In truth I say: should ye turn away from this Our Covenant, your deeds shall profit you not, and ye shall assuredly be consigned to the fire of hell through the Great Word - this hath been irrevocably decreed in truth.

Were ye to know with the knowledge of certainty, ye would behold hell in your deeds with the eye of certainty - yea, with the truth of certainty most sure. Unto God belongeth sincere religion, both before and after. God accepteth not any of your deeds save after ye assist His Cause with mighty strength.

Verily We have given you glad tidings of the servant of God and this Our Word, the Youth Whom the people call Ali in very truth. By God! He is independent of you and of your help. If ye help God, He will help you, and ye shall be rendered victorious over your own selves, in very truth.

Be ye thankful unto God and deny not God and His signs. Verily He is independent of all creation. God desireth to test the hearts of the believers through this Book. If ye be truthful in your faith, fear none except God, your True Lord. Verily He is witness over all things.

By your Lord! We shall assuredly gather you together on the Day of Resurrection around the fire in the place of assembly, and ye shall find no helper that day besides God, the Exalted, the True, the Faithful. We verily intercede for those who obey God and come before the Gate, prostrating themselves and bowing down before God, besides Whom there is none other God. Verily He is merciful unto the believers.

Never will the idolaters be pleased with thee unless thou follow their religion. Say: The remnant of God is true guidance. I have forsaken the religion of a people who believe not in Him, and I follow the religion of my fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It beseemeth me not to associate aught with God. This is of God's grace upon me. God hath not ordained for mankind even a whit of our bounty. Yet most people render not thanks unto the remembrance of God, the Exalted, save a little.

Verily God desired from Abraham, Muhammad; and from Isaac, Ali; and from Jacob, Husayn. It beseemeth me not to speak except by their leave.

From Jacob Al-Hussein: It was not for me to speak except by their leave, and I am nothing before them save as a shadow before the sun. Verily God hath chosen me from among His servants by virtue of my response to their call. By thy Lord! When God declared His will, thou didst precede all others in answering our call, and for this reason have we bestowed upon thee our dominion. Therefore, bestow favor upon whomsoever thou pleasest and turn away from whomsoever thou pleasest, for verily thou desirest naught save by our leave. We are in truth thy protector, and We are in truth, by what God hath ordained in the Mother Book, thy witness.

O My fellow prisoners! Are diverse lords better, or God, the One, the All-Subduing? Remember God, your Lord, besides Whom there is no other God, in this Most Great Gate in truth and by the truth. Verily He has ever encompassed all the worlds. He is the One Who has sent down a Book on parchment that people might know that God has power over all things. Did We not create you when you were but dust? Did We not give you life after your death when you were, in truth and by the truth, dead upon the earth? Verily We have sent down from heaven water as a pure essence from that Ocean. And verily We have ordained for you in this Book a wisdom that We had not decreed for any before you, inasmuch as you were, through God's grace, foremost in answering the Call around the Gate, as was inscribed in the Mother Book. O concourse of Shi'ihs! Fear God in Our Cause regarding the Most Great Remembrance of God, for verily in the Mother Book he has been, from the Point of Fire, mighty indeed. We have made him the middle cushion - your highest cannot comprehend his knowledge and your lowest cannot grasp his Cause, and God's decree concerning his station has been, in truth and by the truth, irrevocably fixed in the Mother Book. You will never attain even to a single letter of the knowledge of the Book, and the truth has ordained in the Book that those who journey to this Gate shall follow, in truth and by the truth, a straight path. We have made you like unto the peoples who passed before you, and you shall never find any change in God's true way. You shall never comprehend the truth except through this Most Great Truth, for We have made him to be witnessed around the Fire in the Book. This is among that which is revealed unto thee from God, confirming the Two Gates in the Word of Truth, that people might, through the Most Great Name of God, be witnesses in that Gate by God's leave. Therefore glorify thy Lord with praise and seek forgiveness of God for the believers, for He has ever been merciful in truth and forgiving toward the believers. We have revealed this Book unto Our servant that he might be a warner unto all the worlds, and We have made him, in truth for God the Truth, a manifest authority. God has willed to seize Rome in the true dominion with severe might. Do people think they can outstrip Us in anything? Nay! The matter has been irrevocably decreed in the Book. God has desired to destroy all people through the Most Great Truth in that Gate, save those who repent and turn unto God, and in that Gate have been recorded among the people of return. O people! Has not the news of the ancients come to you with exalted and mighty truth? We have sent unto you, in truth and by the truth, this perfect mortal that you might know that God created you not, nor raised you up, save for an authority that was great indeed in the Mother Book. O servants of the All-Merciful! Turn ye unto your Creator Who created you and made you, in the temples of unity, human beings. We have made Our servant, in truth and by the truth, a shining sun above the worlds. O servants of God! Be ye the best helpers to this servant of Ours, who is, in truth and by the truth, praiseworthy. We have made him wise in the Mother Book. O people! Acquire from the light of God which He has made within you, in truth and by the truth, an illuminating moon, that ye might know the number of years \[...\]

Verily We have made Our servant a shining sun unto all the worlds, in truth, upon the truth. O servants of God! Be ye the best helpers to this servant of Ours, who is, in truth and by the truth, praiseworthy. We have made him in the Mother Book all-wise. O people! Acquire from the light of God, which He hath made to exist within you - in truth, by the truth - as a luminous moon, that ye may know the number of years and the reckoning, and whatsoever God hath ordained therein of the decree of the Gate, as a fixed decree. Verily We have desired in this Book, concerning the Command of God regarding the station of the Gate, a mystery hidden from the worlds in the Point of Fire. O people! Write down that which God hath revealed unto you by night and by day from the tongue of this Gate, this Arabian Youth, who hath been, from the Point of Fire unto the Point of Fire, speaking the truth in praiseworthy wise. What aileth you that ye deny God, your Lord, openly against the truth, and in secret? Have We not created you from a fluid, despised in truth, by the truth? Have We not preserved you in your mothers' wombs when ye were powerless to do aught, in truth, by the truth? Have We not brought you forth from your mothers' wombs, then sustained you, then caused you to die, then quickened you in truth through that Gate by Our will? O people of the prison! Are diverse gates better, or the One Gate of God, the All-Compelling, unto Whom there is no likeness? Ye and what ye worship besides God are but fuel for hell in God's Book, and this decree hath been written by Our hands and inscribed in truth round about the Fire. Fear ye the Fire which God hath prepared for you, and ye shall find no helper besides God, the Most High, on that Day. O people of the earth! Will ye not ponder this Book wherein there is no doubt? Had it been from other than the Remembrance, ye would surely have found in it many discrepancies. Verily, when We will, We replace one verse with another in the Command, and God best knoweth what He revealeth in His decree, while ye know nothing of the knowledge of the Book. God hath sent it down upon thy heart, and the Holy Spirit, by God's leave, is its guardian. And verily God hath power over all things.

The Surih of the Book

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

O concourse of lights! Hearken unto My call from the Sacred Month. This is the month of Ramadan wherein was revealed the Qur'an. Verily, I am God, there is no God but I. God hath revealed unto Me on the Night of Power that no soul who pondereth in his heart a single letter of this Book, or uttereth with his lips the pure truth during this Most Great Month and the two mighty months preceding it, but I have ordained Paradise for him, that he may know that God is the Truth and His Word is the Most Great Mystery, and that God hath power over all things.

Read ye what is easy for you of this Qur'an, morning and evening. Chant ye this Book by leave of the Ancient God, with the melody of that singing Bird in the atmosphere of the heavens - a true chanting. This is a remembrance for whomsoever desireth to take unto the Lord, his God, the Most High, a straight path.

No soul hath judged contrary to what God hath revealed in His Book, the Furqan, and this Book, but hath been recorded with God among the people of unbelief. We have decreed for the unbeliever, as recompense for his judgment, a severe fire in hell - in truth, by the truth. Whoso altereth from the Furqan and this Book a single letter contrary to their letters hath disbelieved in God, his Lord, and God will never accept any of his deeds, and his abode shall assuredly be the fire, according to the decree of the Book.

Those who conceal any letter of this Book consume fire, and We neither look upon them nor speak to them on the Day of Resurrection. God hath prepared for them, in justice, a grievous punishment in the depths of the tomb.

God hath prescribed for you that ye shall not touch this Most Great Book except in a state of greatest purity, for God hath forbidden it unto all unbelievers. Whoso judgeth contrary to what God hath revealed in His Book shall be gathered into the heart of the fire in God's presence.

Be ye content with what God hath made mysterious to you in His Book, for ye know naught of the knowledge of the Book save a few disconnected letters. O ye believers! When ye hear the Book of God, hearken in silence, for this is a decree in the Mother Book ordained by God.

Ye shall never find any change in Our way, in truth and by truth. O ye believers! Touch not the Book on paper except after purification. Fear God, O servants of God, that ye may be recorded in the Mother Book, by God's grace, around the Point of Fire.

This Book guideth unto that which is most upright, in truth, while it increaseth naught for the wrongdoers, by the truth and the Most Great Truth, save in loss. O servants of the All-Merciful! Fear ye God regarding the alteration of the Book by a single letter from what God hath revealed therein in truth, contrary to the letter, for God hath decreed in the Mother Book a great fire for the doer thereof.

God hath placed in your Book, in the positions of the letters, a pause according to a known measure of the Book. And among the positions in this Book, God hath ordained quietness \[...\]

And verily among the provisions in this Book, God hath ordained silence and assimilation according to the paths of station, as He hath firmly established in the Mother Book by the leave of the Gate, as a thing decreed. O ye who believe! Chant ye the verses of God in this Book in the manner of the eloquent ones among the people of the Hijaz, with truth, by the truth, in sorrowful tones. And recite as God hath revealed among you, with truth, by the truth, from the tongue of the Gate, in praiseworthy wise. And take ye the meaning of interpretation from Our Most Great Servant, if ye be faithful to God and His verses, with truth, by the truth. Read ye what is easily accessible of this Book and advance for yourselves its recompense, for verily God doth not suffer to be lost the reward of them that act, even though they act in truth upon the truth but little. And lend ye to God in the reading of this Book through love of the Gate, and seek forgiveness of God in the watches of the night and the ends of the day. God shall soon fulfill your right in ways ye cannot encompass with knowledge, for verily God hath power over all things.

O company of jinn and men! If ye are able to produce the like of this Book, then ye are guided. And if ye are not able - and ye shall never be able - then follow ye this Most Great Light of God and believe as the believers have believed in it. Otherwise your souls have disbelieved in God, your True Lord, and ye were in opposition to aught but truth, which in the Mother Book was far removed. And if ye do not - and ye shall never do so - after your souls are convinced, and your leaders act, and God exalteth the signs of His power from that Gate unto the peoples of earth and heaven in mighty wise.

O ye who believe! Doth not this Book suffice you as a proof from God unto you? How then do ye believe in Muhammad through faith unseen regarding His Book? By God the Truth, were the peoples of earth and heaven to gather together to produce the like of a portion of its letters, they would never be able, even were We to aid them with seven times their like. Is there other than God who hath power over all things?

O Concourse of Lights! Hear ye My call from the Point of the Gate: "Verily I am God, there is no God but I." Read ye from this Most Great Book what ye are able, for verily I have commanded the Pen to inscribe upon the Preserved Tablet for its reader, in truth, the Most Great Kingdom in the Most Great Paradise, wherein are trees of divine bounties which have borne fruit by God's leave. When a soul partaketh thereof it shall find the sweetness of eternity and its fruit. This is God's most great favor for those who recite His Book. Verily God is the Most High, and God is witness over all things.

O Most Great Word! Hearken thou to My call from the Speaker within thyself: "Verily I am God, there is no God but I." Say: "I am the Sacred House, and My true month in God's Book is the tenth of 'Ashur of the Sacred Month." No soul hath magnified God's month and His Book which was in truth regarding Me, the Most Great Truth, and recited therefrom a letter of its most great letters, but the All-Merciful and His angels and those endowed with knowledge among His creation have blessed him. Lo! This is God's favor concealed in the first line, which God hath prepared for the sincere among you in truth, and this decree existed in the Mother Book.

O people of effacement! Hear ye My call from the Point of sobriety from this Arabian Youth Who spoke on Mount Sinai by God's leave unto Moses, for verily the Torah was sent down from God in truth unto him \[...\]

Verily was this decree inscribed in the Mother Book! O people of obliteration, hear My call from the Point of Sobriety, from this Arabian Youth Who spoke by God's leave upon Mount Sinai unto Moses - for verily was the Torah sent down from God in truth unto him, and mighty was this Cause in the Mother Book. And He pointed with Our hands toward Jesus - the Gospel was sent down from heaven in his time upon his own self, then did God raise him to heaven, there to abide until the Promised Day, when the sealed scroll shall be unveiled at the seat of Divine decree within the Sacred Mosque, through the Tongue of God's True Proof in the mystery of the Remembrance, from Muhammad, the Arabian Prophet, fresh and moist upon the tender pen. And verily was this mystery inscribed with the Gate on that Day.

O Solace of Mine eyes! Say: By God's leave have I read all the lines of that sealed scroll on the day when My Grandfather Muhammad inscribed it with his own hands. I know naught and judge naught save what was traced therein in upright script at the Point of Fire. And this is but the mystery of one line from that Most Great Word. Verily God is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.

O Concourse of Lights! Hearken unto God's call from the Point of Fire - God, there is no God but Him! I have forbidden black ink in this Gate of Praise upon Mount Sinai, and have revealed unto the Pen not to write this Book in the station of servitude, nor anything that God hath caused to flow from the Pen of Ink from the Gate, save upon white, refined, gilded, sectioned tablets with yellow ink of pure red gold. Verily God is the Self-Sufficient, and He is God, powerful over all things.

O Solace of Mine eyes! Say unto the believers who cannot afford gold ink that they may write with white or red ink, and if after utmost striving they find not these, then with green ink after yellow. God loveth for the believers what He loveth for His Remembrance, and God, your Lord, is indeed aware of what ye do.

Verily We have sent down unto thee with the Book this Hidden Scroll, that people may recite its prayers throughout the night and at the ends of the day, and may learn from its lofty stations the ways of their servitude unto God in the path of this Most Great Gate. This hath been made a proof from God for the Greatest Remembrance. Preserve what ye can of this White Book and this Red Scroll, for God hath guaranteed unto its preserver and its reciter in the path of the Gate the Paradise of the All-Highest Truth.

Act according to the truth, for soon shall ye find your deeds preserved and treasured with God, your True Lord. When the Qur'an is recited, hearken unto God your Lord and remember Him within yourselves silently, without loud utterance, that ye may be inscribed in the Book of Truth as people of the Gate.

Verily We have sent down this Book as a mystery from the Qur'an concerning the most hidden secret inscribed above the secret. Whosoever supposeth that a single letter thereof is a letter of the Qur'an hath verily disbelieved in God. God hath sent it down through His ancient power upon His wondrous Remembrance, in wondrous truth most wondrously. O servants of God! Did I not covenant with you that ye should not call upon God, your Creator, with names of your own devising for which He hath sent down no authority in His Book?

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

Verily God hath sent it down through His ancient power upon His wondrous Remembrance, wondrous in truth. O servants of God! Did I not covenant with you that ye should not call upon God, your Creator, by names of your own devising, for which He hath revealed no authority in His Book? And the decree from God unto you is that ye worship none but Him, following the path of this Gate with sincerity unto God. This is the mighty religion of God with your Lord, yet most people know naught of the knowledge of the Book save a few letters.

O people of the Prison! Do not differentiate between the people and yourselves through your perverted desires which are of Satan. By your Lord, the Most Merciful! The Most Great Remembrance of God is truth with God, and verily Satan hath ever been your manifest enemy.

The Surih of the Covenant

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

O My two companions in prison! As for one of you, he will serve wine unto his lord, and as for the other, he will be crucified, and birds will eat from his head. Thus is the matter decreed concerning which you inquired. God hath sent down the Book from His presence that people might know the truth of the Remembrance through the Remembrance, and verily God hath power over all things. We have sent down this Book unto you that ye may be remembered near the Fire through Our verses in that Gate. And thy Lord doth inspire thee from the Most Great Covenant of God. Therefore, convey unto all peoples the decree of the Most Great Gate regarding this Word, through truth upon truth. Why do ye disbelieve in God in your private thoughts and public utterances, following abundantly the conjectures of Satan? We have placed between thee and those who believe not in Our signs a hidden veil of truth upon truth. Say: Have We not recited unto you from God's Book, creating and originating? See how people deny Our signs after God hath taught them abundantly of Our proofs in that Book, through truth upon truth. Those who judge by other than the decree of this Book have indeed borne a grievous sin against the decree of the Book, contrary to truth. They eat of the fruit of poison from the tree that hath sprung from the root of hell, and the decree in the Mother Book hath been fulfilled. This is your recompense in truth for what God hath decreed in the Mother Book. We have made Our Most Great Word, through truth, concerning God's decrees, through a mystery from the Book's mysteries, through the instruction of the All-Merciful, knowing through truth upon truth. Therefore submit to His Cause and take Our decrees from the Gate in every particular and universal matter, praiseworthy upon the paths of divine reward through truth upon truth. We have made his heart a vessel for Our knowledge regarding all decrees from beginning to end, according to what God hath decreed in the Mother Book. O people of the Furqan! Do ye know, or doth God Who, there is no god but He, Who created him and made him a mighty pillar of truth for all the worlds? God hath made him a powerful helper for Our Cause through truth upon truth, and hath decreed in the Mother Book a mighty mystery from the Gate. O people of the earth! Convey unto the Christians Our Cause regarding that Gate with intense truth upon truth. Take the covenant from the people of the Book for the Day of God which the All-Merciful hath promised us through truth upon truth, and God's Command in the Mother Book shall be fulfilled. O servants of God! Convey Our Cause from the east of the earth to its west, from what God hath taught you regarding the Cause of Our servant and His Book, powerful upon the paths of the Strong One through truth upon truth. Convey what ye are able, for God burdeneth not any soul beyond what He hath given it, and God your Lord is well-informed of your souls through truth upon truth. Ye know not of God's Cause except what God teacheth you from His traces and His Book, through truth upon truth, upon the paths of description. O servants of the All-Merciful! Fear God regarding Our taking of truth upon truth with intensity. We desire naught from you on this your day save Our servant Ali, and think not falsely of God in delusion. Know that God hath made Our servant a witness among you. Therefore repent unto God, O all ye people.

Know that God has placed among you Our servant as a witness. Turn ye all unto God, O people, for verily We have expounded the verses for whomsoever desireth to believe steadfastly in the All-Merciful. Say: God is our Lord, the Lord of all the worlds. He is God, besides Whom there is none other God. He is One, without peer or minister, and there is nothing like unto Him. And He is God, Who hath power over all things. Verily We have sent down unto thee this Book with truth, by the truth, that thou mayest be renowned among the worlds as the Great Gate. God hath created naught among all things, whether moist or dry, except that God hath inscribed with His hands its decree in this Book, concerning that which God hath ordained, concealed within the Point of Fire. Verily We have concealed from you, from this Book of God, that which God hath willed concerning His mention, that perchance the people may believe in God and may not transgress in rejection. And God is witness over all things. These verses were indeed clear in the breast of Our servant, concerning that which God had decreed, sealed in the Mother Book. God hath desired naught, whether small or great, except that He hath desired its decree in this Book, and God hath knowledge of all things. God hath sent down this Book among you that perchance the people may be witnesses to Our signs round about the Fire. Verily We reveal unto thee from the tidings of the ancients, according to the decree of the two creations, with truth upon truth, concerning that which God hath decreed, sealed in the Mother Book, that the people may know, by God's leave, that We have made him powerful over all things, with truth upon truth. O my two companions of the prison! As for one of you, if he be of them that believe in Our Remembrance, his Lord shall give him to drink of wine from a cup of crystal essence from the waters of camphor, by leave of God, the True One, in truth and in fulfillment. And as for the other, who is of them that reject Our Remembrance, he shall be crucified in the fire, and the birds of fire shall eat from his head. The matter about which ye differed hath been decreed, and God is witness over all the worlds.

The Surah of Unity

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

And he said to the one who he thought would be saved from among them two: "Remember me to your lord." But Satan caused him to forget to mention him to his lord, and he remained in prison for several years. This is a remembrance from God in the Most Great Word to the believers in the Preserved Tablet, which has been preserved with God, the Praiseworthy, above the Throne. We have indeed sent down to mankind a Book of mysteries that has been inscribed in the Concourse of the Line, lest the believers should exchange the verses of God concerning the Remembrance for a paltry price from among the limited letters. We have indeed explained all the ordinances from your Lord in that Book with truth by the mighty truth, concealed around the water. We relate unto thee the best of stories through the Greatest Interpretation, that people may believe in God and His verses with truth by the mighty truth, in small measure. The believers are they whose hearts are filled with rapture when God is mentioned, and who stand at the gate of God, the Exalted, upon the mighty path. O people! Fear God and speak not concerning Our Word anything untrue. Glory be to God! What ails you that when God alone is mentioned in the Book, your hearts shrink with aversion, and you disbelieve in the Hereafter, following Satan's conjecture? By thy Lord! If all the people of the earth, from east to west, were to gather together to produce the like of this Book, they would not be able to do so, even if they were to help one another. God hath sent down this Book in truth unto all worlds. Say not concerning Our Remembrance anything save words of servitude with truth by the truth, for God, your true Lord, doth encompass all the worlds. Should you write what you are capable of, you would not attain to the mention of aught from Our servant, even if it were but a portion of a point beyond the surface around the letter B. God hath created him for Himself, and We have made him a witness over the worlds through the Most Exalted Word. Verily, he is the Truth from God, the Gate of your Guardian; therefore follow him that ye may be recorded among the believers around the water in the Book. God hath decreed for those who enter the City behind its Gate the judgment of thieves, and their hands are decreed to be cut off in the Mother Book by the decree of the Fire. Fear God and follow not your idle fancies, for when We will a thing, We say unto it "Be!" and it is, in the Mother Book, existent around the water. Glorified be He in Whose hand is the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and thou art upon the Most Great Path of God, straight. Fear God concerning the days of God regarding the Remembrance. By God, the Truth! His days are mighty in the Mother Book. When Our Command cometh, God hath decreed that none shall profit from what they earned before, for Our Command is severe in the Mother Book. At that time shall the people be shaken with a mighty shaking, as God hath ordained in the Mother Book. On that day every bearer of a burden shall cast off her burden, both small and great, and God hath not ordained life except for His sign, for He hath ever been mighty and powerful. There shalt thou see mankind as in a drunken state, yet they are not drunken, but God hath made Our signs in thyself mighty with truth by the truth. O people! Follow what God hath sent down unto you of His Most Great Light from this luminous Arabian Youth.

But God has verily made Our signs within thyself mighty in truth through the truth. O people! Follow what God hath sent down unto you of His Most Great Light through this luminous Arabian Youth. Verily the Arabs have shown intense polytheism toward Our signs and have displayed falsehood contrary to truth. Those who repent unto God and perform righteous deeds - the All-Merciful shall soon cause them to enter, on the Day of Resurrection, a noble entrance into an exalted station. Therein shall they have whatsoever their souls desire, and God hath ordained for them youths and houris like unto fragments of the moon and red pearls. This indeed is the supreme triumph, inscribed in the Mother Book. Verily their sustenance from God shall come to them morning and evening in forms resembling their own essence, in truth through the truth. O people! What aileth you that ye humble not yourselves at the revelation of Our verses from the tongue of the Gate, mighty in truth through the supreme truth? By God the Truth! Were We to send down this Book upon any mountain, thou wouldst see it humbled and rent asunder through fear of God concerning that Gate, according to what God hath ordained mighty in the Mother Book. These are the parables We set forth for mankind that they might submit to God and His verses and be content with the truth. Have We not guided you in the ways of those before you? And ye shall not find in Our laws one letter upon another letter apart from the letter of God, Whose sign hath ever existed in all things in truth through the truth. When people mockingly and vainly rejected Our signs contrary to truth, We verily made their hearts like stone, or even harder, and We removed them far from Our mercy concerning that exalted Gate. O people! What aileth you? How do ye judge without God's leave? Do ye not perceive through God the Truth? Why do ye not fear God on a day that hath been ordained mighty in the Mother Book? Fear God, O servants, from Our mighty grasp in truth through the truth concerning that Gate. Soon shall ye witness a day when We shall say to the angels: "Take from among My servants those who were stubbornly opposed to the exalted Gate contrary to truth in this world." O angels of God! Bind them in chains seventy cubits in length, then cast them into the depths of the coffin according to what God hath decreed for them in the Mother Book. And he said to the one whom he thought would be saved: "Remember me before thy Lord." But he mentioned him not in God's Book of Truth, for Satan made him forget the remembrance of God, and imprisonment for known months was decreed for him according to what God had ordained in the Mother Book. Soon will their Lord guide them and forgive their sins, for they are among the guests with God, thus recorded in the Mother Book.

Surah of Vision

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

And the king said: "Indeed I see seven fat cows being devoured by seven lean ones, and seven green ears of corn and others withered. O chiefs! Expound to me my vision, if ye can interpret visions!"

Praise be to God Who hath sent down verses of truth unto His servant, that men might be believers in the remembrance of the All-Merciful in that Book and bear witness to love of the Remembrance.

Verily, We shall relate unto thee the most excellent interpretation of thy vision among the visions of men, with truth upon truth, which was inscribed as truth in the Mother Book.

The believers cannot bear aught of what God hath shown thee above the Throne of Truth within the consciousness of the heart, and God is witness over all things.

Say: After the dawn prayer in the sacred month of Ramadan, wherein the Qur'an was revealed, I saw, while facing the Qiblih and seated in contemplation, gazing toward God, the Most High - and God is witness over all things.

And there came a soul from the Holy Land, the sanctuary of Husayn, disheveled and dust-covered, approaching me by command, returning to the Command.

He said: "In my dream I saw a lofty tree growing in the sanctuary of Husayn, parallel to where his noble head lay upon the ground - which was raised up in truth by the truth.

And I saw upon it a beautiful maiden suspended, speaking: 'I am the Beloved of all worlds, of those who came first and last, of those in the East and West. I am the All-Seeing Eye of God, I am the Outstretched Hand of God, I am the All-Hearing Ear of God,' and similar words, raising her voice to heaven, turning neither right nor left, speaking without pause or hesitation, and I saw not from her, in very truth, any moment of silence regarding these words.

The tree and the words of the one suspended thereon amazed me, just as God showed me His mighty signs in truth upon truth.

I was honored to attain the presence of Imam Musa ibn Ja'far, the Supreme Proof of God. I began mentioning the tree and the words of the one suspended thereon. The Imam indicated toward you with his hands, gloriously, transcendently, majestically, and sublimely in truth, saying: 'Verily God created this tree for my brother, the apple of my eye and fruit of my heart.' And he completed his exalted words with four sublime words similar to these.

And there the green ears were completed, and the matter in the Mother Book was seven.

O chiefs! Interpret for me the vision of God's Supreme Remembrance, if ye can give the best interpretation as witnessed in God's Preserved Book.

The All-Merciful hath interpreted in His Book concerning the Center of the Command through the mystery that none should comprehend - that is God's hidden grace, veiled in mystery, concealed in mystery, sheltered by mystery from all around the line. He giveth it to whom He willeth, and He is the All-Wise, the Gracious, and He, verily, is the Most High, the Supreme.

He hath explained through the interpretation of the Book regarding the vision of the Gate, and none remembereth God's verses save he who hath upon his neck a pure covenant with God by Our leave, and verily God is witness over all things.

Verily He is the Truth, there is no God but He, and He hath knowledge of all things.

O people of the earth! Let not forms veil you \[...\]

Verily He is the All-Knowing of all things! O people of the earth! Let not forms and garments veil you at the Gate, for verily He is, in truth, the Path of God, the Most High, recorded in the Mother Book around the Fire. God hath ordained this punishment as your just recompense for having been obstinate deniers of the signs of His Servant without right. And verily God did not create Muhammad to be the father of any of your men, but God hath placed him in the heart of the Throne for His Most Great Day, which God hath decreed in truth to be treasured and concealed. And verily God hath made the mystery of His Servant great upon the land of the heart. Minds cannot ascend to His station, for God hath ordained in the Mother Book that the decree of the Point of Fire be irrevocable. And God willeth not that imaginings should soar into the atmosphere of His earth, in truth and by truth, concerning what God hath decreed and ordained, for the decree in the Mother Book is conclusive. Know ye that this decree concerning Him from God is a truth, contingent upon the acceptance of His Word of Self, in the Most Great Truth, before all the worlds. Know ye, O servants of God, that God hath made the dominion of earth and heaven Ours through His power, and the decree in the Mother Book is irrevocable. And verily We shall inherit the earth and all that is thereon by God's leave, as God hath ordained in the Mother Book, in truth and by truth, conclusively. And verily We have bestowed upon thee from Our dominion that which God hath willed concerning thee, according to the mystery within the mystery concealed in the veiled mystery. Stand thou firm as thou wert bidden, before and after, upon the Word of the mystery within the hidden mystery, mighty and steadfast. And weigh the hearts of Our followers with the balance of justice from thy knowledge, and show mercy unto them, for verily God is independent of all worlds. And verily We have ordained for the first one to deny Our Servant a fire from the Zaqqum tree which God hath created in the land of Sijjin, and the decree concerning them is, in truth and by truth, conclusive. God hath not ordained for you to leave your land to acquire knowledge of His earth except after days which God shall manifest from His presence - there the decree is obligatory and irrevocable. Soon will God manifest Him in a land, suddenly, in truth with weighty truth, alone. And when He calleth you from God, know ye that God hath enforced His decree, and the promise concerning Him is, in truth, conclusive. Therefore turn ye unto God and seek Our deliverance, in truth and by truth, from the Gate nearby. Fear ye God on the day when the Remembrance shall call among you from God, the Most High, in powerful truth, alone. None shall answer Him save certain souls among the believers who have been treasured and concealed in the Mother Book with God, the Truth. And verily We have ordained good things for those who are foremost, as God hath ordained preserved in the Mother Book. And verily We have set for all things a limit according to the limit of all things, concealed in that Gate. And verily We have ordained for all things, in truth and by truth, by God's leave, a written term. Ye cannot hasten what We have decreed concerning you, nor can ye delay what We have appointed as its term.

Ye shall not hasten that which We have ordained to come to pass in due time amongst you, for thus hath it been inscribed in the Mother Book by the decree of the Remembrance. Verily God shall cause you to die at the hour when the angels take your souls, they who, by His command, have ever been, through the Remembrance, truly powerful executors of the Truth. We, verily, do strengthen Our servant through a spirit from Us, the like of which hath never been created in aught else, in very truth.

They say: "These are but confused dreams! Nay, we know not the interpretation of dreams!" K.H.Y.'A.S. Praise be to God Who hath sent down the Book in truth unto His servant, and hath ordained the angels of the heavens and the earth to circle round the Gate, for verily We have established within his heart the Sacred House in truth. Be ye then, for the sake of God, the Most High, praiseworthy upon the mighty truth. Verily We have made the exalted angels, by God's leave, to be His hosts, and He is God Who hath ever been, in truth, a witness over His servants. Ye do naught save what We will concerning you, and verily God doth encompass all creation. O people! Convey Our word openly to those who are absent, concerning that which God hath purposed regarding His servant who was praised in the Mother Book. And say to the Romans: "By what authority do ye conquer unjustly in the nearest part of the earth in vain delusion?" Verily We shall, God willing, demand the blood of the believers from you in that great truth, and ye shall find no way to escape. And verily, were We to will it, We would take from you Our dominion, and God hath ordained no reversal to Our power in truth. Verily We have made this Book the mystery of the Qur'an, letter by letter. Follow then the greatest light of God amongst you, for if ye follow not God's greatest command concerning you, then by the True One, ye shall not find on the Day of Resurrection even an atom's weight of your deeds, however small. Verily We have prescribed for you that which God had formerly prescribed for the believers in His Book, and ye shall find no variation in the way of the All-Merciful concerning this matter. By the True One, ye shall not find therein a single letter other than the letters of the Qur'an, and God is witness over all things. Fear God, O servants of God, concerning that which He hath ordained for you in the Mother Book as an irrevocable decree of the Gate. Verily the Cause of God hath come - hasten it not. Soon shall We show you Our signs concerning that Gate, which have been hidden in all the Tablets. The word from Us hath been fulfilled that We shall assuredly fill the East and West of the earth with justice, as God hath willed, in a praiseworthy manner, after We have seen it filled with unbelief towards the Gate and denial. Know, O servants of God, that God hath created among you a soul from yourselves, a mortal like unto you, that ye might believe in God and His Cause from the presence of the All-Wise in truth, and the decree concerning the station of the Gate hath been determined with God. Our light hath come unto you in that Greatest Book that ye might believe in God and His verses in a praiseworthy manner. Verily We have made him wise in the Mother Book as a remembrance for Our servants who may be weak in faith. O servants of God! Convey Our Cause, for God hath prescribed for you in this Book a praiseworthy decree from His wisdom. O ye who are present! Convey God's true Cause to those who are absent, all together in beautiful words. Verily We have sent down Our servant from the Concourse on High as a bounty unto the believers, and God doth encompass all things, that he might teach you the interpretation of traditions and the mysteries of the Book which had been abandoned by you contrary to truth. Verily We have sent down the Remembrance unto you \[...\]

Verily We have sent down the Remembrance unto you, and We have been its Guardian through God, the Most High. God hath placed the believers from among His companions upon the straight paths of truth, upon the mighty Truth, though they be few. God hath made Our servant among you a witness unto the Truth, by the Truth, over all the worlds. He is the Witness at the creation of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, by the Truth, through the mighty Truth, all together. We have made him in the Mother Book a testimony concerning the creation of your souls and your deeds and whatsoever ye acquire in your private and public lives. He is God, Who hath ever been the Knower of all things. Know ye, O servants of God, through the Truth, by the faithful Truth, with the eye of certainty, most assuredly, that God hath appointed for Us and for Our servant a station which hath been, in the Mother Book, cut off from the worlds at the Point of Fire, and the Command in the Mother Book hath been forbidden around the Water. We are He and He is We, except that He is He, and Our servant is he who hath ever been, in the Mother Book, a witness over the worlds. Verily We, We have made God's proofs to rest upon all the worlds through the mighty Truth together. Fear ye God, O servants of the All-Merciful, concerning that which God hath stored within the heart of Our servant of the knowledge of the Gate, through the Truth, by the most great Truth. Verily they who pledge allegiance unto thee in Our decree from God unto the Truth, by the Truth, it is as though they pledge allegiance unto God, the Truth, and God is witness over all things. We have placed the hands of Our servant above your hands, for what he hath borne of the Most Great Name of God in Our mystery, through the Truth, by the Truth - a thousand unmultiplied - and the decree from God in the Mother Book hath been accomplished. The unbelievers have testified against their own souls, through the Truth, by the Truth, with confused dreams, and the idolaters with visions, and ye shall not be interpreters of the Fire within your midst, written in the Mother Book around the Gate.

The Surah of Mirrors. In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

And he who escaped from among them remembered after a time and said: "I will inform you of its interpretation, so send me forth." Ta Ha. He is God, there is no God but Him. He has revealed to me that I am verily God, the Truth. There is no God but Him, so worship Him and be sincere in religion to the Most Great Remembrance, for we belong to God and to Him is our return, as inscribed in the Book of God upon the Most Great Truth.

O people of the East! Follow Our servant in what God has sent down to you as a light and an illuminating Book upon the Truth. O people of the West! Come forth from your homes to aid the Cause of God before the day when the All-Merciful will come to you in the shadows of clouds, surrounded by angels who glorify God and seek forgiveness for those who believe in Our signs in truth. The matter has been decreed and judgment has been established in the Mother Book.

You shall find no way to repel Our power in truth, by the truth, in any measure. At that time you shall neither be able to move toward the truth nor find rest in aught else. The kingdom has been inherited by him for whom God ordained it in the Mother Book from ancient times. Fear God, O servants of God, and be among the first to believe in Our servant and His glorious and mighty Book.

Verily God has preserved it for this your day that you might be well-informed of God and His signs in that Gate. We have named it in the Mother Book, by God's leave, as pure and sweet water. God has created the believers from a drop distilled from that Most Great Ocean, and God is knowing of all things.

O servants of the All-Merciful! Fear God in your thoughts about God concerning this Gate, lest you falsely and vainly attribute to it what is not true. It is not for any mortal that God should give him the Book and wisdom, then he should say to people "Be servants to me instead of God." Glory be to God, far above what the wrongdoers imagine concerning His signs in their great arrogance.

We indeed say to the people: "Be pure servants to God alone and associate nothing with His worship in truth." We have taken from the Prophets a covenant for God that you shall surely believe in God's Remembrance and shall aid Him. God will question the truthful about their truthfulness. These have fulfilled God's covenant in concealing His Remembrance, and We have been witness over them and over all the worlds.

Do you seek other than God's pure Remembrance, when to Him have submitted all who are in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly? Say: "We believe in God and His words, and we make no distinction between any of His signs." Be submissive to God and praising of the Most Exalted Gate.

Whoever follows other than this Remembrance, God will not accept anything of his deeds, and he shall be recorded among the unbelievers in God's Book. How shall God guide one who has disbelieved after his faith, and who had testified that the Gate is truth, and the Book has come with truth? God guides not those among you who are ungrateful to God's praiseworthy Remembrance.

These - their recompense is the Fire, and upon them is the curse of God and the curse of the angels and of all the believers, except those who repent after their disbelief. God will forgive whom He wishes and take vengeance on whom He wishes, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise. Those who associate partners with God - God will not accept from them the earth's fill of red rubies even if they should spend it in God's path.

He is God, the Mighty, the Wise! Verily those who ascribe partners unto God - even were they to expend in His path whatsoever the earth contains of rubies red - God will never accept aught from them. God hath desired from the believers pure and sincere faith, and He, verily, is independent of all creation. God hath ordained for mankind no secret commandment after knowledge of this Book save for him who submitteth his face unto God, aideth Our Cause, and awaiteth the dominion of truth in the remembrance of God, the Most High, through truth and with compelling might, which is nigh. God hath prescribed for these believers a double portion of reward and a goodly final abode, according to the decree of the Book, as a provision.

O people of the earth! Believe in God your Creator and follow the light of God within you. This Faith is the religion of Abraham, and hath been inscribed in the Mother Book as the upright Faith. Be not far removed from God, your Lord, the All-Merciful. This Gate is, with your Lord, the first House established for mankind upon the land of the heart, sanctified above all creation. God hath ordained round about it these clear signs: the Station of Abraham. Whoso entereth therein is, in the Mother Book, secure. Pilgrimage to this House is a duty unto God for all who are able to make their way thereto along the equatorial line from the point of fire.

They who have disbelieved in the Remembrance after having heard the words of God from His tongue - God will surely cause them to burn in the fire at the gate of stone in the depths of hell for their disbelief in God, the Most High. God is witness over all things. How can ye disbelieve in God, your Lord, Who created you, when ye read God's Book from aforetime? Do ye find therein, or in that Book, any discrepancy in even a single letter of the truth? By God! Were ye all to gather to take a single letter contrary to the revealed Book, ye would be powerless. God hath sent it down from His presence, and He, verily, hath power over all things.

Whoso holdeth fast unto God's Most Great Remembrance hath fulfilled his purpose and is recorded in the Mother Book as being upon the praiseworthy path. O servants of the All-Merciful! Fear God before death overtaketh you, and die not save in submission to God's remembrance, the Most High. This decree hath been ordained of God in all the Tablets. O people of the earth! Hold fast to the mighty cord of God - Our remembrance - this Arabian Youth Who hath been concealed at the point of snow.

Become ye brothers in God's one religion upon the straight path. God desireth that your hearts be mirrors unto your brethren in faith, that ye be reflected in them and they in you. This is the path of God, the Mighty, through truth, and God is witness over what ye do. We, verily, have made from water every living thing, according to what God hath ordained in the Mother Book concerning the point of water round about the fire. And he who was saved among the believers said: "O people of the earth! Remember after this verse that I shall inform you of the interpretation of the vision from this Remembrance, so turn ye unto God, the Truth, for He, verily, encompasseth all things." \[...\]

O Joseph, O truthful one, expound unto us concerning seven fat cows which seven lean ones devoured, and seven green ears of corn and others that are withered, that I may return unto the people, perchance they may come to know. Divine Cup-Bearer! God hath revealed unto me that this Remembrance is the Supreme Remembrance of God. Take heed, O My servants, lest ye speak concerning Him aught except through God, besides Whom there is no God, and He is verily the Most Exalted, Who in the Mother Book hath been decreed wise. Verily this Youth is God's servant, from Whom He hath taken His covenant concerning all things, and God hath made Him in truth a witness over all things. Be not as those who unite over the Book yet divide over the Remembrance, for verily the Book is with the Remembrance. By God, the Truth upon Truth, it hath been recorded in the Mother Book as an example. God is the Truth. On that Day faces shall become white and faces shall become black. As for those who believe in the Remembrance, their faces shall be whitened, but those whose faces are blackened shall be in torment from their station. Verily God is independent of all the worlds. By thy life, We desire no injustice against mankind. Unto God belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and earth in truth. Deny not God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, for He verily encompasses all the worlds. Those who deny God and His verses, from them shall the All-Merciful and His angels and the believers disassociate themselves. For them is abasement and wretchedness in this world, and in the next God hath prepared for them a grievous punishment in truth upon truth. These are the verses of God which We recite unto thee that perchance mankind may not doubt God even to the weight of a mustard seed, and may speak concerning God's exalted Remembrance words of praise with glory. O people of the earth! Are diverse lords better, or the One God besides Whom there is no God, the Single, the One, the Unique, the Self-Subsistent, Who hath no partner, and there is nothing like unto Him, and He is independent of all in the heavens and earth, and He is God Who hath ever been ancient in truth upon truth. He created the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them by His power. Is there any besides Him who can sustain creation? Glorified be He! He is the True Object of Worship, there is no God but He, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise. People are not equal in faith. Among them are those who have hastened to Paradise nearer than a ray to the sun, and among them are those who stand at the right of the Throne, and among them are those who prostrate to God upon the earth, and among them are the seekers at the Gate. None knoweth their station save God, and verily He hath power over all things. He is the Truth, and He is God Who knoweth all things. O ye believers! Command the greatest good, which is Our Remembrance, and forbid those who call creation to aught besides God, and hasten to this Book, prostrating yourselves before God your Lord, praised in truth with thanksgiving. O people of the earth! If ye are not content with My Remembrance, then die in your rage and depart from God's earth if ye are able. Yet ye have no way to escape from Our dominion. Be not deceived by Satan, but worship the All-Merciful that ye may inherit Paradise through the Gate's bounty, abiding forever. O people! Fear God in your journeying to the cities, and know that God verily watcheth over the worlds. Whatever evil ye commit, We shall surely make you taste its recompense in the Fire.

O people of the earth! We shall cause you to taste the fire as recompense, and whatsoever good ye do, by the truth, ye shall find it preserved with God in the Mother Book. Spend for yourselves in righteous deeds from your works, and spend for the poor from your wealth by night and by day, secretly and openly, as much as ye are able. Fear not poverty, for verily God increaseth for whomsoever He willeth through His power, and the Will of God, thy Lord, cannot in truth be turned back from aught.

O people of the earth! Hear My call from around the Gate. God hath revealed unto Me that no soul hath borne witness in the path of this Remembrance but that his reward hath fallen upon God, and God is powerful over all things. O ye believers! If ye are truthful in your claim of belief in God and await Our deliverance, then by My Lord, the Truth, beside Whom there is no other God - whosoever hath followed this Remembrance from My presence hath verily followed Me, and whoso hath loved the Remembrance for the sake of God hath indeed loved Me, and whoso desireth to behold Me, let him look upon His countenance, and whoso desireth to hear discourse from Me, let him hearken from the True Tongue of God the wondrous words of wisdom and the keys of mercy. Whatsoever ye desire of Me in any matter, I have indeed commanded you through My exalted Self, for He is the Light of the Essence in the heavens and earth, and God hath sent Him down with Me that ye might bear witness unto Him even as the angels and Prophets have borne witness before Him.

By your Lord, the Truth, beside Whom there is no God and unto Whom nothing can be likened! God hath made Him My Self in the worlds of Command and Creation, and He hath not separated Him from Me, by God's leave, less than what your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath numbered, and He will never separate Me from the truth eternally, perpetually, forever. Verily, I am the Caller at the heart of the Book through the Gate, and today there is no way for Me save through this exalted Gate which God hath made great in the Mother Book.

Ask ye the Remembrance concerning the unseen of the heavens and earth, for God hath made Him witness over the creation of all things and hath purified His nature from Sijjin and its book. When ye ask of Him and He judgeth not between you, doubt not the Remembrance of the Truth after the Truth - are ye more knowing or God Who created Him? And God is knowing of all things.

O people of the Euphrates! Hear the call of your Lord, the All-Merciful, from around the Fire: "Verily, I am God, there is no God but I. By My true glory, this Remembrance was prostrate before Me when none of you had existence. When I desired to make Him known, I spoke to that which was not, whereupon appeared the Throne, the Seat, the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them. O My servant! Draw nigh unto Me and grieve not, for verily God is with thee, in truth a witness."

There is naught but that God hath written its term in this Book by the hands of the Remembrance, in truth appointed and decreed. Whoso desireth God and the Hereafter, We guide him to the Remembrance, and whoso desireth this world, We give unto him through the Remembrance. God hath not ordained for either of these two groups any support save through the Remembrance, in truth raised up. Say: Dead are those who have disbelieved in God, and ye are dead. Therefore hasten ye to Paradise and distance yourselves from the Fire. By the Most Great God, verily this worldly life is cut off \[...\]

Keep yourselves away from the Fire, for by the Most Great God, this worldly life is ephemeral and God has not ordained for it any permanence. And verily the life of the world to come is the true life in the sight of God, enduring, eternal, everlasting. O people of the earth! Today My proof among you is this Remembrance, so turn ye towards the Holy Land and be patient therein, and be ye pure helpers of God, apart from all others. Turn ye unto Me, for verily We do not suffer to be lost the reward of any who doeth good. And whoso dies in his journey, his reward shall fall upon Me, and in the Book of God it hath been inscribed in the Balance of the Remembrance. O people of the earth! God hath exalted Our name through the Most Great Name, and God hath made it naught but a written mercy unto the believers, and naught but a mighty retribution unto the unbelievers. Fear ye therefore your Lord on the Day when all shall return unto God, the Most High, and He is God Who encompasseth all things. O Solace of Mine eyes! If thou wert to teach and speak with the believers from that which thou hast been given by the Most Great Truth, the believers would disperse from around thee even as darkness vanisheth at the dawning of the sun. Therefore show mercy unto the believers through thy forgiveness, for verily the people cannot reach thee save as an ant might attain unto Divine Unity. Ask thou forgiveness for them and trust in God, Who - there is no God but He - is my Lord and thy Lord. Verily God hath ever been bountiful unto the believers, and He is God Who is witness unto all things. O people of the earth! By your Lord! The Son of Abu Talib was verily among you from God with the Most Great Truth, and He knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth, and whatsoever ye conceive in your breasts. He is the Truth from God and on the Day of Resurrection He shall be a true witness over you. Verily God hath created the believing chiefs from the accumulated shadow cast by the gleams of light from Our remembrance. Therefore establish your hearts upon the pure path of God, the Most High - and He is God Who hath ever been ancient in truth - and speak naught concerning the Most Great Remembrance of God save the truth, for verily He hath been, in the sight of God and in Our sight, upon the Most Great Truth. He uttereth not a word except by God's leave and Our command, and He is established upon the straight path at the Point of Fire. O people of the earth! Hearken unto God's testimony concerning the Most Great Word: verily the earth and the heaven and whatsoever is between them are in His hand like a ring upon the finger of any one of you, which he may turn whithersoever he willeth. The true Command of God is in His hands; He hath indeed turned the kingdom as He hath willed, by what God, the Truth, hath willed. Verily God wrongeth no one in aught, and God is witness over all things. O ye believers! Fear God in regard to My remembrance with a mighty fear, true and most high, for verily the remembrance of God, the Most High, in the sight of God, the Most Great, hath ever been supremely great in truth. And verily We, when We presented this Most Great Name to creation with the truth in the most great realm of the atoms, some of the Prophets excelled in determination, and God made them leaders for mankind in truth. And among them were those who paused for less than the glance of a gnat's eye, so God afflicted them with trials, like Adam and Shu'ayb and Jonah and Job, until they acknowledged thee. Then the successors of the Prophets excelled in their response, and for this reason God made them the Imams of the earth. Then those excelled for whom grace had been foreordained from the Remembrance \[...\]

O people of the earth! Fear ye God, for We desire naught from you save your salvation, though ye comprehend not what profiteth or harmeth your own selves. God, the Truth, teacheth you that were ye to follow His Cause, ye would find yourselves, of your own accord, beloved at this Gate of Truth. And should ye turn away from God, verily He is independent of you in truth, and ye would find yourselves most grievously antagonistic and wretched. O Joseph, thou Truthful One! Interpret thy vision through seven words from One All-Wise, All-Informed. He is God, Who hath ever been All-Knowing of all things. O people of the earth! God, the Truth, causeth you to journey through seven green ears of corn by virtue of this Most Great Word, that ye might hasten unto God, the Truth, and learn, for the sake of the Remembrance, to place your hopes in God, the Truth, Who hath ever encompassed all things. We, verily, have interpreted this blessed verse through this purified evidence by God's leave. Our foremost followers, who seek Us before the Gate, shall recognize this as praiseworthy through the Gate.

Surah of the Call

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful

The trustees of the Prophets have preceded others in responding, and thus hath God made them the leaders of the earth. Then followed those who were favored with prior grace from the Remembrance, while others were held back according to the decree of the Book concerning their being held back. There is nothing We have not accounted for in that Book with clarity. \[...\]

He said: "Ye shall sow for seven years diligently, and what ye reap, leave it in its ear, except a little whereof ye shall eat." O people of God! God hath revealed unto me that this Remembrance is the Most Great Remembrance of God. Fear ye, O My servants, lest ye speak concerning it without the authority of God, besides Whom there is no God, and He is exalted above all things and great. Verily, this Youth is the servant of God. God hath taken His covenant from all things concerning the Truth, and He is the Witness over all things. O Concourse of Light! Hear My call from around this Gate. I am the Proof from God unto all creation, and God hath revealed unto me that whosoever among you cometh on the Day of Distinction with this Most Great Remembrance, he shall be deemed before God as one of pure faith, and thus hath it been inscribed in the Mother Book. But whoso cometh unto the All-Merciful without His covenant shall have no power over anything, and for him there shall be with God a grievous chastisement, for God hath power over all things. O people of the earth! Hath not the Remembrance come unto you with the truth? How then do ye judge yourselves according to the rule of falsehood? Is he who followeth the Most Great Remembrance of God like unto him who hath incurred God's wrath? What aileth you that ye perceive not the signs of God, the Most High, the True, the Faithful, the Strong, save a little? Verily this Religion is, with God, the mystery of the Religion of Muhammad. Hasten ye therefore to Paradise and the Most Great Good-Pleasure of God, if ye be patient and grateful concerning His signs in truth. God hath indeed been gracious to the believers when He raised up among them a Gate from among themselves, who reciteth unto them His verses, and purifieth them, and teacheth them the Book and wisdom, whereas before they knew naught of the knowledge of the Book save an alif from a curved ba. And when affliction befalleth you, remember God your Creator, and lean not upon yourselves, and say: "All is from God." What aileth these polytheists that they understand not Our wondrous utterances in truth? O people of the earth! Enter ye all through this Gate by the grace of your Lord, for God hath not ordained that any mortal should touch it before you. Follow ye the Most Great Good-Pleasure of God, for God hath ever been possessed of great bounty towards mankind, and He encompasseth all things. Secret counsels are only of Satan. The unbeliever desireth to cause grief to Our friends, but he cannot harm you in aught except by God's leave. In God let the believers put their trust. O ye who believe! Let not those who turn away from the Remembrance grieve you, those who call upon falsehood besides God, lying without truth and in delusion. These shall never harm God in aught, and God hath willed that they shall have no portion in the Hereafter, and He hath prepared for them in hell a grievous torment. Think not that those who disbelieve in the Remembrance can ever escape, for We have extended to them fire upon fire that they might increase in fire upon fire, and God hath ordained for them in the Hereafter naught save a humiliating torment. Unto God belongeth the heritage of the heavens and the earth. We hear the words of those who say "God is poor and we are rich" apart from the Remembrance. Say: When ye die, ye shall bear witness in truth that God is the Self-Sufficient, and all besides Him are poor at His gate, and He is indeed the Self-Sufficient, the Great.

He is God, Who hath ever been supremely independent. God hath ordained death for all souls, as decreed in the Mother Book. Whoso turneth away from the Fire and followeth the Remembrance hath attained unto God, the Self-Sufficient, and verily God hath power over all things. In the wondrous verses, and in the creation of souls, and in the day and night, and the moon and stars, are signs for every penitent one who in the Mother Book is accounted among those who turn unto God. God hath verily assigned the kingdom of the heavens and earth unto Us, and We have been, through God, independent of all the worlds. They who remember God by night and day, and upon their couches, and who say "O our Lord! We have heard Thy verses and await Thy Cause. O God! Make firm our hearts in Thy Cause, for verily Thou hast power over all things." These are they who hasten unto Paradise, and God hath ordained for them a double portion of reward. God is the Protector of the believers, and He hath power over all things. O people of the earth! Follow the Fire that circleth round the Water, for it speaketh naught but by God's leave. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. Hold ye fast, all of you, to the cord of God, for this is the Truth set forth in God's Book from the beginning, and it hath been hidden in the Point of Fire. O company of men and jinn! Seek ye grace from Our presence, for God hath given Us dominion over the heavens and earth, as witnessed in this glorious Gate, and thou hast been praised in God's exalted Book. O ye believers! Hearken unto My call from around the Gate, and seek bounty from this Remembrance, the Most Great Name of God, and slay the idolaters in Our path, purely for God's sake, if ye be thankful unto God, the All-Praised. God hath assured His loved ones of immortality, and God's true promise is the truth, and the Command hath ever existed in the Book. Behold ye Our Most Great Light, the Most Exalted One, Who hath been praised in God's Primal Book. O people of the earth! Fear ye God on the Day of Truth, for We shall gather all creation on a single plain, and God shall question you through the tongue of the Remembrance concerning your deeds. He is the Judge of Truth by the Truth, and He shall judge between you with justice upon God's path, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. God hath verily placed the names of the believers in your right hands, and We record with justice the names of the wicked in the Book of Sijjin. God hath ordained for Me and for this Youth, the Most Great Remembrance of God, a station that none besides God, our Creator, can comprehend, and ye know naught of His Cause save as mirrors reflect the rays of a lamp in a red glass. This is a decree from God conclusively established for your souls, and the Command hath been fulfilled in the Mother Book. God is verily the Encompasser of all things, and the Remembrance is God's truth, He is the True Knower, and when God willeth, My Cause hath knowledge of all things. O people of the earth! Fear God, your Lord, Who created you from a single substance and created from it mates for each soul among you. \[...\]

Verily for every soul among you hath God created a mate from itself, and God fashioneth you in the Gate as He pleaseth in truth, and God is ever watchful over all things. And when We bestowed upon the people a portion of this Book, they became tyrannical on earth and showed enmity towards the Remembrance. God well knoweth His enemies, and sufficient is God as a protector, and sufficient is God as the All-Knowing. Those who pervert the Word from its place, and say "We heard the verses of God, the Wondrous" from the tongue of the Remembrance, then opposed the Remembrance with their tongues, slandering the religion of God - God hath cursed them, and the believers curse their unbelief, and none believe in Our verses in truth except a few among the faithful. And God is witness over all things.

O People of the Book! Believe in what God hath sent down unto Me, confirming that which is with you, before death cometh upon you suddenly. Verily God hath spoken the truth of truths - He forgiveth not that partners be ascribed to this Remembrance, but He forgiveth all else to whom He pleaseth. And whoso ascribeth partners unto God hath indeed fabricated a manifest sin.

O People of the Remembrance! Ye purify not yourselves, rather God purifieth whom He willeth through His knowledge, and verily the Cause of God in this Book is accomplished. Look not unto those who were given a portion of the Remembrance, then fabricated falsehood against God and worshipped idols and false deities besides God. Sufficient for them is their own souls as a manifest sin.

Or have ye a share in sovereignty? Then bring me so much as an atom thereof. And people shall never attain unto aught, not even to the speck on a date-stone.

And verily God hath interpreted this blessed verse in that Most Great Word for those who desire the False One through seven gates of hell, and for those who desire the Remembrance through seven gates of paradise. And for these believers there shall come, God willing, in paradise thereafter a time wherein none shall be mentioned save God. And verily God hath power over all things.

The Surah of the Laws

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

Then there shall come after that seven hard years which shall consume what you have laid up for them, save a little of that which you store. O ye who believe! Call upon witnesses from among your brethren when ye perceive signs of death in yourselves, and bear witness for God and His creation with the testimony of God alone, and judge with justice concerning your possessions, and turn unto God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, with truth. Soon shall ye find God, your true Lord, All-Forgiving, All-Bountiful. O ye who believe! God hath prescribed for you fasting during this month, the month of Ramadan, wherein the Quran was revealed. Complete ye the number and remember God your Lord during the appointed days, that ye may be inscribed among the lines of the faithful in the Mother Book. And whosoever is on a journey during God's month, or hath an excuse before God, then let him fast an equal number of other days as God hath willed. And for those unable to fast, a redemption by feeding the poor is prescribed in the Book's decree. And for those who cannot afford anything, God hath prescribed for them His remembrance at morn and eve abundantly around the Gate in truth. We desire not from men save what is within their means, and We burden not any soul beyond its strength, for God is indeed Self-Sufficient, All-Praised. O people of the earth! When ye fast for God, let your limbs fast from idle talk and vain pursuits, for fasting is a barrier between God and His creation lest ye become heedless of God, your true Lord, in the slightest degree. God hath prescribed for you during His month, for those who witness the month in their land, that ye approach not women, neither eat nor immerse in water from when the white thread becomes distinct from the black thread at the horizon until the sun sets and its redness disappears. Then may ye approach your wives and eat of what God hath made lawful for you. This is God's ordinance in His Book from before, and ye shall find no change in Our ways in God's Book from before, nor shall Our Book be altered in any way. Fast ye voluntarily for God as much as ye are able, for We shall not suffer to be lost the reward of any among you who doeth good in the paths of the Gate in truth. O people of the earth! Fear God regarding this wondrous Word, that ye approach not the drinking of tobacco which ye have invented for yourselves, and purify yourselves from becoming the dwelling-place of Satan, for God hath purified you with the purity of His loved ones. Therefore turn ye unto God regarding this pure ordinance, swiftly content with God, the Truth. And do not have relations with women during your seclusion in the mosques, and approach not Satan's innovations in your mosques, for they are condemned by God in His Most Great Book. These are God's bounds, so approach them not, and be ye patient and grateful regarding God's verses in Our remembrance in truth. Complete the Hajj and Umrah in the known months, and whatever good ye do, ye shall find it recorded with God in the Mother Book. Remember your Lord, the All-Merciful, in the land of Arafat and at the Sacred Monument, and magnify Him during the known days, that ye may be believers grateful before God at that Gate. And when people call upon Us with good deeds for Our remembrance, We inscribe for them a beautiful good deed, for God hath power over all things. We have indeed set bounds for you \[...\]

We have set down for you the bounds and laws in your religion that you may know that God, your Master, is the All-Sufficient, the Most Merciful, and that God's favor in this Gate has been, in very truth, immense upon mankind. God has intended in His Praiseworthy Book by the first intoxicant and by the second gambling, so shun them both and treat not your sick with that which is forbidden, for God has not placed in that which is forbidden even an atom of healing power, in very truth. Treat your sick with cold, invigorating water, for God has made from water every living thing, though you understand but little of the signs of God, the Most High.

O concourse of believers! Wed not idolatrous women until they believe, even though their beauty may please you, for God has prepared for you in Paradise those far greater than they. Therefore seek ye the good pleasure of God, the Most Great, for He, God, has ever been exalted and great.

Draw not nigh unto women during their courses, nor during their lying-in, except after their cleansing. God has ordained for some women three days for their courses, for others more, and for others ten days; and for those lying-in similarly ten days if their blood does not cease to flow; and when the blood stops before the ten days, then upon them is cleansing obligatory. This decree has been prescribed in the Book of God.

When ye approach women or find the known discharge from yourselves, then wash yourselves for God, your Creator, and draw nigh unto your wives in their state of purity and after the cessation of their blood. This is God's irrevocable decree from your Lord. Hasten to observe the command of the Remembrance of God, the Most High, the All-Powerful, for He, God, has ever been exalted and great.

Resolve not on divorce, for it is a grievous error. If they commit flagrant misdeeds, then admonish them according to the decree of the Book, for God is witness to all things. God has ordained for them before drawing nigh unto men to wait three menstrual cycles, and they must not conceal what God has created in their wombs, nor after knowledge of what is in their wombs take medicine to cause miscarriage, for all this is wickedness in the sight of God, thy True Lord. God is well aware of what they do in their inner selves.

God has decreed for women to wait four months and ten days after the death of their husbands, then after that they are free to do as they choose according to the decree of the Book. God knows what is in their hearts if they be believing, righteous women. God is witness to all things.

If ye divorce women before having touched them, then upon you is half the dowry of what ye had fixed for them, unless they forgo it or he in whose hand is the marriage tie forgoes it with their permission. And if ye give them their full due in a befitting manner, ye shall be recorded with God, the Truth, in the scrolls of the righteous.

Lend to the believers what ye are able with proper witness, for God has guaranteed you manifold increase, and God's promise in the Mother Book shall be fulfilled. O ye believers! Establish prayer and give the alms to those who have with God a covenant of truth in the ways of the Gate, for which they shall be held answerable. Ye perform no good deed but that the Recording Angels write it down for you, and ye shall find your deeds on the Day of Resurrection before the All-Merciful in the land of reckoning to be momentous.

Surah of the Laws

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

The angels have recorded your deeds, and you shall find your works mighty in the presence of the All-Merciful on the Day of Reckoning in the land of accounting. God has prescribed for the unintentional killer blood money to be paid to the heir of the slain, and the freeing of a believing soul for the purification of himself. And if he cannot afford this, then according to the decree of the Book he must fast two consecutive months as repentance before God. And whosoever forgives the right of his believing brother, for him there is a mighty reward with God.

O people of the earth! Fear God regarding the intentional killing of believers without right, for with God there is a mighty judgment concerning this.

O people of the earth! Fulfill the covenants of God in truth. He has made lawful for you the beasts of the cattle, except what is recited to you. And draw not near to hunting in the sacred precincts, nor while you are in a state of transgression according to the decree of the Book, as ordained through the Gate.

God has made the sacrificial offerings, the garlands, the sacred month, and the sacred rites as signs for the Most Great Remembrance, that people may know that God encompasses all things.

O people of the earth! Today I have perfected for mankind the religion of justice, and have completed My favor upon them through the Most Great Remembrance of God, and have chosen for you submission through that Most Great Remembrance in truth.

We have made lawful for you today all good things for sustenance, and what you take in hunting, so eat of what God has made lawful for you and remember God's name over it. And God is well aware of what you do.

God has made lawful the food of the people of the Quran for the people of this Book, and We have made lawful the food of the people of the Book for them, that people may know that God is indeed far above what the wrongdoers say in their great arrogance.

Whosoever denies this Most Great Remembrance, his works shall be rendered void, and on the Day of Resurrection he shall not find even an atom's weight of his deeds.

O people of the earth! When you rise for prayer, purify yourselves and take of pure water in remembrance of the Most Great Name of God. Wash your faces in circular motion and your hands up to the elbows evenly. Pass the remaining water over the front of the head and over the feet to the ankles, as prescribed in the Book and ordained in truth.

God has made earth a substitute for water in purification for prayer. So turn to God in truth, for We burden not souls beyond their capacity. Remember God's covenant and Our pledge within yourselves secretly without declaring it aloud. Verily your Lord God, your True Master, knows well what is in the hearts.

God has forbidden you in His mighty Book the eating of carrion, spilled blood, swine flesh, beasts of prey, and that over which any name other than the Most Great Remembrance of God has been invoked. Follow the decree of the Book, for God is witness over all things.

God has prescribed for the believers in the Book regarding retaliation: life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and for wounds there is retaliation in truth. And whosoever gives charity to his brother, God will guarantee his reward and has prepared for him in the Hereafter a praiseworthy recompense in truth.

Then, after that, will come a year in which the people will be succoured and in which they shall press \[wine\]. Alif, Lam, Mim, Sad. O ye believers! Do not forbid yourselves from partaking of the good things which God hath ordained lawful unto you in His Book, and transgress not through intemperance, for God loveth not those who are intemperate. These are they who, in the Book of God with thy Lord, have been rejected with truth in truth. And if a man dieth without offspring, his sister shall receive one half of what he hath left, and if there be two sisters, they shall receive two-thirds of what he hath left, and if there be both men and women, then the male shall receive the portion of two females, according to what is prescribed in the Book, and this decree hath been irrevocably ordained in the Mother Book. God hath prescribed for the thief, both male and female, the cutting off of their hands as a recompense for their deeds, and verily God wrongeth not mankind by so much as the husk of a date-stone. O people of the earth! Fear God in your actions, for God will call you to account at the Balance on the Day of Resurrection for all things, and He is God, the Witness over all things. Swear not by God, nor by the names of the family of God, in any matter, whether in truth or in falsehood. Whoso sweareth falsely by God, upon him shall be the expiation prescribed with justice in the Book of God: the freeing of a slave, or the feeding of ten poor persons, and whoso is unable to do this shall fast for three days. God - there is no God but Him - and He is God, the All-Forgiving, the All-Wise. God hath forbidden the practice of idolatry and transgression, and diversion through gambling, and the consumption of wine, for these are abominations of Satan's handiwork. Therefore put your trust in God, your true Protector, and verily God encompasseth all things. God hath made lawful the catch of the sea and what ye hunt on land, but fear God regarding hunting in the Sacred Precinct and during the state of pilgrimage, that ye may be praised by God, the Most High. O people of the earth! Fear God regarding the removal of soil from the Holy Sanctuary save in times of necessity, and then take only the least amount possible, for God hath decreed the status of this soil to be as our own bodies, and hath ordained in His Book of Truth a grievous sin for this. Whoso hunteth in the Sacred Precinct, his recompense shall be the equivalent of what he hath killed from among cattle, and the feeding of the poor according to what is prescribed in the Book, or fasting as God hath ordained in the Mother Book. God hath made the Ka'bah the Sacred House, and the month a time for the standing forth of men, that they may bear witness to the truth that there is no God but Him, and He is God, Who encompasseth all things. O people of the earth! God hath revealed unto me in truth that ye shall not associate anything with God, and that ye shall show kindness to parents, and that ye shall not approach indecencies, nor the property of orphans, and that ye shall not slay any soul which God hath forbidden, except by right. This is from the tidings of the unseen which We reveal unto you, that ye may be praised by God, the All-Praiseworthy. Give full measure and weight with justice, maintaining perfect equity in this most upright religion. O ye believers! Pay the alms-due on the day of harvest according to God's decree, your Lord, and this command hath been prescribed in the Mother Book. And of cattle God hath provided you with eight kinds in pairs. These are lawful unto you, so eat of that which God hath provided you, of the good things thereof, remembering the name of God, your Lord, the All-Merciful.

Verily, among the cattle in the Book of God there are eight pairs, lawful unto you. Therefore eat of that which God hath provided for you, of their good things, mentioning the name of your Lord, the All-Merciful, and draw not nigh unto the footsteps of Satan concerning certain fats and the like, for verily God hath knowledge of all things. O people of the earth! Establish prayer with the Most Great Remembrance and send forth the alms by God's leave unto His deputies, that ye may be written down in the Mother Book among the people of the Book. These are they who are the truthful ones in God's Book, and their seat is the Paradise -- a mighty decree from God, the Most High. The prayer of the idolaters in the Sacred Precinct is naught but hypocrisy, seeking falsehood instead of truth. We shall therefore cause them to taste the fire of the blazing flame by God's leave -- a mighty decree. Verily God hath desired in this Gate to separate the evil from the good, and to place the evil in layers of darkness one above another, then cast them into the fire on the Day of Resurrection -- an irrevocable decree of truth by the truth. Say unto the idolaters: If ye obey the truth, God will forgive you your sins, but if ye deny the faith, then await the punishment from God, the Truth, for He is God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Know ye that whatever ye gain as spoils, verily unto God and unto the Messenger and unto those near of kin belongs a portion according to the truth that hath been inscribed in the Book of God, the Most High. Convey the pure truth unto the Truth -- excellent is your Lord, the Remembrance, as a protector and excellent as a witness. O people of the Throne! Hear My call from around the Fire: Verily I am God, there is no God but I, therefore worship Me and establish prayer unto the Most Great Remembrance, purely for God's sake apart from all men, for verily your Lord God is the Truth, and those who call upon aught else beside Him -- these are assuredly the companions of the Fire through justice. And verily this Remembrance is upon the pure path with upright line, established around the Fire. O ye believers! God hath prescribed for you prayer with the Remembrance on the day of Friday, that ye may be inscribed in the Mother Book upon the lines of those who pray. And among the people are those who defame thee concerning the alms: if they are given aught thereof they are well pleased, but if they receive not they become wroth with themselves regarding God's Most Great Covenant. These desire naught but this world's life, and in the Hereafter they shall be reckoned by God among the people of the Fire. Verily those who hurt the Remembrance concerning the alms, it is as though they hurt the Prophet concerning the alms, and God hath truly prepared for these idolaters in the world to come a grievous chastisement -- truth upon truth. God hath ordained the alms for the poor and needy among the people of the Covenant with the Remembrance, and for those whom God hath made workers in the Mother Book, and those whose hearts are to be reconciled, and those in debt, and the wayfarer, and in God's path -- a decree from the True Book which hath been prescribed in the Mother Book. O ye believers! Know ye not that those who oppose the Remembrance concerning his Lord, it is as though they opposed God and His Messenger through lies and delusion? Their abode shall be hell, and God hath not ordained for them any helper in the Hereafter by the decree of the Book. God hath ordained for one who breaketh the fast in the Sacred Month through something forbidden three acts of expiation, and God hath not decreed any contradiction between the traditions, nor is rejection praiseworthy in that Gate in the Mother Book. O ye believers! Verily a drop of tears is more beloved before God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, than the earth full of gold, were ye to spend it in God's path in truth \[...\]

O ye who believe! A drop of tears shed for the sake of God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, is dearer in His sight than all the gold on earth, were ye to expend it in His path in truth. Laugh not excessively at the truth, for verily God hath made the measure of a servant to be his weeping for the Most Great Truth, and this hath been an irrevocable decree in the Mother Book.

Take from their wealth what is due according to the Book, that their souls may be purified thereby, and pray for whomsoever thou willest among the believers, for God hath made thy prayers a written blessing for their souls. Verily God is All-Knowing of all things. We accept the repentance of the servants of God and receive their alms with Our own hands, and verily God, your True Lord, is Ever-Forgiving, All-Bountiful.

Whoso fulfilleth his covenant with God, verily his name hath been inscribed by the hands of the Remembrance in the Torah, the Gospel, and the Furqan from aforetime, and God's covenant hath been preserved hidden in the Mother Book.

God hath not prescribed for thee, nor for the believers, to seek forgiveness for the idolaters, even though they be of their nearest kindred, for they are assuredly the companions of the fire, as recorded in the Preserved Tablet.

O people of the Throne! Hear My call from the Point of the Bab. Verily God hath revealed unto Me on Mount Sinai, from around this Blessed Tree: "Verily, I am God, there is none other God but Me. I have sent down this Book concerning the hidden mystery of hearts concealed in the mention of the veiled Oneness, encompassing the Fire inscribed from the fourth line in truth upon the Most Great Remembrance, that men might be witnessed around the Gate by decree."

Verily those who conceal any letter of the Book, they but consume fire, and We shall neither look upon them nor speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, and God hath prepared for them in the depths of the coffin a grievous chastisement.

Righteousness is not that ye perform many good deeds, but righteousness is that ye believe in the Remembrance of God and aid Him with your wealth and your souls. If ye follow God's command regarding Our servant, ye shall assuredly be numbered among the righteous in God's preserved Book.

The Surih of Glory

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

And the king said: "Bring him to me!" When the messenger came to him, he said: "Return to thy Lord and ask him about the women who cut their hands. Verily my Lord is well aware of their guile." Ta Ha. God, there is no God but He, hath sent down the Criterion in truth upon His servant, that the people around the Gate might be remembered. And verily those who have disbelieved, their abode shall be the Fire, as hath been decreed by God in the Mother Book. These are they whom God and His angels have cursed, and they shall find no helper besides the All-Merciful on the Day of Judgment. Do they envy the Remembrance for what God hath bestowed upon him of His grace? God hath verily made this Youth, of the seed of Abraham, a mighty sovereign over the Book, and wisdom, and dominion, in truth by the truth. And verily those who disbelieve in this Most Great Remembrance, We shall cause them to burn in the depths of hell-fire, by God's leave, the Mighty, and God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. O people of the Throne! Hear ye the call of God from around the Gate: "Verily I am God, there is no God but Me. I have sent down this Book unto My servant that the people might believe and aid him in the day of battle, and circle round the House of their Lord God. For I say in truth: No servant hath known him but hath known My Self, and none hath been ignorant of him but hath been ignorant of the All-Merciful, his Lord. And I have planted by his hands gardens for the believers the like of which none save Me knoweth, and I am witness over all things." And We have indeed purified these believers through the Most Great Truth, such that they have followed the Remembrance in truth and have not dispersed from around him, and verily God is powerful over all things. And those who break their covenant with God after the truth hath come unto them in sincerity - these are the companions of the Fire, and God and His angels have cursed them for their unbelief, and God hath prepared for them in the hereafter a great punishment in truth by the truth. O people of the earth! Obey God, your Creator, in this Most Great Remembrance, for He is in truth the Authority in the Mother Book by the Most Great Truth. And if ye dispute concerning anything, refer it to the Most Great Remembrance, for He knoweth better than yourselves the interpretation of the Book, and He is witness over all things in truth. O ye believers! Enter ye all together into this First House in truth by the truth, for God hath made it a sanctuary for the believers and a great punishment for the unbelievers. O ye believers! Fear God, for death is nearer to your souls than all else, and God taketh your souls wherever ye may be, and the angels by His leave dispose in the kingdom as He willeth, and verily God is witness over all things. O Solace of Mine eyes! Turn away from the idolaters and leave them in their transgression, and put thy trust in God, the Truth, for He encompasseth all things. The likeness of those who call upon any besides the Remembrance at the Gate is as one who taketh lords besides God - their seat shall be the Fire by the decree of the Book, and the decree in the Mother Book is binding. O people of the earth! Fear God - do ye find in yourselves any judgment from the Remembrance apart from the judgment of the All-Merciful, while He claimeth naught save servitude before God, the One, the Single?

He claims naught but servitude to the One True God and obedience to us, the People of the House. What then causes you to hesitate in His Cause? By the True One, verily He is the Truth from God, and He is God, the Most High, the Great. Were it not for the grace of the Remembrance reaching you, you would have followed Satan, save a few. Whosoever intercedes before the Remembrance through the Remembrance, God hath prescribed for him good deeds as a recompense, a portion of mercy, for God, the Most High, is the Guardian of all things.

O people of the earth! When you are greeted with a greeting from the people of the Remembrance, return it with a better greeting, for verily your Lord, the True God, is the Munificent, the Generous. God, there is no God but He, the Truth, Who stands firm in the Cause, and in truth He saith: "There is no God but I. We have gathered creation for the Day of Remembrance wherein there is no doubt." And who is more truthful in speech than the Ancient God? And who is more truthful than the Remembrance in verses and scriptures, speaking truth from God and new creation through His Will? He is God, powerful over all things.

Ye will not except as God willeth, verily He encompasses all the worlds. We have taught the Remembrance what God hath willed - openly in His secret and secretly in His manifest revelation. O people of Eden! Hear My call from the center of the Kaf: "Verily I am God, there is no God but I." I have informed you concerning that station. When you greet the people of the Remembrance from the Lord, you become purified therein by leave of the Remembrance, for verily your Lord, the Most Merciful, encompasses all things.

O Solace of Mine eyes! On that Most Great Day, the Friday, God hath truly promised the people of Paradise around the Throne to descend to earth by leave of God, thy Lord. Grant them permission, for they stand truly waiting at the Gate, the Gate of Permission. Enter therein in peace - this is the Day of Truth from God, your Lord, the Merciful. Circle the House, effacing all else, then return to the sacred chambers in your glorious throne, for verily the appointed Day from God, the Most High, is nigh. By God, I yearn for God more intensely than you desire Me in visiting the Lord. Verily your Lord God is the Truth, and He is God, knowing all things.

Praise be to God Who hath taken neither consort nor son, and Who hath no partner in sovereignty. There is no God but He, the Mighty, and He is God, powerful over all things. He is the Truth, there is no God but He. He hath in truth attributed this Remembrance to Himself, and it is the Frequented House in all the Tablets, and the decree hath been written in the Mother Book around the Fire.

When We presented this Most Great Word of God to all creation, the realm of the divine cloud preceded in response, and thus did the Lord adorn it by effacing all else, for He is God, the Most High, the Ancient. Then the people of Paradise preceded creation in the Cause, and thus did God adorn them with the most exalted Throne, and God's Command was decreed in the Mother Book. Then the people of the Garden of Eden preceded in response, and thus did God adorn them at the pole of Paradise, and God's promise in the Mother Book was fulfilled around the Fire. Then from the earth, the earth of the Sanctuary, then from the month, the sacred month of Muharram, in God's Book which was written around the water, then from the water, the water of Euphrates \[...\]

God has promised in the Mother Book - and it has been fulfilled around the Fire - then from the earth, the earth of Hayr, then from the month, the sacred month of Muharram in the Book of God, which has been inscribed around the Water, then from the water of the Euphrates and the spring of camphor, and from the mountains, the mountain of hail upon the Land of Manifestation, according to the decree of the Book by the command of the Gate, which has been concealed around the Fire. O people of the earth! Hear My call from around this Tree, ignited with the ancient Fire - God, there is no God but Him, and He is God, the Most High, the All-Wise. O servants of the All-Merciful! Enter all of you through this Gate and follow not the footsteps of Satan, for he commands you to polytheism and indecency, and he is to you a manifest enemy. Do you not reflect upon a single verse from the verses of the Book? And do you not fear a day when God shall come to them in the shadows of clouds, with angels round about Him, when the matter will be decided, and unto the All-Merciful shall be the return of all people? And when a verse requiring prostration is read, prostrate yourselves before God your Creator, for He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and He is God, Who has ever been worshipped in truth with the truth. \[When the Sovereign of Sovereignty said: "Come unto Me," yet they answer not God with that word. We say: Return to your sacred dwellings and ask the Remembrance concerning the state of those women who cut their hands in His path. Verily God, my Lord, has ever been witness to the deeds of the sincere ones. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, naught is like unto Him, and He alone is to be worshipped, no partner has He, and He is God, Who has ever been exalted and ancient.\]

The Surah of Grace

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

He said: "What was your affair when ye made advances to Joseph against his will?" The women said: "God preserve us! no evil know we against him!" Said the wife of the Aziz: "Now is the truth manifest! I did seek to seduce him from his true self and he is indeed of those who are true!" Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds! O servants of God! Did I not enjoin upon you that ye should not take any god besides God, for He is the All-Merciful, and God, exalted be He, is indeed cognizant of all things. Verily We have sent down the verses in this Book that ye may believe in the Remembrance of God amongst you, and We have made it, in truth, in the Mother Book to be merciful. He is the Sovereign, by God's leave, over all that is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, that men may know that We are, by God's permission, powerful over all things. By thy Lord! Thou art indeed upon the straight path on the Day of Judgment before thy Lord. This is the path of God, the All-Praised, for all who are in the heavens and the earth by Our leave, and We are indeed witness to the truth thereof. By thy Lord! Thou art the Book wherein there is no doubt, and thou art indeed praiseworthy before thy Lord. Those who believe in the Remembrance of God in His absence and judge between men with His verses in truth, We shall surely grant them from Our presence a great reward. These are they who are guided by the Remembrance of God, and these are they who are the foremost, who are in truth witnessed in the Book of God. As for those who disbelieve in God in their hearts, it is the same to them whether thou warn them or not. By thy Lord! They will not believe in Our Remembrance save those who were inscribed in the Mother Book, the Book of God, the Truth. Verily We seal with the seal of the All-Merciful their hearts and their eyes and their ears, for they were unbelievers in the Book of God, the Most High, without truth. And among men there are those who say, "We believe in God and His verses," but by thy Lord! They believe not in thee. They would deceive God and His Remembrance, but they deceive none save themselves, and God hath prepared for them on the Day of Resurrection a grievous chastisement. And whoso turneth away from this My Remembrance, God shall appoint for him in this life humiliation, and in the life to come a great fire that shall encompass their hearts and their eyes and their ears, and they shall find no protector besides the Remembrance of God, the Most High, nor any helper in truth. And those who mock the believers for their faith in the Remembrance of God - God hath mocked them before, and nothing in Our true Remembrance can be forestalled. And verily, did We wish, We could take away their hearing and their sight, for God is indeed powerful over all things. Their likeness is as darkness upon darkness which God hath ordained one above another, and he for whom God hath not appointed any light hath no portion in the Remembrance of God, the Truth, in the Mother Book. O people of the East and the West! Worship your Lord, besides Whom there is no other God, Who created you and those before you, that ye may be in that Gate believers in and witnesses to the truth of the Remembrance of God, the Most High. O people of the earth! Associate not partners with God, for whoso harboureth doubt in his heart hath taken false gods besides God as lords. Such shall be his recompense in the Book of God - Hell, wherein he shall abide forever and ever. And if ye be in doubt concerning that which God hath sent down to this Our servant, then produce a single letter like unto it.

And if ye be in doubt concerning that which We have sent down unto Our servant, then bring forth a single letter like unto it and summon those whom ye have claimed as your learned ones besides the Remembrance of God, if ye place your trust in them apart from God, the Most High. He it is Who hath ever been, in the Mother Book, a witness. By thy Lord! These shall never produce aught apart from God, nor shall God grant them from the knowledge of the Book, in truth and by truth, even a little. Nay, whoso among them hath believed in the Remembrance of God hath indeed been guided, and We shall verily make him, before the All-Merciful, in that Gate, truly and assuredly, one endowed with knowledge. O people of the earth! If ye are unable to bring forth the like of this Book, then believe in God, your Lord, besides Whom there is none other god. By your Lord! Ye shall never be able to produce the like of even a portion of its letters apart from God, the Most High, and God hath power over all things. Fear ye, O servants of God, the fire which God hath prepared for the infidels among you in the iron earth at the bottom of the coffin, through His justice - verily God is just and wise in truth. And God hath ordained its atmosphere from the scorching wind. Ye shall find no succor today in truth, except that the fire shall succor you with fire from Our presence, as recompense for your having been, in regards to the Remembrance of God, the Most High, disbelievers cleaving to falsehood. And give glad tidings unto My believing servants who believe in the Remembrance of God and aid Him, and who fear none save God with the Most Great victory, even should the whole earth and all who dwell therein gather against them - they shall never turn aside from the truth. For them are gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they hear a mention they hear naught save the mention of God, the Most High. And therein they shall have pure companions from among the large-eyed houris, and in the hands of youth shall be golden goblets filled with fresh wine. And when they drink thereof they shall find therein the taste of all manner of fruits from the Tree of Eternity. And they shall recline upon crimson couches, greeting one another with remembrance, saying: "Praise be to God Who hath fulfilled His promise, for we were, through His Most Exalted Remembrance, believers and witnesses in the world." Verily God is not ashamed to set forth any similitude. As for those who are steadfast in Our remembrance, they know it is the truth from God, confirming that which the Prophets, the truthful ones, and the martyrs brought. And as for those who turn away from the Remembrance of God, they know it is the truth by what God hath ordained for them of the true Faith, yet they associate partners with God after their knowledge, saying: "What doth God intend by this servant of His?" For He is indeed severe in command, in truth and by truth. Many hath He caused to go astray thereby, and many doth He guide by His leave, and God hath power over all things. O people of the earth! Break not God's covenant after its binding pact, neither sever that which God hath commanded to be joined through His covenant with you, nor work corruption in the earth without His remembrance, for God's command hath been, in the Mother Book, decreed. By your Lord! The Remembrance of God, the Most High, is verily the truth from God, the All-Wise, your Lord, and God sufficeth as a witness unto His remembrance, in truth and by truth. God hath taken His covenant from all creation, and were it not that God had taken His covenant from you, ye would not exist. The All-Merciful createth naught except through His covenant, and He is, before the All-Merciful, established upon the throne. How then can ye disbelieve in God?

Verily, in the presence of the All-Merciful, He was established upon the Throne with majesty. How can ye deny God when ye were dead and He gave you life, then He causeth you to die, and then giveth you life again, then unto God, your true Lord, shall be your return? And He it is Whose throne was upon the waters by Our leave before the creation of the heavens and the earth, and verily We encompassed all things. O Remembrance of God! God hath preferred thee above all the worlds even as We preferred what God hath created and breathed forth, all of them, in truth. Fear ye God, O servants of God, against a Day when neither remembrance nor justice shall be accepted from you, save Our remembrance, and ye shall have none to help you in truth on that Day. When God removeth the veil from your insight, ye shall surely say concerning the Remembrance what the verse hath spoken in truth, letter by letter: "Now hath the truth become manifest, and ye were far removed from the truth in your false statements concerning the Remembrance of God, the True One." Verily, the Remembrance is none other than God, the True One, and He speaketh naught except from God, the True One, and He, the True One, is indeed informed of all things.

The Surah of Patience. In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

That they may know that I have not betrayed him in his absence, and that verily God guideth not the device of the treacherous ones... Celebrate the mention of the Face of thy Lord, besides Whom there is none other God, the Ancient of Days, and He is God, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Hearken unto that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord. Verily thou wert within the Mount communing with God, the Truth, and He is God, the Witness over all things. And verily We tested Adam through Our Tree, and commanded the angels to bow down in glorification unto the Most Merciful at Our Remembrance. Then Adam drew nigh unto Our Tree, and was accounted before God in the Book of the Most High as one who had wronged himself. And Satan refused to bow down before the Remembrance, whereupon We said unto him: "Get thee hence, for thou art accursed to the nethermost depths." And We taught Adam the station of Our Remembrance, and thereby did he become one before whom the angels of the heavens and earth bowed down. And We took Our covenant from all the peoples of the earth concerning Our servant, and revealed unto the Messengers that they should teach them not to approach this Tree, for it hath been ordained that none should draw nigh unto it save the servant of God, the All-Praised, this purified Youth, Ali. But by your Lord, they fulfill not God's covenant concerning Us, and the people have drawn nigh unto Our Tree through Satan's false oath, and thereby have they been expelled from the paradise of the All-Merciful. O Remembrance of God! Be patient with thy Lord with befitting patience, in truth and with truth. When the people denied Our servant, We said unto them: "Get ye down to earth; therein shall be your abode and provision for such time as God shall will in His glorious Book." And verily the decree in the Mother Book hath been recorded by the hands of the Remembrance round about the Fire. O people of the earth! Victory hath come from God - therefore circle ye round the House, for God hath spoken the truth with truth. Whoso followeth this guidance of Mine, We shall ordain that no fear shall come upon his soul, nor shall We decree for him in the Book any prolonged sorrow. O obedient Sun of God! Remember My favor which I have bestowed upon thee and upon the peoples of the earth from its east to its west, for God hath taken thy covenant from the peoples of earth and heaven. Remember Me and I shall remember thee, and verily God encompasseth all things. O people of the earth! Be ye patient and grateful concerning God and His signs. O people of the Quran! Be not the first to deny the Remembrance of God, nor sell the signs of God, the Most High, for a paltry price contrary to truth. O servants of God! Conceal not the truth after truth hath been made clear unto your souls. Doth not the Remembrance call you even as We called you to prayer, almsgiving and holy war? And verily God hath made this a weighty matter save unto the people of understanding, who stand alone in truth upon truth. Those who imagine they shall meet thee follow their vain desires. God shall soon show thee His authority over them. Glory be to God above what they imagine and what they describe! And He is God, the Witness over all things. And verily We delivered every nation from grievous torment and shall lift from you your afflictions, and the Most Great Command of God hath come unto you from your Lord, mighty in truth upon truth. And verily We parted the sea for Moses and drowned Pharaoh \[...\]

We drowned Pharaoh and his people, and verily We have been witness over every people through their leader. Fear the deed of those who disbelieved by taking the calf as lords besides God in falsehood. Remember God abundantly in the path of the Gate that ye may find tranquility through Our signs and be among the thankful in truth. And verily those who disbelieve in God ask thee about meeting Me. Say: Look upon Me; if your souls are at rest, soon shall ye behold Him. And We shall send thunderbolts upon them while they are regarded on earth as other than truth. Verily We withhold the shadow from whomsoever We will, and We send down good provisions upon whomsoever We will by God's leave, and We have sent down unto the peoples before you but shells of that which We have revealed unto you. The people have not preceded Us in anything, and verily We have been prostrate before our Lord in the pure cloud of truth. And when they ask thee about entering the blessed village, say: Enter the Gate, prostrating yourselves before God alone, and say 'What remaineth with God is best for you than your own selves.' Doubt not God and question not Our Cause, for verily we are God's and unto Him shall be our return, which hath been from ancient times ordained in the Mother Book. Verily We caused the rock to gush forth for Moses until every soul knew their drinking place, and through Our power they were, in truth, possessed of knowledge concerning that Gate. Verily We spoke unto Moses from the Tree on Mount Sinai by God's leave, and We manifested of Our light less than a needle's eye upon the Mount and those upon it, whereupon the mountain crumbled and became scattered dust. And Moses fell down in a swoon, and his people died fleeing unto God, the Exalted, and He is God Who hath knowledge of all things. Glorified be God, the Mighty, there is no God but Him. Verily Thy Cause is truth indeed before God, and We have been in truth its guardian. Be patient, O Solace of the Eye, for God hath assured thy glory throughout all lands and those who dwell therein, and He is God, powerful over all things. And when the people come unto thee asking what bygone peoples asked of their prophets, say: Unto God belongeth the conclusive proof. I am naught but the first of them that worship God, the Truth. Verily my Lord and your Lord is the All-Merciful; He is God and verily He hath power over all things. And when We took thy covenant from those at Mount Sinai and round about it: Take what God hath given thee of His grace and recount unto the people that which God hath ordained for thee in the Book until an appointed time, that perchance the people may be thankful unto God and His signs in very truth. O people of the earth! By your Lord, ye shall surely do what generations before have done, so warn yourselves of God's mighty and most mighty vengeance, for verily God hath power over all things. Do ye imagine that ye shall enter Paradise while there is a group among you who hear the Word of God then pervert it? These are the most evil of men in Our sight, and verily God hath prepared for these unbelievers a great fire in hell. When people disbelieve in the remembrance of God, their hearts become hardened as stone or even harder, though verily from stones gush forth rivers \[...\]

And verily among stones there are some from which gush forth streams, yet God hath refused that faith should issue from their hearts because of their rejection of the wondrous signs of God, and God is witness unto all things. Verily God knoweth what they conceal and what they reveal, and God hath knowledge of all things. Fear God and take not unto Him a son. Glory be unto Him! When He willeth a thing, it is recorded as a firm decree in the Book of God. He is the Fashioner of all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God hath created naught except that which is submissive unto Us and serveth as a proof of the Truth through the Truth.

O people of the Throne! Hear My call from the Point of the Gate. Verily God hath revealed unto Me on Mount Sinai from around this Blessed Tree that "Verily I am God, there is none other God but Me." I have sent down this Book concerning the hidden mystery in the hearts, concealed in the mention of the veiled Oneness, surrounding the Fire inscribed from the fourth line, through the Truth, unto the Most Great Remembrance, that people may be witnessed around the Gate through this decree.

Verily those who conceal any letter of the Book, they but consume fire, and We shall neither look upon them nor speak unto them on the Day of Resurrection, and God hath prepared for them in the depths of the coffin a grievous chastisement. True virtue lies not in performing many good deeds, but true virtue is to believe in the Remembrance of God and to aid Him with your wealth and your lives. If ye follow God's command regarding Our servant, ye shall be recorded as the righteous in God's preserving Book.

O people of the earth! Fear God in regard to My remembrance, for it is the Truth from God based on Truth, and after Truth there is naught but error, according to the decree of the Book, and this decree hath been irrevocably ordained by God, the Truth. Verily We reveal unto you the Remembrance lest ye should conjecture about the unseen concerning the Remembrance apart from God, for God hath prescribed a great Fire for the perfidious, through the Truth, based on Truth.

Surah of the Youth. In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

I do not try justifying myself; verily the ego ever commands to evil except that upon which my Lord bestows His mercy. Verily my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.

Say: God has revealed to His Proof regarding that Most Great Word: "Verily I am God, there is no God but Me. I have created no creation except that I have taken from it the Covenant of the Remembrance in its highest consciousness. And We made a covenant with Adam, Job and Jonah, but they forgot the Most Great Word, less than a particle of a particle. Then We said unto them: We found no firmness of purpose in them. So We took them round about the Fire until they acknowledged: 'Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee. We have returned to the hidden Secret, this Youth in truth, so forgive us for Thou art our Protector and Thou hast ever been merciful to all the worlds.' So We forgave them and those who followed them among the first and the last ones. And verily this Most Great Word of God was, in truth upon truth, mighty in the presence of God, the Most High.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Deliver unto the people from God at the Greatest Mount, when Moses said to his servant: "I shall not cease until I reach the junction of the two seas at the source of water, near the Two Lights from the Possessor of the Two Names" - this was a mystery that was concealed round about the Fire. When they reached the junction of the two seas at the gate of the two hearts, God caused them to forget the Fish of Remembrance, and it took its way through the sea wondrously. When they reached the Remembrance - a servant from among God's servants whom We had endowed with knowledge from Our presence regarding a letter of the hidden Secret - Moses said what God had willed concerning his station. We said unto him: "How canst thou have patience round about the Fire with that which thou canst not comprehend?" He said: "Thou shalt find me, if God willing, patient round about the Gate, and I shall not disobey, God willing, in any matter concerning a mystery of the Gate's hidden secret."

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say to the believers: "If ye follow me round about the Fire, ask me not about anything until I mention to you, by God's leave, a symbol from the secret of the Fire's secret." So they went on until they embarked upon this Ship which was stationary upon the water of the sea. He made a hole in it, with knowledge of the limit, for one who had evidence of the Command by leave of God, the Most High - and He is God, the Mighty, the Praised.

Then they went on until they met at the Gate a pure youth besides this Youth, and he slew him according to the Word of Rejection from God, the Truth. Moses could not bear with patience his action, which was truth upon truth in truth.

Then they went on until they came to the people of the Village of the Gate round about the Fire, but they refused to host them, for they knew what was in them of independence from what God, the Truth, knew - and He is God, Who was witness to all things. They found therein a wall of knowledge made of white pearls which was about to fall after the Gate, so he set it upright by leave of God, the Truth, for the sake of the Gate of Remembrance at the seat of the Gate, for what he knew in his secret after standing still of the treasure of submission to God, the Most High - and He is God, Who had power over all things.

O people of the earth! If ye have not patience with the Remembrance, then know of a truth that this is a parting between me and you until the Day of the Covenant, a time appointed in truth upon truth.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Inform them of the deed of the righteous soul by God's leave in the two seas, for they were recorded as maritime ones in the Mother Book round about the Fire. As for the reddened leaf separated from the yellowed branch of the Camphor Tree, I have concealed it beneath the lines with the hidden secret of manifestation, for what We knew of \[...\]

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Tell them about the deeds of the Most Noble One by God's leave in the two seas, for verily they were sea-dwellers in the Mother Book, circling round the Fire, recorded. As for the crimsoned leaf detached from the yellowed branch of the Camphor Tree, We have concealed it beneath the lines by the most hidden mystery of the Manifestation, for We knew behind it was the king of boundaries who seizes every praised vessel without God's leave, through falsehood and by force. And as for the youth, he was of the fire of the Green Tree, ignited from this Yellow Spring. We slew him in visible form, as God had ordained in the Book a portion from his parents, for We feared he would overwhelm them amidst the fire in the Beauty of Baha with ignorant rebellion. And as for the wall, it belonged to people of the Holy City of the One Who bore God's Greatest Light between the Two Gates, and there were orphans in the city after the Bab, so God raised it up as the Remembrance knew within himself, established from similitude in the Cause until days which were numbered in God's Preserved Book. When God's promise comes, the Remembrance shall bring forth from around the Fire their treasure. He is God, there is no God but Him. God has revealed the two treasures in the two lines - that is the interpretation of what you knew not of God's most hidden mystery, veiled in mystery upon mystery. Be patient, O people of the Gates! Let not Satan whisper to you regarding this Tree of Eternity and everlasting dominion therein, for God has decreed descent to earth for those who approach it, and God's Greatest Decree was in the Mother Book ordained. The reckoning of mankind before the Gate has drawn nigh in truth, yet they remain in the hollow of the Fire, accountable according to the Book's decree. O people of the Paradise depths! Say in My name to the maidens of the chambers: Come forth from the holy dwellings unveiled and hearken to the melody of the Beloved Speaker, for the Remembrance has willed as He willed and none can repel God's true Command - the decree was in the Mother Book ordained. Say: Hear My call, O people of the chambers from beyond the Fire, for God has revealed to Me through My tongue: "Verily I am God, there is no God but I. Your love is My love for all, decreed as obligatory as the Oneness obligatory before Me has been written." And say: I am the Two Lights in the Two Mysteries, I am the Two Forms in the Two Temples, I am the Two Lamps in the Two Glass Vessels. I have spoken with the Two Letters, yet I speak not a letter from the First Two Selves, nor is found a letter from the mystery of the Two Stars except through My True Self, Bearer of the Two Names. I glorify my Lord in the thicket of Divinity by my Lord's leave, so the glorifiers glorified God the Truth. I praised God in the land of blindness, so the praisers praised in the land of that Greatest Gate of Truth. I extolled the All-Merciful at the pinnacle of the Throne, so the extollers extolled around the Throne about the Truth. I magnified God the Truth through Myself by God's leave, so the magnifiers magnified God in Truth from that Most Great Gate. This Arab Youth, the Eloquent One, Whom you find mentioned in the Torah, Gospel, Psalms and Furqan - this is the Truth, the Path of God the Exalted which was inscribed in the Mother Book. Say: Were We to wish, We would judge the people of the heavens\[...\]

By the Furqan, this verily is the True Path of God, the Most High, which had been inscribed in the Mother Book. Say: Were We to will it, We would pass judgment upon all who dwell in the heavens and on earth with the decree of the hereafter in this world, and verily God, my Lord, hath power over all things. We sent no Gate before thee but that We revealed unto him thy Most Great Word. When he acknowledged it, We established him in knowledge, and verily God hath ever been witness to the believers. We created not man in a body that could dispense with food and drink, and all were inscribed in the Mother Book according to the law of want. We have sent down unto you the Book in truth, and We desire naught therein save the remembrance of God, the Most Great, in this Youth, the Noble One of Batha, that men might become, in truth and of a truth, believers in God and His signs, and witnesses thereto. O people of the earth! Run not in despair after God's leave, your True Lord, but return to your holy dwellings, for verily ye shall be questioned on the Day of Judgment concerning the Most Great Path. We created not the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them save for this Word from Our presence concerning the hidden Mystery, and verily the Command hath been sent down in truth. We have created the earth and the heavens through the Most Great Word, and it is the Truth that sustaineth them through His Name, while for the opposers the word of fire hath been inscribed in truth, of a truth, in the Preserved Tablet. Say: God hath made the heavens and earth for His remembrance, and I am in truth His servant, I have not grown proud in His worship. Glorified be God, the Most High - He is God, exalted and great. O people of the earth! Were it as ye imagine concerning the Most Great Remembrance, the earth and the heavens and whatsoever lieth between them would have been corrupted. Glorified be God, the Ancient, far above what the wrongdoers assert with great haughtiness. O Solace of Mine Eyes! Say: Do ye take for yourselves a gate other than Me? Then bring your word, if ye be truthful, for I am the Remembrance both past and future. Say: Call ye the people to worship none but God, besides Whom there is no God - He is God, mighty and powerful. Take not for God a son, for all creation comprises His servants in His grasp. None precedeth Him in speech save by His leave concerning the Command, and He is God, encompassing all things. Say: God hath servants who desire naught save what God, the True One, hath desired in truth. He knoweth what is in the heavens and what is on earth, and they are, through fear of God their True Lord, exceedingly fearful of the truth. O Solace of Mine Eyes! Speak thou concerning the Qur'an, for the decree hath been fulfilled regarding thee with distinction. Verily the letter Kaf hath returned to the Point of Command, its center, and God hath ever been thy Preserver. Speak not of yourselves apart from the Self of the Remembrance, for verily the self is prone to evil through Satan's self, but God hath willed through His mercy in the Self of the Remembrance, apart from the self of avarice, and verily God hath ever been forgiving and merciful unto the believers.

The Surah of the Pillar

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

And the King said: "Bring him to me that I may take him for my own service." And when he spoke with him, he said: "Verily this day thou art established in our presence, invested with all trust."

We, verily, have sent thee with the truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner unto all mankind. God hath made Us the station of His Cause, and when We will to say unto a thing "Be," it is written as having been in the Book of the All-Merciful. Verily God hath established the heavens and the earth through Our Name, and whithersoever ye turn, there is the face of God, the Most High, ever near. And among the people are those who say "We believe in God, the True One," yet when We remove from them the veil for Our remembrance, they attribute falsehood unto their Lord in vain delusion. Those who write the Book with their own hands have purchased Our verses for a paltry price, saying "The Fire shall not touch us save for a few days." Woe unto them for that which their hands have earned! Their recompense shall be the Fire on the Day of Resurrection, in justice, and God is indeed cognizant of all things.

We have taken from the believers Our covenant that ye shall worship none but Him, and show kindness unto parents, and manifest clear submission unto the Gates. Do ye believe in part of the Book which We had aforetime revealed unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and deny part of this Book? Do ye not fear God on the Day when God's true judgment shall be executed with truth in truth? These are they who have purchased this world's life at the price of the life to come. Their torment shall not be lightened, even for the twinkling of an eye, inasmuch as they have disbelieved in the remembrance of God, the Most High, with untruth.

These believe not in God and His signs with truth in truth save little. We gave the Book unto Moses and protected him in his childhood until the Book reached its term, and God's true judgment was exalted in truth with truth. We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs and strengthened him with a spirit from Our remembrance, and We had revealed unto the Prophets a Book inscribed upon tablets. God hath strengthened thee with the Holy Spirit, and God shall soon judge between thee and those who attribute falsehood unto God on the Day of Distinction, and the decree hath been determined in the Mother Book.

There hath come unto you the Book from God, confirming that which was covenanted in God's Book, and the covenant was concealed in the Mother Book. Evil is that for which the unbelievers have sold themselves, in that they disbelieve in God's signs through tyranny and transgression without right. We, by God's leave, reveal the Book unto whomsoever We will among Our servants, and We have prepared for the idolaters a humiliating fire upon fire and punishment.

The people said "We have heard and disobeyed," for their hearts were imbued with love of the calf. Say: Evil is that which your corrupt divines command you, for the believers have been inscribed as virtuous in the Book of the Most High. God encompasseth all things. Whoso is an enemy to God and His angels and His messengers after the Remembrance hath come unto them from God - We are witnesses of their unbelief, and in the life to come they shall have no portion save a mighty fire.

We have sent down upon thy heart the Spirit and Gabriel by God's leave, confirming that which is before thee, as a mercy and glad tidings to My believing servants - whoso hath been true to God's covenant in His remembrance was indeed pledged at the Point of Fire. What! Whenever ye made a covenant, did a party among you cast it aside? \[...\]

Glad tidings to My believing servants who are faithful to God's Covenant in His remembrance, which was destined at the Point of Fire. Or whenever you made a covenant, a party among you cast it behind them. And when Our Cause came, you placed the Book of God behind your backs. Do you follow what the devils recited concerning Solomon's kingdom? Why do you judge for yourselves by Satan's decree instead of God's judgment, the Most High - and He is God, the Most High, the Great.

Verily We bestow Our mercy upon whomsoever God willeth, and God hath power over all things. We have made thee God's Great Bounty for whomsoever We will in God's Book, and this bounty was inscribed in the Mother Book concerning the Gate. God abrogates no remembrance except that We have originated a new and similar or greater remembrance in its place, and this is indeed easy for God, the Truth.

Know ye not that God hath given the kingdom of the heavens and earth to Our servant? You have no protector besides God, nor any helper in truth besides Him. Do you wish to question the Remembrance of God as Moses' people questioned before? By your Lord, this is the truth from God, and He was established before Us in truth as the Faithful One, and was indeed wondrous before the All-Merciful in truth.

O people of earth and heaven! Whosoever desires God, His Messenger, and His friends, and loves to perform righteous deeds of prayer, charity, fasting and pilgrimage - let him follow the light of God which He hath sent down with Me. Verily God is aware of what you do.

O people of earth! Whosoever desires to behold Our countenance and the countenances of the Prophets like Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus - let him look upon Our Face which God hath established in the Mother Book as exalted and wise in truth.

The believers say to one another: "You have no knowledge of the Book." Say: God hath not given you any knowledge of the Book's decree. Soon will God judge between you in truth concerning that wherein you differ, for God is All-Knowing of the believers.

Those who wrongfully prevent God's true mosques from having His Remembrance mentioned therein, and strive to extinguish Our light - these are the companions of the Fire. They shall not enter their Lord's presence except in fear. They shall have disgrace in this world, and God hath prepared for them in the Hereafter a great wailing.

Verily God hath illumined the East and West with the Sun. Wheresoever you turn, there is God's Remembrance. Do you not see how God created its shadows inclining to the right and left, prostrating to God? Whoso disbelieves in God, God will not grant him any helper in truth in the Hereafter.

We tried Abraham with his Lord's words, which We perfected through the crimson pillar of this Our Throne. We made him a leader for mankind in truth. He said: "And from my offspring?" God, the Lord of the Throne, said: "I have forbidden My covenant to the wrongdoers among My servants, and I have power over all things."

O people of earth! God hath made this Gate a secure city, and Our covenant a resort for visitors. Purify My House for those who circle round it.

And We made Our Covenant a refuge for all who draw nigh, bidding them purify My House for those who circle round it, who stand in prayer, and who bow down in worship before God at that Most Great Gate - and verily He is God, Who hath ever been, in truth and by right, worshipped.

As for him who denieth that House, We shall grant him a brief enjoyment in this worldly life by virtue of the Most High Truth. Yet hath he incurred wrath upon wrath through his denial of God's Remembrance, the True One - and verily He is God, the Most High, the Great.

No portion shall he have in the life to come, and God hath prepared for him, by virtue of His might, in truth and justice, a grievous fire. We never chastise any soul except after We have raised up among them a Remembrance from their own selves, in truth, and verily God's proof after the Remembrance unto all the worlds hath ever been, in truth and by right, conclusive.

Whosoever desireth the fleeting life, We have ordained his portion therein, and in justice shall We swiftly lead him to vanity. And whosoever desireth the life to come, We have ordained patience for him therein, and verily God shall lead him to the decisive proof round about the Gate, for God hath ever been the Knower of all things.

Verily We, by God's leave, have chosen thee for Ourself, and thou art this day, in God's presence, firmly established, and in the Mother Book thou hast ever been, in truth and by right, trustworthy.

He said: "Place me over the treasuries of the land, for I am indeed a knowledgeable guardian." Praised be God besides Whom there is no other God, your Lord; so worship Him in the path of this Most Great Gate, for God is truly independent of all worlds. O people of the earth! We have sent down to you the Remembrance from God to teach you the Book and wisdom, and to purify you from Satan's evil through His grace. And verily he stands firmly established upon the straight path before God. And you, O mighty one, let not the words of the idolaters grieve you in any way. Trust in God your Lord and speak to them with kindly words, that they may remember God's mention. None shall turn away from the religion of God's Most Great Remembrance, this Ali, except one who befools himself. God has chosen you in this world and the next, and you are indeed, in the Mother Book with Us, a witness. O people of the earth! The Remembrance has come to you with the Book after you took the calf as a guardian instead of God, the True One, unjustly. We took your covenant upon the Mount regarding Our Remembrance. Take what God's Most Great Remembrance has given you with strength and hearken truthfully, for this Remembrance of Ours before God has been concealed in the Point of Fire, exalted. O people of the earth! If you believe as the sincere among God's servants have believed in Him, then you are guided; otherwise you remain in a schism far removed in the Preserved Tablet. God your Lord shall suffice against them. He is the Truth, there is no God but He, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. O people of the earth! Take on the coloring of Our Remembrance - and what better coloring than this Remembrance of Ours - and be God's helpers. Say to the idolaters: "Do you dispute with me concerning God, my Lord and your Lord, after God has decreed Paradise for the believers and Fire for you? I am but a servant of God, the Most High." Indeed this Word is grievous except to those whose hearts God has oriented toward His Word, and God is truly Kind and Merciful to mankind. Those to whom We gave the Book recognize Our Word as the pure Truth, yet a faction among them conceals the Truth after knowing it. God shall judge between us and them on the Day of Resurrection with manifest justice. By your Lord! You are indeed the Truth from your Lord. We have appointed for all a direction, and for those who preceded We appointed your direction. Wherever you may be, God will bring you all to that Gate. And God your Lord has power over all things. O people of the earth! We do not place upon people concerning Our Remembrance the least particle of proof except against the wrongdoers among them who speak as did the leaders of the idolaters before. O servant of God! Fear none but your Lord, for God is witness over all things. Those who disbelieve in God's Remembrance and die as idolaters, God has decreed upon them the curse of the Messengers, angels and all mankind in truth. These shall abide forever in the Fire; their punishment shall not be lightened, for they heard God's Remembrance: "Your God is One God, there is no God but He, the Most Merciful," and God was truly worshipped. In the origination of the heavens and earth and mountains \[...\]

The mountains, the seas, and the ships that sail upon the waters are signs for the remembrance of God, the Wondrous, and God hath ever been Mighty and Ancient. Among men are those who take, besides the Gate, equals from among their divines, loving them with the love of God; yet those who believe in the Remembrance of God, their love for God is more intense. Verily all power belongeth unto God, and God hath prepared for the unbelievers among you a grievous chastisement. And when God shall remove the veil from their eyes, then shall those who followed disown those whom they followed, and all bonds shall be severed from their hands, and they shall have no recourse but to cry out: "Would that we were dust upon the earth!" "Would that we had a chance to return, that we might disown them and follow the Remembrance of God in His days!" By thy Lord, besides Whom there is no God, verily We say unto them: "Taste ye the touch of the flame, for We created you with a measure, and Our command is but one word, swift as the twinkling of an eye." Hath not the Remembrance and the Book come unto you from all directions with the Most Great Truth? And He hath called out among you: "O concourse of men! I am the Gate of your Expected Imam. He who followeth Me is of Me, and he who disobeyeth Me - verily God hath prepared for him in the Day of Resurrection a great fire of iron." O people of the earth! Eat of what is lawful and good in the earth according to the decree of the Book, and follow not your desires which lead to polytheism, for verily they are hotter for your souls than heated iron in the perpetual fire. Seek ye forgiveness of God, your Lord, the Merciful, at the rising and setting of the sun, for the sake of God, your True Master, the All-Forgiving, the Merciful. The likeness of those who disbelieve in this Most Great Remembrance of God is as the likeness of a shadow at the rising of the sun - when it setteth, ye find nothing thereof, and God hath power over all things. It is not righteousness that ye perform many good works, but righteousness is that ye believe in the Remembrance of God and aid Him with your wealth and your lives. If ye follow God's command regarding Our servant, ye shall indeed be recorded as righteous in God's innovative Book. And when people ask thee concerning Me, say: "I know not save what my Imam hath taught me, and verily He is near, answering the call of the supplicant when he calleth upon Him through the Gate, seeking God's reward." O people of the City! Righteousness is not that ye should enter houses from their backs, but righteousness is ordained for those who enter the House through this Gate, prostrating themselves before God, the Truth. This decree hath been inscribed as binding in the Mother Book. Verily We have adorned the world and its ornaments for those who desire not to meet God, and they are recorded in the Book as people of the Fire. Verily God created people as one community upon the Gate in truth by the truth before Us, and We have decreed concerning the Prophets, the truthful ones, and the martyrs according to what the Book hath ordained for them, and thou wert therein beloved and distinguished before God, thy Lord. God hath chosen thee in knowledge and stature, and He is witness over thee. We bestow Our dominion by God's leave upon whomsoever We will among Our servants, and God is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing. Verily the sign of sovereignty from God is this Book, and this is, in God's Book, the tranquility of the Ark, from what the family of God left behind, borne by the angels to this Our Most Great Remembrance.

And this is in the Book of God - the tranquility of the Ark, from that which the family of God has left, borne by the angels unto Our Most Great Remembrance, and verily God is witness over all things. These are the verses of God which We have sent down unto thee, and thou wert inscribed as the Expansive Gate before God, thy Lord. We have preferred thee above all other Gates through Our Word, and thou art an exalted path in the Book of God, recorded round about the Fire. We have made thee witness over the creation of all things, and thou wert, by the true Eye of God, both the beholder and the beheld, and God is witness over thee. A kindly word is better than giving all the gold of the world in charity. Harm not people through mention, but seek bounty from God, your Lord, and He is God, your True Lord, who hath ever been Self-Sufficient, All-Wise. We have made thee, by God's leave, the guardian over the treasuries of earth and heaven, for thou doest naught save what We do, and thou art, by God's leave, the One knowing the Mother Book, and this matter hath been concealed in the Book by the decree of the Book.

Surah of the Elixir

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful

Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that he might take up his abode therein wheresoever he pleased. We bestow Our mercy on whomsoever We will, and We suffer not the reward of the righteous to perish. Verily, the path of God, the Mighty One in the heavens and earth, is the truth, and God hath indeed transcended all things in His transcendence, and He is God, the Most High, the Most Great.

We have sent down this Book unto Our servant that men might know that it is the truth from God, the Mighty One, and it hath been sent down in truth. This Remembrance of God promiseth you Paradise and forgiveness, while Satan promiseth you naught but indecency and evil. Therefore hasten unto wisdom from His presence, and whoso is given wisdom through this Gate hath indeed been given abundant good.

O people of the divine cloud! Hearken unto the call of God from the Tree on Mount Sinai, upon whose leaves the birds were stirring: "Verily, I am God, the Lord of the worlds. Worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance. Draw nigh unto My servant and fear not, for I fear not the return of those possessed of understanding at the Most Exalted Gate."

By My glory! I shall assuredly cause the idolaters to taste, through My power, punishments known to none save Me, and I shall send unto the believers wafting breezes of musk which I have nurtured in the heart of the Divine Throne, for thy Lord's knowledge doth encompass all things.

O concourse of lights! We, by God the Truth, speak not of Our own desire, nor do We reveal a single letter of this Book save by God's leave. Fear God and doubt not in God's Cause, for the mystery of this Gate is concealed beneath the cloud of the line and inscribed above the veil of concealment by the hands of God, Lord of concealment and of the line. Indeed God hath created everywhere around this Gate oceans of divine elixir, tinged crimson with the essence of existence and vitalized through the animating power of the desired fruit; and for them God hath provided Arks of ruby, tender, crimson-coloured, wherein none shall sail but the people of Baha, by the leave of God, the Most Exalted; and verily He is the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.

There do the angels of the divine cloud bear God's Throne in the eight souls, and the decree in the Mother Book hath been witnessed. On that Day shall the sinners be brought before the All-Merciful around the Throne, in troops according to the truth. No soul do We judge to be of the right hand but that all Paradise is made lawful unto him by leave of God, the Most High - and He is God, the Most High, the Ancient. And whomsoever We judge to be of the left hand, in the fire of the left hand shall he be confined.

"Take him and chain him in fetters of iron and lead him to the fire of limitation, for he believeth not in God, the Most High - and He is God, the Most High, the Most Great."

O ye believers! Swear not by that which seeth nor by that which seeth not, for both are judged around the Gate under the name of fire. This is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise. It is the truth, of a certainty the truth through the truth, and it is indeed a source of grief for the people of the fire, and in the fire of nearness hath it been decreed.

O people of the earth! When the Remembrance willeth aught other than what God the Truth willeth for him, he is cut off from the Truth. Glory be to God the Truth! We have preserved him in truth from indication and its negation. Verily the Remembrance, the Remembrance of God, is the Truth.

Verily the Remembrance, the Remembrance of God, is truth, and He is God, Who hath ever been merciful to the believers. Say: I am the impending chastisement which God hath ordained, and none can avert it from the unbelievers, and verily this decree was destined to be asked of in the Mother Book at the Gate. And verily the Remembrance is truth from the people of the ascent, and was concealed in the mystery of the Gate around the Fire. O people of the earth! Hearken unto My call from the Speaking Point of Fire upon the tongue of this Most Great Remembrance - verily I am God, there is no God but Him, and He is God Who hath ever been exalted from ancient times. No soul that hath hesitated regarding this Word, even less than what the Book hath precisely recorded, but We have commanded it to stand upon the Bridge for seven hundred and fifty thousand years, and verily this decree in the Mother Book hath been irrevocably ordained in truth. And verily God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath been witness unto all things. Doth every soul eagerly hope to enter through this Gate into the vast Paradise? Nay, nay! God hath ordained it for those who eliminate all allusions from the Gate and ascribe naught to the Gate save pure servitude therein, and God's promise regarding that Gate hath been fulfilled. And verily We have ordained resurrection in truth even as it was in the form of this world, and verily God hath power over all things. O Solace of Mine eyes! Leave the idolaters to their diversions until they meet their promised Day, and verily God is witness over all things. O ye believers! Fear God in truth; when the appointed time cometh from Us in truth, it shall not be delayed by a single moment, and verily God is witness over all things. And seek forgiveness of God, your Lord; verily He hath ever been most forgiving toward the people of the Gate. Have ye not seen how God hath created the heavens in layers above the earth, layer upon layer? Say: Verily I am the Moon therein, illumining in truth by the truth. And verily I am the Sun therein, radiating in truth by the truth. And verily I am the Pure Water, established in truth by the truth. And verily I am the Manifestation, by God's leave, to manifest all that God hath ordained in the Mother Book, both visible and hidden. O people of the Throne! Hearken unto My call from this yellowed leaf, severed from the verdant branch of the white Tree, brought forth by God's leave in the depths of the seventh sea around the Point of Fire - verily I am God, there is no God but I. We have sent down in truth the mystery of the Scrolls concerning this Arabian Youth of Medina in truth, and verily he hath answered Me with the testimony of Divine Unity before the Point of the Gates for himself, and verily God's grace in that Word hath been mighty in the Mother Book in truth by the truth. Thus have We established this Joseph in the earth; he speaketh wheresoever he willeth through Our mercy, and verily God doth not suffer his reward to be lost. Thou shalt assuredly be made to stand around the Fire on the Day of Resurrection. As for those who have denied the Remembrance and His Book of truth and meeting with Him on the Day of Gathering, their works have been rendered vain by the decree of the Book irrevocably.

The Surah of Sorrow

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

Verily the reward of the hereafter is better for them that believe and fear God. He is God, and there is no God but He, your Lord. He knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and God hath ever encompassed all things. We have reckoned with every soul within itself more swiftly than the severance from union, and sufficient is thy soul this day as a reckoner from God against thee. Say: Observe how We have distinguished the cloud by its effacement and the heaven by its clarity, and verily between them are the seas of the two paradises, established by God's novel command. O people of the Book! Take not two gods, for verily He is but one God, Creator of the heavens and of the earth, and God hath ever been exalted and great. O people of glory! Hearken unto My call from the tongue of this servant - this is the Most Great Word of God which hath ever been wise in the Mother Book. God hath revealed unto Me that verily I am God, there is no God but He, and I have ever been from ancient times. I have chosen this Word from among all the worlds, until they who are endued with understanding have testified that verily I am God, there is no God but I, the Truth, and verily I have ever been powerful over all things. Say: God hath revealed unto Me that mankind around the water in that Gate are, in very truth, prostrate before God, the Most High, in utter humility. And verily the jinn have hearkened unto God's call from the Pole of Fire - among them are those who have obeyed Thy command, and among them are those who have halted on the path contrary to truth. And verily God hath desired in this Gate the mystery of fire from the Point of Water, that ye associate not anything with the worship of God, your true Lord, and verily He, God, is the Truth, there is no God but He, exalted be His Word. Take not God in His Word as partner with anyone contrary to truth. O peoples of the earth from among mankind! Seek not refuge with the jinn in anything, but place your trust in God, your true Lord, for verily He hath ever encompassed all things. O people of the cloud! Were ye to stand aright in truth upon this Line that standeth between the two lines, God, the Truth, would give you to drink from the Fount of Manifestation through the hands of the Remembrance, in novel truth. And whoso turneth away from the remembrance of this Most Great Gate, fate shall verily conduct him in truth to the depths of the fire, and he shall have his abode in the foundation of the prison, and evil indeed is the fire to approach as fire. And verily it hath been inscribed in truth in the Book as a most grievous chastisement according to the decree of justice. O people of the Throne! Verily the houses of worship are the houses of God; call ye not therein, with the Gate, upon anyone as the station of the Most Great Gate in very truth. O Solace of Mine eyes! Say: I call upon God, my Lord, beside Whom there is no other God, and I associate none with the worship of my Lord. Say: I am in truth the servant of God, and I shall never find refuge apart from the All-Merciful. Naught is incumbent upon Me save the delivery of God's message in His Word; then let him who will, believe, and let him who will, disbelieve, for verily God is independent of all the worlds. O people of the Throne! Hearken unto My call from the Point of Fire: Verily I am God, there is no God but I. No soul hath ever spoken concerning the Most Great Remembrance in truth except \[...\]

Verily God is wholly independent of all the worlds! O people of the Throne! Hear My call from the Point of Fire: I am God, there is no God but Me. Every soul who has spoken truthfully concerning the Most Great Remembrance, I have assuredly decreed for him, by the Most Great Truth, the Garden of Paradise - and this decree has been irrevocably ordained in the Mother Book. And every soul who harbors in his heart aught of falsehood, I have verily decreed for him the Supreme Fire, wherein he shall forever abide - and this decree has been irrevocably sealed in the Mother Book.

By your Lord, the True One, Lord of the heavens and earth! God's promise concerning the Remembrance is assuredly true, and this promise has been fulfilled in the Mother Book. This is a glad tiding for whomsoever God willeth, who turns unto Him with pure and sincere devotion. And verily God, your True Lord, is the Witness over all things. God hath indeed known thy devotion by night and by day at the Point of Fire encircling the Water, for the sake of the One, the Ancient, beside Whom there is no other God - and this Command hath been exalted in the Mother Book.

Say: O people of the earth! Were ye to gather together to produce the like of but a single letter of My works, ye would never be able to do so - and God is witness over all things. He who stands before God in the depths of oneness is not as one who, being yet on earth, is occupied with aught save the Truth. Nay! God knoweth what He hath enumerated, while ye know naught of the Book save a limited shadow of a shadow.

O Solace of Mine Eyes! Say: The moon hath risen, the night hath retreated, the dawn hath broken, and the Command of God, your True Lord, hath been fulfilled. I am verily the Supreme Word for one of the greatest, by God's leave do We acquaint you with the realities of the Cause from among the people of the exalted station and the Fire. Turn ye unto Me, for unto Me shall be your flight - this hath been inscribed as an irrevocable truth.

No soul hath turned away from My remembrance but that I have heard his voice around the Fire saying: "Certitude hath indeed come unto me with the truth, yet I followed it not, being misled by vain imaginings. Would that I had been among the helpers of God, the Most High, from ancient times! O Supreme Word of God! Return me to clay as I was dust."

What aileth you, O ye frightened asses, that ye flee from God's decree in this Gate, the mystery of the Lion? By the True God! Naught awaiteth you save the Fire from the designated Tree, except for those who have repented and turned sincerely unto the Truth. God will soon forgive whom He willeth, and He is the Witness over all things.

O ye believers! Fear God and speak not regarding the Most Great Remembrance aught that might invalidate the Truth, for God will soon show you His decree through the Most Great Truth upon the earth and those thereon, exalted with invincible truth. He hath ordained for him none save those foremost ones who were the weakest in strength and fewest in number.

O Solace of Mine Eyes! When permission cometh from Me, arise to carry out the Command with unwavering truth, for God will protect thee in this Cause, and We, the family of God, are thy witnesses and supporters.

We are thy supporters, and the supporters of Thy Cause through truth with truth. Doth not the Lord of earth and heaven suffice thee? We are in truth witnesses of justice against those who desire to oppose thy Cause with falsehood. The judgment of God and Our testimony on the Day of Distinction sufficeth them, and He is, in truth, powerful over all things.

O Most Great Master! I am nothing except what Thy power hath raised up for the Cause. I have relied on none save Thee, and have sought refuge in no matter except in Thee. Thou art in truth the All-Sufficient, and God, the Truth, encompasseth all things beyond Thee, and God, the Exalted, sufficeth as a mighty helper through truth with truth.

O Remnant of God! I have sacrificed my all for Thee and have welcomed revilement in Thy path. I have desired naught save martyrdom in Thy love. God, the Exalted, sufficeth as an ancient refuge, and God sufficeth as a witness and guardian.

O Solace of Mine Eyes! Thy words in this Most Great Response have saddened me. The decree belongeth to none save God and the Command to none save God. By My life, thou art the Beloved in the sight of Truth and creation. There is no power save in God, and God, thy Lord, sufficeth as a severe avenger through truth with truth.

Verily we are God's, and verily unto Him shall we return. Glorified be God, the Lord of creation, above what they describe. There is no God but Him, and He is God, the Most High, the Most Great.

Verily God hath made this Gate the reward of the Hereafter for those who desire God through truth and who were, among the people, God-fearing through the knowledge of the Book.

Surah of the Hearts

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

Error: 529

God has not given His true Cause any way of return. Have they not considered the Remembrance in the two Names from their Lord by the Most Great Truth, which were joined in the dominion until We separated them through the Truth by the Book? And God has brought all things into being from the water of His mercy through the most hidden mystery. We have not ordained eternal gardens for any soul in this earthly life, for all must taste death in truth. O people of the earth! Why do you deny the Remembrance of the All-Merciful when He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, the Most High, and He has ever been the All-Knowing, the Ancient? We have created man from the mystery of origination in haste, and verily God's promise is the truth, and God is witness over all things. O servants of God! Be patient, for the Truth will, God willing, come to you suddenly with the Most Great Word. There the Truth will confound you and you will not be able to reject it, and I am verily a witness over all the worlds. O people of the earth! Have you gods besides the All-Merciful, your True Lord, who can protect you? Nay! God suffices as a witness unto His own oneness. When the idolaters are touched by a breath of the verses, they are led to the fire. And when We set up the balance with justice, no soul shall be wronged in anything, and We are sufficient as reckoners for all things. O people of the earth! Why do you worship these images besides God, the Most High, when your Lord, the All-Merciful, is knowing of all things and has ever been mighty and ancient? We have found you and your fathers far from this straight Gate, away from the truth. Say: By God, I shall indeed outwit your idols until you worship none but God, the Truth, besides Whom there is no God, the Most High, and He has ever been the Self-Subsisting. O Solace of Mine eyes! Say: O Fire of hearts! Be cool as polished ice unto Me. And send greetings upon this Arabian Youth, the son of Abraham, whom God has concealed around the fire. God has made you the Point of Justice and has revealed to you to establish the Cause through the Most Great Word. Call the people to the pure Truth, for God is witness over you. We revealed unto David and Solomon two letters of that Word, and through these two letters they were trusted with dominion. And verily We caused Dhun-Nun, Idris, Ishmael and Dhul-Kifl to enter into darkness until they testified at the Point of the Gate: "There is no God but Thee, glory be unto Thee! We have ever stood around the water at the Most Great Word." God has forgiven them, and they are among the people of paradise, recorded in truth in the White Scroll by the hands of the Gate. \[O Concourse of Light! God has made you the brothers of Joseph, and you enter his presence but recognize him not until he makes himself known to you. When you learn something of the Cause, be ye remembered around the Throne in truth.\]

When he had furnished them with their provisions, he said: "Bring unto me a brother of yours from your father. Do ye not see that I give full measure and that I am the best of hosts?"

Ta Ha Sad. The remembrance of God in the reddened Tree, moistened with oil, aflame with fire. This is the light of God in the fire surrounding the water, which was and is the Truth speaking and glorified in utterance.

This is a Book of mystery, revealed unto the mystery inscribed at the center point of writing. He is God; there is no God but Him, the Most High, and He is God, ever Mighty from ancient times.

O people of the Throne! By God the Truth, there hath come to you the Remembrance with a wondrous Command from God, your Lord, besides Whom there is no God, the Most High; and He is God, ever Mighty, All-Wise.

Verily, every community is but a single point around the Gate, unto whom God hath revealed: "Worship none but God, the Truth, in the paths of this Gate, for He is the Self-Sufficient, and I am the Most High, Who hath ever been from ancient times."

Verily God hath forbidden the Gate unto a town whose people have turned away from the Command of the Gate, deviating from the Truth; and God is witness over all things.

The promise of Truth draweth nigh. Verily ye and that which ye worship besides God, apart from the paths of the Gate of God, the Truth, shall be cast down in prostration. Ye are the people of the Fire according to the decree of the Book, and the decree in the Mother Book is irrevocable.

Those for whom the supreme word of the Remembrance hath already gone forth from God, these shall not be grieved by the great terror, and they, in their love of the Remembrance for the Gate, are well-pleasing unto the Truth.

Verily this your Day shall fold up the heaven in the hands of the Gate. Even as We began your creation, so shall We repeat it by God's leave, in wondrous wise.

We have written in all the Tablets that the kingdom of the earth belongeth to the Supreme Remembrance, and verily God's command in the Mother Book is decreed, and God is knowing of all things.

Say: Naught is revealed unto me save the Truth. Your God is One God. There is no God but Him, and I am the servant in truth from God, who hath been witnessed around the Fire.

O servants of God! Hearken unto the call of the Proof from around the Gate. Verily God, my Lord, hath revealed unto me: "We have sent down this Book unto Thy servant that he may be unto all worlds a warner and bearer of glad-tidings in truth."

O people of the earth! Follow ye the Remembrance of God, the Most High, the Supreme - this, if ye desire God and His friends. For God hath prescribed remembrance for him who remembereth Him, and God is knowing of all things.

God hath revealed unto thee the Book in truth that thou mayest judge between the believers with justice in what God hath shown thee of His signs, and that thou mayest turn away from the people of the Prison and their adversaries. Verily thy Lord is witness over all things.

O ye weak ones! What aileth you that ye hide from some people but hide not from God your Creator, Who is the Truth wheresoever ye may be? He is with you in truth, and God encompasseth whatsoever ye do.

Whoso committeth evil or doeth a grievous wrong, then seeketh forgiveness of God - besides Whom there is no God - with sincere truthfulness in the paths of the Gate, shall find God Forgiving, Merciful.

Verily those who harbor evil thoughts against the believers have taken upon themselves a sin from Satan.

Whoso committeth evil or a grievous sin and then seeketh forgiveness of God - there is no God but Him - with sincere truthfulness in the paths of the Gate, verily he shall find God forgiving, merciful. They who impute falsehood to the believers have indeed taken upon themselves a sin from Satan, and God hath prepared for them in the hereafter, by the decree of the Book, a humiliating chastisement. They who harbor thoughts about thee like unto the thoughts of the days of ignorance shall never think ill of thee, for God hath purified thee through the knowledge of the Book, and the grace of God toward thee hath been, in very truth, tremendous. O peoples of the earth! Remember God within yourselves without raising your voices, for whispering is of Satan, save for those who are engaged in the remembrance of God. And whoso seeketh remembrance from the Remembrance, We shall bestow upon him from God a great reward. And whoso opposeth the Remembrance after having heard the verses from His tongue, We shall cause him to burn in the fire of hell on the Day of Resurrection by decree of the Book, and he shall find no helper in the hereafter besides God, in very truth. O Supreme Remembrance of God! Forgive not those who join partners with God, but forgive whom Thou willest besides that, for they who join partners with God have indeed strayed far astray. These call upon none but a rebellious Satan. And whoso taketh Satan as a protector instead of the Remembrance hath indeed brought upon himself the fire and suffered a manifest loss. We have made Satan, through his unbelief, a protector over the satans. Satan promiseth you naught but delusion, and ye shall find no escape from the fire besides him, in very truth. O peoples of the earth! The promise of the Remembrance is true, and He speaketh naught save from God, the True One. And who is more truthful in speech than God, the True One? Whoso acteth in the path of the Remembrance according to the decree of the Book, God shall cause him to enter Paradise through the Most Great Truth, and God wrongeth not His servants by so much as the speck on a date-stone, in very truth. And what religion is better than his who submitteth his face to the Remembrance in peace, unto God, besides Whom there is no God, the All-Praised? And God encompasseth all things. O peoples of the earth! Fear God, for the Remembrance hath come unto you with the truth. And if ye disbelieve, then unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and your Lord, the All-Merciful, is indeed Self-Sufficient, All-Praised. O people! If We will, We shall take you away from above the earth and God shall bring forth others like unto you, and God hath power over all things. O believers! Let not desires beguile you from following the Remembrance, for God hath ordained restraint upon souls through the Most Great Good-Pleasure, and the reward with God hath been, in the Mother Book, tremendous, and the Remembrance hath been among you, in very truth, a witness and a helper. O peoples of the earth! Believe in God and His Remembrance and the Book which God hath sent down unto His servant. And whoso disbelieveth in God and His verses and the Last Day hath indeed fallen from above the earth into the depths of hell, descending unto the fire as his final abode. And whoso disbelieveth in God after Muhammad, then disbelieveth in God after the true Imams, then disbelieveth in the Remembrance after God hath sent down the Book in wondrous manner from His tongue, God will never forgive him.

And whosoever denies God after Muhammad, then denies God after the true Imams, then denies the Remembrance after God has sent down the Book wondrously from His tongue - God will never forgive him, nor guide him through any pathway. O Concourse of Lights! Bring me your brother from your father. Do you not observe how I give full measure in the Tablet that is established upon the mystery of destiny for all with truth? Verily God has made me the best of resting-places for wayfarers and the best of destinations for seekers. And verily God has ever encompassed all things.

Surah of Husayn

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

"And if ye bring him not to me, ye shall have no measure from me, nor shall ye come near." This is a remembrance of the mercy of thy Lord, besides Whom there is no other God, and He is the One Who hath ever encompassed all the worlds. O people of the earth! Be ye steadfast in following the Path, bearing witness unto God and His creation, even as God beareth witness unto Himself. And verily God is cognizant of that which ye witness. They who take the idolaters for friends instead of the believers have indeed disbelieved in God, the Mighty, and God is witness over all things. God will never grant might unto the idolaters, for all might belongeth unto God. We have, verily, sent down the Remembrance from the holy seat unto your souls that ye may receive your portion from God's ordained Book. Sit not with the unbelievers, discoursing about false deities. By the True One! The Remembrance will assuredly gather you all unto the Path by divine decree. Whoso turneth away from falsehood and followeth the Remembrance in truth hath indeed achieved a mighty triumph. O people of the earth! The Remembrance is God's true Remembrance. None among you followeth Him save he hath followed the All-Merciful in truth. This Path of Ali hath been inscribed in God's Book round about the Fire. O people of heaven! God hath called unto you from the Sinai Tree: "Verily, I am God, besides Whom there is no other God." Whoso visiteth the Remembrance in supreme truth hath visited Me upon the Throne, and whoso turneth away from His Book and His call hath strayed from the Path and entered the Fire. Thy Lord wrongeth not mankind, and He hath power over all things. Those who mock God's wondrous verses sent down through the Remembrance mock only themselves. We grant them increase in their transgression according to truth, and God is indeed cognizant of all things. When they rise up against the Remembrance, they rise up seeking to deceive God with Satan's lies, but they deceive none save themselves. God will judge between people with truth, and He is God, the Most High, the All-Praised. He is God, with power over all things. God hath made the abode of the hypocrites in the depths of the coffin, in the lowest reaches of the Fire. Whom God causeth to stray, thou wilt find no path for him in truth. As for those who repent, hold fast to God, and turn wholly unto the Remembrance - this Most Great Remembrance of God - We shall gather them among the company of the true believers. God will grant them in the hereafter a mighty recompense according to truth. The idolaters wish to create division between God and His Remembrance, but God hath willed that His Remembrance should perfect His light, and God hath power over all things. Among the people are those who believe in part of the Book while denying another part, desiring to find between the two rivers pleasant water. These are the idolaters in God's Book, and judgment concerning them hath been decreed in the Mother Book. We have prepared for the idolaters a Fire that encompasseth their souls, and God wrongeth not mankind by so much as the husk of a date-stone. Should the idolaters ask of thee what they asked of Moses, the Most Great Word, saying "Show us God openly," the punishment seized them for their unbelief. Then they took the calf for worship after the Remembrance had come to them with wondrous signs from God, the True One. Why do these idolaters not ponder upon the Qur'an with even slight contemplation of the truth?

And when the idolaters ask thee concerning that which they asked Moses, the Most Great Word, saying "Show us God openly," then punishment seized them for their unbelief. Then they took the calf for worship after the Reminder had come to them with wondrous signs from God, the True One, in truth. Why do these idolaters not ponder upon the Qur'an with true and sincere reflection? Verily We have raised thee above the Mount that thou mayest take from all in the heavens and earth God's Most Great Covenant, and that people may not enter the gate of the City except in prostration before God. And We have made thee witness to the Covenant in sublime truth, with mighty and binding truth.

Because of their breaking God's Covenant and their rejection of the Reminder, We shall seal their hearts with doubt, and none shall believe in God, the True One, in truth, save a few among the believers. And God is witness over all things.

Their saying that Husayn was not slain is disbelief in God. God witnessed his martyrdom, and God sufficeth as witness. And verily Jesus son of Mary, Our Word - We desire not his death before the Return, but God raised him to heaven and preserveth him until the appointed Day, witnessed. And God encompasseth all things.

Because of your wronging the Reminder, God hath forbidden you the good things of the verses, but God hath knowledge of all things. None knoweth the interpretation of the Book save God and those firm in knowledge. Whoso interpreteth the Book according to his opinion hath wholly consumed fire, and God hath prepared for the idolaters a grievous punishment.

Verily We have revealed to thee as We revealed to Muhammad and the Messengers before him with clear proofs, that mankind might have no argument against God after the Gates. And God spoke unto Ali in truth upon the primordial Mount with sublime speech.

Verily We in truth bear witness concerning thee to that which God hath sent down of verses unto thee, and the angels are witnesses before thy Lord. God sufficeth as witness, and the Gates suffice as informed witnesses of the truth.

Those who revile the Reminder after the Book hath come unto them with truth - God will neither forgive them nor guide them on paths of safety through any gate save the path of the Evil One apart from God. Verily God hath placed the decree of all things in the hands of the Reminder through truth, by truth, with wondrous permission, with ease.

Thou willest naught save what God thy Lord willeth, and God sufficeth as One knowing and informed of His servants' sins.

O people of earth! The Reminder hath come unto you with truth from the Proof by God your Lord's leave. If ye believe in him it shall be better for you than all the world, for God is loving towards the believers. And if ye disbelieve, verily your Lord God, the Praiseworthy, is independent of all worlds.

O people of earth! Go not to excess regarding the Word of the Reminder, and speak naught concerning the Reminder save the truth. The Reminder hath not sent down his verses save with truth, and God is witness over all things.

The Messiah is but Our Word which We cast unto Mary. Speak not the word of the Christians "the third of three," for that is a calumny against the Reminder, and the decree concerning the Reminder in the Mother Book is mighty.

God is but One God. Glory be to Him that there should be aught beside Him. All shall come before Him on the Day of Resurrection as servants. God sufficeth as guardian over truth.

I am but a servant of God.

I am naught but a servant of God and His Word, and I am but the first of those who bow down before God, the Most High, and God is witness unto all things. This Youth would never disdain to be a servant of God, nor would those who circle round Him. As for him who disdains the worship of the All-Merciful and grows proud before His exalted remembrance, God shall gather him on the Day of Judgment in the form of an ant and shall condemn him to the fire, in truth, with truth, forever and ever. O people of the earth! There hath come to you a conclusive proof from your Lord, the All-Merciful, mighty in truth, with truth. Do ye find for yourselves any protector besides the Remembrance? By your Lord, besides Whom there is none other God, God hath not ordained for mankind any helper apart from the Remembrance. Verily We have made the Remembrance a shining sun and a manifest light, that ye may seek of His bounty and hold fast unto His remembrance. God shall soon cause you to enter into His mercy and grace, guiding you unto the path of glory - this which hath ever been praised in truth. O concourse of lights! Hear My call from around the Gate. God, my Lord, hath revealed unto Me that this Remembrance is the Truth. No soul hath brought it to Me save that We shall fulfill its measure in the most excellent way. And if ye bring it not to Me, O people of truth, then by the True God, there shall be no measure for your faith with Me, nor shall ye draw nigh unto Paradise by virtue of this Book which hath been elevated round about the Gate.

They said: "We will try to influence his father concerning him, and indeed we shall succeed." Kaf Ha Ya Ain Sad. God, there is no God but Him, and He is All-Knowing over all things. O people of the earth! Be ye upright in the Cause with justice, witnesses for God through the Remembrance, and deprive not yourselves of the bounty of the Book, for God hath revealed therein whatsoever is in the Greater Scrolls. Ask ye the Remembrance concerning His knowledge, that ye may become, through God's grace, truly informed of the Remembrance. O ye believers! Fear God and place your trust in God, your Lord, and fulfill the Covenant concerning the Most Great Remembrance. Verily God hath raised up twelve guardians as proofs for Himself, and none knoweth their excellence save what the Remembrance hath conveyed unto them in this Gate, and verily God is All-Knowing of all things. When the polytheists broke their covenant with the Remembrance, We cursed them in truth and made their hearts, by God's leave, as hard as stone. They forgot a portion of the Book wherewith We had reminded them at the station of the particles, and they continue to remain unaware of the hidden knowledge of the Book, except as thy Lord willeth. Verily He is All-Powerful, All-Wise. The Christians among the People of the Book said: "Our hands are tied." They have lied in their polytheistic desires against Us. Indeed, the hand of God is truth, and He is the One Who controls the kingdom as He willeth, through what He willeth, and He is God, powerful over all things. Verily God encompasseth all things, and He is God, the Most High, the Most Great. O people of the earth! The Light hath come unto you from God through this Book, manifest with the truth by the truth, that ye may be guided unto the paths of peace and emerge from darkness into light by God's leave, upon this pure and extended path. They have disbelieved who have attributed to the Remembrance anything beyond servitude to God, the Most High. Say: Who possesseth anything apart from God, the Most High? And verily if God desired to destroy the Remembrance and all His creation, none could withhold His power nor prevent His Will. His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and there is nothing but shall come before Him on the Day of Resurrection, in truth, as a worshipping servant in poverty. They have disbelieved who have said that God hath established a connection between Himself and His creation, like unto the word which the Jews and Christians spoke saying "We are the sons of God." Exalted be God far above what those who liken Him to His creation say, with a great exaltation. He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them by His command, not from anything. He is unique in His Oneness and Self-Subsistence. His sacred Essence is not joined with anything, and none knoweth Him as He is except Him. So glorified be He above what the wrongdoers describe concerning His signs, with a mighty glorification in truth by the truth. O people of the earth! The Remembrance hath come unto you from God after an interval between the Messengers, to purify you and cleanse you from impurities for the days of God, the Truth. So seek ye bounty from His presence, for We have made him in truth a witness and a wise one over the people of the earth. O ye believers! Remember God's favor upon you, for I have given you in truth what was not given to anyone in all the worlds before you. So be thankful to God, the Most High, and be praiseworthy in the Faith. O thou beloved! Let not those who hasten towards unbelief grieve thee \[...\]

O beloved one! Let not those who hasten to disbelieve grieve thee, nor those who say "We believe" with their tongues while thou knowest their hearts speak otherwise. And whoso seeketh to create dissension against the Remembrance shall have no power over anything, for unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth, and He is independent of all created things. O exalted Remembrance of God! Judge not between the polytheists but turn away from them. Yet if they believe in this Book, then judge between them with justice according to the true Faith, for verily God encompasseth all things. Whosoever judgeth by other than what God hath revealed in His Book is accounted in God's sight as one written down as an infidel to the truth. Those who disbelieve in God after the Remembrance are worshippers of false gods in the Mother Book, and theirs shall be the most evil return to the Fire. We have witnessed many among the people transgressing and consuming what is forbidden - what aileth these people that they fear not God, the Most High, the True, the Faithful, even a little? Those who spoke the word of the Jews and Christians and claimed the Proof was cut off from mankind have disbelieved. Cursed are they for what they have said. By God, besides Whom there is none other God! Nay, God's hands are outstretched - He bestoweth as He willeth, and His power hath no end in truth. Were the people of the Furqan to believe in the Remembrance, We would remit their sins and cause them to enter the gardens of delight as their best reward. O Solace of Mine eyes! Deliver what hath been sent down unto thee from the bounty of the All-Merciful. If thou doest not, the people will not know Our mystery. Verily God created creation only for His knowledge, and God is indeed the Knower of all things and independent of all worlds. Say: O people of the Furqan! Ye have nothing save after the Remembrance and this Book. If ye follow God's command We shall forgive your sins, but if ye turn away from Our decree We shall verily judge you by the Book with the greatest Fire, yet We wrong not mankind by a whit. O people of the earth! If ye believe as do the believers, ye have truly purchased Paradise, and no fear shall come upon you nor shall ye experience prolonged grief. We have taken thy covenant from all in earth and heaven by God's promise, He besides Whom there is no God. Yet whenever the Remembrance came to you from God, ye followed Satan save a few. Do ye not fear God on a Day which in the Mother Book is ordained for reckoning? By your Lord! We have taken from the wrongdoers around the Fire the right of the believers, for God hath power over all things. They have disbelieved who say God is the Exalted One. Glory be to God above what the wrongdoers describe! The heavens and earth are nigh rent asunder and split from their word of disbelief in God. He is but a servant, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise. By the True God! He hath called creation at the Equator: "Worship my Lord and your Lord, the All-Merciful - He is God, there is no God but He." Whoso associateth partners with God, Paradise is forbidden him and the Fire becomes his portion, and this hath been recorded in the decree of the Book.

This has been decreed in the Book and inscribed in that same decree. The similitude of those who point to God in the form of trinity is as the similitude of those who say God is the third of three. There is no God but the One God, there is nothing like unto Him, and exalted is He far above what the unbelievers say with great exaltation. Muhammad and His trustees were naught but servants of the one God. Whoso claims aught else regarding them hath disbelieved in God, his abode shall be hell-fire, and God hath not ordained for him in the hereafter any helper. They who claim that Muhammad and the family of God are in need of aught besides God, these are the most misguided of men in the Book of God, and God hath not ordained for them in the hereafter any helper. O people of the earth! Do ye worship besides God that which possesseth naught besides the All-Merciful, when God is witness over all things? O concourse of men! Go not beyond the bounds of servitude unto God, besides Whom there is no God. Whoso claimeth aught else hath as it were warred against God and His loved ones, and God hath prepared for him in the hereafter a grievous punishment. They who follow Satan desist not from that which is reprehensible unto themselves; these are the companions of the fire by the decree of the Book, and this decree hath been irrevocably fixed concerning them in the Mother Book. Save those who repent and believe; God will soon forgive whomsoever He willeth, for God is powerful over all things. O people of the earth! When will ye speak as did the brothers of Joseph in his presence, for verily He is the Doer of all things by God's leave, and God is indeed cognizant of all things.

The Surah of Mercy

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

He said to his servants: "Put their merchandise in their packs, that they may recognize it when they return to their people, that they may come back."

Ta. Sin.

Verily We have revealed unto thee this Book in truth, that men may know the truth of the Remembrance, and God is witness unto all things.

The believers, when they hear a verse from this Book, their eyes overflow with tears and their hearts are humbled before the Most Great Remembrance of God, the All-Praised, and God has ever been All-Knowing.

These are the inhabitants of Paradise, dwelling therein forever. They shall see therein naught save that which proceedeth from God, which their souls cannot comprehend, and the believers among the people of Paradise shall greet them, saying: "Peace be upon you!"

God hath ordained mercy for the believers as a thing prescribed, and God doth encompass all things.

O people of the earth! Fear God and be not excessive in the religion of God, the Truth. Consider your souls before death, for God hath not ordained any path for the unbelievers after death, in very truth.

O ye believers! Fear God concerning this Most Great Remembrance, for whosoever opposeth Him hath opposed the Truth, and God hath decreed for such a one the punishment of fire, and God hath power over all things.

O ye believers! God, your true Lord, saith in truth that whosoever followeth this Remembrance hath indeed followed all the Messengers in truth.

O people of the earth! God desireth naught from the believers save pure religion for Himself, and God hath ever been Self-Sufficient.

Know, O people of the earth, that God hath ordained for the Remembrance, after the Book, naught save the Bayan. Fear ye God in the name of the All-Merciful, for He knoweth what is in the heavens and what is on earth, what ye reveal and what ye conceal, and He is independent of all worlds.

God hath not ordained equal judgment for the good and the evil. Marvel not at the abundance of evil, for God hath ordained for His gate fewer than ye imagine, and God hath power over all things.

O people of the earth! Ask not the Remembrance of your inner thoughts, for if revealed they would grieve you. God is the Self-Sufficient, the Concealer. Ask Him concerning the ways of your path to God, your true Lord, and God is cognizant of all things.

When people ask thee about the unseen at the time of proof, say: "God's is the conclusive proof. I know naught save what my Lord hath taught me, and none knoweth the unseen save God." He is God, your true Lord, and He is cognizant of all things.

The people know not a single letter of the knowledge of the Book in truth. Had they known the truth, they would not have asked thee for proof after the verses, for God hath created them through His power and hath appointed the angels of heaven and earth as their guardians. Were all the people of earth to gather together to produce the like of a portion of its letters, they would never be able, even if they had others like unto them to help.

God hath power over all things.

God is witness unto all things.

God is independent of all worlds.

Can any besides God reveal such verses in truth? Glory be unto Him!

He is God, independent of all worlds. Can anyone besides God reveal verses like these in truth? Glorified and exalted is He above what the wrongdoers say concerning His gates, with great transcendence! When you say to the polytheists, "Come unto God and to this Book which has been sent down from God, the Truth," they say, "Sufficient for us is what we found of the knowledge of the Book before." Say: By your Lord, you know naught of the knowledge of the Book save one limited letter of the proof. Do you believe in part of the Book and deny part of it? On the Day of Resurrection, the Book's decree for your souls shall be naught but the Fire of Samum from the Tree of Hell, and this decree has been determined in the Mother Book.

O ye who believe! God has ordained for your souls naught but your own decree, and on the Day of Resurrection, God will not question you about the decree of those who guide or those who go astray. Therefore watch over your souls, for Satan is your manifest enemy.

O believers! Hear My call from around this Most Great Remembrance. God has revealed to Me that the path of this Remembrance with Me is established upon truth by truth. Whosoever follows other than this upright religion shall find no portion written for him in religion on the Day of Resurrection.

O concourse! Remember Me at this Remembrance, that God may accept your deeds and the angels may record for you goodly reward from the knowledge of the Book as ordained. Know that God has prescribed mercy for Himself on the Day of Gathering, the appointed time for all the worlds. Turn away from this world, for it associates partners with God, and follow the Remembrance, for in the Mother Book He is wise and knowing.

Fear God, O company of kings, regarding distance from the Remembrance after the Truth has come to you with the Book and verses from God through the tongue of the Remembrance wondrously. Seek bounty from God, for after your belief, God has ordained for you a garden whose breadth is as the breadth of all gardens, wherein you shall find naught but blessings and bounties from God, according to that which was great in the Mother Book.

O believers! Why do you not ponder the Book? Is there any creator besides God? Glory be to Him! He is the Truth, there is no god but He, the Truth, and He is the Most High, and God is mighty, praiseworthy.

O people of the earth! Hear My call from around this Blessed Tree: Verily I am God, there is no god but I, so worship Me and establish prayer at this Most Great Remembrance, that you may be written in the Book of the monotheists.

Verily We shall gather the Prophets, the truthful ones, and the gates in the plain of gathering, and We shall say unto them: "For what were you sent?" They will say: "By God, the Truth, we have no knowledge of anything. God is the Most High, and He is God, ever knowing, great."

God, glorified be He, has said: "I created you not, nor did I raise you up, save as one soul, that you might say: 'There is no god but God, the Most High,' and He is God, ever mighty and praiseworthy in truth by truth."

Soon shall the truthful profit from their truthfulness, and We shall judge the guilty by their names, and God does not wrong the worlds by so much as the speck on a date stone.

O Spirit of God! Remember My favor upon thee when I spoke to thee in the midst of holiness and supported thee with the Holy Spirit that thou mightest speak unto the people through God's wondrous tongue that which God had wisely ordained in the mystery of the heart wondrously.

I have strengthened thee with the Holy Spirit that thou mayest speak unto men with the tongue of God, the Wondrous, concerning that which God hath firmly established in the mystery of the heart in a wondrous way. Verily God hath taught thee the Book and wisdom in thy youth, and hath favored the peoples of the earth through thy Most Great Name, for the people know naught of the knowledge of the Book, save a little. We, verily, created the birds and healed the blind and the leper through the tongue of the Spirit of God, Jesus the son of Mary, that the people might know that God is the Creator, the Healer, the Powerful. And there is naught but shall come before Him on the Day of Resurrection as a servant. And when the disciples ask thee concerning the Word from thy Lord, the True One, shower upon them the holy effusions from thy Lord, for God rejecteth naught, and He, verily, hath power over all things. O concourse! Hear My call from the tongue of this Most Great Remembrance, for My proof unto you is this Soul, My Soul, and the decree hath been inscribed in the Book of God from the beginning. Fear ye the Day whereon the Remembrance shall judge among you with the judgment of God, your True Lord. There shall ye find none in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth besides this exalted Remembrance as a helper. O people of the divine cloud! Hear the call of the Lord from this spot of earth - verily He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and He is indeed the Ancient, the Mighty. We, verily, command the angels, by God's leave, to place the sign of the Remembrance in the dwellings of the souls of those who have preceded, that they might recognize it when they return to the people of the divine Unity, and that they might return unto God, the True One, upon this Most Great Path. Verily God hath ever been compassionate unto the believers.

When they returned to their father, they said: "O our father! No measure of grain shall henceforth be given to us unless our brother is with us. Send him therefore with us that we may obtain our measure, and we will indeed guard him well."

Praise be to God Who hath lifted grief from the heart of His servant that he might be a shining lamp unto all the worlds.

We have revealed unto thee as We revealed unto the Prophets, commanding that ye worship none but God, besides Whom there is no God, and He is the Mighty, the Ancient.

O ye believers! Fear God and let not Satan deceive you, for verily the world is fleeting, but the life to come with God, thy Lord, the Most High, hath been ordained great in the Mother Book.

O ye believers! Fear God, your Lord. By God! If ye deny the Remembrance after the Book hath been sent down unto you in truth, by the True One, We shall surely chastise you by God's leave with the severest chastisement, such as hath never been inflicted on any other, for God hath power over all things.

And when the Day of Resurrection cometh, God shall question the Prophets, the Truthful Ones, and the Gates: "Did ye tell the people to worship aught beside God?" They will answer: "Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee alone, without partner. We called the people only to bear witness unto Thy Oneness, and sufficient art Thou between us and all the worlds as Witness."

O people of the earth! Fear God regarding falsehood. Our Remembrance calleth the people only to that which the All-Merciful hath called unto Himself - to worship none but God alone. He is but the servant of God and His Word, and God sufficeth as a true Witness.

O Supreme Remembrance of God! We bear witness in thy prayer upon the Path: "O my God! If Thou shouldst take them to task for what their hands have wrought, verily Thou art the Just in judgment, and if Thou shouldst forgive them, verily Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Generous."

We shall surely cause the truthful ones to enter the Garden through the Remembrance - this is God's supreme bounty unto whomsoever He willeth, and God encompasseth all things.

Praise be to God Who hath created His servants in the temple of His power, and all the worlds stand in awe and humility before His Remembrance.

Verily those who have disbelieved in God after the Book hath come unto them in truth - God shall soon decree for these polytheists the Fire, and God is witness over all things.

We send down no verse in this Book but We have ordained it in its supreme potency over its like, yet most people remain far removed from Our signs.

When they denied the believers through Our Remembrance, God decreed against them through the sons of the oppressors who were made to stand upon the Path at this Gate.

Do ye not reflect upon the polytheists whom God destroyed for their sins? And ye are in a worse position than they. Soon shall We destroy you for your sins and bring forth another creation for the Supreme Remembrance, for God hath power over all things.

O people of the earth! Fear God in your deeds, for God hath appointed for everything a limit in the Mother Book.

When a thing is decreed, it shall not be repeated in like manner. Fear God through God that ye may all be united at this Gate through God, the Great.

The polytheists indeed mocked some of the Messengers before thee; soon shall We decree for the guilty ones the Supreme Fire, for God encompasseth all things.

God hath prescribed mercy for Himself on the Day of Assembly about which there is no doubt\[...\]

Verily God hath been encompassing all things. God hath prescribed mercy unto Himself for the Day of Assembly concerning which there is no doubt, and those who deny the Most Great Remembrance - these are they who shall be encompassed by fire. No dwelling-place findeth rest in aught, nor doth any moving thing move, save by the leave of God, the Most High, and He is God, the All-Knowing.

O people of the earth! Do ye take lords other than the One God, beside Whom there is no god - He Who created the heavens and the earth by His power? There is no god but Him Who is the only God. Those who call upon aught else beside Him are encompassed by fire upon fire, and verily God is Self-Sufficient, Great.

O ye believers! I fear from my Lord a Day whose measure is fifty thousand years, when mankind shall stand before the All-Merciful. Fear not, for We have turned away from thee the evil of that Day, and verily the supreme mercy of God for those who follow thee hath been inscribed in the Mother Book with exalted truth.

Whosoever holdeth fast unto God, He sufficeth him. And if harm toucheth thee, there is no decree but His. There is no administrator save God, the Most High, and He is the Almighty over all things - He is God, the Mighty, the Wise.

O people of the earth! If ye bear witness to this Most Great Remembrance as God beareth witness unto Him, then ye have indeed denied. And if ye bear witness against Him according to the promptings of your own selves, then ye have lied, for God hath ordained naught for mankind save complete submission.

Say: The testimony of Truth concerning the Book sufficeth me. I call you only to worship one God, and verily God and His loved ones are quit of the idolaters. And who doth greater wrong than he who fabricateth falsehood against God concerning the Remembrance? Verily God hath prepared for the liars an all-encompassing fire.

Soon will God gather you in the plain of resurrection, and We shall say unto you: "Call now upon those partners ye claimed beside the Remembrance!" But they will not answer, nor will they be able to say aught save "Would that we were dust beneath the earth!"

O Solace of Mine eyes! Hast thou not seen those who stood before the fire and said: "Would that we could return and not deny the Remembrance and the Book!" God hath slain them for their unbelief. Were they to be sent back unto thee, they would gain naught save unbelief and Satan.

By thy Lord! We shall cause all to stand before the Lord at the Bridge, and none shall have power over aught save through the Covenant of the Remembrance. Verily the Covenant of God at the Bridge shall be a station where Truth shall be questioned according to the Truth.

And when We remove the veil from their insight, they shall say: "O our remorse for what we neglected concerning the Most Great Remembrance!" Verily God wrongeth not mankind by so much as the weight of a mustard seed. God sufficeth as a witness for the believers. The life of this world is naught but the enjoyment of illusion, while the Hereafter hath been decreed in the Mother Book to be supremely great.

And God hath witnessed thy grief for Husayn.

And God has witnessed your grief for Husayn, and verily God will fully compensate those who grieve with a reward beyond measure, and God has not ordained in the Mother Book for these believers any reckoning save that which is justly measured. Let not the denials of the polytheists concerning God, the Truth, grieve thee, for God will soon take vengeance upon them in the fire with the severest punishment and the ultimate retribution. Verily messengers before thee were denied, yet they were patient concerning that which they heard, and there is none to change the words of God, thy Lord. And God has ordained for thee to bear the afflictions of all the people of creation, in truth and justice, all together. I am content with God as my Lord and I hold fast to His cord, and there is no power nor strength save in God, the Most High, and He is God, the Most High, the All-Wise. And He is God, Who encompasses all things. And verily this Remembrance is the truth from God, and He is God Who is witness over all things. And if God had willed, He would have gathered them all unto the Remembrance, and verily God quickens the dead and causes the living to die, and God has power over all things. O ye believers! When ye return to the city unto Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets, ye shall say: "O our father! The Remembrance has withheld from us the measure. Therefore send with us a sign of the Remembrance for the Most Great Remembrance, and verily we have been, through God's might and power, guardians of the Remembrance." That is of the tidings of the unseen which We reveal unto thee in truth, that mankind may be patient concerning the signs of God, the Most High, in truth and justice. And unto Him submit whosoever is in the heavens and the earth in truth, but the polytheists, by the decree of the Book, have been inscribed around the fire in their associating partners with God.

He said: "Can I trust you with him except as I trusted you with his brother before? But God is the best Guardian, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy."

Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. Verily, I am God, there is no God but Me. I have chosen you for Myself and have ordained mercy upon Myself, but people know little of the knowledge of the Book. There is not a letter in the Book nor anything in the horizons except that God has created it according to your likeness, and nothing is neglected in the Book, for God encompasses all things.

God has made the polytheists blind to the light of the sun. Whomever God wills to be in unbelief, He leads astray, and whomever God wills to have faith, he is upon the straight path, steadfast around the Gate.

O people of the earth! The Hour is surely coming, there is no doubt in it. By your Lord, if the veil were removed from your eyes, you would forget your partners besides God, and on that Day you will not find any helper besides God, the Most High.

Say to the believers: Have mercy upon yourselves and do not follow Satan, for God does not forgive that partners be associated with the Remembrance, though He forgives anything less than that to whom He wills. He is God, and He is knowing of all things.

When the polytheists forgot the judgment of the Remembrance, We opened unto them the gates of all things that they might rejoice in what God gave them of His justice. Soon We shall seize them suddenly with fire, and We shall judge them with fire justly, according to what God has decreed irrevocably in the Mother Book.

Say: None knows the unseen except God and whom He wills. My knowledge is only through God, and We speak only the truth. Whoever is guided is guided only for his own soul, and whoever disbelieves - indeed, God is Independent of all the worlds.

O people of the earth! Do you not fear a Day when you will be gathered to God, your Lord? On that Day you will not find any helper besides the Most High Remembrance.

We have tried some through others that people might remember through the Remembrance, yet few among the believers believe in God's wondrous verses.

With God are the keys of the unseen in a Book, and the treasuries of all things in a Book that none knows except Him. He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and He is the One Who sends down things from the Mother Book with truth, by truth, concealed around the Fire.

There is nothing but that We have its like, which We send down as We will by Our power, according to what God has decreed irrevocably in the Book.

O people of the earth! By your Lord, the Truth, besides Whom there is no God, this Remembrance is upon clear evidence from Myself, and judgment belongs to God Who relates the truth and nullifies falsehood, and God is knowing of all things.

God has decided the matter between Me and the people after the Book, so turn not to anything and work for God, for God is Independent of the worlds.

Whoever believes, it is for his own soul, and whoever disbelieves, it is for his own soul. The Remembrance is nothing but Justice itself, and God is witness over the believers.

When the believers come to you with verses, give them glad tidings of what God has prescribed for Himself \[...\]

And when the believers come to thee with the verses, give them glad tidings of what God hath prescribed for Himself, and accept their excuse for what they do in ignorance, without the command of the Book, and turn them back with the Remembrance to God, their True Lord. His is the judgment, and He is the Reckoner of what the Book hath truly recorded, the Faithful, the Mighty, the Swift. Say: Who protecteth you in the darkness of the wombs and in the ark upon the waters? Do ye call upon any other than God for yourselves, apart from the Most Great Remembrance? What aileth you that ye believe not in God, the Most High, the Mighty, save a little? Verily God is the Subduer over His servants. Do ye not fear God on a day when He shall send down water from heaven and bring forth water from the earth? Then shall We deliver the Remembrance, the Most Great Word, and ye shall find no helper beside God, the All-Wise, the True.

And all this We have originated from the tidings of the unseen in an established knowledge. God shall soon cause the guilty ones to enter their abode upon the sun in the reckoning of the fire, from a valley which hath been in the Mother Book as a blazing flame.

O Solace of Mine Eyes! When thou seest the idolaters discussing the Book, turn away from them until they come to thee with the Most Great Remembrance. And sit not after the reminder, but leave them in truth in the fire, gathered around the fire.

Turn away from those who make the Remembrance like unto the remembrance of their own selves, or love Him more ardently. What aileth these cattle that they ponder not the truth? Have ye any intercessor beside God? Have ye any protector beside God, the True One? And God is the Mighty, the Wise.

These are they who have been clothed, for what they have earned, with the garment of fire. God hath prepared for them a drink from the spring of venom and food from the tree of Zaqqum. God hath not ordained for them in the hereafter any portion of the Most Great Mercy, and the decree in the Mother Book hath been accomplished.

O people of the earth! Fear God and call not upon any beside God, your True Lord, that which neither profiteth nor harmeth you, save that it maketh you to wander in perplexity upon the earth. Verily your Lord God, the True One, is Truth, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise.

Verily guidance is with God, guidance from the presence of the Remembrance, and He commandeth you only that ye may submit to God, the Lord of the worlds. And He is God, the Mighty, the Ancient.

And He it is Who hath created what is in the heavens and the earth in truth, that men may know that the Most Great Word is "Be!" and it hath been written in the Mother Book concerning the station of the Remembrance.

His word is the truth and His is the kingdom in truth, and by His command is blown the trumpet. He is the Knower of the realm of the trumpet's blast, both the unseen and the visible, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise.

And verily We showed thee the kingdom of the heavens and the earth in truth, and thy vision hath not ceased since the beginning of the latter creation, and God hath been witness over thee.

And among the idolaters are those who say that such a one was the gate of God, but when he setteth, they say the like concerning another. Thus do their claims never cease, leading to Satan, and these know not from the knowledge of the Book even a little of the truth.

God hath testified for thyself that I have turned my face toward God Who hath originated the people of origination through His Most Great Name, the Wondrous, beside Whom there is no God, and He is God, the Most High, the Great.

He is God, the Most High, the Most Great!

The knowledge of my Lord encompasses all things, and I am but the servant of God in truth. Soon We shall show you, by God's leave, the Beast of Earth upon the earth, supremely exalted in truth by the truth.

O people of the earth! Do you not fear your polytheism against God after your oppression of the Remembrance? Will you find, apart from God, any helper on the Day of Truth, in truth, by the truth?

Nay, by your Lord! The Fire shall be their abode, by the decree of the Book, and this judgment has been irrevocably ordained in the Mother Book.

Verily, We bear witness to Your proof for every soul through wondrous verses from God, and We raise in ranks whomsoever We wish among Our servants. Verily God is knowing of all things.

O people of the earth! Act according to the holy station within yourselves, for the Hereafter is indeed the true life, and God has prepared for the believers among you a mighty reward.

God rewards each according to what His Book has prescribed, by the decree of the Book, and this judgment from God, the Truth, has been irrevocably ordained in truth by the truth.

The Truth has spoken in truth, in the inmost meanings of the Word from the seas of creation, through the mystery of the Line which was wondrously concealed in the Point of Mystery.

Has He secured you through the Most Great Remembrance as He secured you through His two brothers before? For God, the Truth, is the best guardian, and He stands firm upon the straight path around the Fire.

Verily God is the Knower of His servants, and He, the Truth, encompasses all things. And He is God, independent of all worlds.

The Surah of Unity

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

And when they opened their belongings, they found their merchandise returned to them. They said, "O our father, what more could we desire? Here is our merchandise returned to us. We can provide for our household, protect our brother, and obtain an additional measure of grain. That is an easy measure."

God, there is no God but He, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting. Nothing knows Him, yet He knows all the worlds through His knowledge, and He is God, the Witness over all things.

O people of the veils! Hear My call from the tongue of this Remembrance, this Arabian Youth. Verily, I am God, there is no God but He. I have ordained eternal Paradise for the Remembrance upon the Most Great Truth. And there is nothing except that We have decreed for it a covenant from Him. Whoever fulfills his covenant is indeed guided, and whoever turns away has turned away from his Lord, and We shall decree for him on the Day of Resurrection naught but eternal fire, wherein he shall abide forever.

Verily, We have favored some prophets above others, and We have given you the wisdom of the Book by God's leave from the presence of One All-Wise, and He is God, informed of all things.

And verily Isaac, Jacob, Jonah, Zachariah, and John were all recorded in the Book with God as being around the Fire.

And verily Solomon, Elias, Abraham, Ishmael, and Lot - We favored them with the truth, and they were recorded in the Mother Book as being around the Fire.

These are they to whom We gave wisdom and prophethood in truth, for We knew in their souls the covenant of the Remembrance. And whoever denies a single verse from God has denied all the verses, and God is indeed knowing of all things.

O people of the earth! Associate not partners with the Remembrance, for God has rendered void the deeds of the polytheists through justice, and God's command in the Mother Book has been decreed.

Say: God asks of you no recompense on the Day of Judgment save My remembrance, and this is naught but a reminder for all the worlds.

He is but a servant of the Proof, calling people to the pure religion of God, and they have not valued Him as He should be valued, in truth, even a little.

Is it other than God who sent down the Book that came to Moses as a light and guidance for the people? What ails you, O black tree? Will you not ponder over that Book regarding the truth of the Gate?

This is a blessed Book We have sent down, confirming the truth, that people might know that God's proof concerning the Remembrance is like His proof for Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets, and this matter in the Mother Book is mighty.

And who is more unjust than one who fabricates lies about God concerning this Book? Can any besides God alter it? Say: Bring your proof if you are witnesses before God, the Most High.

By your Lord, if mankind and jinn gathered to produce the like of even a portion of its letters, they would not be able, even if We were to aid them with seven thousand like themselves. Can any besides God speak with His tongue? Glory be to God, the Most High, above what the polytheists say, for none besides God has power over all things.

Soon shall We gather you individually as We created you the first time, and We shall see you around the Fire, for they are polytheists.

Those partners of God whom you claimed - you will not see there for yourselves even a little of truth in truth.

Therefore believe in God, there is no God but He.

They are indeed associators. Do you see there any of those whom you imagined to be partners with God, even in the slightest measure of truth? Therefore believe in God, besides Whom there is no God, and turn away from all else, for He is the Truth and He is God Who has ever been mighty from ancient times. Verily God is the Cleaver of the grain and the date stone, and the Creator of darkness and gloom. Show me then what those whom you call His partners have created. By your Lord, the All-Merciful, your abode shall be in the Fire along with the moon and sun in a valley which God has named in the Mother Book as a reckoning. We have indeed set the stars in the horizon of heaven that men might know the paths of land and sea by God's leave, and verily God has knowledge of all things. We have created you from a single soul, as one soul, and We ordain for you in truth: among you are the learned and among you are the learners, and God encompasses all things. God has sent down from heaven water in abundance that there might spring forth from that holy earth inner vegetation and outer grapes and pomegranates, distinctive without comparison to aught else. Behold this greatest fruit and its ripeness that ye may become knowledgeable in the remembrance of God, the Most High. Some people have ascribed partners unto God without knowledge. Glorified be God far above what the wrongdoers describe in their great arrogance. He is the Originator of all that is in the heavens and earth. He has no offspring nor consort, and He created all things from nothing, and God has power over all things. God, the Truth, He is your Lord; there is no God but He, so worship Him and put your trust in Him. Vision comprehends Him not, but He comprehends all vision, and He is God Who has ever been exalted and great. The Book has indeed come to you from God with truth: whoever sees, it is for his own soul, and whoever is blind, it is to his own detriment, and verily God is witness over all things. Follow what We have revealed unto thee from thy Lord, besides Whom there is no God, the Mighty, and He is God Who has ever been powerful and wise. Had God willed, none would have associated partners with Him. Revile not those who call upon God without knowledge, lest they revile God, the Truth, with knowledge. We have taught you in truth that ye may become praiseworthy through God, the Most High. Shall we seek other than God for judge when He is the Truth Who has sent down the Book with truth that people might know His greatest Word in truth? There is none that can change His words, and He is God Who has ever been hearing and knowing. Thus have We appointed for every Prophet an enemy from among men and jinn, that devils might whisper to their souls ornate speech as a lie against God, and He is God Who has ever been exalted and praiseworthy. Eat of that over which God's name has been mentioned and turn away from sin and its inward manifestation, for everything has its limit in the Book of God which has been inscribed around the Fire. Is the likeness of the sun as the likeness of darkness? Exalted be His name, blessed and exalted be God! He knows where He bestows His authority, and He is the Truth, and He is God Who has knowledge of all things. Whomsoever God desires to guide to the truth, He illumines his heart for remembrance, and whomsoever He desires to lead astray, We have placed him in a besieged city. This is the path of God, the Most High, in the heavens and earth, and the Command has been established in the Mother Book around the Water. These are they for whom is the abode of Peace.

The Command in the Mother Book concerning the water was made straight. These are they for whom is the abode of peace, and God, the True One, is their Guardian wheresoever they may be, and verily God hath ever encompassed all things. And when the Day of Resurrection cometh, We shall gather together the jinn and men in the plain of assembly, and We shall say unto them: "Did not the Remembrance come unto you with the Book, with pure truth? What aileth you that ye believe not in God and His signs with pure and mighty truth, save a little?" Verily We inscribe the ranks of all beings with truth, for God is the Mighty, the Merciful. And if He so desired, He would make you pass away and bring forth another creation, for God, the True One, is truth indeed, and God hath ever been powerful over all things. They who have disbelieved have falsely ascribed partners unto God, and their cry reacheth not unto the Truth but only unto Satan, who hath ever been cast back into the fire, upon the fire, above the fire. O people of the Book! Fear ye God in your inmost hearts regarding certain suspicions about the Most Great Remembrance, for God hath decreed that in certain suspicion lieth all sin, and verily God hath ever been witness over all things, and God hath ever been powerful over all things, and God hath ever encompassed all beings. O ye believers! Hearken unto My call from the tongue of the Remembrance. Verily this is My path in the Mother Book, which hath ever been straight around the Fire with the Most Great Truth. Follow ye it with truth and follow not other paths apart from it, for God hath forbidden His path unto him who showeth evidence of any other than Him, and verily God hath ever been informed of all things. And when the people of Reality opened the goods of hearts, they found the merchandise of Divine Unity speaking of the Remembrance, whereupon they said even as the brothers of Joseph said to their father - exalted be God above this - "This is but a scanty measure," while the Remembrance is, in the sight of God, as the measure of a camel's load, which hath ever been inscribed in the Mother Book.

The Surah of Creation

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

He said: "I will not send him with you until ye swear a solemn oath to God that ye will surely bring him back to me, unless ye are encompassed (by enemies)." And when they had given him their solemn oath, He said: "God is witness to all that we say."

Praise be to God Who hath sent down the Book in truth unto Our Remembrance, that it might serve as a proof of the Remembrance for all who dwell in the heavens and on earth - a proof that is true and eloquent.

Verily We relate unto thee tidings of the unseen which God hath not revealed to anyone before thee through the mystery of the Cause, and thou wert indeed, through this Word, witnessed in the Mother Book before God.

God hath brought every matter into being through His power and hath ordained diverse fruits for the trees, that men might know that God hath power over all things.

Those who associate partners with God say: "Had God willed, we would not have associated partners with His Remembrance." Their tongues have falsely attributed this to God after their hearts were convinced thereof. Verily the proof from God through the Remembrance is truth, and God is witness over all things.

God hath ordained grievous punishment for those who turn away from certain verses. Say: "Wait ye, for God is indeed aware of all things."

Say: "In all my deeds and actions I am only for God Who created the heavens and earth in truth - no partner hath He. For this did my Lord create me, and I am the first of the Muslims." In the Mother Book I was concealed around the water by God's leave.

O people of the earth! Do ye seek any path to the Truth save through this exalted Soul who is your final destination?

The souls acquire naught except by His leave, and unto God is your return in truth. He is independent of the worlds through God, His Lord.

Verily We have made you successors in the earth by God's permission, and We have exalted some of you above others in certain degrees, and God is indeed knowing of all things.

Verily We have sent down this Book unto thee by God's leave in truth, as a reminder and glad tidings for such of God's servants as were, in the Mother Book, devout around the Gate.

Follow what We inspire in thee, and turn away from the people of the earth and their desires, for thou art indeed inscribed in the Mother Book upon the name of God, the Wondrous.

When We will, We destroy the wrongdoers from the face of the earth, even as We destroyed many of those who came before, by God's leave.

Fear ye the Day when We shall recount unto you through the knowledge of the Remembrance in truth. Then shall ye recognize the Most Great Name of God and wish for His seat that day, though ye shall only be able to visit it. The matter hath been decreed, and the judgment hath been fixed in the Mother Book.

The balance on that Day is Truth among the people of the Remembrance, and whomsoever God ordaineth to be light in weight shall have no power over anything, and God's command in the Mother Book is decreed.

When God created the Remembrance, He presented him in the assembly of the Ear to all things, whereupon all the angels prostrated themselves before God, the One, the Single, save Iblis who, being too proud to submit to the Remembrance, became thereby in His Book an arrogant accursed one.

Did We not say unto thee, O Iblis: "What aileth thee that thou dost not prostrate before God, the One, the Independent, Who created thee from the fire of the Tree, while I was indeed a witness from clay unto clay?"

Verily, I have been, from clay unto clay, a witness. And when asked, after appearing unto the eyes until the appointed time, We shall cause him to taste through these questions a lasting portion until the known Day -- a matter that hath been inscribed in the Mother Book. Soon shall Muhammad come upon the clouds, with angels round about him, and the matter hath been decreed, and there shall be no averting God's command in the Mother Book.

O people of the earth! Put your trust in God, the Truth, for verily We grant no way over those who trust in God to Satan. Fear ye God, and think not of the Remembrance as other than the Remembrance, for God commandeth not indecency, nor is He pleased with unbelief in His servants. Say: I have commanded you to justice in the pure Faith; as ye began, so shall ye return, and God is well-aware of what ye do. Say: Who hath forbidden the pure adornment of God for the believers, and the good things of sustenance? God hath created good things for the believers, so seek ye bounty from God, and be not extravagant in your enjoyment, but seek moderation upon the straight path in a praiseworthy manner.

Verily God hath forbidden you polytheism and sin and indecencies, whether open or concealed, and speaking of the Remembrance without truth. So shun ye the false deity that ye may be inscribed in the Book of Truth as helpers of the Gate. For all things We have ordained, by God's leave, a written measure. When its time cometh, ye shall not advance it by a single moment, and the decree on that Day shall belong to God, the One, the Wise, the Single.

O people of the earth! By God, the Remembrance hath come unto you with the greatest proof. Whoso denieth, upon him be the Fire, and whoso feareth God, upon him be divine good-pleasure -- a decree foreordained in the Mother Book. Who, then, doth greater wrong than he who fabricateth lies about the Remembrance after this Book of Truth? These shall not attain their appointed portion and shall be recorded in the Hereafter as companions of the Fire.

Verily those who ascribe partners unto God and reject the Remembrance, saying he is other than the true Servant of God -- the gates of heaven shall not be opened unto them, nor shall they enter Paradise until souls pass through the eye of the needle. This is God's path in the Mother Book, inscribed round about the Fire.

We burden not any soul beyond its capacity, and God hath today lifted from the breasts of the believers the burden of limitation. They have declared concerning the Most Great Word: "Praise be to God Who hath guided us to the Most Great Remembrance; we would not have been guided had not the Remembrance guided us by God's leave." These are the companions of Paradise, wherein they shall abide forever. Neither the heavens nor the earth with their denials shall grieve them, and they shall remain steadfast upon the pure path in truth.

We have stationed upon the Heights men who know people by their marks, and We have ordained for these men heights wherefrom they know not people by their marks, and from the throne of blindness they observe people by their marks. And God is knowing of all things.

When We cause the people of the Fire to enter therein, they say: "O people of Paradise! Pour upon us a drop of water, filtered from that Ocean!" Then doth the Remembrance proclaim with magnification: "God hath forbidden My bounty unto those who turn away from My remembrance. Make them taste, O Malik, of the heat of boiling water and the essence of Zaqqum with intense severity." When they forgot the Remembrance, We caused them to forget the remembrance of the Truth through truth\[...\]

And from the essence of hell-fire upon the Truth by the Truth, most severe. When they forgot the Remembrance, We caused them to forget the remembrance of the Truth by the Truth, and they shall never find any change in God's true judgment in the Fire. O ye believers! Have We not sent down unto you a Book on parchment wherein We have detailed the knowledge of all things? What aileth you that ye believe so little in the wondrous verses of God? Do ye deem false judgment more worthy of security than the judgment of Truth by the Truth? Woe, then woe unto these idolaters! What aileth you that ye ponder not the Qur'an's interpretation? Verily God is your true Lord Who created the heavens and the earth in six days of the six, then established His authority upon the throne. His is the Command and the Creation. There is no God but He, and He hath ever been the Self-Subsisting, the All-Wise. O people of the earth! Create not disorder in the land after the Remembrance, and call upon God within yourselves in supplication and fear, for verily the mercy of God in the Mother Book hath ever been nigh unto the believers. O Concourse of Lights! God sent not the Remembrance unto you save after the Most Great Covenant with your souls that ye should bring Me not a verse from Himself unless His light encompasseth you or the Remembrance eraseth you from His mention. When ye brought Me your covenant, the Lord brought you the Most Great Covenant, and God hath witnessed with justice upon the Truth by the Truth. And verily I am the Truth by the Truth upon the Truth as Guardian, and verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath ever been independent of the worlds. And verily this Remembrance is the Light in the Mount of Manifestation, and He is God Who hath ever been beloved by the believers. Say: Verily I am the Light at the Point of Manifestation. God hath stored Me up for that promised Day, and verily God's Command concerning Me hath been decreed in truth, and He is God Who hath ever been witness over all things.

Surih of the Thunder

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

O My son! Enter not by one gate, but enter by different gates. I cannot avail you aught against God. Verily, the decree rests with none save God. In Him do I place my trust, and let all those who trust, place their trust in Him.

Alif. Lam. Mim. Sad. Make mention of the mercy of thy Lord, Who is none other than He, within thyself - the self of the Guardian who was, in the Mother Book, exalted.

God hath, in truth, sent down this Book that men might recognize the truth of the Remembrance, for God is, in truth, All-Knowing.

Hearken unto that which thy Lord hath revealed unto thee: Verily, I am God, there is none other God but Me. Therefore, worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance. Circle ye round the House, surrounding the Throne, and glorify God in the Furthermost Mosque near the Remembrance, for God hath, in the Mother Book, inscribed the Throne with the name of the Gate.

God, beside Whom there is none other God, the Truth, doth in truth declare: No soul hath visited the Remembrance after his passing save as one who hath visited the Lord upon His Throne. This is the path of God, the Most Exalted, which hath been irrevocably decreed in the Mother Book.

O ye believers! Revile not the winds, for they proceed from the command of the All-Merciful in truth. We send them down only upon a goodly land by God's leave, that ye might draw forth its qualities by the leave of God, the Most Exalted - and He is God, the Praiseworthy in truth.

When the verses from the Remembrance descend upon an evil land, the soul turneth against itself, and nothing emergeth therefrom save darkness and affliction.

Marvel ye that there hath come unto you the Remembrance from God through one of Our souls among you, that he might purify you and teach you the way of those who have gone before, steadfast upon the straight path of justice?

Verily, We have sent the Remembrance to call you unto the pure Faith. Worship God, your Lord; ye have no god other than Him. I know from God that which ye know not. Ye are but a portion of His letter, and I fear for you the Most Great Day, the Day of Judgment, for God is witness over all things.

Say: O people of the earth! I am the Most Great Remembrance of God, and I am only charged with conveying unto you the messages of my Lord, counseling you, and making known unto you the ways of the Prophets, the Truthful Ones, and the Martyrs in truth. Whoso believeth, it is for his own soul, and whoso disbelieveth, it is likewise for his own soul. Verily, my Lord is God, the Truth, in truth, and He is independent of all worlds.

God hath ordained salvation for those who embark upon the Ark with thee, and We shall soon drown the deniers in the sea of fire by the leave of God, the All-Wise.

Verily, God sent not the Prophets save to convey unto men the Most Great Word that they should worship none but Him in justice - He beside Whom there is no god. This is the true Faith, and God is witness over all things.

Thou art but the servant of God and Our Remembrance. Whoso claimeth aught else regarding this Most Great Soul hath disbelieved in God, and his abode shall be hellfire, and God hath not ordained for him any helper in the Day of Resurrection, in very truth.

Say: O people of the earth! Do ye dispute with Me concerning God on the basis of names which ye and your fathers have devised through Satan's promptings? Verily, God hath sent down unto Me the Book in truth that We might acquaint you with the true names of God, from which ye were far removed, having followed other than truth.

And there is nothing but that We have taken from it a covenant regarding the Remembrance at its beginning \[...\]

We have taken from Him the Covenant of the Remembrance from its beginning, and irrevocable is God's decree concerning the purification of all peoples, by virtue of the Book which was inscribed in the hands of the Bab. Verily the Letters in God's Book are naught but a sign like unto yourselves. Do ye desire salvation for yourselves apart from them? Why do ye not reflect, even briefly, upon the wondrous creation of all things? O people of the earth! This is God's She-Camel upon the earth. Touch her not with evil thoughts contrary to truth, lest God's punishment seize you with severe suddenness. We have ordained the mountains upon the earth, and We have set the earth upon the water, and the scented air beneath the heat and cold, that ye may know that God is the Truth, and that He, God, is cognizant of all things. We have sent down torment upon every nation in truth, for they have called upon Satan instead of God with falsehood. And verily God wrongeth not mankind by even a whit. O people of the earth! Worship God in truth, for ye have no god but Him. Indeed the Book hath come to you from God in truth. Do ye still maintain any argument for yourselves? What proof have ye against the Remembrance after the Book? By God the Truth, ye call upon naught but Satan, a rejected lie. And of the people of the earth, those who have believed in the Remembrance - We shall feed them abundantly from the bounties of Paradise and We shall send down upon them, in truth, the blessings of heaven. But people know naught of the knowledge of the Book save a few letters thereof. O people of the earth! Deny not the Remembrance within yourselves, for God hath rent you asunder through your evil thoughts with fire. Believe ye in the Remembrance in truth and fear God's greatest judgment against your perverted desires. And glorified be God far above what the wrongdoers say in their great arrogance. These are the villages whose ordinances We relate unto thee, and verily God encompasseth all things. We found not the majority faithful to the Covenant of the True Guardian, but rather We found you arrested in your deficiency. O people of the earth! I am God's Remembrance, His proof unto you, and I speak naught but the truth by the truth. Here I have brought you the Book with clear verses. Is there anyone among you who hath brought a surah like unto it? Bring forth your witnesses apart from God if ye be truthful and praiseworthy in matters of faith. By your Lord! Ye shall never be able to do so. God hath sent it down from His presence, and ye are powerless to produce even a portion of its letters. And verily God is witness over all things. The polytheists said to their king: "This youth desireth to abandon our gods and seize the kingdom from our hands. Help thou the kingdom to slay him, that we may be witnesses upon the earth." God hath destroyed them for their unbelief. Had We not willed it so, they would have had no power, but God refuseth save to perfect His Remembrance, though the polytheists detest it all together. We have visited loss of fruits upon certain souls inasmuch as they rejected certain verses, that they might remember God, the Exalted, in this Book, in truth, by the truth, in praiseworthy manner. What punishment could be more severe for the polytheists than rejection, were they to ponder the Quran even briefly in the knowledge of the Book? These are they whom, at the moment of rejection, the angels seize with afflictions and exemplary punishments. Then when the Hour cometh, they shall behold with submission the judgment of God, the True, the Witnessed.

For when the Hour cometh, they shall gaze with submissiveness upon the decree of God, the True One, as a thing witnessed. And God's decree hath been fulfilled for the Remembrance with justice concerning those whom God hath established in the East and West of the earth, by leave of the Book, as dwellers in truth and security.

O people of idolatry! Why do ye worship these idols instead of God when they have no power over anything? Cast off manifest corruption and enter this upright Faith if ye truly desire God in truth and reality.

And verily We appointed thirty nights for Moses and completed them with ten, and thus was fulfilled the matter of forty mornings in truth. And when We raised up the sincere ones around the Mount, they asked Us concerning the Command. Say: God cannot be seen, but O people, look ye unto Me. For if your hearts become steadfast after truly beholding Me, soon shall ye see the servant standing firm in pure servitude with sincerity.

When the Remembrance revealed Himself to the mountain with that Word, they heard My call from around the fire: "He is God, there is no God but Him." Is there among you any who can hold fast save unto God? The mountains crumbled and hearts fell prostrate before God, the Ancient One.

O Solace of Mine eyes! God hath chosen thee through His Word, so manifest to all peoples, by God's leave, a drop in remembrance of her. And verily God hath ever been Self-Sufficient, All-Witnessing.

We have inscribed in these Tablets the likeness of the birds of the Throne, that people might be patient and grateful in the remembrance of God, the Most High.

Those who proudly reject the verses without right after the truth hath come, have chosen the path of error instead of the shining Straight Path. And God hath power over all things.

O people of the earth! Enter not through the gates by a single gate, but enter through all gates by this one Gate alone. Who can make you independent of Him through anything from God? The decree belongeth to God alone, so place your trust in Him with pure truth, for God doth take account of those who trust in Him.

And He is God, the All-Knowing of all things.

When they entered in the manner their father had commanded them, it did not avail them against God in any way except to fulfill a need in Jacob's soul. And verily he possessed knowledge of what We had taught him, but most people know not.

Kaf. Ha. Ya. 'Ayn. Sad.

God is He besides Whom there is no God, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting. Nothing is like unto Him, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.

Follow what is revealed to thee from thy Lord in truth, and grieve not over the idolaters in any way, for thou hast been purified from grief in the Mother Book from time immemorial. Verily, after the Bab, the people acted like the calf - a lifeless body in human form, in the shape of an animal, lowing.

O my Lord! Forgive me and those believers, both men and women, who have entered my house. Verily Thou art our God and the God of all worlds in truth, and Thou art the All-Forgiving through Thy grace, and Thou hast ever been Kind and Merciful to the believers.

We choose for every nation unto the Greatest Appointment a people in truth. God hath not ordained trials in religion without purpose, and verily God is cognizant of all things.

O my Lord! Through Thy Most Great Name, record for those who enter the Gate of the Hidden One such good deeds as none can reckon save Thee. Verily Thy mercy embraceth all things. These are Thy servants, poor at Thy gate, and Thou art the Self-Sufficient in truth, and Thou hast ever encompassed all worlds.

O people of the earth! Follow this Light which God hath sent down with Me in the Greatest Truth. Nothing is permitted unto you except pure things by God's leave, and nothing is forbidden unto you except impure things by God's leave. This is written in the Books of the heavens and earth. Unto God belongeth sovereignty. There is no God but Him, and He is God, the All-Knowing of all things.

He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and He is God, the Witness over all things.

We caused twelve springs to gush forth from the rock for Moses and his people, that each group might know its drinking place. And verily God hath ever been Witness over all things.

O people of earth and heaven! Enter this blessed city and eat of its verses whatsoever ye wish of wisdom and truth. Enter the Gate, prostrating yourselves before God, the Truth. We shall verily forgive those who enter that Gate, according to the decisive decree of the Book.

But people wronged themselves and read not a single letter from the Book except that their souls followed Satan, and thereby they became, in God's Book of Truth, far removed from the truth.

This city is recorded in the Mother Book on the Day of Unity, and in the Preserved Tablet it is written as being around the Fire.

When people transgressed against what they were forbidden, We said unto them: "Be ye in the Fire, in the form of fire, by God's leave, as your destination."

O people of the earth! Did not God take from you a covenant concerning the Remembrance and the Book, that ye should speak naught but truth concerning God? Verily the abode of the Hereafter is better for you as a station, in truth.

Those who hold fast to the Book and follow the Remembrance after the Remembrance, and establish victory for the pure religion - verily We shall not suffer the reward of such doers of good among you, who perform righteous deeds, to be lost.

We took from all things in the First Scene a true testimony from themselves, through the tongue of the Remembrance: "Am I not your Lord, and Muhammad your Prophet, and the Imams your guardians?"

And these holy ones and imams, and their followers, are the gates of God on earth and in heaven. And when they were asked thereof they said: "Yea." But when We brought them forth into this world, the idolaters forgot the name of the Remembrance, though in the Mother Book they were reckoned among those consigned to nothingness. Recite unto the idolaters the tale of those who came before, how We seized them from above the earth with justice. Their likeness is as the likeness of the dog: if thou attack it, it panteth with tongue protruding, and if thou leave it, it panteth still. How far have these idolaters strayed from the truth! God hath decreed for them, after the Fire, grievous punishment.

Whoso followeth the Remembrance, he is guided unto the truth, but whoso turneth away from the truth is recorded in the Mother Book as one of the denizens of the Fire, above the Fire and beneath the Fire. What aileth these believers, that they seem not to hear these verses of truth from God? They are like unto cattle - nay, more astray from the path, as it is written.

God hath inscribed for the Remembrance the most excellent names upon the Throne. Call ye therefore upon Him by them, and abandon those who pervert His names. God shall soon requite the idolaters with the Fire as their final abode. When men ask thee concerning the Hour, say: "The knowledge thereof is with my Lord alone. He is the Knower of the unseen. There is no God but He, Who created you from a single soul." I possess for myself neither benefit nor harm save as my Lord willeth. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, and God is my Lord, encompassing all things, and God is Witness over all things.

Will ye call upon servants like unto yourselves apart from God? He is the Protector of the believers, and He is God, the All-Forgiving, the All-Clement. God is the Reckoner of all mankind. And when Satan draweth nigh to a soul, seek refuge in God - verily He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. God is independent of all creation. And when they ask thee concerning the spoils, say: "The spoils belong to God and to whomsoever He willeth in truth." God is cognizant of all things, and thou art witness over all mankind.

Whoso is given of the Remembrance is given of God, and he is indeed upon the straight path, standing firm in truth. God thy Lord doth encompass all things. The believers, when the Remembrance is mentioned in the Most Great Path of God, their hearts are filled with sadness and they stand transfixed upon the path.

O ye who believe! If ye believe in God the Truth, then follow the Remembrance in truth and study this Book which God hath sent down with Him. Fear ye the Day of Distinction when the two hosts meet, and know that God is cognizant of all things.

O people of the Furqan! If ye stand by the Book, then this Remembrance is the essence of the Book. Return ye therefore unto Him, for God hath made the return in the Day of Resurrection witnessed before Him. God decreeth what He ordaineth, and His command in the Mother Book is fulfilled. Now in truth shall the perishing ones perish with clear evidence, and the believers shall live through clear evidence, and God is powerful over all things in truth.

We have shown thee from Our command in thy dream, and hadst thou made known the unseen, they would have disputed concerning the command. God thy Lord, the Truth, is indeed cognizant of what lieth within the breasts. O people of the earth! Believe in the Light which God hath sent down with Me in truth.

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

Verily God, thy Lord, the True One, hath ever been cognizant of that which is in the hearts. O peoples of the earth! Believe in the Light which God hath sent down with Me in truth, and follow not the footsteps of Satan, for verily he biddeth you to associate partners with God, your True Creator. And verily God forgiveth not that partners should be ascribed to Him, though He forgiveth all else to whom He pleaseth. And God is, in truth, the All-Knowing.

The Surah of Justice

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

When they came in unto Joseph, he drew his brother close to him saying: "I am, in truth, thy brother, so grieve not at what they did."

Alif. Lam. Mim. That Book, there is no doubt in it, and this Remembrance from God is truth, and verily God hath ever been All-Seeing over His servants with truth and justice.

O people of the earth! Fear God and let not Satan deceive you from the truth, for verily the Remembrance is truth upon truth, and ye and all that ye worship besides Him are, by the decree of truth, among the people of the fire, thus hath it been inscribed in the Mother Book.

O people of the earth! Do ye not reflect upon the creation of the heavens and the earth? Were there two gates from the Remembrance therein, both would be corrupted. Verily God hath ordered His dominion through His true gate, and God hath ever been knowing of all things.

O ye believers! Fear God on the Day of Truth, for We have gathered you around the fire and We shall question you concerning your deeds with the Remembrance. By the truth, We shall cause the idolaters to taste a grievous punishment of the fire, and We shall surely reward the patient with the most excellent reward in the land of saffron, exalted by the decree of the Book.

O ye believers! Do not exceed bounds regarding the Remembrance except with the true names from God, and leave the idolaters in their transgression, for every soul on the Day of Resurrection shall have a station upon the path where it shall be made to pause by the truth.

God doth not abrogate any verse, neither in earth nor in the heavens, except that He hath produced by the truth its like or greater than it, and verily God hath power over all things.

Follow what the Remembrance reciteth unto you in the pure religion. Verily, unto God belongeth pure judgment with justice, and God is the Self-Sufficient while ye are the poor at His gate, and He is the Truth, knowing all things.

This Book is with God, your True Master, the Secret of Books by truth, that people might witness to the bounty of the Remembrance with justice, and verily God hath power over all things.

Did ye think that ye could forsake the Remembrance and believe in the Book? Nay! God hath not ordained distinction between them save upon the water of the Throne. Were the Book to approach the Remembrance by any means, it would be consumed by God's leave, and truth draweth not nigh save as God hath ordained therein with truth upon truth, and the decree of the Book in the Mother Book hath been accomplished.

The wise have said that the connection between Truth and creation is an existent truth - exalted be God far above what the wrongdoers describe with great exaltation! Their words are like unto the words of the Christians who say the Messiah is the Son of God. God assail them! How they have disbelieved in the truth after the truth! They have taken lords for themselves besides God, while they were commanded to worship but one God, and there is none besides God save His creation in His grasp. There is no god but He - glorified and exalted be He far above what the wrongdoers say with great exaltation!

Do ye desire to extinguish the light of divine unity with your false imaginings from Satan? Exalted be God, my Lord! God refuseth but to perfect His Word and make it manifest over all religion, though the idolaters be averse.

Verily many among the People of the Book mock the Book from the Remembrance. Say: Consider! For I am with you upon the path above the fire, and I shall surely be questioned.

Verily God hath made the hypocrites enemies one to another because they forgot God after the Remembrance, so the Remembrance made them forget themselves with justice.

Verily God hath made the hypocrites enemies one to another, inasmuch as they have forgotten God after the Remembrance, and He hath caused them to forget themselves in justice. These are the people of the Fire, who have entered into the depths of the coffin, arriving at the Truth -- and evil is the Fire as a destination.

Verily the hypocrites are the polytheists in the Book of God, and sufficient for them is the curse of God and of the believers among all the peoples of earth and heaven.

O people of the earth! Look ye at those who died before you after the signs and the messengers, having died as unbelievers against the truth. Will they find aught after death save the Fire? Fear ye God, for verily the grasp of the Remembrance with God hath been ordained severe in the Mother Book.

O people of the earth! Have not the tidings of the ancients -- Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus -- come unto you? What aileth you that ye believe so little in the signs of God, the Most High?

Verily God wrongeth none in aught, but it is the people who, after the truth, have shown ingratitude for God's bounties.

Verily Jesus, from among the progeny of Adam, hath been inscribed in the Mother Book with God as the Truth.

God hath promised the believing men and believing women from among the people of the Covenant of the Remembrance lofty gardens and goodly dwellings in the Most Great Ridvan of God. This is the supreme triumph, inscribed in God's Book of Truth which hath been written round about the Gate.

Among the people are those who swear falsely by the Remembrance, and among them are those who know not the Remembrance yet swear truthfully. Verily God hath ordained for these polytheists and these believers a station on the Day of Resurrection, fixed in truth by the truth.

Verily We decree the Fire for the liars and the Most Great Ridvan for the truthful, by the judgment of God, the Most High. And He is God, powerful over all things.

No soul hath turned away from the truth after the Book but We decree for it a double chastisement, as irrevocably ordained in the judgment of the Book.

What aileth you, O people of the Book, that ye know not that God is aware of your secrets, your open deeds and your whispered words? Verily God hath taught the Remembrance the knowledge of the Book in the Point of Fire, all of it.

Verily the unbelievers mock the Remembrance through the Book, and know not that God mocketh them through His Remembrance, and He is the Truth, by the truth, independent of all worlds.

If these were to beg God's forgiveness seventy times, God would never forgive them. God hath prepared for them the supreme chastisement in the hereafter, for they have disbelieved in God and His signs. And He is God, witness unto all things.

Verily God hath created the desert Arabs more severe in unbelief than the non-Arabs, and God is knowing of all things.

Verily God hath distinguished the believing Arabs for His Word, and these have been concealed in the Mother Book above the lines upon the circles of the line.

Verily some of the desert Arabs round about the city are deep in hypocrisy, and God knoweth their secrets. Soon shall We chastise them twice by the decree of the Book, and this decree hath been irrevocably ordained in the Mother Book.

Some among the people have acknowledged their sins and have mixed good deeds with evil. Soon will God forgive whomsoever He willeth, and He is God, witness unto all things.

And among the people are some whose affair is deferred for the Remembrance, and verily God will judge between all with justice on the Day of Resurrection.

Verily God shall judge between all with justice on the Day of Resurrection, and He, God, was ever the All-Seeing over His servants. O ye who believe! Act for God, the One, the Single, with pure sincerity, free from any mention of aught within aught, for God shall soon show you your deeds in the presence of the two mighty spheres, witnessed in truth with truth. And verily We bear witness that thy deeds are purely for God, the Truth, and none among the believers shall behold thy deeds in the Most Great Scene except as being for God, the One, the Eternal, the Ancient, besides Whom there is no God, and He, God, was ever the Mighty, the Wise. And when the people of truth came unto the Remembrance, He recognized them concerning certain matters through His words of truth, therefore be not grieved by any reference to Me, for verily the Word is sanctified beyond all reference and its negation, and He, God, our Lord, was ever the Witness over all things. And verily God was ever the All-Knowing of all things.

The Surah of the Pen

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

When he had furnished them with their provisions, he put the drinking-cup into his brother's saddlebag. Then a crier called out: "O ye in the caravan! Ye are surely thieves!"

Alif. Lam. Mim. Sad. This is the remembrance of God concerning the Remembrance. There is no God but Him. Therefore worship Him and turn your faces toward the Sacred House, the Ka'bah. Associate not anything with the worship of the All-Merciful. O people of the earth! This Remembrance is Shu'ayb in the Book of God. Fear God concerning him and turn not away from His Cause, for God hath prescribed mercy for Himself, that He will forgive no soul except as the Remembrance willeth. The knowledge of our Lord encompasseth all things, and He is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Our Lord! Judge between the Remembrance and his people, and decree with truth against his oppressor, and take vengeance on those who harbor thoughts of the Days of Ignorance concerning him. Thou art God, the Wise, and Thou art verily well-acquainted with Thy righteous servants.

O people of the earth! Fear God on the Day of Truth when the Remembrance shall stand before the Throne and say: "O people of the earth! Did I not convey unto you the verses of the Book? Did We not open unto you the gates of heaven? How then did ye deny Me after the Book? Taste ye this day, by God's decree, the heat of the Fire, for ye were ungrateful to the Remembrance of God, the Just, without knowledge."

Those who have taken the mosque of hearts as a house of polytheism against God, and for corruption of the Remembrance, and for reviling the people of faith - though they swear by God with fair-seeming oaths - they have indeed belied God's testimony concerning His servants. And God doth encompass all things.

Stand not in the mosque of those who associate partners with the Truth and upon dead earth, for God hath purified thee by His knowledge - and He is the Truth - and God is aware of all things.

Verily thou art, in the Mother Book, the first mosque established in the cloud of the Throne upon pure God-consciousness for God, the Most High, and He is God, the Mighty, the Ancient. God hath ordained for thyself men who are concealed therein, and God hath ordained for these souls gardens of ruby stone, wherein God hath ordained no void of air. God hath established by His power in the center of each of their heavens seventy thousand suns that rise only by the remembrance of God, the Most Great, and God hath not decreed for them any setting, by the decree of the Book. And verily this decree was, in the Mother Book, conclusive.

That is God's greatest good-pleasure. Whomsoever the Remembrance willeth, We have willed for him by leave of God, the Truth. And verily God is witness over all things.

Is he who hath laid his foundation upon the letters of Divine Unity more worthy to be a gate unto the Truth, or he who hath laid his foundation upon the word of fire in the Fire? Judge ye for yourselves which of the two letters is more worthy of security, if ye be believers in God. And verily God is knowing of all things.

Abraham's seeking forgiveness for the polytheists was only for God, the One, the Single. When he learned from a soul among them that he was an enemy of God, he disavowed him. And verily Abraham was tender-hearted, forbearing in truth upon the truth.

God misleadeth not any people save after His greatest proof hath been made clear unto them. When God's proof was complete in truth, We destroyed them for their sins. And verily God wrongeth not creation by so much as the husk of a date-stone.

The Truth hath spoken in truth upon the inmost meanings of the Word from the seas of creation, through the mystery of the Line which was, in the Point of Mystery, wondrous.

O people of the Throne! Hear My call from this Blessed Tree: "Verily I am God, there is no God but Him. I have caused the Pen to move upon the Most Great Tablet that the Remembrance is truth even as I am the Truth. Therefore fear ye to reject, for verily the Word of God, the Most High, was, in the Mother Book, supreme."

Verily hath the Truth spoken in truth from the innermost reality of the Word from the oceans of creation, through the mystery of the Line which had been wondrous in the Point of Mystery. O people of the Throne! Hear ye My call from this Blessed Tree: "Verily I am God, there is none other God but Him!" I have caused the Pen to move upon the Most Great Tablet that the Remembrance is truth, even as I am the Truth. Fear ye the denial thereof, for verily the Word of God, the Most High, hath been in the Mother Book most great.

And verily We, when We commanded the Pen by His name, it was cleft asunder in awe and fell prostrate upon the Throne before God, the Ancient of Days, and God hath ever been knowing of all things. And verily unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He is the Truth, He giveth life and causeth death, and ye have no protector nor helper besides God.

O people of earth and heaven! Ye do naught except that God hath decreed for it a decree in His Book aforetime, and God hath ever been knowing of all things. Ye spend not in the path of God, neither small nor great, nor do ye walk upon the earth, except that it hath been written in truth for your souls aforetime, and there is nothing except that it hath been decreed in the Book of Effacement from the Point of Fire.

God hath not decreed that the believers should go forth all together unto the pure religion unto the Most Great Remembrance. But why should not a company from every group go forth to inquire of the Remembrance concerning the knowledge of the Book, that God might enrich them through His grace with the decree of the Book? And verily God hath ever been knowing of all things.

We have not sent down any verse in truth except that it increaseth the love of the believers for the Most Great Remembrance, while it addeth naught unto the polytheists save the severe fire of hell. And when the Remembrance arose with the Command, the polytheists looked to one another regarding the arising of sedition. God turned away their eyes, for they were a people who knew but little of the decree of the Book.

O Concourse of Lights! There hath come unto you the Remembrance from among yourselves, compassionate unto the believers and forbearing unto the polytheists. By God, the Truth! It beseemeth not to deny One like unto Him - if there be any like unto Him among you - and verily He is the Truth, the Path of God upon the pure path, Who hath ever been stationed upon the Most High Truth.

O Thou the Apple of Mine eye! Say: "Sufficient unto me is God, there is none other God but Him. In Him have I placed my trust, and He is the Truth, the Lord of the Throne and of the heavens, and God hath ever been knowing of all things."

Are men astonished that We have revealed the Book unto a man from among them, that he might purify them and give them glad tidings upon the footsteps of truth from God, their Lord? And God hath ever been witness unto all things.

Verily God is the Lord of creation and command, and there is no god besides Him. Then He mounted the Throne by His command, and there is no administrator in the earth nor in the heavens except by leave of His Word. And He is the Truth, He originateth creation, then causeth it to return, and God hath ever been knowing of all things.

O Concourse of Lights! Hear ye the call of the All-Merciful from this crimson leaf which hath sprouted from the green Tree. Verily, there is no god but Him, so worship Him with equity at the center of the sun upon the point of equality - after its setting are glimmers and before its rising are decades, according to the decree ordained in truth. And verily the decree hath ever been written in the Mother Book round about the Gate.

Verily, the decree was written in the Mother Book round about the Gate. He it is Who hath made the sun and the moon as two signs of truth, that ye might know the number of years through these two luminous ones. Thus doth God set forth similitudes in truth, that ye may be thankful unto God, the Praiseworthy. Verily in the diversity of the verses and the wonders of the signs are tokens for those of understanding from among the people of that Most Great Gate, and the decree of the Remembrance from God was concealed in the Point of Fire. Those who desire not Our presence and are content with the life of this world instead of the Greater Life, and who find tranquility in this world by turning away from the Most Great Word - these are the people of the Fire and were inscribed in the Mother Book round about the Fire. And those who have believed in God and have acted with justice in effacing all else for the sake of the Greatest Remembrance - these are the companions of Paradise and were gathered in the Mother Book round about the Letter B. Their first call therein shall be "Glory be unto Thee, O God, our Lord! There is no God but He, alone with no partner," and their greeting therein from the Truth shall be "Peace," and their final call shall in truth be the First Word: "Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds." And He is God, the Witness over all things. O Solace of Mine eyes! Turn away from those who hope not for Our presence and are content with the base life of this world, and leave them in their transgression by reason of what their hands have wrought. Verily God is aware of all things. When We visited Our retribution upon man for what his hands had wrought in falsehood, he called upon Us whether sitting or standing. Yet when We removed his affliction, they persisted in silence as before. What aileth these people that they understand not even a word of the Book in truth? Verily We took vengeance on generations before you for their failure to stand firm on the Most Great Path, and soon shall We destroy the guilty among you by God's leave, the All-Wise. When Our verses from this Book are recited unto the idolaters, they say: "Bring a different Qur'an than this, or change these verses." Say: "God hath not empowered me to change it of mine own accord. I only follow what is revealed unto me. Verily I fear my Lord on the Day of Judgment which is appointed in truth." Verily We commanded the angels to place the drinking cup of the Remembrance in the saddlebag of the believers by leave of God, the Most High. He is God, the All-Knowing of all things. O Herald! Call out: "O Caravan! Ye are indeed thieves, for the drinking cup of the Remembrance was hidden in truth in your highest consciousness." He is God, the Preserver of all things. He is God, the Powerful over all things.

\[The Surah of the Camel. In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.\]

They turned to them and asked, "What do you seek?" Verily, the remembrance of God in the concealed line, inscribed and veiled in mystery, which hath been hidden in the Mother Book. God hath sent down the Book unto thee that people may bear witness to God's just testimony unto Himself, that there is no God but Him, the Ancient, and He is the All-Knowing God. Had God willed, We would not have recited it unto you. Verily I am the servant of God and desire naught save what my Leader desireth, and He is the Truth from God, the True One, a proof unto all the worlds. And who doth greater wrong than he who fabricateth lies against God or His signs in vain delusion? These are the people of the pit, who dwell in the depths of the sea of Zaqqum by the decree of Truth. And God's command in the Mother Book hath been ordained.

O Remembrance of God! Say unto the idol-worshippers: How do ye worship besides God that which can bring you naught save the greatest harm - the fire of hell as your destination? Do ye inform God of what He knoweth not, or hath He partners in the heavens and earth? Glorified and exalted is He! There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and He is the Creator of all things, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Verily God hath not decreed in the Book negation as negation, nor affirmation as affirmation, nor form as anything specific, except that He hath made firm in them both in the Book according to this similitude, and verily God hath ever been All-Knowing and All-Seeing of His servants. Mankind was but one community, then they differed concerning the command after the truth. Were it not for a word that went forth from God regarding thy purpose, that judgment be passed according to the decree of origination therein, mankind would have been but alone at the Gate.

Say: The unseen belongeth unto God, the True One. Wait ye therefore, for God your True Lord hath ever been watchful over the believers. And verily We, when We cause you to taste affliction, ye call upon the Remembrance in ease, and when We raise up the command with justice therein, ye call upon Him with words of polytheism. What aileth you that ye believe not in the signs of God, the True One, according to the mighty truth, save a little?

Verily God hath caused you to travel in ships upon the sea and upon beasts across the land that ye might stand firm in truth upon the pure religion. And verily We, when We commanded the stormy wind upon the wooden ships, mankind called upon their Lord, making their devotion pure unto Him, when they feared drowning amidst the encompassing waves. Yet when He delivered them by His grace, they called not upon Us with pure truth. What aileth these souls that they read not from the knowledge of the Book even a letter of truth upon truth upon truth, save a little?

And if thou desirest the ship, then say: In the Name of God, and praise be to God, and there is no God but Him. Verily the command is in His hand and He is the True One, powerful over all things. O ye believers! Follow the Most Great Remembrance, for He is with God in truth, established upon the straight religion, inscribed in truth upon truth. Fear ye a Day when all shall return unto God, the True One. Therein shall the polytheists find no protector for themselves besides the Remembrance, and He is the Truth in the Mother Book, concealed within the circle of the letter B.

Verily God hath ordained your return unto Us and your reckoning in truth upon Us. Therefore follow the Remembrance in truth upon truth with manifest strength. Slay your souls in the path of God in truth, for God hath ordained death for every soul by the decree of the Book from the Gate. The similitude of the life of this world is as layers of darkness upon darkness. When the sun ariseth, the polytheists shall find themselves naught but darkness within darkness, the fire like shadows in mirrors. God calleth you unto the abode of peace \[...\]

Your account rests with truth upon Us. Follow, then, the Remembrance with truth, upon truth, with manifest strength. Slay your souls in the path of God in truth, for God hath ordained death for all souls by decree of the Book from the Gate. The likeness of the life of this world is as darkness upon darkness; when the sun ariseth, the idolators shall find naught but darkness within darkness, the fire like shadows in mirrors. God calleth you unto the abode of peace, and this Remembrance hath ever dwelt in the Mother Book upon the straight path. Those who have excelled in remembrance of the names of Truth, God hath prescribed for them a seat of honor in the supreme paradise, and this promise of God in the Mother Book hath been fulfilled. Those who commit evil deeds, God shall requite them the recompense of evil in like measure, and God wrongeth not mankind in aught, and He hath ever encompassed all worlds. The wrongdoers shall be overwhelmed with abasement in their faces before thee; therefore show mercy, by God's leave, unto these weak ones through thy pardon, for God is verily witness over thee. On the Day of Judgment We shall gather the sinners around the fire and say unto them: "Call now upon those partners ye claimed besides the Remembrance!" But ye shall find none among all creation. The Command hath ever belonged to God, the Ancient, the Single. O people of the Book! Ye and whatsoever ye worship besides the Remembrance are but fuel for hell, while the Remembrance through God is independent of all worlds. God sufficeth as a truthful witness between Us and you. Ye and the worshippers of the idol shall alike be in the fire, as hath been inscribed in the Mother Book. The Day of Resurrection is truth itself. There shall every soul be returned unto God, their true Lord, and He is the Just, the Best of Judges, and He hath ever been mighty and ancient. He it is Who bringeth forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living, and Who directeth all affairs besides Him, and He is the Truth, ever knowing all things. O people of the earth! God, the Truth, declareth in truth that the Remembrance is truth from God, and naught followeth truth but error, and naught followeth error but the fire, as decreed. O people of blindness! Hear My call from around the Gate. Verily your Lord God, your true Master, is truth itself. There is no God but He. His are the Command and Creation, and He hath ever been knowing of all things. God hath ever encompassed all things. God hath ever been witness over all things. O ye who dwell in chambers! Hear My call from behind the veils. I am God, besides Whom there is no God. In truth, the Remembrance is truth itself, and He is the Exalted One Who hath ever been wise in the Mother Book. The Word of God hath been fulfilled concerning the people of earth and heaven, and the proof of God in that Most Great Gate hath been sealed in truth upon truth. Are there any partners with God who can originate creation and then repeat it? Exalted be God, our Lord, besides Whom there is no God. No partner hath He, in truth upon truth. He is the Exalted, the Ancient, besides Whom there is no God, and He hath ever been wise and knowing. O Solace of Mine eyes! Point in truth to thy true breast, then say by God, the Truth: "Therein lieth authority with God, the Truth. I am He Who hath ever been the best reward."

He is God, the All-Wise, the All-Knowing!

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Point with truth to thy breast, then say: By God, the Truth, therein lies sovereignty unto God, the Truth. I am He Who hath ever been the Best of rewards, and I am He Who hath ever been the Best of destinations. O ye dwellers of the Throne! Hearken unto My call from around the divine mystery, from this Camel that expresseth the Truth by the Truth, Who in the Mother Book hath been wondrous. And when the Remembrance hath given permission unto you, return, O people of the divine cloud, to the place of His manifestation in truth. Why is there lost from the King's measuring cup something mighty? And verily We say: We find the measuring cup of the Remembrance lost in the manifestations of your hearts. And whoso bringeth His sign, according to the Most Great Truth without any trace of diminution, his shall be a camel's load by the Most Great Justice in like measure. And verily We are its guarantor, according to the pure Truth, free from all similitude and limitation. And it hath been inscribed in the Mother Book upon the upright line round about the Fire.

The Surih of the Camel

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

They said and approached them: "What do ye seek?" The mention of God shines resplendent in the hidden, concealed line, veiled by the mystery that was enshrined in the Mother Book. God hath sent down the Book unto thee that people might bear witness with the just testimony of God unto Himself, that there is no God but Him, the Ancient, and God hath knowledge of all things. Had God willed, We would not have recited it unto you. Verily I am the servant of God; I desire naught save what my Lord desireth, and He is the Truth from God, the True One, a proof unto all the worlds. And who is more unjust than he who inventeth a lie against God or falsely denieth His signs in delusion? These are the people of the pit, and by the decree of Truth have they dwelt in the depths of the seas of Zaqqum. And the Cause of God in the Mother Book was ordained.

O Mention of God! Say unto the idolaters: How do ye worship besides God that which can bring you naught save the greatest harm, the fire of hell as your final abode? Do ye inform God of what He knoweth not, or hath He a partner in the heavens and earth? Glory be to Him, exalted is He! There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and He is the Creator of all things, and God is knowing, wise. Verily God hath not decreed in the Book negation as negation, nor affirmation as affirmation, nor form as anything, save that He hath decreed in both according to this similitude, and God is knowing and seeing of His servants. Mankind was but one community, then they differed concerning the Cause by the Cause after the Truth. And were it not for a word that went forth from God regarding thy purpose, judgment would have been given according to the decree of origination. There would the people have been but alone at the Gate.

Say: The unseen belongeth unto God, the Truth, so wait ye, for God your True Lord is watchful over the believers. And verily when We cause you to taste affliction, ye call upon the Mention in ease, and when We raise up the Cause with justice, then do ye call upon Him with words of polytheism. What aileth you that ye believe not in the true signs of God, save a little? God hath made you to journey in ships upon the sea and upon beasts across the land that ye might be steadfast in the pure religion. And verily when We commanded the stormy wind upon the wooden ships, people called upon their Lord, making their devotion pure unto Him, when they thought they would be encompassed by the overwhelming waves. Yet when He delivered them by His grace, they called not upon Us with pure truth. What aileth these souls that they read not from the knowledge of the Book even a letter of truth, save a little?

If thou desirest the ark, then say: In the Name of God, and praise be to God, and there is no God but Him. Verily the Cause is in His hand and He is the Truth, powerful over all things. O ye believers! Follow the Great Mention, for verily he is with God in truth, established in the true religion, and is inscribed in truth with truth. Fear ye the Day when all shall return unto God, the Truth. There shall the polytheists find no protector for themselves besides the Mention, and He is the Truth in the Mother Book, concealed within the letter B. Verily God hath ordained your return unto Us and your reckoning in truth is with Us, so follow ye the Mention in truth with manifest strength.

Slay yourselves in the path of God in truth, for God hath ordained death for every soul by the decree of the Book from the Gate. The likeness of the life of this world is as layers of darkness upon darkness, and when the sun ariseth, the polytheists shall find themselves naught but darkness within darkness, the fire like shadows in mirrors. God calleth you unto the abode of peace.

Your reckoning in truth rests with Us, so follow the Remembrance in truth openly and with strength. Slay your souls in the path of God in truth, for God hath ordained death for all souls by decree of the Book from the Gate. The likeness of the life of this world is as darkness upon darkness, and when the sun riseth the idolaters shall find themselves naught but shadows in darkness, like reflections in mirrors. God calleth you unto the abode of peace, and this Remembrance hath ever dwelt in the Mother Book upon the straight path. Those who have glorified the Remembrance in the names of truth, God hath ordained for them a seat in the highest paradise in the greatest Ridvan, and this promise of God in the Mother Book is decreed. Those who commit evil deeds, God shall recompense them the like thereof, and God wrongeth not mankind in aught, and He doth encompass all the worlds. The oppressors shall be overwhelmed with abasement in their countenances before thee, so by God's leave show mercy to these weak ones with thy forgiveness, for God is witness over thee. On the Day of Judgment We shall gather the sinners around the fire and say unto them: "Call now upon those partners ye claimed besides the Remembrance!" But they shall find none among all creation. The Command hath ever belonged to God, the Ancient, the Single. O people of the Book! Ye and all ye worship besides the Remembrance are but fuel for hell, and the Remembrance is independent of all worlds. God sufficeth as a witness in truth between Us and you - ye and the worshippers of false gods shall equally be in the fire, as hath been written in the Mother Book. The Day of Resurrection is truth itself. There shall every soul be returned unto God their true Lord, and He is the Just, the Best of Judges, and He is the Mighty, the Ancient. He it is Who bringeth forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living, and who but He ordereth all things? He is the Truth and knoweth all things. O people of the earth! God, the Truth, doth declare in truth that the Remembrance is truth from God, and after truth there is naught but error, and after error naught but ordained fire. O people of blindness! Hear My call from around the Gate: Your Lord God, your true Master, is truth itself - there is no God but He. His is the Command and Creation, and He knoweth all things. God doth encompass all things. God is witness over all things. O ye who dwell in chambers! Hear My call from behind the veils: I am God besides Whom there is no God. In truth the Remembrance is truth, and He is the Exalted One Who hath ever been wise in the Mother Book. The Word of God is proven true for the peoples of earth and heaven, and God's proof in that Most Great Gate hath been sealed in truth upon truth. Are there any partners with God who originate creation and then repeat it? Exalted be God our Lord, besides Whom there is no God - He hath no partners, in truth upon truth. He is the Exalted, the Ancient, besides Whom there is no God, and He is God, the Wise, the All-Knowing. O Solace of Mine eyes! Point in truth to thy true breast and say by God the Truth: "There lieth sovereignty with God the Truth - I am He who hath ever been the best reward."

In the Name of God, the All-Wise, the All-Knowing! O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Point to thy breast with the truth, then say: By God, the Truth, therein lies the sovereignty of God, the Truth! I am He Who hath been the best of rewards, and I am He Who hath been the best of returns. O people of the Throne! Hearken unto My call from around the Mystery, from this Camel that expresseth the Truth by the Truth, which hath been wondrous in the Mother Book. And when the Remembrance hath given permission unto you, return, O people of the cloud, to the place of His manifestation in truth. Why is there lost from the king's measure something mighty? Verily, We say: We miss the measure of the Remembrance in the mirrors of your hearts, and whosoever bringeth His verse with the Most Great Truth without any least diminution, his shall be a camel's load through the Most Great Justice in like measure, and verily We are its guarantor upon the pure Truth, free from similitude and limitation. And it hath been inscribed in the Mother Book upon the upright line around the Fire.

The Surih of the Cave

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate!

They said: "We have lost the king's goblet, and for him who produces it shall be a camel-load; and I am responsible for it." Hath not God spoken in the Blessed Tree? Hearken unto the Call of God: "Verily, I am God, and there is none other God but Me, and I am the Most High who hath ever been supremely great in truth." Do men imagine that the Companions of the Cave and of the Inscription were asleep without the Gate? By God! Our signs concerning that Gate have indeed been wondrous to the believers, in very truth. And verily the Cave is this Gate, and in the Mother Book it hath been inscribed as encompassing the Fire. And We have caused their ears to be sealed in the Gate by God's leave, for years revolving around the Twin Mysteries which in the Mother Book were recorded as a hidden number. Then We raised them up that they might know the truth of the Cave, how long they had tarried in its precincts. And verily the letters of thy names, O Companions of the Cave, are seven, when they arose from around the Fire and said: "Our Lord is the Lord of the Throne! There is no God but He. Never shall we call upon any deity besides God," and verily God is witness over all things. These are the Companions of the Gate. They have taken gods besides Him - yet had not God manifested the Remembrance unto them with the authority of the Book, they would have been stationed around the Fire in opposition to the Truth. And We revealed unto the Companions of the Cave: "Return ye to your dwelling-places round about the Truth, for God announceth unto you His mercy, and God will prepare for you in your cause a course beneficial to your command that shall be witnessed." O Companions of the Cave! Have ye not observed the sun when it rose, declining from the Cave of your hearts on the right, encompassing the Fire, speaking from God - there is no God but He, and He is God, the Most High, the Supreme. And when it set in speech, it drew you by the mystery of its power to the dayspring of the heart. Did it not pass you by in the Cloud while ye were in a cleft of the Point that had been sprinkled from the presence of the Gate, having paused in truth? Such are God's signs for those who have preceded round about the Gate, and verily God is witness over all things. Do men imagine there is negligence in the Remembrance? Nay! He turneth the worlds by the Two Letters - on the right unto the Two Names from His own Self, and on the left unto the Two Words in the Two Gates round about the Command of His Cause. Glorified be God above what the wrongdoers say, with supreme transcendence! And verily God hath appointed through His grace, in very truth, a place of return round about the Gate. And We have decreed his two arms to be outstretched in knowledge from the presence of the Remembrance. Were men to discover this, they would not comprehend any matter of truth save in flight. And We ourselves have witnessed their speech after the resurrection in the Cave, and verily God is witness over all things. Say: Take thou, in the Most Great Truth, this supreme leaf and deliver it by God's leave unto the City. Then bear witness, O thou who art of keener sustenance in obedience unto God: "Praise be to God Who hath not made anyone aware of it, in very truth, with pure truth." And We have caused you to be discovered that ye might know that God is your True Lord, and that the mystery of the Hour hath come in truth - there is no doubt in it - and verily God is powerful over all things. O Concourse of Lights! Why do ye speak concerning the Remembrance that which ye know not from the knowledge of the Book - a letter deeply hidden in the Most Great Truth? Among you some say three in judgment \[...\]

Verily God has power over all things. O concourse of lights! Why do you say about the Remembrance that which you know not from the knowledge of the Book, a letter mysteriously concealed in the Most Great Truth? Among you are those who say three in judgment, yet God hath ordained no judgment for the fourth. And among you are those who say five, and when God wills, their sixth in judgment was indeed cast out in truth. And among you are those who say seven upon the Name, and an eighth from the mystery - those who through the knowledge of the Gate have learned of their number, and verily God is knowing of all things.

And We preserved them in the Cave beyond nine and three hundred - that is God's judgment concerning those who came before, by the truth, and God's command in the Book was decreed. O concourse of lights! We desire naught except through mention of Our Will in its beginning, and what God has ordained in the Book is nearer than this Gate, rightly guided in truth. Say: God knows best about the Cave and the Companions of the Gate. Take ye not any protector besides Him in truth, nor any partner in His command.

The parable of the water of allusion in unity is like two waters that mingle upon the earths. And God alone, there is no God but He, and naught was with Him. Glorified and exalted is He! There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.

Verily God has made wealth the glories of majesty, and children its signs, and the enduring things are the face of thy Lord, the Lord of Majesty, as a bounty from God. And We have gathered in the land of gathering unto God around the still Fire, rank upon rank, even as We created you the first time, rank after rank, and verily God has power over all things.

And when this Book is set down, the unbelievers will say: "What manner of Book is this that leaves out nothing small or great?" But they will find all that they did present before them, and thy Lord, the Most Merciful, wrongs no one by so much as the thread of a date-stone.

We have made thee witness, by God's leave, to the creation of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, on the Day when thou wert speaking praise-worthily around the Fire in truth. God has not appointed those who lead astray to be any support for aught, even slightly, in truth.

Nothing prevented men from believing in God and His signs when the truth came to them from His tongue, save that they followed not thee except in the way of the ancients, most of the deniers disputing against the truth in a known manner. We sent thee only with the truth as a bearer of glad tidings unto the light and a warner against the fire. Do you take My signs from the presence of the Greatest Remembrance in vain and delusion?

And if thou callest them to the dividing line between the worlds, Satan bars them from the truth, and they will never be guided. And whoso turns away from this Word, God has ordained no knowledge for him save a straitened life in the shadow. And We shall gather him in the land of gathering upon his face, though he was blind in this world above the earth.

Say: Were it not for a word that went forth from God concerning My Cause, I would have been compulsory upon the Command in truth. O Solace of Mine eyes! Glorify thy Lord within thy true self before the rising and at sunset and at the point of noon\[...\]

At the point of the midday sun and the darkest point of midnight, verily the remembrance of God within thy true self cannot be equated with all the deeds of them that labor. And command the people of the Gate to prayer and the Most Great Word, and be forbearing with them, for verily they cannot attain unto the knowledge of the Word except according to their capacity. And verily God, thy Lord, hath ever been forgiving unto all the worlds. Say: All at the Gate have remembered, and verily I, at the axis of the waters, am seeking after the Command, and with God, in truth, I have been mentioned in truth.

The Surah of the Friend, In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

They said: "By God, you well know we came not to spread corruption in the land, nor were we thieves."

All praise be to God, Who hath sent down the Remembrance in truth unto the Remembrance, that the people might be mentioned in the Mother Book through the remembrance of God, the Most Great.

Say: God hath indeed known the Remembrance. Is then he who guideth unto the straight path more worthy to be followed, or he who knoweth naught of the Book save a few letters?

Most people follow naught but conjecture, and conjecture availeth nothing against truth. Verily God is well aware of what ye do. This Book could not have been devised by any save God. Rather hath God, the Truth, revealed it upon the straight path at the Point of Fire with fire, in perfect measure.

It is the Truth concerning what God hath ordained before thee and around thee. God hath detailed therein the laws of all things as a mercy and glad tidings to His believing servants who stand firm around the Remembrance in truth.

Or do they say "He hath fabricated it against the Truth"? Say: "Call upon whomsoever ye can besides the Remembrance and bring forth a verse like unto it, if ye be truthful and praiseworthy."

By thy Lord! Should all who dwell in earth and heaven gather together to produce one Surah like unto it, they would never be able, even were they to be helpers one to another.

Thus have they rejected that which they could not comprehend. God shall soon requite the deniers with severe chastisement.

Among men are those who believe in God, and among them are those who deny the Remembrance. Verily God is well aware of the corrupt ones.

O Thou the Apple of Mine eye! Should the people of the two Sacred Places deny thee, say: "To me are my deeds and to you your deeds. Satan calleth you. I am innocent of the wrongdoers, by leave of God, the Ancient. He is God, the Mighty, the Wise."

Among them are those who gaze upon thee as one in a swoon. Thy Lord, verily, encompasseth all things.

God wrongeth not mankind in aught, but men wrong their own souls by remaining far from the Remembrance.

We shall gather the idolaters in the land of gathering, thinking they tarried in this world but an hour of the day. Thus doth God requite the wrongdoers for turning away from the Remembrance. Verily God is witness over all things.

No soul hath arisen to this Cause but God hath decreed its return unto Us in truth. We shall judge between all with justice, and We wrong not mankind by even a thread's weight.

Say to the believers: "I possess for myself neither benefit nor harm, save as God, my Lord, willeth. For every soul there is an appointed time. When the leave is given, it can neither be advanced nor delayed by anything through God's will. Unto God is the return of the believers ordained in truth upon truth."

The believers will ask thee whether it is true. Say: "Yea, by my Lord! It is the truth upon the straight path, established around the water."

Were the wrongdoing soul to offer all that is on earth as ransom to avoid seeing the punishment, it would not be accepted. The matter hath been decreed in truth, and the command in the Mother Book is sealed.

Know ye that all things belong to God in truth.

In the Mother Book the Cause was ordained. Verily, unto God belongeth all things in truth, and the promise of God is truth. He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and He is God, powerful over all things. Verily the day of the cleaving of heaven, the day of the opening of the Gate, draweth nigh. At that time the All-Merciful permitted His servant to lift the veil from the stations of your knowledge, and your sight on that day, God willing, hath become, in that Book, piercing in truth with truth. O Solace of Mine eyes! Thou art the One Who standeth upon the Alif around thy Lord. Fear not, for verily thou shalt meet Him, and God is well-pleased with thee, and God hath ever been beloved by the believers. O Supreme Remembrance of God! Sprinkle drops of water upon the companions of the right hand until their reckoning is completed - an easy reckoning from the Command within the Command. And say: Return ye to the place of your hearts, content with the Gate and joyous. And pour forth a reflection of water upon the companions of the left hand around the fire until their souls have testified to the decree of the Gate, in truth upon truth, praiseworthy. Say: Return ye to the veils of effacement through the justice of the Gate, and call upon truth, through truth, unto truth with woe. For We shall cause you to taste, by leave of God the Exalted, a fire that was ordained in the Mother Book as a blazing flame. And verily God hath ever been cognizant of His servants in truth with truth. O Concourse of Lights! Swear not by the twilight, nor by the moon when it is full, for verily the Gate hath traversed in the twinkling of an eye rank upon rank of the first and the last ones. The way of God hath been fulfilled in His right, and the Cause hath been decreed in the Mother Book. O servants of the All-Merciful! What aileth you that ye believe not in God? This is naught but a Remembrance from truth with truth, from the Tree of the Friend in the land of mystery, which was made to stand within the precincts of the All-Merciful.

The Surih of the Sun. In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

Say: "What shall be his recompense, if ye be truthful?"

The Command is God's, besides Whom there is no God, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, unto Whom nothing can be compared, the Creator, the Fashioner, the Originator, the Ordainer, and He is the Truth, Who knoweth all things.

Verily, the Remembrance, by God's leave, establisheth the truth through His Word, and abolisheth falsehood through His Word, and He is the Truth at the Point of Fire, having been sent forth from God, the True One.

O people of Paradise! Hear My call from the tongue of this Remembrance, concerning the deeply hidden Secret in the Line, wondrously revealed.

I am God, there is no God but I, the Most High, the Most Great. I have taken a covenant concerning this Youth, even as I took it from all the worlds. He is the Remembrance circling round the Fire from his Lord, and verily he hath been praised circling round the Water.

He is the Blessed Tree on Mount Sinai, which hath grown upon the soil of Paradise in form of glorification and praise.

O Solace of Mine Eyes! Say: Hear, O people of the Throne, My call from this verdant Leaf that hath sprung from this crimson Tree. I am the Secret within the Secret, from the Line within the Line, standing at the Command around the Fire.

O Solace of Mine Eyes! Say: I am the heaven rent asunder before the All-Wise, and I have been inscribed at the Point of Fire.

God hath made the stars the gates of heaven around the Fire, and they have been fixed firmly in truth within the truth.

When We raise you up on the Day of Separation, you shall behold your deeds present before you, and judgment shall be found around the Gate.

O people of earth! Fear God and let not Satan deceive you. For morning hath indeed breathed forth for the obeyed Gate, this Most Great Remembrance, who was witnessed around the Fire.

O Solace of Mine Eyes! God hath placed thee upon the power of dominion, and thou art praised before the All-Merciful.

The polytheists among the people of the Furqan have falsely supposed regarding the Book, uttering vain and deceptive lies.

Thou art none other than the Remembrance of God at the manifest horizon, and thou art indeed beloved before God, the Lord of the Throne.

O people of the two Sanctuaries! Whither do ye go? He is the Remembrance of God and Our Remembrance in truth through truth unto all the worlds.

O Solace of Mine Eyes! God hath ordained the two Sacred Mosques and all around them as signs of thy truth, for thou wert a witness at the Fire.

This Book is a guidance in truth - take ye not any besides the true Remembrance of God as your guardian.

O people of the divine cloud! Hear My call from the Point of the Letter B. God hath revealed unto Me: "I am God, there is no God but I. I have sent down the Book upon this, My Most Great Remembrance, an Arab Youth, that creation might witness that He is the Truth from God, the True One, in truth." Say: "Sufficient is He between Me and him as a witness in truth."

O people of the divine cloud! This Sun hath been made round above the two Mounts, and this Moon hath risen over the two Clouds, and this Star hath revolved above the two Heavens, and this Mountain hath moved upon the two Wings, and this Sea hath surged over the two Earths, and in all the worlds it is naught but according to the decree of the Two Lights.

In all the worlds, He is governed by the law of the Two Luminaries, and verily God, your True Lord, is witness over all things. We have created man from a drop of water which has trickled from the ocean of the rain cloud. Then We ordained for him the path, open unto the Day of Remembrance. He frowned at the truth and spoke unto that which he knew not, uttering words of polytheism through vainglory, consumed by fire. When the Cause cometh, he shall behold the Remembrance magnified in the presence of God, the Most High. Verily this Book was exalted in truth in the scriptures of the ancients, in the Mother Book. And verily this Book was inscribed in truth by the hands of the latter-day scribes in the Preserved Tablet. Perish man! How ungrateful is he toward God and His signs, while God is ever Self-Sufficient, All-Praised. Was he not created from a mere drop of water through time? Doth not man observe the point of beginning, when nothing existed on earth? And God hath power over all things, and God hath knowledge of all things, and God is independent of all creation. We created him from the reflected shadow of this illuminating Sun fixed in the pole of this heaven, and on that Day he was veiled from the Remembrance. When the Stunning Blast cometh, they shall flee from the Cause, finding no refuge, and on that day thou shalt find none praiseworthy except in the presence of the Remembrance. On that Day, the faces of those who have preceded others shall be sealed with love, and the faces of those who turned away shall be sealed with the seal of remoteness, in very truth. God hath judged with truth, and He shall forgive those who have repented and turned in truth unto the Gate. Verily the mercy of the Remembrance in this Book encompasseth all the worlds in very truth. O people of the earth! God's recompense in that Word is truth concerning him who is found guilty, and this is his reward. Thus do We requite the wrongdoers with justice, and verily God wrongeth not mankind by so much as the speck on a date-stone.

Surih of the Leaf

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

They said, "His recompense - \[the recompense of\] one in whose baggage it was found - is that he \[himself\] should be his recompense. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers." Red. Say: O people of the kingdom! Hearken unto My call from this crimson leaf which hath sprouted from the yellowed Branch, kindled from this Blessed Olive Tree in truth with mighty truth. For God, your Lord, He is the True God, and He hath knowledge of all things. Verily I am God, there is no God but I. Worship Me upon the upright line in that Gate which hath dawned from the stream of Glory above Mount Sinai, for it is the Truth by the truth, and there is no path unto Me except through it, and verily it is the Most High, and hath been in the Mother Book a witness. I have taken upon Myself for those who fulfill My Covenant the Covenant of the Remembrance that there is no God but I, the Truth, and I have been in truth the One intended. And I have decreed for those who turn away the breaking of the Covenant from My Covenant, and there is naught for him in truth but the fire of hell in the depths of the Most Great Coffin, and verily God encompasseth all the worlds. And verily God is the Truth, there is no God but He. I have not revealed in the mystery of this Book a single letter of the Most Great Mystery from that Most High Gate, and He is God, the Knower of all things. O people of the earth! Turn ye unto the Most Great reward from before the Gate to the Gate of Truth, the Mystery of God, the Most High, which hath been in the Mother Book witnessed. Say: Praise be to God Who hath sent down the Book unto me in truth upon pure truth apart from all men, and there is no God but He, and He is God, exalted and great. O ye believers! Fear God and interpret not a single letter of that Most Great Book except according to the truth by the truth, in accordance with the Quran and the Tradition which God hath placed among you, for verily it is from the hidden mystery inscribed in the Great Tablet with God, the Most High, and hath been in truth recorded. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say: I have returned the narrative concerning the mystery of Moses Who conversed with God by the leave of God, the Most High, and He is God, powerful over all things. O people of Glory! Hear ye the call of God in the inscribed mystery from these crimson leaves which have fallen from the Throne upon that white leaf in prostration upon the yellow dust. Verily we are God's and verily He is the Truth, there is no God but He, and He is God, exalted and great. Say: Verily I am the Caller in the Fire by the leave of God, Lord of the Throne and of the cloud of unknowing. Verily I am the servant of God, so remove thy sandals from both feet, for thou art in the holy valley in that Gate, encompassed. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Verily God hath chosen thee for Myself, so hearken unto what is revealed unto thee from before God, the Most High, and He is God, mighty and wise. Verily I am God, there is no God but I, so worship Me at the Pole of Fire at the center of the equatorial line, and establish prayer for My remembrance in truth, for verily I am God, there is no God but He, and I have been in truth eternally true. And say: Verily I am the Most Great Hour, it cometh; the idolaters would almost hide it. And verily I am the Most Great Word; God hath made me mighty in dominion and sovereignty. And verily God recompenseth all who ascend unto the Most High Gate, and verily God is witness unto all things. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! The people ask thee concerning Dhu'l-Qarnayn. Say: Yea \[...\]

Say: Verily God hath been witness unto all things. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! The people ask thee concerning Dhu'l-Qarnayn. Say: Yea, by my Lord! I am indeed the Master of the two Beginnings in the two Cycles, and I am He of the sublime Horn in both Bodies, and I am the Fire in the two Waters, and I am the Water in the two Fires. Let them hearken unto My call from these two Mounts. Verily We established him in the earth and bestowed upon him from the Name of the Remembrance -- this Arabian Youth in truth, by the truth -- a letter, until We gathered unto him the means of all things as a cause.

Say: When I followed the Causer, I journeyed until I reached the setting of the sun, and found it setting in a spring of pure water. And there I beheld a people from the cloud-realm around the spring who were unto God, the Most High, among those who prostrate. They spoke unto me a letter from the hidden knowledge inscribed above the line, and I spoke unto them a symbol from the veiled mystery.

Then I followed the Command until I reached the rising-place of the sun, and saw it rising from a spring of camphor upon a people from the cloud-realm unto whom We had given naught of the mystery save the sign of Unity as a secret. They said: "Verily God, your Lord, is in truth the Truth, like unto Him there is nothing." I said unto them: "He is the Truth, there is no God but He, and He is God, the Most High, the Great."

Then I followed the Truth until I reached between the two barriers between the two seas, and found around them a people who behold not God except with things and before them, and I saw them in these two seas recorded among the people of the fish. They said in truth unto the Most Great Remembrance: "Verily Majuj from among the people of compulsion and Yajuj from among the people of delegation have wrought corruption without truth in the Book of the Command between the two commands. Shall we then render unto thee tribute on condition that thou establish between us and them a criterion which hath been written in truth, by the truth, upon the truth?"

Then I said unto them: "Verily God is my Lord, there is no God but He. He hath empowered me in every command and I desire naught save by His leave, and He is God, powerful over all things." O people of the earth! Aid yourselves with the power of sheets of iron until the earth and all thereon are purified from these polytheists, the people of the two fires, for the Expected Proof, the Alif standing between the two commands. Then pour upon yourselves from the fire of heated iron from this Most Great Gate that ye may be mighty in warfare in the religion of God, the Most High.

Verily God hath made the Remembrance between you a mighty barrier in truth, by the truth. When His appointed time in the Command is fulfilled, by God the Truth, He shall die in truth, and He is from the Truth unto the Truth, witnessed in the Mother Book with the Truth. And verily We have left the polytheists on that day surging in fire upon fire according to what God hath ordained, concealed in the Mother Book. Verily those whom allusions veil from the Gate are unable to hear a letter of the mystery revealed from the wondrous line as witnessed. Do the polytheists reckon that the Remembrance knoweth not their position in the Command? Nay! He is the Witness from God unto all the worlds. Verily the Remembrance is truth by the truth.

Verily the Remembrance is the Truth of truth, and Paradise hath been inscribed, in very truth, for the believers from among the people of this Gate. Verily the Remembrance is the Truth from God, and for the idolaters hath been ordained the heat of the Fire on the Day of Return. And when the idolaters ask thee "Who hath sent thee to us with this mighty and exalted Cause?" say: "God, the Originator of the heavens and earth, through His proof, the Expected Qa'im. Verily He is the Truth, and I am but one of His servants whom He hath subjected to His dominion. Therefore submit ye to God's Cause, for verily God hath power over all things." And say unto the people of blindness: "From clay hath God created you, and unto it shall He return you, and from it shall He bring you forth unto this mighty Gate once again, in truth, by the truth, gloriously."

So he began with their bags before his brother's bag, then brought it out of his brother's bag. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother by the law of the King except that God willed it. We raise in degrees whom We will, and above every possessor of knowledge is One who is All-Knowing.

Al-Matas. This is a remembrance of thy Lord's mercy unto His preceding servants who were pledged to the Straight Path.

O people of the earth! Hear My call from the Remembrance. God hath revealed unto Me: "Verily, I am God; there is no God but Me, and this Remembrance is in truth My path exalted, which hath been inscribed in the Mother Book."

Follow then God's hidden mystery concealed within the mystery raised by the line above the line, veiled by the Sun of Oneness.

This indeed is the Truth, God's path in the heavens and earth, and He, the Most High, hath ever been praised by Truth and creation.

O Solace of Mine eyes! Say: Thou hast returned the discourse of Moses from Sinai's Mount in that radiant Light manifested. When thy Lord called thee from the sacred valley nigh the blessed water, We showed thee of His signs in the light round about the fire most great.

O Solace of Mine eyes! Rend asunder the veils of allusion from the Pharaoh of men's souls, for they stand at the gate of God's ancient mystery having been inscribed as transgressors against Truth.

He claimed falsely in the Prison Land: "I am God's Most Great Gate," and God sufficeth as witness against him and unto the Truth.

Say: Endure Our chastisement in this world and the next, for God's punishment hath indeed been grievous in the depths of the Prison.

When the overwhelming event cometh from before the Gate by God's leave, soon shall souls witness what God hath ordained concerning the decree of the two waters.

We wrong not mankind by an atom's weight, nor by the smallest measure.

No believer who feareth his Lord regarding the station of the Gate but shall have inscribed for him an abode of eternity in the Garden of Paradise.

No soul that waxeth proud against the Gate but shall have inscribed for it the iron fire and the tree of Hell by decree of the Book.

When they ask thee concerning the Hour by the Hour of Manifestation, say: Its knowledge is with God in truth, and the knowledge of all things hath been inscribed in the Mother Book.

Say: We have written the Hour in the crimson scroll within the grasp of that Greatest Sword with golden water upon the tablet of the heart by leave of God, the Most High - and He is God, the Mighty, the Ancient.

The idolaters on the Day of Remembrance shall tarry but an hour of the night appointed.

There shall the denier of the Gate say: "Would that I were dust beneath the earth!"

That is the Day of Truth; so let him who will take unto the Gate his return.

O Solace of Mine eyes! Say: I am the Mighty Tiding that was mentioned in the Mother Book.

Say: All have differed concerning Me, yet I have not differed regarding the Gate in truth upon truth, and God the Truth sufficeth as witness.

We have made the earth a bed spread over other earths, and this lofty mountain as pegs above all mountains.

Say: I have manifested Myself among you in pairs, yet in truth as One.

\[...\]

Say: Verily I have manifested Myself among you in pairs with truth as single ones, and upon the pillars with truth in pairs, that ye may bear witness unto God in oneness at the Center of the Gate in hosts. Say: Verily My name in the Mother Book hath been the Seven Strong Heavens, and I am the Lamp in the horizons that hath been, in truth, upon the truth, blazing. And verily We have sent down from the Gate the Water of Life upon the depths of the heart, abundant, that ye may bring forth therefrom the love of the Gate for the Gate as vegetation. O people of the Divine Cloud! Plant ye in the soil of hearts, from the gardens of patience and love, dense foliage. By God, the Truth! Verily the Day of the Gate hath been for all the worlds an appointed time. And when the Trump is blown for the Gate, the people shall come around the Gate in throngs. And We have set forth everything in that Gate in writing. Verily the people of the Gate hear no idle talk, but only from God, the Truth, "Peace and Peace." And verily We have ordained for the God-fearing, from the gardens in the Blessed Tree kindled around the Fire, the speech of the Bird soaring in the atmosphere of heaven by God's leave - and He is God Who hath ever been, in truth, praised. Verily this Gate hath been like the Sealed Cup in all the Tablets, numbered round about Love. Verily this is the letter Kaf in the Word of Command that hath been concealed in the mystery of the letter Nun. And God hath ordained for the Remembrance angels around the Gate, commanded by permission. Among them are those who draw forth forcefully upon the White Corner, who have been, in truth, stationed; And among them are those who spread forth upon the Yellow Corner, who have been, in truth, by the truth, observed; And among them are those who swim upon the Green Corner, who have been, in truth, glorified; And among them are those who race forward upon this Red Corner, who have been, in truth, by the truth, outstripped.

They said, "If he be a thief, a brother of his stole before." But Joseph kept it within himself and revealed it not unto them. He said: "Ye are in worse case, and God knoweth best that which ye describe."

O thou who art the God beside Whom there is none other God, the Peerless, the All-Compelling! Thine are the most excellent titles, and Thou art, in truth, the Most High, the Most Great. We, verily, did cause thee to descend from the Throne above on the night of Power unto thy mother's womb, and on that day thou wast, in truth, prostrate before God, the Most High, upon the Throne, and praised among all people.

O ye that dwell on earth! This Remembrance is verily the hidden Secret between the lines, which hath been, in truth, concealed in truth. This indeed is the Light at the Dawning-place of Manifestation which hath been luminous upon the Mount. This indeed is the Life in the Mother Book which hath been witnessed round about the Fire. This indeed is the Ancient Cipher which hath been exalted with God. This indeed is the Day of Separation and the Day of Union which hath been, in truth, appointed. This indeed is the Water in the River Euphrates which hath been, in truth, made to overflow. This indeed is the Fire round about the Mount which hath been, in truth, made manifest. This indeed is the Speaker from his Lord, Who hath been sought after by the believers in the depths of the sea. This indeed is the Symbol of the Beloved which hath been inscribed in the Mother Book. This indeed is the Mystery in the Friend which hath been intended in the Glorious Tablet. This indeed is the Form with three sides which hath been engraved round about the Fire. This indeed is the Temple with four sides which hath been praised round about the Water. This indeed is the Standard in the Heaven, and We have ordained for the God-fearing beneath its shade at the Gate an entrance, in truth and by truth inhabited. This indeed hath been the Destroyer of the ancients gathered together by God's leave, the Most High. This indeed is the Mystery concerning the latter ones which hath been witnessed round about the Fire. This indeed is the Truth on the Day of Judgment concerning the people of Heaven which hath been witnessed round about the Fire. We, verily, have ordained the heaven to be raised up in truth and by truth for His remembrance. And the mountains have been, in truth, scattered. And the stars have been, in truth, effaced. And the earth hath been spread out round about the water. This is that the people might know the truth of the Remembrance from the All-Informed One - He is God, the Mighty, the Wise. We, verily, have ordained the tempests in a letter of the Gate to blow tempestuously, and the scatterers to scatter abroad, and the bestowers to bestow bountifully, and the separators to separate distinctly, that the people might witness concerning the truth of the Light above the Mount round about the Fire as a remembrance.

O Solace of Mine eyes! Say: I am indeed the Man Who hath been mentioned in the Mother Book. Say: I am indeed the Water in the Cup of Manifestation which hath been made pure as camphor. Say: I am indeed the Feeder in the path of God, the Most High, and I have been, by God, the Ancient One, praised. By God! I have given unto the poor at this Gate, from between the lines, from the hidden Secret above the line which hath been concealed round about the Fire.

By God, thou hast been, through God the Ancient, most praiseworthy! By God, thou hast given unto the poor, between the lines of this Gate, from the most hidden mystery above the line which was concealed round about the Fire. And thou hast given unto the orphans from the anointing waters contained in a most delicate glass chalice, a drop from the ocean which hath been filtered from that selfsame ocean. Verily, I am the Giver unto the night-travelers from among the people of the divine cloud, from the water that dwelleth in the chalice of manifestation, as though it were a piece of ice which hath been, in the Mother Book, made cool. This indeed is the Cup-Bearer in Paradise from your Lord, the Most Merciful - a pure drink. And this indeed is the Truth in the moving circle which hath been inscribed round about the Fire with the name of Fire.

They said: "O exalted one! He has an aged father, so take one of us in his place. Indeed we see thee to be of the beneficent ones." Alif Lam Mim Ta. This is the Path of God in the divine cloud, the Mystery inscribed upon the Mystery above the lines, which God has concealed in the Mother Book, veiled behind the veil. Verily We have made the Remembrance the Most Great Word in the Mother Book in truth, and the decree concerning his station has been inscribed at the Point of Fire. We have verily ordained for him a station in truth - I am He and He is I, except that He is He, and I am the Proof of God unto all the worlds, and I have been, in truth and by the truth, praiseworthy. O people of the Throne! Fear God, for there is no path for anyone except for those who are written as being among the people of the Gate around the Fire. O Solace of Mine Eyes! Say: Ye will not anything unless God willeth it in all things, for verily He hath ever been, in truth, mighty and wise. This indeed is the Straight Line between the two kingdoms, and it hath been extended above the Throne. One of them dwelleth in the clouds of might around the Mystery inscribed in the mention of the Fire, circumscribed. And the other, in a land by the Euphrates, teacheth the people the mystery of the veils, and he is concealed in the fourfold veil around the water. Say: O people of the earth! Circle round this Straight Line around the Fire, for it is the Truth by the truth, and hath been praised in the Mother Book. Learn not except through the Gate and from the Gate, for he is the One Who speaketh in truth from God, besides Whom there is no God, and He is God, Who hath ever been, in truth, exalted and wise. O Solace of Mine Eyes! Flash forth with a gleam of light upon the vision of the people of insight, who before the Gate have ever been prostrate before God, the Most High. O people of the earth! God hath gathered together the sun and the moon in the mystery by the mystery within My breast in truth, so reject not the Book lest the sun be eclipsed for you and the moon be darkened for you. Nay, nay! There is no refuge in anything and unto Me is the escape, which hath ever been, in truth and by the truth, the destination. Verily on that Day unto your Lord shall be the return. O Solace of Mine Eyes! Say: I am verily the Resurrection at the Pole of Heaven from the Most Great Hour. By God! He will question you concerning Me regarding the Cause around the Fire, and I have ever been, in truth by the truth, witnessed. O Solace of Mine Eyes! Move not thy tongue concerning anything to hasten the Most Great Command of God regarding thine own self of truth, for upon God hath ever been its explanation in truth by the truth, and thou art, in truth, upon the Straight Path, upright around the Fire. Hear, O people of the Throne, My call from every direction from this Gate - God, there is no God but He. I have sworn in truth by My Soul that no soul magnifieth the Cause in this Most Great Gate except that he is, in My presence, among the people of Paradise, inscribed in truth. And no soul hath demeaned the Cause except that it is incumbent upon God to burn him with the Most Great Fire in the depths of the coffin, and the decree in the Mother Book hath ever been severe. O ye believers! The Most Great Mystery of God, with God your True Lord, hath ever been mighty in the Mother Book. O Solace of Mine Eyes! Say: I am verily the letter Nun in the Pen according to the decree of the Book, and I have been inscribed in the Mystery of the Gate.

In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate!

The decree in the Mother Book has indeed been severe. O believers! The Most Great Mystery of God, before God your True Lord, has been mighty in the Mother Book. O Solace of Mine Eyes! Say: I am the letter Nun in the Pen according to the decree of the Book, and I have been inscribed in the mystery of the Gate. I am the Great Reward for all the believers, and I am the Mighty Creation that has been great in the Mother Book. I am the verses in the heavenly scrolls that have been written in truth.

When Our verses are recited to the idolaters, they fall upon their faces as though they were a people who know not God and His verses, save a little. And when We remove the veil from their eyes regarding the Sacred House, they circle around the Remembrance as though they were sleeping in the House, confined within their own limitations, and they look not to God their True Lord, even for a moment.

Some of them turn to others in the fire and speak falsely about the Remembrance, and their recompense with God shall be naught but the severe fire of hell. And when God removes the veil from your eyes, you will be found prostrating at the Gate of God. Whosoever denies this utterance, We shall punish them in the fire twice over, and they shall have no helper in the hereafter.

O people of the Throne! Hear My call from this Remembrance, the Point of the letter Ba, which has been witnessed around the fire. He is an Arab youth who has been concealed around the fire in the Mother Book. God has revealed to Me in truth within the House of Kaaba: "Verily, I am God, there is no God but I. I have chosen you for Myself and selected the Remembrance for yourself. No soul that obeys you in the path of the Gate but shall have the reward of the hereafter inscribed for them in truth."

And no soul that turns away from this Most Great Word and His true Book but I have decreed for them in the Mother Book every punishment, and the command of God cannot be turned back. The idolaters among the people of the Furqan have pointed with their eyes at the Remembrance untruthfully, and these shall be recorded among the companions of the coffin in the depths of the fire.

Say: I am indeed the True Word around the water and the Striking Word around the fire upon the pole of the realm of glory, by God's leave have I been praised in truth. We have sent to the people of Ad the wind of allusion away from the Gate during seven nights and eight days, which has been numbered in the Mother Book.

When the decree of the Remembrance is fulfilled, the Book has decreed according to the mighty event by God's leave, and He is God, powerful over all things. O Solace of Mine Eyes! Say: O noble Al-Hasan Al-Husayni! God has appointed for His Remembrance in every condition an elder one great in truth. Take Me as thy station in the holy throne, for We shall show thee inscribed in the Mother Book by the name of Ba.

The Surah of the Declination

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate!

God forbid that we should take except him with whom we found our property; indeed, we would then be unjust. Kaf-Ha-Ya-'Ayn-Sad. Make mention of thy Lord's mercy at the rising and the setting of the sun. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise. Hearken unto that which thy Lord revealeth unto thee from the Point of Fire, as God hath ordained upon the exalted Center of Direction. Verily He is God, there is no God but Him, the Protector of the believers, and He is God, the All-Knowing, the Ancient. O Solace of Mine eyes! Hearken unto My call from around the Tomb in truth within thy breast, by that which God hath revealed unto Me: "Verily I am God, there is no God but Me, so worship Me around that Most Great House," for thus was it inscribed in the Mother Book upon the clay of the Mosque of Khayf. O Concourse of Light! Hear ye the call of God from the tongue of the Remembrance, this Arabian Youth. God is the Truth, there is no God but Him. Verily I created thee in truth for Myself, and I fashioned thy name above the holy horizon with My Most Exalted Name, and I have ever been, in truth, from ancient times. We have written, by God's leave, above the center line, concerning the mention of God's Most Great Name, concealed in the mystery of mysteries, which hath been inscribed round about the Fire. O people of the City! By the True God, this Remembrance is the Truth, and He standeth upon the pure path of God, the Ancient One, making mention of God's Most Exalted Name, and hath ever been established around the Fire as the Self-Subsisting. O ye believers! The Remembrance hath come unto you from your Lord, and We have ordained healing in His Name for the hearts, and the decree hath been written around the line by leave of God, the Truth. Say: The bounty is with Me, and I have ever been, in truth, upright upon the Most True Balance. O people of polytheism! Hath God given you leave to speak falsehood concerning this servant, or do ye fabricate lies against God, the Truth? Wait ye, for God hath ever been witness over all worlds. And thou art not engaged in any matter, nor readest thou the Quran concerning anything, nor do the workers perform any deed, but We are witness over them in the Mother Book. Nothing escapeth God's knowledge, and He, the Truth, hath ever been knowing of all things. We have sent down in this Book the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and there is nothing whose decree hath not been inscribed therein in detail. God hath delivered the friends of the Remembrance from the grief of fear, and He is God Who hath ever been knowing of all things. Those who have believed in the Most Great Word in pure truth, theirs is glad tidings in this world's life and in the Hereafter - there is no changing the command of God, the Most High, and this is the mighty triumph that hath been concealed in the Mother Book around the Gate. Let not the words of the believers concerning the Limited One grieve thee, for might belongeth wholly unto God, the Ancient One, in truth. His are all who are in the heavens and who are in the earth, in truth, and He is God, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. Those who call upon aught else besides God follow naught but conjecture, and these are they who have been gathered in the depths of the coffin within the Fire. God hath ordained the night for rest \[...\]

And these are they who shall be gathered in the depths of the coffin amidst flames. God hath ordained the night for rest, and in the Mother Book hath decreed the day to be illuminating. They say God hath taken unto Himself a son - glory be unto Him! He is self-sufficient, independent of all things. He is the Creator of whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth by His command, and God hath power over all things. Verily those who fabricate falsehood against God, their abode, by decree of the Book, shall be in the land of fire, upon the word of fire, as hath been inscribed in the Mother Book. Recite unto them the story of Noah whom We delivered, together with those who were with him, and verily We drowned the wrongdoers in the waters of the sea, in the surging, bitter ocean. And verily We sent forth, upon the Most Great Word, Moses and Aaron unto Pharaoh and his chiefs with clear signs, that men might know that God doth encompass all things. And verily We sent forth the two Gates before, upon that same Word - among them were those who believed and those who denied, and God is witness over all things. Then the idolaters falsely said unto them: "Have ye come to turn us away from that which we found our fathers following?" while they themselves were secure in their earthly falsehood. Say unto these idolaters: "Do ye believe in part of the Book and deny part thereof? Wait ye therefore, for God hath truly prepared for the wrongdoers among you the fire of hell and the stone of Sijjin, and God is exalted and great" - unless they repent unto God in the path of this Most Great Remembrance, for verily God is forbearing and forgiving toward His servants. And when the sorcerers were gathered at the appointed time, He rendered them powerless through the Most Great Word, for God hath not decreed for the unbelievers any way against the believers. God shall soon vindicate the truth through His words and bring the sinners to naught through His signs, for He is God, the Truth, and knoweth all things. O Solace of Mine eyes! Verily the tree of Pharaoh is exalted in the Gate - cast it into the fire and rely upon God, for He is the Subduer of His servants, and God is witness over all things. And verily We revealed unto Moses and his brother through that Word, saying: "Establish for the people of the land in Egypt dwellings of oneness for the Most Great Remembrance of God, the Ever-Living" - and God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. And God hath made it a Qiblih for mankind - therefore perform all prayers therein and give glad tidings unto God's sincere servants thereof, for verily it hath been inscribed in the Mother Book as a symbol of the Remembrance, in truth, upon the truth. And verily God delivered the believers in the Remembrance through the Most Great Remembrance, and decreed drowning for Pharaoh and his hosts in the sea, and We heard his words at the moment of drowning: "I believe in God, the Truth, there is no God but He" - and God is witness over all things. O ye believers! Recite from the Book at the beginning of noon: "Glory be to God! There is no God but God! Praise be to God Who hath not taken unto Himself either mate or son, Who hath no partner in sovereignty, Who hath no protector out of weakness - and magnify Him with all magnificence!" O people of the Throne! Hear My call from the center of the Sun that dawneth from the dawning-place of the Gate: "Verily I am God, there is no God but Me. I have singled out in truth the Remembrance of the Remembrance at the dayspring of the Sun \[...\]"

O people of the Throne! Hear My call from the center of the Sun rising from the Orient of the Gate! Verily, I am God, there is no God but I. In truth I have singled out the mention of the Remembrance at the rise of the sun, its setting, and at its zenith. Invoke blessings upon Him as the All-Merciful invokes blessings upon His servant, while the angels circle round the Remembrance with His remembrance. And He is God, the Witness over all things. And He is God, Who encompasses all worlds. Verily, We have sent down from heaven the realities of sustenance that people might know the truth of the Remembrance. And thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ regarding the truth of the Remembrance. And He is God, the All-Knowing of all things. O Solace of Mine eyes! Say: God forbid that We should take anything on the Day of Resurrection save from those in whom We find the goods of Divine Unity from the Gate, this in the center of the fire surrounding his heart. For verily then, by God, We would not be acting with true justice.

The Surah of Kaf

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

When they despaired of him, they conferred privately. The eldest of them said: "Know ye not that your father hath taken from you a solemn pledge in God's name, and how, before this, ye failed in your duty with respect to Joseph? Therefore, I will not depart from this land until my father giveth me leave or God judgeth for me, and He is the best of judges. Return ye to your father and say: 'O our father! Verily thy son hath committed theft, and we bear witness only to what we know, and we could not guard against the unforeseen.'"

Know thou that the Most Great Remembrance of God was inscribed upon the first line above the third line of the fourth talisman which was concealed in the Mother Book upon the second of the twelve lines around the Fire. We have indeed revealed unto thee from the mystery of the Pen, that the people might be witnesses to the verses of God and His Remembrance, in truth and by the truth.

O ye believers! If ye be in doubt concerning that which God hath revealed unto Our servant in truth, then ask those who read the Book before you, for verily God hath concealed the name of the Remembrance in every Book within the Point of Fire.

O people of the earth! Be not of those who denied the Messengers after the Book, for God hath decreed the word of chastisement against those who deny the Most Great Remembrance, and this decree hath been ordained in the Mother Book.

When the idolaters believed in the Remembrance, We removed from them, by the Most Great Truth, the humiliating torment in this world, and We granted them enjoyment for a time, as decreed in the Book.

Had We willed, all the people of the earth would have believed in the truth, wholly and entirely. No soul can believe in the Remembrance except by God's leave, and God hath ordained the word of defilement for those who believe not in God, according to the decree of the Book. The Remembrance hath been witnessed before God, the Most High.

Say: Look ye in the heavens and the earth, and call your witnesses besides the Most Great Remembrance. Is there any rich one save God, the Truth? Glorified be God, far above what the wrongdoers say, with most high glorification.

Say: Await ye the chastisement from God in truth, for We have been witness with all the worlds. Verily, I am the Truth, the Remembrance in truth, and I have been witness over thee in truth.

O people of the earth! If ye be in doubt concerning My Remembrance, then worship not anything besides God, your True Lord, for God hath created you and sustained you and will cause you to die in truth, and unto Him is the return through the Most Great Severance, and this decree hath been written in the Mother Book.

Turn your faces toward the Kaaba, purely for God, the Most High, and He is God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

O people of the earth! Why worship ye besides God that which can neither benefit nor harm you? Verily God is the Truth, your Creator, and He is independent of all the worlds.

Verily God withholdeth harm from whomsoever He willeth, and none can reverse God's command of truth. He is God, merciful to the believers.

O ye believers! The Remembrance hath come unto you in truth from God, the Truth. Whoso is guided, verily God, the Lord of the worlds, hath guided him to the truth; and whoso goeth astray, verily he goeth astray only against himself. God wrongeth not the worlds by so much as the speck on a date-stone.

O people of the Throne! Hear My call from around the Fire. God hath revealed unto Me in truth that He is the Truth, there is no God but He. Whoso followeth the Remembrance in truth hath followed Me in truth, by the Most Great Truth.

Verily God doth not wrong anyone amongst all created things by so much as a date-stone's skin. O people of the Throne! Hearken unto My call from around the Fire. God hath revealed unto Me in truth; verily He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. Whoso followeth the Remembrance in truth hath verily followed Me in the Most Great Truth, and God is witness to the believers. O Solace of Mine eyes! Be thou patient with God's decree concerning thyself in truth, for We judge with truth between all peoples by God's leave, the Most High, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise. This is a Book whose verses have been perfected in truth, then expounded from the presence of the Wondrous One, beside Whom there is no other God, and He is God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O people of the earth! Fear ye God regarding this crimson Leaf dyed with the Most Great hue. Worship none but God with sincere devotion in the Most Great Truth. Verily I am the Warner with the Most Great Justice, and concerning the decisive decree by the judgment of the Book I have been in truth a Bearer of Glad-Tidings upon the truth. O ye believers! Seek forgiveness from your Lord, the True One, beside Whom there is no God, upon the Straight Path. Verily God is your True Lord, possessed of grace towards mankind. He is the Truth, and He is God, the Knower of all things. O people of the earth! Fear ye God concerning a Day whereon unto God, the True One, shall be your return, upon the Path from this Gate, and verily God, your True Lord, is powerful over all things. God hath created no creature in earth or in the heavens but He hath ordained its sustenance from this heaven. We verily know its habitation and its repository, and the Remembrance hath been, in the Mother Book, a witness over you. He it is Who hath created the heavens upon the line of earth and hath ordained the earth upon the measure of the heavens in six days, and He is God, the Encompasser of all things. We verily have suspended the Throne upon the water and the air around the Fire, and the Fire in the pivot of water, that men might witness in the water of wine, after the effacement of two thirds, the purification of one third in the mystery of this Book by the decree of the Gate, and He is God, the Encompasser of all things. God hath ordained resurrection for all souls after death that We may test which of them hath been witnessed before the Remembrance. O ye believers! God hath decreed in truth concerning the kurr of water that after true severance it is pure and purifying, for the letter K hath returned in a circle to the pivot of its zone in this Gate, and the decree hath been determined in the Mother Book. O ye believers! Speak not against Me the word of associating partners with God after the truth, for the Qur'an aforetime hath conveyed unto you the praised decree of the Gate concerning the truth. By your Lord! This Book is verily the Qur'an from aforetime. Fear ye God and deny not part of the Book after accepting another part thereof. Verily your Lord God is the Self-Sufficient, and He is God, witness over all things. When We cause man to taste mercy he rejoiceth therein, and when We take vengeance upon him in truth he becometh wroth with Us, as though he were halted upon the path of rejection. Be not thou in distress concerning what people imagine about the Cause, for from thy Lord, the True One, the decree of the ancients is made binding upon thee, and He is God, the Knower of all things. Or do they say "He hath fabricated it"? Say: Then bring ye a single letter like unto it \[...\]

He is God, Who has been Knowing of all things. Do they say "He has fabricated it"? Say: Then bring forth a single letter like unto it and call upon your witnesses apart from the Remembrance. Glory be to God, far above what the wrongdoers assert with great haughtiness! And if you are unable to produce its like, then know that God has sent it down through His knowledge as pure truth. There is no God but He, the Mighty. And He is God, Who has ever been All-Wise.

Whoso desires this world, We shall give him justly the like thereof; and whoso desires the next world, We shall give him bountifully double thereof. Verily God has power over all things.

O people of the earth! The Remembrance is assuredly truth upon truth, even as you speak with pure hearing. And God suffices as a witness to His Remembrance, in truth upon truth. And He is God, Who has ever encompassed all worlds.

O people of the cloud! Hear the call of God in this Commentary from the Water Point that flows from the Camphor Spring, in truth upon powerful truth, wondrously.

O concourse of lights! Know ye not that God has ordained no path for your souls save after effacement from all else but God? Purify your souls for God, your Lord, in truth upon truth, in intimate communion.

Know ye not that your father, the Most Great Master, took from you the Covenant in the realm of the atoms regarding His Most Great Word? And here you have been neglectful regarding Joseph. I shall not depart until God grants permission to me and to my Imam. He is the Truth Who has judged between me and you in truth. And He is God, Who has ever been Self-Sufficient, All-Praised.

And when the people returned to the Gate at the mention of this Most Great Remembrance of God, they said: "O Remembrance of God! The sign of love has been effaced from our souls and we witness naught save what we know. And verily God, your Lord, the Truth - there is no God but He - has ever been, in truth, the Guardian of the unseen."

Surah of the Most Great, In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful

Ask of the township wherein We dwelt, and of the caravan with which We travelled hither. We, verily, speak the truth. Contemplate thou the remembrance of God, the Most Great, in the mention of the hidden line. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and He is God, the Mighty from ancient times. O people of glory, hear ye My call from these submissive hearts in the remembrance of God at the Most Great Gate. God hath verily revealed unto Me upon the Most Great Mount that this Path of Ali is a truth upheld by the denizens of the heavens and earth, and it hath been concealed in the hidden mystery above the line. O peoples of the two Iraqs! The son of Muhammad Ali was not among you one from the East, nor from the West, nor from the sea, nor from the land, but God created him from His light and treasured him in the hidden mystery upon the Most Great Truth with the Straight Line upon the Most Great Throne. And He is God, the All-Knowing. Say: Verily, I am the Truth from God, your Lord. No soul hath followed Me in pure truth except that it is incumbent upon Me to be its helper in the land of gathering, with the sincere truth. And verily God's promise to you hath been fulfilled in the Mother Book. O Concourse of Lights! Hear ye My call from around the Gate which hath been established straight upon the Straight Line around the Fire. God hath verily revealed unto Me in truth that this Remembrance is the Truth, and He is the Truth, Who hath ever been praised upon the Throne before the Lord. Is one who standeth upon a clear proof from his Lord, with such a Most Great Book of truth, equal to one whose promised lot is the Fire in truth, and whom God hath not granted any proof from His presence of aught? Which of these two souls is more worthy of security, if ye truly know God, the Praiseworthy. And who is more unjust than he who hath fabricated falsehood against the Remembrance? God, the Truth, hath cursed him, as have the angels and the believers, all together in truth. Such souls shall not escape on earth, nor shall they find for themselves any helper on the Day of Judgment in truth. And they shall have no protector besides God, the Exalted, in truth on that Day. The parable of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf. Are the two waters alike - this, sweet and pleasant, and that, salt and bitter? And verily God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, is witness over all things. O people! Fear ye God and worship none but Him, being sincere unto Him in religion, for I fear for you the supreme chastisement on the Day of Judgment, according to God's wondrous decree which, with God and His loved ones, hath ever been nigh unto the truth. O people of the earth! By God, the Truth, the Remembrance desireth naught save God's true command for your own selves, and his reward resteth with God, his Lord, in the Mother Book, by the hands of the Lord, and hath been inscribed in truth at the Point of Fire. Say: I desire no recompense from anyone. My reward is with God in that Book - the reward of this Book which hath been inscribed in truth in the Mother Book. O people of the earth! Whosoever helpeth the Remembrance, God will help him in every matter, and verily God, your true Lord, encompasseth all things. O Crimson Leaf! Hearken unto that which thy Lord revealeth unto thee from around this White Leaf. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him.

Verily God, your true Lord, hath ever encompassed all things. O crimson leaf! Hearken unto that which thy Lord revealeth unto thee from around this white leaf. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Verily the mention of this Remembrance in truth is like My mention in all the Book by My hands, and hath been inscribed in truth. Hear ye His call from around this Fire in its mystery, for He is God, there is no God but Him, the Lord of the Throne and the Seat, there is no God but Him, naught is like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.

Or do they say "He hath fabricated it"? Say: If I have fabricated it, then upon me be the guilt as recorded in the Mother Book in truth. We, verily, have revealed unto all the Prophets in truth through the path of this Remembrance with pure justice, and God hath ever encompassed the worlds.

We, verily, revealed unto Noah, saying: "Build thou the ark in Our name." When Our command came, We said: "Embark therein with the believers in God." But none believed in truth save a few of the faithful.

And say at the time of embarking: "In the name of God, the Most Exalted, be its course and its mooring. Verily God is my Lord in truth; worship ye Him, for He is the Most Exalted, the Most Great."

When We caused him to embark in the Ship of the Remembrance, We commanded the winds around it, and We caused the sea to surge with waves like mighty mountains by God's leave, the Most Exalted, for God hath ever been powerful over all things.

And Noah called unto his son who had withdrawn apart, but Satan had led him astray from his Lord's command to hold fast to aught else but this Most Great Remembrance, and thus was he among those separated and drowned in the surging sea.

O earth! Swallow up thy waters after the rains of heaven, and contain the waters in the depths of this soil, for God hath decreed the matter through His Remembrance, and the Truth was established upon Mount Judi on the tenth line of the Arabic month in truth, and God hath ever been witness over all things.

These are among the tidings of the unseen which We reveal unto thee that people may bear witness to the Most Great Remembrance after the Book in the Most Great Truth, and verily God hath ever encompassed what ye do.

O concourse! Hear My call from this Most Great Word assembled from the letters of God's Most Great Name. God hath revealed unto Me: "I am God, there is no God but Him. No soul hath visited the Remembrance in truth except it hath visited God, the Lord, in the Most Great Truth above the Throne, and God hath ever been witness over all things."

O people of the earth! The grace of this Gate in the Mother Book is at the mightiest level above the first line in truth, and hath been inscribed in truth. We, verily, delivered the Prophet Hud and those with him through the Most Great Remembrance upon that mighty Word, and thus was it witnessed before the All-Merciful in the Mother Book.

O ye believers! I bear witness before God, and do ye bear witness, that I have ever been upon the pure religion in the Mother Book from the day the heavens and earth were created in truth, witnessed in truth.

O ye believers! Seek forgiveness of your Lord, Who is none other than God, and turn ye all unto God, that ye may be forgiven through the Most Great Remembrance upon the straight path.

Turn ye all unto God, that ye may attain, through this Most Great Remembrance, unto the upright Path and be forgiven. Verily God hath power over all things, and He is God Who encompasseth all the worlds. Verily God is witness unto all things, and He is God Who standeth in need of none of His creation. O peoples of the earth! Fear ye God in this Remembrance, and utter not concerning Him any words of falsehood and delusion, for verily God hath prepared for those who falsely accuse the Remembrance a grievous fire in the depths of the tomb on the Day of Resurrection. O peoples of the earth! This is the very Remembrance of God Who hath been sent down unto you in truth, and God is the Truth, and God sufficeth as a witness unto what I say, in very truth. Say: God hath revealed unto Me in this Most Great Commentary concerning this Verse which blazeth with the fire of the hearts, by His command, and verily God hath knowledge of all things. I am God, there is no God but Me. Ask of the blessed village wherein We dwelt, which is the Word whereunto We turned from the caravan, and verily We have spoken the Word of Truth concerning this from God, the Most Exalted.

The Surah of the Letter B

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

He said: "Nay, but your souls have made the matter seem fair to you. So comely patience! Perchance God will bring them all to me. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."

Alif Lam Mim Fa. God hath sent down the Criterion in truth, that men might judge concerning the Remembrance with justice. Verily God is well aware of all that ye do.

We have indeed sent down the Book on Mount Sinai unto the Remembrance, that he might judge between men with justice. And verily God, thy Lord, knoweth all things.

O leaves of the heart! Hear My call from this Pen of ink. I am God, there is no God but Him, the Ancient. And He is God, the All-Wise, the All-Knowing.

The Remembrance speaketh not from mere desire. God hath indeed revealed unto Me the truth, and verily He dwelleth upon the straight path that resteth above the waters, ever-witnessed.

O concourse of lights! Do ye marvel at God's command and His power over one of Us, the People of the House? Verily God hath power over all things.

O Solace of the Eyes! Turn away from the idolaters, for God hath verily willed in truth and by truth to visit upon them the greater punishment. And verily God hath power over all things.

We have indeed sent down the verses in truth in that Book upon the upright line in the first row, and mention of the Remembrance was concealed between the lines in truth and by truth.

Perchance the people might read from the knowledge of the Book some of the letters which in truth were inscribed concerning the station of the Remembrance in the Mother Book.

O Solace of the Eyes! God hath ordained for none any portion of thy hidden destiny. Therefore place thy trust in God, thy Lord, turn away from the perceiving ones, and stand at the gate of the heart, for verily God, thy Lord, the True One, encompasseth all things.

O people of the earth! Fear God and be not like the people of Lot in associating partners with God, your Creator. For verily the Remembrance among you standeth in truth and by truth as a witness over your souls around the Corner.

Say: None knoweth the hidden save God, and He encompasseth all things. He is God, the Most High, the Most Great.

Verily God hath raised up the Remembrance for Himself, that He might make the earth's highest the servant of its lowest. And He is God, powerful over all things.

We have made the response from the tongue of the Remembrance unto the unbelievers a burning fire.

O people of the earth! Keep My word that ye worship none but God, my Lord and your Lord. Diminish not the measure nor the balance wrongfully, but stand upon the line of justice in this Gate.

Verily this Remembrance is the remnant of the lights, and He is better for you if ye be faithful to God, the Most High, in truth and by truth.

O ye believers! Do ye not see that I am indeed upon a clear proof from my Lord, and God hath provided Me with such knowledge of good things as none among creation knoweth save the Truth? My success is only through God, and unto Him is the return of the believers inscribed in truth and by truth.

Seek forgiveness of God, then turn ye unto Him in the path of this Most Great Gate. Verily God is the Truth, my Lord, and He is indeed most forgiving, most loving.

O people! Act according to your station, for God is verily a witness unto the truth.

O people! Act according to your capacity, for verily God is the True Witness and He is the All-Knowing. He has indeed been All-Seeing and All-Informed of all your deeds. We have sent you to all creation by God's leave with Our signs and this Most Great Authority, which has ever been a faithful guardian of the Truth. Verily the followers of various sects shall be witnessed around the Fire on the Day of Resurrection. These are among the tidings of the towns We relate to you - some are around water and some around God, having been laid to rest at the Point of Fire in very truth. The idolaters did not wrong Us, but rather the people of the Fire have been wronged according to the decree of the Book. Those who call upon aught else but the Remembrance - their gods whom they invoke besides God shall avail them naught, for the Cause has come from God, the True One, as an irrevocable decree. We took from all a covenant concerning the Remembrance above Mount Sinai, but when the Truth came to them in this world, they were recorded in the Mother Book as having broken the covenant. In this is a sign for those who fear the punishment of the Hereafter. On that Day all creation shall be gathered before the All-Merciful. That Day is recorded as witnessed in the Mother Book. We delay it only for an appointed term, and the Cause has been numbered around the Fire in truth. We shall give souls their due on that Day in truth - some shall be with the Cause and some around the Fire, witnessed in very truth. We have decreed in the Book concerning the wretched in their essence and the blessed in their essence, as an irrevocable decree from that Gate. As for those who are wretched, they shall be made to stand around the Fire in justice, except as your Lord wills. Verily He is the Truth and has power over all things. And as for those who are blessed, they are recorded in the Mother Book as being around God by virtue of the decree of the Divine Will around the Gate. We shall recompense every soul according to what it has wrought, by the Most Great Truth. God diminishes not anyone's portion, and there is nothing but We have recorded it in that hidden Book. We have given you the Book in truth that you may judge between people with justice. Were it not for a decree that had preceded from God concerning the people, He would judge between them in that Day, the days of the Remembrance in truth - and God's command in the Mother Book has been decreed. O Solace of Mine Eyes! Be steadfast as thou art commanded and grieve not over the idolaters and their words, for God thy Lord shall judge between them on the Day of Resurrection by the Most Great Truth, and He is Witness over all things. O people of the divine cloud! Hear My call from the Point of the Letter that dwells at the Pole of Fire. Nay, your souls have seduced you after the Book regarding the matter of the Greater Joseph. O God! From Thee do I seek patient endurance in His Cause, with truth, a gracious patience. May God bring him and you all together in the land of gathering, in very truth. Verily He is the Truth and He is the Most High in truth, and He is the One Who has ever been, in the Mother Book, wise and knowing in truth. He is God and is witness over all things. And He is God Who has ever encompassed all the worlds.

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

And he turned away from them and said: "How great is my grief for Joseph!" And his eyes became white with sorrow, and he was filled with suppressed grief.

Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra. These are the verses of the Book from the presence of the Wondrous One, beside Whom there is no other God, and He is God, the Most High, the All-Wise.

Verily We have sent down the verses in this Book for those of insight among the people of the Gate, with truth upon truth, uniquely.

O Fruit of the Heart! Hearken unto this call from this Mystic Dove singing in the realm of the cloud of unknowing. God hath verily revealed unto Me: "Verily I am God, beside Whom there is no other God, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise."

O My servants! Turn ye unto this supreme reward, for I have created gardens for remembrance that none knoweth save Me, and I have not permitted entry therein to any soul except after martyrdom in His path. Therefore seek ye this supreme reward from God, the Most High, for He is God, the Exalted, the Great.

Had We willed, We would have made humanity around the Remembrance one community, but they will not cease to differ, except those upon whom God hath bestowed His mercy. And the Command with the Remembrance hath been decreed with truth upon truth.

Verily We relate unto thee from the tidings of the Messengers that the hearts of the people might be made firm in the pure religion, and God thy Lord is witness over all things.

Verily God hath made the verses an admonition for the believers, but it increaseth not the unbelievers save in loss.

O ye unbelievers! Act according to your way, for God, your Lord, the Most Merciful, He is the Truth, and He is God, powerful over all things.

Verily this Remembrance is the Truth, and He hath been a witness with truth upon truth among the worlds.

And upon the veils, they became veiled from glory through glory, and He is God, encompassing all things.

And upon the cloud of unknowing, it hath effaced all otherness from its essences, and He is God, witness over all things.

And upon the heaven, it was raised without the pillars that ye see, and He is God, the Reckoner with the believers.

And upon the earth, it became humble upon its surface through the Remembrance, and He is God, merciful to the believers.

And for all things according to the Command of the Book, their portion hath been bestowed with truth.

Verily We have sent down unto thee the verses with truth from thy Lord, but most people believe not in the Most Exalted Remembrance, save a few of the foremost believers.

Verily We have raised the heaven without pillars that ye can see, then established the heavens with the earth according to what God had ordained in the Mother Book as decreed.

Verily We have made subservient the sun and the moon and the stars around the Remembrance that perchance the people might believe in meeting Him with truth upon truth, and He is God, praised with truth among the worlds.

Verily We have written the seat as thy Throne and the station as thy Chair, and verily their command hath been raised upon the water around the Gate with truth upon truth.

God hath extended the earth through His Word and hath ordained therein the inner \[...\]

In it He hath ordained hidden springs and rivers of wine, and of every fruit He hath decreed therein two kinds. The night envelopeth the day, and in this verily are signs for those of insight among the people of the Gate who circle round the Remembrance.

We have ordained in the land of Unity adjoining tracts of attributes and gardens of names with vines, and fields of divine stations that are both single and paired, watered by the water of the Remembrance through the Command above the Command, and this decree was inscribed in the Mother Book.

O concourse of lights! Should ye marvel at the Remembrance in His truth, verily We have been, in truth, uniquely creative in Our creation by the leave of the Ancient God, concerning the station of the Remembrance, and this Command was a new thing from God, the Most High.

The abode of the idolaters is the fire, according to the true decree of the Book, and this judgment was inscribed in the Mother Book.

Verily God hath made thee a warner in truth through the truth, and a guide to the believers, and one guided to the mystery of the Book.

God knoweth all things and what is in the wombs in truth, and what increaseth in unique creation, and everything with Him hath been inscribed according to measure.

He is God, there is no God but Him, Knower of the unseen and the visible, and He is God, the Most High, the Great.

The Surah of the Truth

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

By God, they say: "You will not cease to remember Joseph until you are consumed or become among those who perish." Alif Lam Mim Ta.

Praise be to God Who hath sent down the Book in truth unto His servant, that he might be in all worlds a manifest token of His similitude, by virtue of pure justice, witnessed in the Most Great Truth.

Verily We have made thee in the worlds of holiness a cornerstone of praise and an exalted throne of glorification.

Therefore hearken unto My call at the Gate, from all around the Gate: "Verily I am the True King, Who hath ever been, in truth and by truth, the Self-Subsisting.

"Verily I am the Command in truth, upon the encircling Alif, Who hath ever been, in truth and by truth, decreed.

"And thou art, in truth, the cornerstone of Divine unity and the center of glorification by leave of God, the All-Praised, Who hath ever been praised in truth.

"Verily We desired naught in truth from any thing save that which their own souls had already desired regarding that thing, and God hath ever encompassed all things.

"He it is Who showeth you in the lightning a flash from the Most Great Remembrance, and in the clouds a gleam from the Most Great Command, and God hath power over all things.

"O ye believers! Why do ye dispute concerning the Remembrance after the truth hath come, when verily he hath been inscribed in the Mother Book as one mighty in authority around the Fire?

"Verily those who call upon aught else besides this Gate will receive no response, and God hath ordained that the prayers of the unbelievers shall be answered only in the fire, by the fire, through the Most Great Fire.

"Unto God prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and on earth - some upon the straight Truth and some upon falsehood uprooted, as hath been inscribed in the Mother Book around the Fire.

"O people of the Throne! Hear My call from around this Gate: 'Verily I am God, there is no God but He, and I am the Ever-Living, Who hath ever been Self-Subsisting.'

"O My servants! No soul hath followed the Remembrance in truth except it hath followed Me upon the consummate Truth, upon the straight path, upon the Most Great Remembrance, steadfastly.

"And no soul hath turned away from His Cause except it hath turned away from My Cause, and verily I shall take mighty vengeance upon the idolaters, in truth and by truth.

"O Solace of Mine eyes! Cause the people to hear the melodies of the birds of Paradise upon the Throne of Truth, from a level upon this sacred earth, for thou art in truth directed by the ear of God in holiness, and God hath ever been thy Guardian.

"Say: 'Verily I am the son of Muhammad, the Arabian, and have been witnessed around the Fire in the Preserved Tablet.

"'Verily I am the Fire of the Interlocutor around the Mount that spoke in the Tree: "There is no God but He," and God hath ever been My witness.'

"None hath truly estimated God with due estimation save God, his Lord, there is no God but He.

"We are the Family of Muhammad in truth, and thus hath the decree been inscribed by the hands of the Lord in the Great Leaf around the Throne.

"O thou Sun rising in the horizon of the cloud of unknowing, obedient unto God, the One, the Eternal, besides Whom there is no God, and God hath ever been thy Reckoner!

"And from God, the Truth, and from Us, the Family of God in truth, peace be upon thee," even as thou hast been mentioned in the Preserved Tablet with God.

O people of the earth! Fear God regarding this crimson Word, that ye speak naught concerning God save the truth, for verily God hath ever been cognizant of all things.

Verily God hath knowledge of all things. And who doth more wrong than he who inventeth a falsehood against the Remembrance? I announce unto him the great Fire, for he is nigh unto the great Fire. O ye who dwell in the celestial realm! Hearken unto My call from the Point established at the center of the Sun, in truth upon truth, from the tongue of this Arabian Youth, the Citizen, upon the mighty and wondrous Truth. God hath in truth revealed unto Me: "Verily I am God, there is no God but Me. This Remembrance is before Me, upon the Most Exalted Word and the impenetrable Mystery, created in truth within truth around truth." Say: Are the two Alifs equal - one standing firm in the Cause and the other sitting at the Gate? Exalted is God, the Most High, and He is God, the Mighty, the Great.

What aileth you that ye join partners with God from among His creation, so that creation seemeth alike to them at the Gate? Exalted is God far above what the wrongdoers describe, with supreme exaltation. Say: God is the Creator of all things by His command, in truth, and He is the One, the Most High, Who hath knowledge of all things in truth through truth.

Verily We have sent down water from heaven, and the valleys flowed according to their measure, and We have ordained it in truth with precise ordination.

And that which profiteth the believers is this Remembrance in truth, and verily it is the truth that hath been written in the Mother Book around the Fire.

And We hold it with justice on earth that people may benefit in truth from the distillations of this Most Great Sea, according to the decree of the Book beneath the letter Ba, inscribed. Is one who knoweth the Remembrance through the Remembrance like unto one who knoweth through the Book? Nay! Between them is the distance of the two Easts, and the decree hath been determined in the Mother Book.

The true believer is he who fulfilleth the covenant with the covenant and breaketh not the pledge according to the balance, and hath been mentioned in truth in the measure around the Gate. These are they who have patiently persevered seeking the face of God in truth, and are content with God in secret and in public; these are they who dwell in truth in the holy throne by leave of the Remembrance.

And those who have believed in truth and are content with the ultimate abode around the Remembrance - these are they who are witnessed in truth upon the straight path. These shall abide in Paradise forever, and the angels shall enter unto them from every gate: "Peace be upon you from God, the Most High, in ancient truth."

O people of Paradise! Hear the call of God from the crimson leaf growing from this verdant Tree upon the land of that Most High Gate, which hath been written in the Mother Book in the mystery of Fire: "Verily I am God, there is no God but He, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise."

O servants of God! Why do ye speak concerning the matter of God's Most Great Remembrance in the same manner as Joseph's brothers spoke, saying "By God, thou wilt not cease to remember Joseph"? Nay! The Remembrance was not veiled upon the light of Sinai in your hearts, but ye veil yourselves from Him. Verily He is the Truth, the Most Great Word, and I am the Crimson Pillar inscribed in truth upon truth by the hands of the Merciful in all the Tablets.

The Surah of the Bird

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

He hath said: "I only complain of my anguish and sorrow unto God, and I know from God what ye know not." Alif Lam Ra. This is a Book which We have sent down in truth, that thou mayest lead mankind out of darkness into the pure light of truth. This is the path of the Most High, established in pure justice and truth, and He is God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth in truth, and He is independent of all things, and He is the Truth, and hath ever encompassed all creation. The likeness of those who break the Covenant concerning the Most Great Remembrance is as those who violate the Covenant concerning the Lord, and thus hath it been inscribed in truth upon truth in the Preserved Tablet with God, the Ancient of Days. God extendeth knowledge unto whomsoever He willeth, and the life of this world compared to the life to come is but as a shadow compared to the sun, and verily the shadow in the presence of the sun is as nothingness. Verily God guideth in truth whom He willeth unto the path of this Remembrance, and verily the path of Ali is inscribed in the Mother Book upon the upright line around the letter Ba, having been written in powerful truth upon exalted truth. Know ye that through the remembrance of your Lord, the All-Merciful, are the hearts of the believers who surround the waters at that Most Great Gate set at rest, and verily God is witness over all things. O Solace of Mine eyes! Verily the Tree of Blessedness in the Mother Book with Us is inscribed in truth at the gate of the letter Ba. And no soul hath taken hold of the branches through these most great verses in truth except that We decree for it, by God's leave, a goodly end in the life to come, and verily this decree in the Mother Book is unalterable. O people of the earth! How can ye deny the All-Merciful when He is in truth my Lord? There is no God but He; in Him have I placed my trust, and unto Him is the return of the believers in truth. Were We to will it concerning these verses as a command, We would verily cleave asunder the earth and cause the mountains to move in truth, for unto God belongeth the command in truth, and He is God, powerful over all things. Nay, I desire naught save what God hath desired for it aforetime. Say: Verily I am the servant of God, I have no power over truth save what God my Lord willeth, and verily He is the Truth and is cognizant of all things. Were We to will it, We would transform the earth and all that dwell thereon through a single letter of command, in less than the twinkling of an eye, all together. But those who have disbelieved shall be afflicted with the fire for what they have wrought, and verily God faileth not His promise in truth, and He is God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Messengers before thee have indeed been mocked, and thou art but the servant of God in truth. Soon shall We grant respite unto those who have disbelieved for what their hands have wrought, and verily God wrongeth not anyone even to the extent of the film on a date-stone. Is he who standeth watch over souls by command like unto him who sitteth in his house? What aileth you? How do ye assign partners unto God in authority? Would ye inform Him of what He knoweth not in the earth? There is no God in truth but He, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise. As for those who call upon aught else besides Him, verily God hath prepared for them on the Day of Resurrection the most grievous chastisement, and this decree hath been irrevocably fixed in the Mother Book. The similitude of the Garden of Oneness which the All-Merciful hath promised His servants is as that which resteth upon the Throne in the ocean of eternity, its mountain enduring forever without change \[...\]

The All-Merciful has promised His servants, like unto that which is established upon the throne in the ocean of eternity, whose mountain stands forever unchanging and whose shadow is cut off from all determination. That paradise is the Most Great Word unto the believers, and He is God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Verily, some among the people of the Furqan rejoice in what God hath bestowed upon thee of His grace. Say: I have been commanded to worship God, besides Whom there is no other God, and not to join in His worship anything whatsoever of truth with truth. Thus have We sent down unto thee in truth this decree from God in an Arabic tongue, neither of the East nor of the West, but rather upon the Alif standing between two lines and the still water upon the two talismans from that Most Great River, the mystery of the two Names, and verily God hath ever encompassed all things.

No soul can bring forth a verse from the Book in truth except by God's leave, the Praiseworthy, Who is commanded in the dominion. For every term there is a decree written in truth upon this Gate, the Most Great Book of God. God doth blot out and confirm what He pleaseth, and He is God, the All-Knowing of all things.

The polytheists among the people of the Book say: "Thou wert not commissioned by the command of the Imam, the Proof of God in truth." Say: God sufficeth as a witness between me and you, and verily the Proof beareth witness unto me with the Most Great Truth, and He is God, and His chosen ones have ever been witness to all things.

Some of the believers followed their vain desires after the Remembrance had come unto them with the Most Great Book. Soon shall We cause them to taste severe heat of fire upon fire with fire. Say: Mine is but to deliver the Message, and the reckoning is inscribed in the Mother Book.

O people of the divine cloud! Hear My call from this crimson leaf growing from the branches of this green tree, suspended upon the yellow tree, standing upon the white root in the land of grandeur. This is an Arab Youth Who hath been in truth witnessed. God doth verily reveal unto Me: "Verily I am God, there is no God but I, the Truth, and verily the Remembrance is with Me in truth upon truth, before the Fire Point which was written at the Point of Manifestation."

O My servants! These are the days of God which the All-Merciful promised you in His Book. Remember God abundantly in the path of this Most Great Remembrance in truth with truth. No soul hath been created except that within it was placed a sign from the Most Great Remembrance, that the Truth might witness with truth, and He is God Who hath ever been knowing of all things.

Those who desire this world after the truth - God hath ordained for them in the hereafter no portion of good, and the decree concerning them from the judgment of the Gate hath been fulfilled. We sent thee not save with the tongue proceeding from the people of the Garden of Good-Pleasure. The people have no knowledge of speech after the Bayan, for verily everything hath its announcement in the Mother Book which was concealed around the Fire.

Verily God hath permitted the Remembrance to speak whatsoever He willeth as He willeth, and He willeth naught in anything save as We will in truth, and verily God is witness unto all things. Therefore hearken unto a word from the Most Great Remembrance in pure truth, free from the false satanic rules in your hands. Reject not the truth, for verily the kingdom is God's - He disposeth as He willeth, how He willeth.

Hearken then to a Word from the Most Great Remembrance, expressing the pure truth devoid of false satanic principles in your midst. Reject not the truth, for sovereignty belongs to God Who doeth what He willeth as He pleaseth, and He, verily, hath ever been All-Knowing, All-Wise.

O ye believers! Have I not warned you of the Days of God in truth? By God, the Truth! This Day hath indeed come unto those servants who have been patient and thankful in the remembrance of God, the Most High.

God hath permitted the thankful to receive His gratitude, and the unbelievers to receive the fire of His Command. Verily God, your true Lord, hath ever been knowing of all things.

O concourse of lights among the people intoxicated with the crimson wine! Hear My call from this Bird soaring in the atmosphere above the mountains of the land of Qaf. God hath indeed revealed unto Me while upon the Ship that saileth above those waters: "Verily I am God, the Truth, there is no God but Me. Worship Me then upon this Straight Line that moveth in the heart of the Gate, for it speaketh the truth with truth in that interpretation, with justice and in a praiseworthy manner."

O God! Unto Thee be praise! There is no God but Thee. I pour out my grief and sorrow concerning that stagnant water in the two eyes, from the camphor water in the two names, and concerning the golden water in the two cups, unto God, the Lord of both commands. I know from God concerning this enlightened Arab Youth whom I have reared with My hands in the fire of hearts - he whose name recalls the Most Great Word - that which ye know not, and God hath ever been knowing of His exalted remembrance.

He is God, the Witness over all things.

Verily God hath ever encompassed all things.

The Surah of the Announcement

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

O My son! Go ye and seek tidings of Joseph and his brother, and despair not of the Spirit of God. Lo! none despaireth of the Spirit of God save unbelieving folk. Alif. Lam. Ra. O thou Greatest Word! God hath indeed revealed unto thee the Remembrance in truth, and thou art none other than the Remembrance of God, the Most High, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise. We have, verily, sent thee down in truth, and God and His angels are, in truth, thy sublime and exalted guardians, and have ever been thy protectors of old. These verses are indeed the verses of the Qur'an in truth from God, thy Lord, the True One, besides Whom there is no God, and He is God Who hath ever encompassed all things. Leave thou the idolaters around the Fire until that appointed Day of Truth. For each one there is a known book concerning the Command in that Greatest Word by God's leave, and in the Mother Book is recorded the decree for all in truth. O Thou Solace of the Eyes! Thou art indeed the Mighty Tidings in the most exalted Concourse, and by that Name art thou known in truth among the people of the Throne. O ye believers! Ye are in doubt concerning that whereunto the Remembrance calleth you, yet it is the Truth in truth, and hath been witnessed in truth. Can there be doubt about the Gate Who holdeth the heavens and earth by Our leave? God is indeed well aware of what ye do. The likeness of those whom the Remembrance preventeth from false foundations is as those who love not to reject their gods, and both are recorded in the Mother Book as following vain decrees. Say: God is my Lord and your Lord in truth. He hath appointed me as a witness to this Greatest Word in truth. I am but a man like unto you. God bestoweth His favor upon me as He willeth, with what He willeth. And there hath been no limit set to your Lord's command in the Mother Book. Our command is but as the twinkling of an eye, and God is indeed witness over all things. We speak not save by God's leave, and in God do we place our pure trust, and He is God, our Lord, Who hath power over all things. God hath ordained for those who fear, round about the House, a place of security nigh the Throne, and God doth indeed encompass all things. Whoso imagineth aught false concerning the Remembrance, We shall cause him to drink, on the Day of Resurrection, of scalding water. When he drinketh it, it burneth him, and death cometh to him from every quarter, yet he dieth not, and behind him is God's most grievous chastisement, which hath been recorded in the Mother Book in truth. Have ye not reflected on aught? We have created the heavens in truth, and if God willed, He could remove you and bring forth a new creation like unto you, and He is God, Who hath power over all things. And in the Fire is the fire of cold, alike for the unbelievers after the cold; whether they are patient or impatient, they have no escape therefrom in justice, and God hath power over all things. When the matter is decided, Satan saith unto his followers: "Verily, I am with you in idolatry. Blame not me but blame your idolatrous selves, for God's most grievous chastisement hath been fulfilled upon us and hath returned to us by decree of the Book from the command of the Gate, which hath been irrevocably ordained in the Greatest Truth." Have ye not seen how God hath likened the Remembrance to the Tree whose root was in the breast of the Remembrance \[...\]

And upon Us has returned, by command of the Book, from the Cause of the Bab, which hath been irrevocably decreed by the Most Great Truth. Have ye not seen how God hath likened the Remembrance unto a tree whose root was in the breast of the Remembrance and whose branch had been raised unto the heaven of the clouds? And verily God, your True Lord, hath been knowing of all things. And verily the goodly Word - its root is firmly fixed upon the Throne, and its branch endureth in the heaven by the leave of the Gate. We give forth its fruits - the verses - at all times, goodly ones, by God's leave, creating through a new Command, in novel justice, upon the Fiery Point that hath been concealed around the Water. And the likeness of a false word apart from Truth is as an evil tree, uprooted from the shadow of shadows upon the shade, and the shade was present in the fire, in the fire. Do ye take peers besides God while they are creatures like unto you? Then wait, for God hath decreed the destiny of the idolaters unto the fire, and verily the Command from God's presence hath been decreed in the Mother Book. Say to My servants who have believed in the Remembrance upon the Straight Path and have spent their wealth after establishing prayer: verily God hath prepared for them gardens beneath which flow fruits of forbearance and divine acceptance from the breezes of knowledge. And verily this bounty of God for the Most Great Remembrance hath been known in the Mother Book with God. And verily We have subjected for you the sun and moon, both circling round the Remembrance. And if ye should count God's favor ye cannot reckon it, and verily God hath ever encompassed the worlds. O people of the Throne! Hear My call from around this secure city, the Station of Abraham. Whoso entereth it upon the Straight Path, he is of the people of the Gate, and whoso disobeyeth God is excluded from it. And He is God, the Self-Sufficient, the Praised One. Our Lord! I have settled mine eye's delight in a valley without truth, so cause Thou, O God, hearts among men to incline toward it, and provide its people with fruits of inner truths for Thy Most Great Covenant with pure truth, for Thou art the Lord of great bounty and Thou art powerful over all things. Our Lord! Thou knowest in truth concerning it and whoso dwelleth therein, and nothing is hidden from Thee. And Thou art the Mighty, and Thou hast been independent of the worlds. Verily the unbelievers desire not the truth save unto the Remembrance in their eyes and not their hearts, and God hath ordained for them on the Day of Reckoning a station wherein they shall be questioned concerning the truth by the truth. And when the veil is removed from their eyes they shall say: "Would that we had answered Thy call and followed the Remembrance from Thy presence, the Truth!" And they shall have no helper besides God, the Most High. Soon shall the believers behold on that day the dwelling place of the sinners in the fire, their garments of molten brass prepared, the fire covering their faces. Evil is their dwelling place, the coffin their abode, and verily God hath encompassed the worlds. And verily God recompenseth every soul for what it hath earned, and verily God, He is the Truth, there is no God but He, and He is God, knowing of all things. Verily this Remembrance - His judgment is the delivery of Truth that people might know of a certainty that He is but One God, there is nothing like unto Him, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise. And We destroyed no city save at an appointed time by God's leave - our Lord, the Truth - and verily God hath been knowing of all things. And verily We have sent thee down in truth unto the sects of the ancients and the moderns, upon a letter from the mystery of the line that hath been concealed around the Fire.

In the Name of God, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful

And the others are upon a letter from the mystery of the line which was concealed around the Fire, and verily God has power over all things. O Solace of the Eye! We have preserved the earth above the water and the heavens beneath the air, for thy true mystery concerning the wondrous Cause from thy Lord, the True One, and the decree in the Mother Book was ordained. Hearken then unto that which thy Lord reveals unto thee. Verily, there is no God but Him. Worship Him and place thy trust in Him. And when the matter is decreed, say: "Verily we are God's, and verily unto Him do we return in truth."

O people of Eden! Hear My call from that purifying water, moving in that camphor-scented cup in the hands of youths from among the people of that Gate, who standeth before God, the True One. Verily, He is the Living One, there is no God but Him, and He is God, exalted from eternity.

Verily, I am God, there is no God but Me. O Concourse of Lights! My servants, go to the goodly land and seek out Joseph and his brother at that Gate, and his brother within that same Gate, and be not disheartened by the Most Great Word, the Spirit of God, for wheresoever ye may be, by the leave of God, your True Master, He is with you in truth, raising you through His verses to your homeland. And verily He is the Truth within the Most Exalted Gate, Who was sought around the Fire. And He is God, Who is witness unto all things.

The Surah of the Proclamation

When they came before him, they said: "O exalted one! Distress has befallen us and our family, and we have brought scanty merchandise. Give us full measure and be charitable unto us, for God rewards the charitable."

God! There is no God but Him, the Truth. Nothing exists besides Him except what is created by His command in truth, and He is God, Who has knowledge of all things.

O believers! God has indeed revealed this Book unto Me with the Most Great Truth, and I have revealed it in truth to My Most Great Remembrance by God's leave, and God is witness over all things.

By your Lord, the True God! Any soul who harbors in his heart anything other than servitude to Me and to this, My Most Great Remembrance, God will burn with fire on the Day of Return, and He has not ordained for him in the hereafter any refuge among the people of truth.

O people of the earth! This crimson Leaf, nourished with the oil of hearts, is a manifestation of the decreed Command by the Most Great Truth, which none can resist. Indeed, God's Command in the Mother Book has been irrevocably ordained around the Fire through the wondrous Command.

O people of the earth! Hearken unto My call from the movements of these Birds upon that white Leaf. Verily, I am God, besides Whom there is no other God. Therefore, worship Me and establish prayer before the Remembrance for the Most Great Remembrance. Spend of that which God has given you in the path of the Remembrance, for death surely watches over His decreed Command, and God encompasses all things.

Know ye that this Remembrance, in the Holy Seat, has been recorded in truth as among the first of those who prostrate themselves before God, the Exalted.

Therefore, turn ye unto God before the day when death comes upon you suddenly, whereupon ye shall find no deliverance from death except through submission to God, the Truth.

The way of the ancients has passed regarding the transgressors, according to the decree of the Book, as God's true Command concerning that Gate has been ordained.

Were We to open unto the believers a gate from heaven, they would still grow arrogant in their souls and think of the Remembrance as a mighty sorcerer.

We have ordained in heaven constellations upon the equinoctial point in two cycles around the center of the Gate in perfect symmetry, that the people of knowledge might judge by their configurations upon the point of equality for a little while.

We have preserved thee from every satan except those who steal away verses of the Book concerning the souls of the believers, for such shall remain hidden in the Fire.

O Solace of Mine eyes! Cast upon them meteors of verses, weighty stars against those verses which God has ordained in the Gate, made clear in truth in that Book.

There is nothing but that God has placed its treasuries in the Mother Book, and We send it down only in measure according to what God, the Truth, has willed.

We truly know the paths of journeying of the people of earth and heaven, and thou art stationed at the Gate of Knowledge before the All-Knowing, the Self-Subsisting.

O people of the earth! Convey Our true Command to all through a mystery of the Alif standing around the Truth. God has ordained for those who convey the Message gardens of moist ruby, wherein He has created heavens layer upon layer, and God has originated in the center of each heaven a sun upon the form of glorification \[...\]

Behold how God hath created in the center of each heaven a sun formed for glorification, a moon fashioned for sanctification, and stars shaped for praise - all extolling God their Creator, the True One, from their orbital stations, beseeching God's forgiveness for those who convey to humanity a command from this Most Great Word, by leave of God, the Most High; and verily God hath ever been mighty.

O people of the Throne! Hearken unto My call from around that Rod of Iron, heated by the fire concealed in the heart of the Remembrance, which was hidden in the Mother Book.

Verily God revealed unto Me on the First Mount, through the tongue of His Beloved, from the Most Hidden Mystery surrounding the Gate: "Verily, I am God, there is no God but Him. This Remembrance is the Truth established by My Truth amongst all the worlds. I am the Truth, there is no God but Him, and verily the Truth from God hath ever encompassed all the worlds."

O people of Paradise! Hearken unto My call from the radiant Sun in the depths of the seventh sea, upon the Greatest Line, above the Mystery of the Square Line. Verily, I am God, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting. No soul conceiveth aught of the Truth in his heart in the path of servitude regarding any aspect of this Most Great Word, but that We have forgiven his sins and planted for him in the Garden of Eden trees in the form of peacocks from among the birds of Paradise. And We have ordained at the Gate from their fruits maidens like hidden pearls. Verily God's power to fulfill His promise is truth. Act according to the Truth, and soon shall ye witness God's Cause in the distant gathering, upon the Truth, the Most Praiseworthy, drawing nigh.

O Solace of Mine eyes! Speak not to people according to the depths of reason lest they be led astray from the path of Truth. Rather, address them with familiar words containing the hidden, veiled mystery which hath been known among the unified ones.

Verily We have made the earth a name for the Most Great Word and have ordained therein your means of livelihood at the Gate. Do ye then believe in any provider for yourselves apart from God, the True One?

O Solace of Mine eyes! Send down upon the lands of verses the water of mercy, that people may drink thereof upon the straight path of the Most Great Word until the appointed time.

Verily We have created man from dried clay in the palm of the Wise One around the seas of water, by leave of God, the Most High; and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise.

We have decreed for the jinn the hidden fire from the green tree which was planted around the scorching heat. And when We created the angels around the Remembrance, We commanded them in truth at that Gate to prostrate before the Merciful, your True Lord, upon the path of love which was intended in the Mother Book.

The prostration of the angels was with the dust rising from this earth at a command from the Remembrance of God, the Ancient One; and He is God, Who in truth hath ever been worshipped.

And when Iblis grew proud through his denial of the Most Great Gate, he became through that association an outcast in God's guarding Book.

"Get thee out, for thou hast been inscribed in the Book of the Wicked as fire destined for the fire!"

Verily We have raised up the Gate for the Gate by God's leave in the Sacred Mosque through the question about the letter Ha in response to the word containing Lam, to attain the consciousness of the heart upon the Truth from that ink. And verily God hath power over all things.

Verily there is no path except after severing oneself from all save the Truth in the Praiseworthy Gate, by leave of God, the Most High, the Great, concealed.

Verily God hath power over all things. There is no path save after severance from all save the Truth, in the Praiseworthy Gate, by the leave of God, the Most High, the Great, the Hidden. This, verily, is a path exalted in the Mother Book, inscribed in the form of trinity around the Fire. God hath not in truth decreed the will of Satan over those who place their trust in the Gate, through the Most Great Truth, according to the judgment of the Book from the judgment of the Gate, which hath been decreed in the Mother Book. God hath indeed, in His wisdom, made the gates of hell to be seven letters upon the shadow of Paradise, by the decree of the Twin Luminaries, the heat of the flames existing in the Point of Fire through fire. Verily, for the God-fearing are gardens of holiness around the Gate, by the leave of God, the Most High, planted in truth through truth. O ye believers! Enter them in peace, with clear consciousness, through the line drawn from the veil, through the truth by the truth which hath been known in the Mother Book. O people of might from the mystery in the depths of the sea! Hear My call from that Whale stationed at the pole of that sea in its most holy habitation, for God hath given it a heart like the light of the Twin Luminaries, illuminating the sea with its light, and it standeth at the gate of servitude unto God at that Gate, stationed in truth. Say: God hath revealed unto Me, "Verily, I am God, there is no God but Me. I created thee that thou mightest say by God's leave in the land of Egypt, when the whales come unto thee: Say at the Gate, 'O mighty one! Distress hath befallen us and our people, and we have come with scant merchandise from the verse of the Gate, so give us full measure with the just balance, and be charitable unto us through the Most Great Verse, even as God was charitable unto us through the verse of Unity and His loved ones.' For verily God doth reward those who are charitable at that Gate through the Most Great Truth." And He is God, the Most High, the Witness. Verily God encompasseth all things. He is God, the All-Knowing of all things.

The Surah of Man. In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

He said: "Do ye know what ye wrought with Joseph and his brother when ye were ignorant?" Alif Lam Mim. That Book is from God, the Truth. Indeed it hath been sent down unto Us with pure truth upon the Alif, established in the Most Great Word, concerning the truth around the First Veil. And verily God hath power over all things. God knoweth the unseen of the heavens and earth by the truth, and verily the Remembrance possesseth knowledge of the Book, which hath been inscribed by the truth with the truth. And verily We have, by God's leave, removed from the breasts of the believers among the people of the Gate the rancor of those who turned away, according to the decree of the Book which was ordained in the Tablet of Reward. And these are they who, upon thrones facing one another, have been stationed around the Gate in pure truth. No weariness toucheth them therein save the remembrance of the Gate, and the love of the Gate occupieth them to the exclusion of all else. And verily God is knowing of all things. O Solace of Mine eyes! Inform My servants that their Lord, the All-Merciful, hath been unto the believers a helper. And He is God Who, by the truth, hath been All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. O people of the earth! Hearken unto My call by the truth from the tongue of this human being, the wondrous Remembrance of God, upon the form of divine unity, by the truth and with clear utterance. God hath revealed unto Me that the path of Ali is with Me a truth founded upon the truth which hath been firmly established by the truth. Verily I am God, there is no God but I, and I have been, by the truth, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting. No soul hath moved in truth around the House but that the word of divine good-pleasure hath been made binding upon it by the Most Great Truth, and verily God hath been witness over all things. O Concourse of Lights! Draw forth your souls from the water of permanence after negation, and arise for God, the Most High, alone. And perform pure deeds around the established Alif upon the straight line that standeth from the presence of the Remembrance, and be ye for God, the Ancient, by the truth and upon the mighty truth, praiseworthy. And verily We gave glad tidings of Our word to Abraham concerning his guest, through a word confirming what would come after him, and We have encompassed all things through God by the pure truth. And verily We delivered Lot by God's leave and destroyed the wrongdoers through a letter of the Most Great Word, and verily God hath been witness over all things. And the people of the city came unto the truth, so the Gate returned them to the Holy Land, and these are in truth My guests, and they have been inscribed in God's Book around the water. O people of the earth! God hath counseled you by the truth with the truth, so proceed upon the extended line from around the Gate toward the direction of heaven, and turn not unto anyone in anything. By thy life! The ones who enter this Gate around the Most Great Balance have been, by the truth, stationed upon the truth. So when the cry cometh with truth, then shall your high be made low in that Gate, according to the decree of the Book which hath been ordained by the truth. And verily in that Gate are signs for those of insight among the people of the hidden veil which hath been concealed around the fire. When the companions of the Rocky Tract denied the truth, We took vengeance upon them through the Most Great Remembrance, and verily God wrongeth not mankind by the truth even to the extent of a date-stone. And among the people are those who have hewn houses from the mountains, but when the Command cometh with truth, then shall their uppermost parts be cast down to the earth \[...\]

And among people are those who have hewn houses from mountains, but when the Command cometh in truth, lo! their heights shall be brought low upon the earth. Verily, the decree of God cannot be averted, and God is witness over all things. We created not the heavens and the earth and all between them save with truth centered around the Remembrance, and verily, by God the Truth, it is the Truth, and upon the Straight Path it standeth justly, stationed around the Fire. The Hour hath verily been established around the Remembrance in truth, and none can avert it from God, so pardon with gracious pardon, by God, the Most High.

God hath made thy name seven from the Book and a letter from the second of the Qur'an, and thou art verily of exalted character in the Mother Book, created around the Command. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say: I am the Book in the scrolls of the heavens, and I was inscribed around the Fire. Work then as thou art commanded and turn away from the idolaters by leave of God, the Most High, for He is God, the Mighty, the Wise.

Those who set up another god with God, in false imagination - by thy Lord, We shall surely question them about the Command and judge them with burning stones of fire, heaped up. We know indeed that thy breast is straitened by what people think about thy Cause, so place thy trust in God with truth, and glorify thy Lord with praise. Sufficient is God, the Praiseworthy, as One informed of His servants in truth.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Worship thy Lord until death cometh in truth. There thou art, above the Throne among the ranks of those who prostrate themselves from the people of the cloud-realm, appreciated in God's presence. O Concourse of Lights! By God the Truth, God's Command hath come in truth, so hasten it not. He sendeth down the angels with the Command upon whomsoever He willeth among His servants, saying: Warn ye the people, for I am responsible in truth for the revelation.

There is no God but He, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, and He is God, worshipped in truth. We have created the heavens and earth by the Command concealed within the mystery from the line of the Gate in truth, and exalted is God above what the wrongdoers describe concerning the Remembrance. Verily He is the Truth in the Mother Book, commanded around the Truth.

God hath ordained the sperm for man from man, and decreed the Command between the two waters according to the decree of the Book, determined. We created cattle in the form of talisman for your benefit - in them is warmth and in them is profit, inscribed in truth in the Mother Book. God hath ordained horses from the center of the letter Ba, and mules in the form of Waw, and donkeys in the shape of earth, that ye may ride them in your journeys unto God, the Truth. He is God, ever-seeing His servants in truth.

Upon the Remembrance is the right path hoped for around the Gate. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! The people of hearts have come unto thee in truth, so say: Know ye what ye did to the Sign of the Gate, this Most Great Light, sister of the Guardianship, when aforetime with Joseph and his brother ye were people of sobriety, inscribed in truth in the depth of the two annihilations? He is God, independent of all worlds.

The Surah of the Trinity. In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

They said: "Art thou indeed Joseph?" He said: "I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God hath shown favor unto us. Verily, whoso is righteous and patient - God will not suffer the reward of the doers of good to perish."

Alif Lam Mim Sad. God! There is no God but Him, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting. Lord of the heavens and earth and all that is between them, and He is God, exalted and great.

Verily this Book is from God, the Wondrous, and hath been sent down in truth, though concealed. These verses are leaves from the Tree of the Friend in Abraham's bosom, which hath been planted. This is a rod of ruby in the Holy Land which hath been implanted. This is the Word of glorification, springing from the Tree of magnification above the Mount, which hath been uttered.

And had God willed, He would have guided all mankind through the Remembrance to His mighty Book. And He is God, the Exalted, the Praiseworthy. The mention of this Servant in the Qur'an is upon the Word of truth which they know not, in truth upon truth, concealed within the Fire's Point.

He it is Who hath sent down from heaven the water of mercy, whence groweth the Tree of the Heart and whence cometh its drink. Thus is it inscribed in the Mother Book, in truth and by truth, around the Gate.

We have subjected the waters to your hands that the plants might grow thereby - the elixir and the olive around the veiled line with the secret, and the palm trees above the most hidden secret of the line, and all fruits from around the veiled secret by the hands of the Remembrance, existing in truth and by truth.

Thus doth God expound His verses that perchance people might know the truth of the Remembrance in that line extended from the most hidden secret, albeit little. All things are subject to Our hands in truth, and there is naught but is commanded in truth around the Gate.

God hath subjected to you this sea that ye might partake of the flesh of attributes in the path of the Gate, praising the name of God, the Exalted. By My life! Thou art the Star of the Book, the Sun of heaven, and the Lightning of the cloud in the Mother Book. Thou wert, in thy Lord's sight, concealed around the upright line about the Fire.

Is then he who sendeth down the Book in truth like unto him who hath no power over a single letter thereof? Nay! For God is the All-Knowing, and He is God, powerful over all things.

Creation hath indeed been filled in truth with the bounties of the Remembrance, yet people know naught of the Book's grace save an alif after the most hidden secret upon the square line which was in the Mother Book inclined.

God hath encompassed all things in His knowledge, and He is God, ever-knowing, ancient. Those who call upon the Gate apart from the Gate are indeed as dead upon the earth, halted at the Pole of Fire.

O people of the earth! Your God is One God. There is no God but Him, and He is God, mighty, wise. We seal the hearts of the idolaters with denial in truth, and assuredly God knoweth what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and He is God, witness over all things.

Those who believed in the Book plotted and associated partners with the Remembrance, but soon shall the roof fall in upon them by the word of justice, by God's leave, the Exalted, and nigh.

Those whom the angels take in death, the signs veil them from the Gate. Enter ye the gates of Hell, to abide therein so long as the heavens and earth endure, until such time as God your Lord, the Truth, willeth. And verily God is powerful over all things.

Verily God has power over all things! And when the people ask thee concerning what thy Lord hath sent down in the Book, say: Yea, by My life, the Most Great Word hath been revealed concerning My Self, and in the Mother Book that Word was destined to revolve around the Letter B as God's true purpose. The abode of the believers is the mansion of joy surrounding the Gate, according to the decree of the Book - this hath been irrevocably ordained in truth. God hath prepared therein for them whatsoever they desire, sanctified by His leave, His blessings being immutable, for God hath power over all things. Say: Await ye the Most Great Day! The Truth hath come, and the angels surround Him. Satan hath been slain by the Most Great Sword, and the matter hath been decreed in truth concerning that Gate. Enter ye therein through all the gates of paradise, for the decree of fire hath been fulfilled regarding its cause, and verily God hath power over all things. The polytheists among the people of the Furqan say: "Had God willed, we would not have been content with aught besides the Gate." God hath cursed them for their unbelief. Is aught required of the Remembrance save clear delivery of the Message, which hath been inscribed by the Fiery Point? O people of the earth! By the True God, the proof of the Remembrance is like unto the radiant sun which the All-Merciful hath fixed in the heaven upon the equatorial line at its zenith. O people of the Throne! Hear My call from around the Shrine upon the Temple of Divine Unity - verily there is no God but Him. Hearken unto what is revealed unto thee in truth: No soul hath breathed a word in thy remembrance upon the Most Great Remembrance but We have ordained for it, in truth, the Most Great Paradise. This bounty is truly magnificent in the Mother Book. We have not sent down a verse save by God's leave in truth concerning that Word - that ye shall worship none but God. This is the true and upright religion, and thus hath the Truth been inscribed in all the Tablets by the hands of the Remembrance in crimson ink. O Solace of Mine eyes! Be not eager for the guidance of any soul, for God guideth not those who follow the path of the Evil One. God is the All-Praised in truth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise. Verily when We desire to ordain a matter in the Book, We but say unto it "Be!" and it is inscribed in the mystery of this Gate, and recorded on the Tablet in the mystery of fire by fire. We have sent no Prophet but We took from him a covenant concerning the Remembrance and His Day. Verily the Remembrance of God and His Day have been witnessed in truth at the Most Exalted Prospect before the angels of the Throne. O people of peace! Hear My call from this Point of Mysteries in the crimson Ruby, nurtured by the essences of the people of the cloud-realm, around which are engraved in diamond script Arabic verses from the Bedouin soul of the western wilderness - which were established upon a handful of the Gate's clay in the atmosphere of the heaven of peace, firmly fixed by the Command. Verily I am God, there is no God but Me. I have created the gardens of Paradise through My Word, this Noble Arab Youth, the True One in truth, and I have brought forth the fire from the shadow of Paradise for those who reject His Word and His Book sent down from God, the Truth. I am the Self-Subsisting, the Witness over all worlds, and I am the Most High in truth, independent of all worlds. O Solace of Mine eyes! Soon will the people of the cloud-realm declare: "Thou art indeed the Joseph of Oneness!" Say: Yea \[...\]

In truth I am the Most High, and verily I have been independent of all worlds. O Solace of Mine eyes! Soon will the people of blindness say that thou art in truth Joseph of Oneness. Say: Yea, by my Lord! I am indeed the Square Form in the Joseph of the Beginning, and this my brother is the Triangular Form in the Image of the Seal. God hath graced me with the twin mysteries in the twin Mounts, and with the twin names in the twin Luminaries. And whoso believeth in the Gate and remaineth patient after the Book - verily God will not suffer the reward of the righteous to be lost, not even by a date-spot, nor by the pellicle of a date-stone, in truth and by the truth. And verily God hath ever been the Reckoner of all things.

Surah of the Square Form

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

In the Name of God, the Exalted, the Most High!

They said: "By God, truly hath God preferred thee above us, and we have indeed been sinners." Alif. Lam. Ra. God, there is no God but Him, the Truth, and He is God Who hath ever been, in truth, the Object of all worship.

Hearken thou to My call from all the precincts of the Gate, encompassing all directions from every direction. O Solace of Mine eyes! Speak thou in the melody of the Beloved beneath the depths of love, by the command of thy Ancient Lord, in wondrous wise.

Verily, I am God, the Holy One, Who hath ever been witnessed in the seventh sea of Paradise round about the Fire. And verily, I am the Manifest Mystery above the line of the Hidden One, beneath the yellow, lightning-like veil, inscribed round about the Throne.

O people of love! Hear ye My call from My heart's light at the Most Remote Temple round about God's exalted Throne - in truth, upon the Truth - and He is God Who hath ever been mighty and ancient.

Verily, I am God, besides Whom there is no other God. I have planted with Mine own hands gardens in the land of Paradise for My servant, from the moist piece of red gold, wherein nothing hath portion save His own Self. I warn you, O My servants, by His Self, and verily the Word of God is indeed the Truth, and He is God Who hath ever been exalted and great.

Thou shalt find therein naught but the Voice of God, the Most High, upon the straight path which hath ever been mentioned at the Point of the Heart. And verily thou art, at the Mount, the Point of the Gate round about the Tree planted in the land of Mystery by God, the Ancient - thou hast ever been speaking and praiseworthy.

Verily thou art the Form of the mystic figures for those at the Mount above the Light - thou hast ever been relating. And verily thou art the Word of the followers of Jesus in the Gospel and the Psalms, in the form of glorification - thou hast ever been inscribed.

Say: Verily I am the triangular Form in the holy Mystery, squared - I have ever been written. And verily I am the Exalted Name - I have ever been unified at the Point of Fire. And verily I am the Lofty Symbol - I have ever been multiplied round about the Water. And verily I am He Who hath ever been written in the Mother Book near the All-Merciful round about the Fire.

O Solace of Mine eyes! Look thou toward the couches of the Throne, for verily the Mystery and its people cry out at the voice of this Speaking Bird above this reddened Leaf grown from this Blessed Tree - with such a cry that their souls nearly expire beyond their dwelling places. And verily thy Lord, the Truth, is possessed of grace toward mankind, and He is God Who hath ever been self-sufficient and wise.

O Great Master! By God, the Truth, were the birds to adjure me by one of the crimson doves - and verily when Thou didst command me to answer the servants, I brought them forth in a flash from the chambers, for they had beaten upon my breast for eighty-seven thousand ancient cyclic years. And verily Thou art the Knower of Truth, and God, thy Lord, sufficeth as witness to the Hidden Mystery.

O Solace of Mine eyes! Observe them upon a drop of moisture, for death hath drawn nigh unto their souls, and were it not for thy glance, they would assuredly lie dead upon the earth in truth.

O people of Mystery! Hear ye My call! Verily I am the servant of God and His Most Great Remembrance. Is there aught besides God, your True Lord, to which I summon you? He is the Almighty, the Gracious unto His servants. What aileth you in the Great Thunderbolt? Return ye to the chambers wherein ye dwelt by the wondrous Command of God, the Truth, and await ye My bidding round about the Standing Alif in truth, for verily the victory of God and His days have ever been near in the Mother Book.

O people of earth! Have ye not beheld what God hath originated of all things whose shadows incline in the Mother Book at the time of turning toward the most manifest Point\[...\]

O people of the earth! Have ye not beheld that which God hath fashioned? Its shadows incline in the Mother Book at the approach of the Point, and at its withdrawal are cast down from the Truth. Thus doth God set forth similitudes for men, that ye may be thankful to God, the Most High, around the Gate, through His All-Praised Name.

O people of the earth! Hearken unto My call from around the Remembrance: Verily, I am God, there is no God but I. O My servants! Take not two gods. He is but one God. We forgive not the joining of partners with the Truth, but We forgive all else to whom We will. And verily the best outcome with Us is for the sincere ones around the Gate.

Follow ye this Remembrance in truth, for verily it standeth upon the exalted Path, upon the stationary Alif at the Pole of Fire. Unto God, the Most High, prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and the earth in truth, and unto Him belongeth true religion. The Remembrance, and in the essence of that Gate, is verily most ardent.

No blessing cometh save from God, Who hath sent it down upon you through this Gate. Among you are believers and among you are those who join partners. And verily the Remembrance standeth firm upon the true Balance around the Fire.

Would ye know what none else knoweth? The Line hath not been ordained for anyone. By God, the Truth! Ye shall assuredly be questioned about what ye say concerning the Remembrance without truth. And verily your Lord, the Most Merciful, is witness over all things.

Do ye attribute falsely to God? When We create for you the female in truth, how do your faces darken? Do ye detest the creation of Truth while He is the Praiseworthy in His actions? Why believe ye not in the Truth and in His signs save little?

God hath ordained the worst example for those who join partners, while unto God and His friends belongeth the supreme example in the Mother Book, set forth in truth. The example of the Remembrance with God is as the sun at the zenith of heaven, unclouded in the expanse of air. And God is witness over all things.

For every atom there is a term inscribed in the Mother Book. When permission cometh, they delay not a ninth part of the tenth, nor do they advance. All repair to their nests beneath the air, halting at the Gate.

Among the people are those whose tongues speak falsehood concerning the Remembrance. By God! He hath ordained for them naught save the fire of hell as their promised destiny.

God hath not sent down the Book unto thee except that the people of the Book might know concerning that wherein they differed in religion without truth. And God is witness over all things.

Verily We have sent down this water from the heaven of the Throne that the believers might revive their dead souls through the truth. And verily life for the people of the heart hath been inscribed in the Mother Book.

O people of the earth! The example of this pure water is as pure milk between two seas - this one the depth of Power and that one the ocean of Delegation. These two are declared unbelievers in the Mother Book. And the upright Alif upon the line of equality is the Remembrance between them upon the pure Truth, and it standeth firm upon the straight Path in very truth.

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

He is established upon the Straight Path and hath verily remained steadfast upon the Truth through the Truth. Verily, We have ordained in the fruits of the date palm, and in certain stalks of cane and grapes, a goodly sugar, that the believers may partake of sweet sustenance through God's bounty, for He is God and hath power over all things. O Solace of Mine eyes! The people of blindness have spoken as did the brothers of Joseph, and have acknowledged their supreme transgression. Say: No reproach shall be upon you this day. God shall soon forgive you, if ye stand firm in the land of war. Verily God, your Lord, hath ever been towards His servants All-Forgiving, All-Wise.

Let no reproach be upon you this day. May God forgive you, for He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones.

O people of the Ridvan! Hear My call from this Bird, permitted by God to hover at a point in the atmosphere of the divine cloud. Verily, I am the Truth within the Truth. I have ascended into the air; among all creation I found nothing except that I saw it standing before that Gate by God's leave, the True One. And God is witness over all things.

Verily, I am the Tree on the Mount and the Speaking One manifesting the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, Who gives His servants to drink from the fountain of camphor. Hear My call from God's kindled Fire. Verily, I am the One rising in the mystery of hearts. God has revealed to Me: "Verily, I am God, there is no God but Me, the Truth." I have chosen the Letters of the Remembrance for remembrance, just as I, the Truth, the Powerful, have ever been - there is no God but I, the Exalted, the Great.

O believers! If you believe in God and His verses, return to the earth and pray to God for Our Cause, for God's victory is, in the Mother Book, nigh. God has witnessed today your discourse with the believers in the House, and verily I glory today in your verses among the angels of the heavens and earth. God has ordained for you a recompense of truth like unto Our own souls, and God is indeed cognizant of all things.

O believers! Why do you not remember the wondrous verses of God from your Lord? God has bestowed sovereignty over the heavens and earth upon His Most Great Remembrance, and God has made him oft-returning, merciful to the believers.

O concourse of companions! Does doubt befit God, the Originator of the heavens and earth, Who sends down verses from the orb of the sun? By your Lord, besides Whom there is no God, never has God desired for the believers, concerning this Arabian Youth, the Most Great Name of God, a gate more magnificent.

Say to the five souls from the men of the Holy Land: God has chosen you by His grace from among the people. You are the forerunners in God's Book, and in the hereafter you shall have an exalted kingdom in the Garden of Eden, established in truth by the truth.

Verily, We have made these believers witnesses over the people of the City. Say: Return to your dwellings around the House and ask God of His grace for the relief of the Remembrance, for God's Cause is, in truth by truth, nigh.

And say to the fourth among them: God has ordained for you a double portion of the greatest mercy as recompense for your wearing the two sandals for My Most Great Remembrance, and verily you have in the hereafter an honored station.

By your Lord! It befits not to hesitate concerning such a Youth Who recites unto you the wondrous verses of God from your Lord, purifies you by His grace, teaches you the Book and wisdom through His verses - He Who is comely and pure in truth by truth, and Who has been concealed in the Mother Book around the Fire.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say to the Arabian youth from Qazvin: God has accepted your arrival at the Most Great Gate. Fear not, for you are among the people of peace, already inscribed in the Mother Book.

God has witnessed your discourse at the House with those whom We made to journey in the evil land, who make false claims about the remote soul by moving mountains untruthfully. By your Lord! They shall have no power over even a staff or an atom without God's leave. Soon We shall judge in the land of gathering those who fabricate lies against God. Verily, God has made the Remembrance from His presence a witness over all worlds.

Verily God hath made the Remembrance from His presence a witness unto all the worlds, a beloved unto the believers, and mighty unto the infidels. We have given today, by God's leave, unto the water-bearer a cooling draught from the Camphor Spring, in recompense for his love of the Most Great Remembrance of God. Verily God doth not suffer to be lost the reward of one who giveth water for the sake of God, the Most High, and God is well-aware of what ye do.

Verily God hath today caused a soul from the Holy Land to enter the Sacred House, and God hath written for him the reward of the martyrs. We do not suffer to be lost the reward of one who performeth a pure and praiseworthy deed for God's sake. Verily God is witness over all things.

O people of the earth! Enter ye the Holy Land by leave of the Remembrance, and enter ye the Gate through the Gate, for verily he was the first to believe in the True Remembrance of God. Therefore, in the Mother Book, round about the Gate hath it been written.

Verily the Remembrance hath accepted the repentance of a soul that came from the Holy Land, and God hath written for him the reward of the believers. We do not suffer to be lost the reward of one who performeth a good deed before the Remembrance, and verily God is witness over all things.

Recite unto thy brother the true account of the sons of Adam, when they each offered up an offering: it was accepted from one but not accepted from the other. God shall soon guide those who believe unto the truth by the truth, upon His Most High and Praiseworthy Path.

Verily God hath guided His servant in the night unto His mighty path, and He is God Who hath been merciful unto the believers. God hath written for the believers, through His grace, that which He hath ordained for the people of Paradise, and verily God encompasseth all things.

God hath witnessed thy discourse in the Two Sacred Precincts with that distant soul among those who came from the Holy Land, and God's proof hath been completed after the Book unto all the worlds. God shall soon guide those who desire God and His friends from before the Gate, through the decree of the Book, according to what God hath ordained concerning the mystery of the Return.

Verily God hath completed His proof against him who stood upon the Path, after the descent of verses from God, the True One, through the truth with wondrous truth. God hath saved him through His grace and caused him to enter upon the spacious Path, and verily God watcheth over all things.

God hath turned in forgiveness unto those who preceded, who went forth from the Holy Land unto the Gate for the Most Great Remembrance, and who followed thee in the hour of solitude after none knew of thy greatest matter.

God hath not ordained for the people of the City of the Remembrance, nor for those round about it, that they should hold back from the Most Great Remembrance of God, nor should they prefer their own selves to His Self. For verily thou art, in the Mother Book, the Self of the Remembrance, and wast inscribed, before the creation of the heavens and earth, through the truth with the truth, round about the Fire.

Verily God hath enjoined upon the believers who have written that which God caused to flow upon the Pen of the Remembrance with black ink, that they should efface it with the waters of the Euphrates. God hath forbidden the believers from keeping that page for themselves. Fear ye God\[...\]

Verily God hath enjoined upon the believers who have recorded that which God hath caused to flow from the Pen of Remembrance in black ink, to erase it with pure water, for God hath forbidden the believers to retain such pages for themselves. Fear ye God and make no distinction between that which God hath caused to flow from the Pen of the Bab. Gather it in pure truth and inscribe it in the finest hand with clarifying ink, for every soul shall most surely be questioned at the appointed station on the Path. O Solace of Mine eyes! Verily have I found the people of the Ridvan beseeching the Bab, taking refuge in God with truth, and verily God, thy Lord, hath ever been bountiful unto all the worlds. Therefore sprinkle upon them drops of camphor water that their hearts may find repose in that Gate, as a grace from God, the Most High. And He, verily, is the Most High, the Great. O Solace of Mine eyes! Say: Are ye in doubt concerning God's Cause? Who is it that createth you from dust, then from a drop, then from a clot, then from a morsel of flesh? Is there any creator besides God in truth? Glory be unto Him! He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and He is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Exalted is God above what the infidels say regarding the mystery of Our Most Great Name. This We have decreed for them from their own description naught but the fire, and verily the remembrance of God is the Most High in truth. He is God and is verily witness unto all things. O ye believers! Fear God and think not of God, the Truth, with vain imaginings, for God hath decreed for the deniers the fire of the coffin, and verily God's decree hath ever existed in the souls of the deniers. O Solace of Mine eyes! Speak forth from thy tongue with truth upon wondrous truth, for the Book hath fulfilled its term, and He is God, powerful over all things. O peoples of the heavens and the earth! I call you to witness for Myself, and God sufficeth, and His trusted ones before Me, as witness unto the truth by the Most High Truth. I am the servant of God and the Word of Truth. I have desired naught in a single letter of that Book save as God, my Lord, hath willed. He is the Truth and hath ever been Most High, All-Wise. O Solace of Mine eyes! Verily the people of blindness have spoken as did the brothers of Joseph and have confessed to the greatest shortcoming. Say: No reproach shall be upon you this day. God shall soon forgive you if ye remain steadfast in the field of battle. Verily God, your Lord, hath ever been Forgiving, All-Wise.

The Surah of the Bee

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate \[...\]

Take this my shirt and cast it upon my father's face, he will recover his sight; and bring me all your family. KAHM'A. Verily We have revealed unto the bee, saying: Take thou from the mountains palaces for a sanctified dwelling - this is the lightning-like sign - and from the trees a station for Divine Unity - this is the eastern sign - and from that which they build on the path of Oneness - this is the western grindstone - for God, the Most High, and God hath knowledge of all things. Then eat of all signs submissively in the path of this Gate of Remembrance. There issueth from their bellies a fluid, the elixir, unified in its blessings and diverse in its colors, wherein is healing for the believers. Verily God hath power over all things. God is the Creator of all things through His power, and God is verily well-informed of what men do in truth. O ye believers! Fear God regarding this Most Great Word heated by the fire of truth, for verily it is in truth a witness before God, the Most High. O people of the veils! Hear the call of God from the tongue of the Most Great Remembrance - verily I am God, there is no God but Him. Verily the likeness of the Remembrance is as molten gold in fire, flowing to all hidden things by God's leave, and God is the Mighty, the Ancient. O people of the Throne! Hear My call from around the shrine, from the tongue of this Tree planted on the exalted Mount, adorned with impregnable golden leaves - verily I am God, there is no God but Him. No soul hath borne in the path of the Remembrance any matter of war or wealth but We have ordained for it the Garden of Paradise and good pleasure in truth, and verily God hath power over all things. Verily We cause the earth to quake in the Hour by the command of the Remembrance, and We hold it back in truth through his prayer, else would the earth in truth have swallowed its inhabitants, and God hath power over all things. God hath preferred some over others in knowledge of the Remembrance - do ye then deny His favor falsely? Verily it is the truth from God and shall in truth be questioned. God hath made for you mates from among yourselves in truth, and verily God hath made believing women as leaves of the Lote Tree around the Gate, and verily God hath knowledge of all things. O ye believers! Fear God and speak not concerning God's veiled mystery around the unveiled solution except the truth, for God hath made the mystery of the Dove witness over the people of the cloud, and verily God is witness over all things. O Solace of the Eyes! Speak in the melody of the Beloved at the Throne and clothe the words in the garment of breezes, for God hath loved thy call in the crimson Dove unclothed, and God is thy Guardian. O Concourse of Lights! Hear My call from around the Point of Water at the center of earth - God, there is no God but Him, Lord of the worlds, and God is the Mighty, the Wise. Verily I am the Fire around the Mount, speaking in truth, praiseworthy. Verily I am the Light above the Mount, exalted. Verily I am the crimson circular Point revolving around God its Creator, sealed in truth. Verily I am the Most Great Glorious Plant in truth, purposed above the dawning place of the flowing ruby above the Mount. Verily I am the Splendor from the Glory - none comprehendeth the Splendor save the Self of Glory\[...\]

I am verily the effulgence of praise; none can comprehend this effulgence save the very essence of praise, single and unique. O people of the earth! By the true God, God hath made the mystery of this Gate profound, and in its Arabic description there can be found naught save that which is elegant and manifest. And in these verses are examples for those possessed of understanding, who circle round the Gate, bowing in prostration to the truth through the truth. Do ye worship, besides God, that which possesseth nothing, while sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Most High, before and after, having been inscribed in the Mother Book in truth concerning the station of the Gate? Strike not similitudes for God, for He is the Truth: there is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Mighty, the Wise. God hath given the example of two men: one standing firm in the Cause, commanding justice and goodness, and the other standing in the fire, calling with fire unto the fire. Which of these two is upon the truth, if ye can read a single letter of the Book? Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is ever cognizant of what ye do. God hath ordained today for His servant a recompense upon the line - a truth from the white ruled page - and verily God hath knowledge of all things. And for the servant who acteth with equity are two gardens upon the line of equity, and for him who beareth the cup of water, a cup from the pure water of Kawthar, and verily God is witness over all things. With God are the hidden mysteries manifest in truth, and God hath not ordained the matter of the Remembrance more distant than the Command, and He is powerful over all things. We have brought you forth from the wombs to aid the truth on the Day of the Remembrance, and We have endowed you with hearing, sight and hearts that ye might give thanks to the true Remembrance in the upright Balance. We have subjected the birds in the atmosphere of heaven - is there any that can withhold them save God in truth? And verily God is witness over all things. O Dayspring! Remember the name of thy Lord, besides Whom there is no God, for verily He is the Most High, the All-Wise. O Hour of Dawn! Remember before the rising of the sun from the Dawning-Place of the Gate, for verily the Day of God is nearer than the twinkling of an eye, and the decree in the Mother Book hath been accomplished. O people of the earth! Hearken unto the call of this Soul standing in the atmosphere of the divine cloud: "Praise be to God Who hath caused me to know, through this Gate, the paths of the unitarians through the word of justice - this is of God's grace upon me, and verily He is independent of all worlds." O people of Arafat! Arise from around the tomb and hearken to My call from this Shirt stained with My blood and pierced by four thousand arrows from the people of polytheism from among My servants. Verily I am the Slain One between the Two Rivers, I am the One Sacrificed by Two Swords, I am the One Cast upon Two Lands, I am the Speaker in Two Stations, testifying that there is no God but God, alone, there is no God but Him, and He is the Mighty, the Wise. And verily God hath revealed to a thread of that Shirt reddened with purified blood: "Verily I am God, besides Whom there is no God." O people of Paradise! Take My Shirt, the sign of this Most Great Remembrance, and cast it upon the face of the Proof, your Leader, that he may look upon you with your sight, and your sight today, God willing, concerning that Gate hath become penetrating in truth through the truth. O Solace of Mine Eyes! Say: Verily I am the Hour - do ye not know that the Hour in truth upon the truth hath drawn nigh in the Mother Book? Say: Verily I am the House, having been raised up in truth.

O Solace of Mine eyes! Today your insight, God willing, concerning that Gate hath been truly and verily piercing. Say: I am indeed the Hour - will ye not understand? Verily the Hour, in truth and by the truth, hath in the Mother Book been nigh. Say: I am indeed the House that hath been truly raised up. And verily I am the Lamp in the Niche that hath been, through God the Truth and by the truth, illuminating. And verily I am the Fire within the Light above the light of Sinai in the Land of Joy, that hath been concealed round about the Fire. O Solace of Mine eyes! Say to the believers among the peoples of earth and heaven: Bring unto Me your kindred from among the people of effacement in the Gathering, by leave of God, the Exalted. For God hath desired to recompense you in this Gate with the Most Great Truth. And He is God, Who hath ever been knowing of all things.

The Surah of Proclamation

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

When the caravan departed, their father said: "Verily I perceive the fragrance of Joseph, even though ye may think me doting." Alif Lam Mim. God hath sent down unto thee the Book as an exposition of all things, and as guidance and mercy unto those possessed of understanding who have been standing around the Gate. O people of the Throne! Circle ye round about the House. Hear ye My call from that crimson chamber of moist carnelian, devoid of any intimation to any soul, if ye be of them that prostrate themselves around the Throne. Verily I am God, there is no God but Him, your Creator, established upon the straight line around these waters, and I have been in truth a witness unto all the worlds. Verily this Remembrance is the path of them that are detached unto Me in all the Tablets, inscribed in truth by hands. O peoples of earth and heaven! I bear witness before God and call you to witness that neither I nor this servant is aught but the servant of God and His Word, calling you unto the pure Faith by God's leave, the Praiseworthy. God and His loved ones suffice as witnesses unto Me and unto this My Remembrance, in truth, by the truth. By God the Truth! Whosoever claimeth otherwise regarding Us, God shall curse him, as shall all the angels and believers among the people of the earth, and God hath ordained for him in the Hereafter no portion save the heat of the fire. Verily the likeness of certain verses in this Book is as the Word of Sinai from God in the Furqan, and We send down naught save by the truth from God, the One, the Single, the Alone, and He is the One besides Whom there is no God, and He is God Who hath ever been All-Knowing of all things. O Solace of Mine eyes! Say: I am the servant of God and His Most Great Word. No soul conceiveth aught concerning Me save that the All-Merciful and His angels and the believers have verily blessed him, in truth, by the truth, and God hath ever been merciful unto the believers. And whoso imagineth aught falsely - verily We shall rend him to pieces on the Day of Resurrection, and God hath ever been observant of what ye do. And God hath ordained from the skins of cattle an established station for mankind, inscribed in truth. And from their wool and their fur and their hair, knowledge for the people of the world until that appointed time. And God hath created naught save that He hath created its like in the Throne, witnessed in shadow. And there is nothing save it existeth in the Book as two pairs, irrevocably ordained in truth by the truth. And upon thee is only to deliver the truth unto him who accepteth it, and God hath ever been thy helper and witness. And people have recognized the favor of God like the sun at its zenith, then deny it according to Satan's desire. What have I to do with these idolaters among the polytheists? God shall soon judge in truth between them and this solace of Mine eyes, this Persian Youth, the Truth apart from man, and God, the All-Knowing, sufficeth as One having power. Verily on the Day of Decision God shall raise up from every nation a witness over the people of the earth, and this Remembrance is a witness from God over creation concerning what ye used to do in your secret and public acts, and verily God is the Truth Who hath ever been knowing of all things. On that Day shall the guilty behold their partners whom they called upon besides God, and they shall say: "Our Lord! These are our partners whom we called upon besides Thee, so send upon them double the punishment for having turned us away from God's path" - this One Who hath ever been standing upright before God, the Ancient, upon the Throne. And We answered their prayer \[...\]

And they say: "Our Lord! These are our partners whom we called upon besides Thee," whereupon We shall send upon them double the chastisement for having turned others away from the path of God, the Most High, Who hath stood established and upright upon the Throne before God, the Ancient of Days. We have answered their prayer and have sent down upon them double the chastisement, for verily God doth not wrong mankind by so much as a whit. O ye who believe! This Remembrance, in truth, commandeth you naught save justice and goodness and return in truth to the Paradise of His good-pleasure. By God! He hath indeed forbidden you in many passages of the Book from indecency, evil and transgression, and He is, before God your Lord, the All-Knowing of the stations of command and prohibition. Fear ye God in His Cause, for verily He hath been, in all the Tablets, All-Knowing and All-Wise. Fulfill ye God's covenant concerning His Remembrance, and break not the sign of His oneness after its confirmation, for verily the mystery of God concerning His right hath been difficult and supremely great. Had God willed, He would have made you one community around the Remembrance, but God leadeth astray whom He willeth and guideth whom He willeth, and He is the All-Wise in truth, and God hath power over all things. Purchase not God's covenant for the price of referring to idols and false deities, for verily God's covenant concerning this Most Great Gate hath been, in the Mother Book, severe. By God! That which ye possess shall perish, while that which is with the Remembrance shall endure with God, and verily God is witness over all things. And no soul, whether male or female, who hath acted in the path of the Remembrance in truth, but We have written their reward in this Book in truth, and the decree concerning that Gate hath been accomplished. Verily We have elevated the stations of the Gates through the power of God, the Most Great, in truth, and verily this Remembrance is He Who is intended by the All-Knowing before the All-Wise, and He is God Who hath been, in truth, praised. And verily this Remembrance is a truth from God, the True One, and God hath written for his visitor that he visiteth Us, the People of the House. Verily He is the All-Praised, and God encompasseth all things. This is a Book whose verses have been detailed from One All-Wise, Whose power over the worlds hath been equal. Verily God hath ordained parables for those who know not the Remembrance through the Gate; there have they devised for themselves a similitude from parables, and verily God is witness over all things. Verily those who do evil in the paths of falsehood - We have ordained for them repentance from the Truth, and soon shall ye find God, your True Master, All-Forgiving and All-Generous. This indeed is the straight line established upon the paths of the Way in the thread of justice. This religion is the faith of Abraham which, in the Mother Book, hath been upright in truth upon the truth, and verily the Remembrance in truth standeth firm upon the eternal religion round about the Fire, upright upon the Most Great Truth. Verily We have ordained the Sabbath for those who differed concerning the Remembrance, and God shall soon judge between them on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and He is God Who is witness over all things. O Solace of Mine eyes! Call thou unto the Most Great Path of God with pure wisdom and leave the paths of difference upon the straight line in truth, for verily God, thy Lord, is the Truth, and God is witness over the believers. Verily We have ordained counsel for the people of the sea from among the people of water in truth, and We have decreed disputation for the people of the land from among the people of submission, with pure truth upon the Most Great Truth.

We have ordained disputation for the righteous ones among the people of submission, with pure truth upon the Most Great Truth. And verily the Remembrance, as He willeth, by God's leave, hath been commanded in truth. O Solace of Mine eyes! Be patient, and be not patient save through God, and grieve not at their evil deeds, for verily I am the Truth, the All-Encompassing, behind thee, and God thy Lord hath been witness over all things. O Solace of Mine eyes! By God, thy Lord will assuredly reward thee for thy patience in God with a goodly reward, and verily God thy Lord hath been witness over all things. O Solace of Mine eyes! By the Truth, We have sufficed in thy Cause with the testimony of God, His angels, and those endowed with knowledge among His creation, and verily God hath been cognizant of His believing servants. O people of the Throne! Hear My call from the dawning-place of the sun and its setting-place, and from the zenith point at its center, and from the line that gloweth white in the blackness of night with its rays. Verily I am God, there is no God but Me, the Ever-Living, Who hath been the Self-Subsisting. When the caravan of spirits from the people of the Gate departed in death unto your father, the Most Great Lord, the Truth speaketh in truth: Verily I perceive the fragrance of the Remembrance from your hearts, and ye shall verily abide today beneath the shadow of the Throne, by leave of God, the Most High.

The Surah of Knowledge

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

They say: "By God, thou art indeed in thine ancient error." Obey God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Truth, and He is God, the Lord of all worlds, Who hath ever been established upon Truth through Truth. God hath never decreed for His servants any authority from Satan over Truth. O people of the earth! Doth not the All-Merciful suffice you as a true Guardian of Truth? Do ye feel secure from the most grievous chastisement if ye take any besides the Gate as your guardian contrary to Truth? Do ye feel secure from the punishment of the Hereafter or the raging tempest in this world? Fear ye God and be not deceived by your own selves, for death is truth and unto God, your true Lord, shall be your final return, Who hath ever been the true destination through Truth. Whoso is blind in the Dispensation of the Remembrance shall in the Hereafter be debarred from attaining the presence of God, the Truth. Verily We shall call mankind on that Day through their Leader. Whoso is not given his book shall be reckoned among the foremost ones in the Mother Book. And whoso is given the Book of Remembrance in his right hand, these shall be among the companions of the Gate, round about the Gate, who have ever been mentioned in Truth through Truth. But as for him who is given his book in his left hand, he shall cry out for destruction and shall be made to drink from the waters of Zaqqum by the hands of stern angels in the Fire, from the essence of Fire, by God's leave, the Most High - and He is God, powerful over all things. By God the Truth! No soul hath transgressed regarding this Youth beyond a letter of servitude, except that God hath cursed him in truth, and the angels and those possessed of knowledge among creation disavow such a soul, and by the decree of the Gate his abode hath assuredly been fixed as the Fire in truth through Truth. Verily this Book is an exposition based on interpretation from God, the All-Wise - and He is God, Who hath ever been mighty and ancient. None knoweth its interpretation save God and whom We will in truth. Ask ye the Remembrance concerning its interpretation, for God hath taught him in a handful of dust the knowledge of the Book, all of it, in truth through Truth. This is God's way for those Whom We sent before thee among the Gates, and thou shalt find no change in Our way regarding thine own true self through Truth. O Solace of Mine eyes! Say: The Truth hath come in truth from God, the Truth, and God hath caused falsehood to perish through justice, and God is witness over all things. God hath sent down verses in truth upon the Most Great Truth, wherein there is naught for the believers save healing and submission. And We have decreed naught therein for the idolaters save the Fire in a valley that hath been ordained in the Mother Book as scalding. Verily We have ordained deeds for souls, each according to its capacity, and thy Lord God is in truth witness over all things. God hath ordained exaltation through His Cause round about the Gate in truth, yet the All-Merciful bringeth you but little of the knowledge of the Remembrance. Say: By God the Truth! Were the two worlds to gather together to produce the like of this Book from God, they would never be able, even were We to send unto them the like of themselves for everything that hath been named with the name of that thing, thousands upon thousands of times. Glorified be God, the Truth! Can any besides God bring forth the like of this Criterion? Nay, by the Truth, nay! And God is witness over all things. And when the idolaters question thee concerning ornate speech and the transformation of things in their form, say: "My Lord, if He willeth, is powerful over all things. Am I aught but a mortal from the Truth unto creation, who hath been, by God's leave, an upright Gate round about justice?"

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

Say: If my Lord willed, He would have power over all things in their transformation and form. Am I anything but a mortal from the Truth unto creation? I have been, by God's leave, an upright gate surrounding justice. Whomsoever God guides, he is guided concerning the Gate, and whomsoever God leads astray, he is fire, from fire unto fire, and he shall enter the fire - what an evil destination to arrive at.

God hath created the heavens and earth through His power and hath sent down the Book in truth through His wisdom, yet man hath ever been miserly regarding the decree of the Book. We have indeed given the Remembrance all the verses in that Gate, from the Gate to the Book, from the presence of the Truth. Verily I know the Pharaoh of the Gate, for he hath been far removed from the Gate.

O people of the earth! Fear God on the Day We shall gather you in truth around the Path in throngs. We have decreed to the people of the Cloud that ye shall strike twice in your chambers concerning the Two Names who were, in truth and through truth, Ali and Hamid.

When the promise comes to pass, We shall send against you servants with pure knowledge from the Truth. Verily Our promise hath been ordained in the Mother Book. God hath destined for Our servant return upon return, and soon shall they witness God's Cause in the latter return, witnessed through penetrating vision, in truth and through truth.

We have, by God's leave and in truth, caused you to enter the Mosque as We caused you to enter the first time, that ye might utterly destroy what they had exalted. Verily the fire hath been, in truth, by leave of God the Exalted, as a prison for the unbelievers.

This is a Book from God through the Most Great Truth, that people might attain the summit of knowledge through God's grace - and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise. Knowledge with God hath ever been the knowledge of Truth, and His verses on the straight path surround the Remembrance.

As for those who deny the Remembrance after the Book, We have prepared for them, in the land of iron through the new truth, a great fire.

O people of the Cloud! Hear My call from the Snow-Point at the pole of the Mountain of Cold, which was upon the fire that was held fast in the heart of the Remembrance.

Say: Both he who is blessed and he who is in the fire - there is no God but He, and He is God, the Exalted, the Wise.

O Snow-Point in My heart! Say: O people of the Morning! Fear God and say not concerning the Remembrance that he was held back in the shadow of the Ancient One.

By God the Truth! God created him for Himself, and the shadow hath been lifted from his temple. He is God's Light in the heavens and earth of hearts, and God hath not ordained for His light in that station any likeness among the multitude of likenesses.

The Surah of Battle

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

When the bearer of glad tidings arrived, he cast it upon his face and his sight returned. He said: "Did I not tell you that I know from God that which ye know not?"

Alif. Lam. Mim. Sad.

O ye who believe! God hath prescribed for you warfare in the path of this Most Great Remembrance, in truth, a command above all commands, and this command was, in the Mother Book, momentous.

O ye who believe! When ye encounter a host of unbelievers, strengthen your hearts for the meeting of the hereafter and its delights. Remember God and trust in Him, for God is the Truth, and God hath ever been predominant in His Cause, though people read not even a few letters of the knowledge of the Book inscribed in that Gate.

O ye who believe! Be not like those who left their homes to champion the Truth, but when they reached the Cause, Satan turned them from the path of God, and they said: "No victor have we today." When they beheld the host of the idolaters, they retreated from battle, saying: "We have seen of the Truth what ye see not; verily we fear God, the Lord of all worlds, the All-Glorious."

These shall behold how the angels smite their faces with the sword, for the decree hath been fulfilled, and the decree in that Gate was destined.

Verily, the worst of souls in God's sight is he who breaketh his covenant after making it, and who violateth His command after accepting it. God, verily, is independent of all worlds.

Whoso desireth aught, desireth it for himself. Glory belongeth unto God and His loved ones, and this decree hath been inscribed in the Mother Book.

Verily, many among the people desire not the Truth save through deception. Sufficient unto thee is God, besides Whom there is no God. He it is Who hath confirmed thee with His word, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise.

God hath united the hearts of the believers for His remembrance, and these idolaters shall never prevail in aught, for judgment belongeth to God, the Truth, and He is God, the Mighty, the Powerful.

O Solace of Mine eyes! God sufficeth thee, and His angels, and those who have followed thee among the sincere believers, though they be few. O Solace of Mine eyes! Urge the believers to battle in Our presence, for God hath guaranteed them Paradise in truth, and God's promise hath ever been fulfilled in that Gate with compelling power.

O ye who believe! Why do ye fear death when God, Who is the Truth, is with you? Wheresoever ye may be, desire ye the supreme recompense of God and the meeting with your Lord, the Truth, for the abode of the hereafter with God, your Lord, hath ever been, in supreme truth, praiseworthy.

Those who have believed and emigrated with the Remembrance, and striven with their wealth and their lives in God's path - these are recorded eternally in the firm covenant as companions of Paradise.

The believers are protectors, one of another, according to the Covenant in the Most Great Remembrance. Fear ye God regarding its violation, for God is witness over all things.

This is a decree from God unto the Remembrance in truth: Slay not the idolaters during the four sacred months, that people may know the sanctity of the Remembrance in truth after the Book. Verily, God hath ever been compassionate with the believers.

O People of the Book! Slay not the idolaters in the sacred month, nor at the Sacred House of the Ka'bah, nor in what the Remembrance hath forbidden you after the Book, for God hath desired justice in truth upon truth for you.

O peoples of the earth! By God the Truth, the Book hath not been revealed except with truth, that ye may bear witness to the truth of the Remembrance through the Remembrance, and that ye may aid Him in the Cause on the day of battle. Know ye in truth that God will question you concerning His Cause on the Day of Judgment with manifest truth, and verily God hath ever been witness over all things.

O people of the Remembrance! Be ye believers in God and content with His decree in truth, for God hath ordained death as the portion of every soul, and there can be no averting the decree of God, your True Lord.

Verily those who fight in the path of God the Truth are alive with God, and God sustaineth them in the Garden of Eden with abundant flowing waters. Therein shall they have whatsoever their souls desire, and they shall look to none save God their True Lord, and verily He hath power over all things.

O ye who believe! When the Remembrance calleth you from God the Truth unto battle, then gather ye round about the Truth and be ye content with His decree, that ye may be written in the Mother Book as companions of the Gate. Reject not Our command unto you from Our presence, for verily God is witness over all things. If ye answer not Our Remembrance, then await Our chastisement in truth, for We have power over all things in truth.

Soon shall We gather the rejecters on the Day of Resurrection upon the path around the Fire, blind. O peoples of the East and West! Come forth from your homes to aid God in truth, for verily God's victory is nigh in the Mother Book. We have made Our Remembrance your guardian in truth from Our own Self. Turn ye therefore unto God in truth, for God is aware of what ye do.

O people! Why do ye fear when God the Truth is your Protector and is with you wheresoever ye turn? There is the face of God, and verily God encompasseth all the worlds. God hath preferred those who strive above those who sit still with a bounty none can encompass save He, and God is witness over all things.

O servants of the All-Merciful! Fear ye the day when Our servant shall call you in truth as an offering unto God the Truth. Whoso is slain in God's path in truth, his reward falleth upon God, and His decree hath been ordained in the Book of God round about the Gate.

O ye believers! Be patient with God's hosts in the army of truth, for God is your helper in truth. Follow not your vain desires after the Book hath come unto you from your Lord regarding the station of the Remembrance with manifest and mighty truth.

Fear ye, O servants of God, the day when Our servant shall call you with the word of magnification in truth, with a voice of truth made weak. O people of the Heights! Arise from your holy seats, for the Most Great Remembrance desireth to walk in the land of your knowledge, and He is the Proclaimer from before God, the Exalted, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise.

O servants of the All-Merciful! God hath revealed unto Me in the white line from the dawning-place of the morn: "Verily I am God, there is no God but I. Hearken unto the call of this My Most Great Self from your Lord God, the True Protector, for verily He encompasseth the worlds." And no soul hath come with the crimson shirt from among the shirts of the Gate \[...\]

He is God, the Mighty, the All-Wise!

O servants of the All-Merciful! God hath verily revealed unto Me in the white path at daybreak: "I am God, there is none other God but Me." Hearken unto the call of My Most Great Self. This is from your Lord God, the True One, Who hath ever encompassed all worlds. No soul that hath come with the crimson shirt from among the shirts of the Gate upon the face of his heart, but his eyes have turned back toward God, seeing the Truth by the Truth. At that moment the people gaze toward the hem of the shirt, making no reference to God, the True One, by any means, and therefore they are recorded as being among the people of the Gate round about the Fire. And He is God, the Witness unto all things. Verily God hath ever been the All-Knowing, encompassing all worlds.

The Surah of Battle. In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

Say: Did I not tell you that I know from God what ye know not? O people! Answer ye the call of God in truth and gather around the Most Great Word at the Mention, for God hath in truth ordained it as irrevocable in the Mother Book. Slay ye the idolaters except during the four sacred months, but when these ordained months have passed, then slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, take them captive and besiege them in truth. Ye shall surely find your deeds with God, all praised in the dominion of the land of Eden. And if any of the believers seek thy protection, grant it until he heareth the Word of God in this Book, for thus hath it been decreed in the Mother Book. God hath not granted the idolaters any covenant with our followers to enter the Sacred Territory. These are infidels who believe not in God and His signs, and God is witness over all things. O thou beloved! Urge the believers to battle. If there be among you ten steadfast men, they shall, by God's leave, overcome a thousand, for God strengtheneth them through our prayers with mighty strength from before the Gate. These are they whose hearts God hath created from bars of iron, and in each soul hath He placed the strength of forty men who were brave upon earth and mighty in truth. Be patient, O people of patience, for God is with you at that Gate as a watchful guardian. Ye shall not attain unto righteousness until ye sacrifice yourselves for Our sake in God's path, the Exalted, the Mighty, with complete devotion. Let not Satan's whisperings grieve you, for God hath blocked his path for those who trust in Him, and God is ever vigilant over His believing servants. Let not knowledge of God in this Book delude you falsely from the truth. Slay ye the idolaters in God's path wherever God hath permitted you through the tongue of the Gate, and turn not away from God's command, for if ye turn away ye shall have no power over anything in truth, nor shall ye find on the Day of Resurrection any helper besides God, the Exalted, the Faithful. Verily God defendeth those who believe from the word of polytheism, and God, your Lord, the Merciful, loveth not any treacherous one who in the Mother Book was ungrateful. Those who have left their homes without God's permission have indeed rendered their deeds void without knowledge, nor have they read from the knowledge of the Book a single light letter. Were it not for God's causing men to repel one another in truth, the souls of the believers would have been altered and none would remember God's name at the Gate of the Mention in faithful truth, and God is ever aware of His servants. God hath prescribed for you in truth that when ye are established in the land, ye shall perform the prayer, give the alms, and fight against the idolaters in God's path with pure truth, desiring the religion of God, the Most High, and God is Mighty, Wise. O believers! Strive in God with the striving due unto Him, and be ye helpers and maintainers of the religion. God hath chosen you and He is your Protector, so hold ye fast, all together, to God's Most Great Cord in mighty truth. He is God, the Mighty, the Praised. God hath indeed ordained from among the believers men who have been true to what We covenanted with them. Among them are some who have fulfilled their vow \[...\]

Among the believers are men who have remained true to what We have covenanted with them. Some of them have fulfilled their pledge, and some still wait, and you shall never find any alteration in the decree of God, your Lord, established in truth. God hath sufficed the believers in battle, and verily God is, concerning what you have earned, All-Knowing and Ever-Helpful.

No believing man or woman, when God and His Remembrance have decreed a matter, hath any choice in their affairs, for God is Mighty, Powerful. Those who obey God concerning Our Remembrance and fear God, fearing none except Him - God shall suffice them in truth, for God hath power over all things. Is not God sufficient for His servant? God sufficeth as a Reckoner in truth.

O people! Fear God on the day when the Remembrance shall call unto you from God in distress and with mighty authority. Gather ye at the Corner and circle the House, unified in devotion to God, the Most High, for He is God, the Most Exalted, the Great.

Deprive not yourselves of what God hath ordained for you in the Mother Book concerning this exalted Gate. Choose not the calf instead of God, for if ye do as they did before you, ye shall find no helper besides God, the Most High, on the Day of Resurrection, nor shall ye find any protector on the Day of Overwhelming besides God in truth.

Know ye that God hath prescribed battle for you in truth - a mighty command ordained in the Mother Book. Those who fight in God's path fear none save God, the True One, and the matter concerning the believers hath been decreed by God, the Most High.

Verily God hath purchased from the believers their souls, for they shall have in that Gate a soul which is, in truth, praiseworthy. Those who bear witness in Our path shall surely meet God, their Lord, in the Garden of Eternity, well-pleased and joyous.

When the Herald calleth to battle, answer ye God and His Remembrance, for We shall aid you with victory such as ye have not seen. Hasten to God's greatest good-pleasure and dwell not in this vain, fleeting life, for this Most Great Gate is, with God, the True One, the best of destinations.

O concourse of believers! Conquer ye the lands and their people for the pure religion of God. Accept no tribute from the unbelievers, for religion belongeth unto God in the Mother Book and hath been inscribed in truth.

O ye believers! Whether ye die or are slain in God's path by leave of the Remembrance, unto God your Creator shall ye be gathered, and He is the Self-Sufficient, the Powerful, and God is cognizant of all things.

O people of the earth! Fight in the path of God's exalted Remembrance against those who fight you. Turn not aside in the midst of battle from the truth, and be ye steadfast helpers of His religion through God, the True One.

O Solace of Mine Eyes! Say: Did I not reveal unto you in the Book of Remembrance that I know from God, concerning the Most Great Remembrance and Our Word, that which nothing knoweth? And verily God hath power over all things.

\[Surih of Jihad. In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate\]

They said: "O our father! Ask forgiveness for our sins, for we have indeed been at fault." O people of the earth! Hearken unto My call! The Truth, by the truth, declareth: Were men to know what God hath prepared for them in the path of this Remembrance, they would not accept for themselves the earth and all that is therein, even were God to create for them seven thousand like unto it apart from His command. Verily God is the Truth, and all else besides Him is falsehood. God hath prepared for those martyred in His path gardens vast indeed in truth, wherein ye shall find no mention save the pure remembrance of God. Therein shall ye have pure companions and whatsoever your souls desire and what your minds cannot encompass - a bounty from God unto you. This indeed is the supreme bounty in the Book of God, which was inscribed by the hands of the Remembrance with crimson ink.

O people of the Remembrance! If ye obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back upon your heels in battle. Then blame none but yourselves. God hath detailed His ordinances unto you. Fear God and be the best helpers of God, the Single One, the Praised. For those who strive in the path of tyranny, God hath ordained naught in the Hereafter save the fire as their portion.

O servants of the All-Merciful! Answer the call of God's herald from near the Gate. Fear ye the Day when He shall summon you with your souls and wealth, alone in truth. Verily God hath power over all things, and God is indeed knowing of all things. God is the Protector of the believers. Do ye seek bounty from other than God? Glory be to God, the Great! Say: The bounty is in Our hands; We bestow it upon whom We will and withdraw it from whom We will. He is God, powerful over all things.

O hosts of Truth! When ye encounter the idolaters in battle, fear not their numbers, for We have inscribed terror of you upon their hearts. Slay the idolaters and leave not upon the earth any trace of the unbelievers, until the earth and all thereon be purified for the awaited Remnant of God. Work for God, the Praiseworthy, in the path of the Gate in a praiseworthy manner.

O people of the earth! Fear God and turn not away from the Remembrance after the victory of the idolaters over you, for God hath ordained for you after grief an enduring joy. Think not of God thoughts of ignorance unlike the truth, and say not concerning the Remembrance: "Have we any part in the matter?" Know ye not that all authority belongs to God? Were ye not to fight in the path of the Remembrance, We would create another people who would fight in God's path, the True One, hoping for His reward. God knoweth while ye know but little of the knowledge of the Book.

O concourse of lovers! Fear God on the day when the Remembrance shall arise at the meeting of the two hosts, and a herald shall cry out with the takbir: "O people of the Sacred Place! Hasten unto God and slay those who place the Book upon their forms. By your Lord! I am indeed the True Book, and these idolaters know not even a small portion of a letter of the knowledge of the Book."

Think not of those who are slain or die in the path of the Remembrance as dead. God, the Truth, by the truth, declareth: They are alive with God, and God provideth them from Our presence with fresh meat and pure water from the Camphor Spring. Verily those who answer the Remembrance after His call \[...\]

And pure water from a fountain of camphor. Verily those who answer the Remembrance after His call and aid Him until the appointed time - these are the companions of Paradise, wherein they shall abide forever and ever according to the decree of the Book. O ye believers! Shun the idolaters altogether and say: "Sufficient is God for us, and excellent is He as Guardian, and excellent is the Supreme Remembrance as a Helper and Protector." When thou didst call the believers to battle, thou didst see the hypocrites turning the believers away from thee wrongfully, through Satan's vain imaginings. How then will it be when calamity befalleth them from the Remembrance because of what their hands have wrought, and they come unto thee swearing by God the Most High: "We desired naught but good and conciliation"? God knoweth what their hearts have concealed of hypocrisy in truth. Be forbearing toward mankind through thy grace, and warn them of God's Most Great Remembrance, and give them glad tidings of the Most Great Name, and speak unto them face to face words of compelling justice, that perchance they may remember God's wondrous verses in truth, though it be but little. When they wronged their own souls, make known to them that when they come unto thee seeking God's forgiveness, and thou dost ask forgiveness of God for them, they will surely find God forgiving and merciful unto truth. Nay, by thy life, the idolaters will not believe in thee until thou judgest concerning themselves according to the Book's decree - there will they find no protector save in complete submission. When We prescribed for the believers, saying: "Slay yourselves in the path of this Most Great Remembrance for God your True Lord," none carried it out save a few among the foremost. Know ye not that God hath made grace to reside in this Path, and We do verily ordain from His presence for the believers a mighty recompense in truth? O people of the earth! Fear God your Lord and follow the light of God which He hath sent down with Me in truth, for it is the Straight Path with the All-Merciful and hath been established at the Point of Fire. Those who follow God's Most Great Remembrance - these are the companions of Paradise in the Mother Book, together with the Prophets, the truthful ones, the martyrs and the righteous. How excellent is God's reward, and how lofty the station! This is God's supreme grace for those who desire God and His friends in truth upon the Most Great Truth. Sufficient is God as One Who knoweth His believing servants in truth. O people of the earth! God writeth no affliction for any soul except for what its hands have earned through remoteness from the Remembrance. Ask ye of God through the Remembrance, that ye may be numbered with the believers as witnesses in God's path. Verily those who fight in the path of the Remembrance in truth, whether they be slain or whether they be victorious - We shall surely grant them, by God's leave, a mighty recompense from the presence of the Remembrance on the Day of Resurrection. God hath not prescribed fighting for the helpless among men, nor for children, nor women, nor the sick, nor the blind, nor the deaf. God desireth ease for you, so turn ye unto the Truth and purchase Paradise through martyrdom in the path of the Remembrance. Be content with God, the All-Praised, and patient. Those who fight in Thy path - they are in truth the friends in God's Book. As for those who fight in the path of the Evil One - these are the people of the Fire. Slay ye the party of Satan, for Satan's stratagem is ever weak according to the decree of the Book. O people of the earth! Fear God and press not hard upon the Remembrance in the thick of battle, for little is the enjoyment of this world.

In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate

Do not place excessive emphasis on remembrance during the heat of battle, for a small remembrance suffices. Indeed, the goods of this world are few, and God has prepared for you in the hereafter a goodly destination, for He is powerful over all things.

Fight in the path of God, for God has ordained upon the peoples of the East and West to aid thee, until the lands and all who dwell therein are purified. Verily God, your Lord, the Most Merciful, is witness over all things.

O Solace of Mine Eyes! Should some among the unbelievers fail to help thee, grieve not, for I have been with thee as a witness to the truth by the truth.

Verily God has prepared for the unbelievers the heat of steel and severe chastisement.

O peoples of the earth! If you claim the abode of the hereafter exclusively for yourselves apart from the people of the Remembrance, then seek proof from God if you are confident in your own testimony before the Remembrance, and be content with God, the Most High, both witnessing and witnessed.

O peoples of the earth! Associate nothing with God and submit your faces to God, besides Whom there is no other god. Those who are slain in the path of God by leave of the Remembrance are deemed virtuous at the Gate, and their reward is with their Lord. No sorrow shall touch them, nor has God ordained for them any fear on the Day of Resurrection, in truth, by the truth. And in that Gate they are indeed praised in truth, by the truth.

O people of the surging, tempestuous crimson sea! Take hold of the helm of the ships by the hands of God, the Truth, for the Remembrance desires to join you through the word of justice by Our leave. He is the Fire that has been ordained in the pole of water.

O Most Great Sea of God and all that are upon it! Hear My call from every direction at the center of the water, and efface all directions through the negation of allusions, for God has revealed to Me at that White Point that, verily, I am God, there is no God but I, and I have ever been, in truth, the One Worshipped.

He said: "Soon shall I ask forgiveness for you from my Lord, for verily He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful."

O people of the earth! Say not of those who are slain in the path of God's Remembrance, the Most High, that they were not upon the truth. Nay, by your Lord! They are alive in Our presence, and We shall surely grant them a reward far greater than their deeds. They are the living ones in the true religion of God, pure and mighty.

We have revealed unto thee their martyrdom. Say: "We are God's and unto Him do we return." These are they upon whom are blessings from their Lord, and forgiveness, and divine good-pleasure from God, the Most Great. God hath inscribed their names in the Preserved Tablet with His own hands, hidden and treasured, veiled round about the Gate.

O ye believers! Turn ye unto God's Remembrance that is within you, for God hath guaranteed forgiveness through this Gate, and God is witness unto all things. Deprive not yourselves of that which God hath ordained for you in the Book until an appointed time. When God's promise cometh, ye shall not be able to secure for yourselves any good whatsoever, for the decree in the Mother Book hath been irrevocably fixed by leave of the Gate.

Were these two Dispensations from other than God, they would surely have found therein many contradictions. God hath commanded justice and benevolence, and that ye consume not the substance of others save in proper measure. This decree hath been irrevocably fixed in the Mother Book.

Verily God loveth those who struggle in His path. He is God, the All-Powerful over all things. He is God, the Vigilant over the believers. He is God, encompassing all things. Verily God is independent of all worlds. He is God, the All-Knowing of all things. God's punishment for those who hold back is grievous. God hath ordained Paradise for His servant in truth, and the decree in the Mother Book hath been irrevocably fixed in truth.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say unto Siyyid Husayn-i-'Alavi: "Fear not, for thou art indeed witnessed before the Gate in truth." Slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, except at the Sacred Mosque and the sanctuaries of your true Imams. If they attack you to slay you, then slay them, for such is their recompense from God, their Lord, for their rejection of the signs of God, the Most High. Persecution is more grievous than slaying in thy Lord's sight. Therefore slay the idolaters until persecution ceaseth and religion is wholly for God, the Most High, pure and unsullied.

Spend your wealth in God's path and do good, for God is ever watchful over the God-fearing. Whatever good ye do, ye shall find it recorded in God's presence in the Mother Book. God hath prescribed for you fighting in His Cause, sincere for God in truth, mighty and powerful.

Think ye that ye will enter Paradise after turning away from martyrdom? Nay, by your Lord! None shall enter Paradise save those who in the Covenant were foremost in remembering Us, and the decree in the Mother Book hath been fixed. When the herald calleth you to battle, hasten ye to Paradise, for it and its people yearn for you. Soon shall ye find in Paradise God's eternal, everlasting, and magnificent kingdom.

O believers! Ye know not in this world your stations which God hath ordained for you in the eternal Paradise. By your Lord! God hath prepared for the sincere among you a mighty spirit of truth.

O people of the earth! Mount ye upon the marked steeds \[...\]

O believers! You know not in this world the stations which God has ordained for you in the eternal Paradise. By your Lord! God has prepared for the sincere among you a mighty spiritual reality. O people of the earth! Mount your marked steeds and beasts and march forth to join the army of Truth. How often has a small force, by God's leave, vanquished a mighty host. Let the believers put their trust in God, for He has power over all things.

O people of the lands of Persia! Turn eagerly to the remembrance of God, the Truth, and give one another glad tidings of Paradise before there comes a Day wherein there shall be no bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession, and wherein the Fire shall encompass the wrongdoers.

God - there is no God but He, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting. Nothing is like unto Him, and He alone is worshipped in truth. Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. There is no God but He, and He is knowing of all things.

Verily, We shall intercede on the Day of Resurrection, by God's leave, for those who have borne witness before this Remembrance of Ours and have been among His vicegerents on earth. None encompasses any portion of Our knowledge save those whom We will, as God has willed concerning His servant and His Remembrance. His dominion encompasses the heavens and the earth, and their preservation wearies Him not. He is the Most High in God's Book in truth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.

There is no compulsion in this upright Faith. The horizons and souls have been filled with its guidance. Whosoever rejects false deities and believes in this Remembrance of Ours has indeed believed in God and His signs, and has grasped the firm handle. And verily, the Truth concerning warfare has been a witness to the Truth in truth.

Surih of Jihad

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

When they went in unto Joseph, he took his parents into his shelter and said: "Enter ye into Egypt, God willing, in security." O ye who believe! Prostrate yourselves before your Lord, beside Whom there is no God, and enter wholly into peace, and place your trust in God, for verily the Remembrance is truth and God is the vigilant Observer of all things. O ye who believe! Purify the Holy Land of its corruptions, for it hath been solely for God apart from all men, and slay the idolaters wherever ye find them by leave of the Remembrance. Take not from among these idolaters a protector for yourselves, for God hath willed their misguidance through their unbelief, and whomsoever God leadeth astray, no protector hath he, nor hath God ordained for him in the Mother Book any helper. O people of the Remembrance! Fear ye God on the Day when the Remembrance shall arise with the cry of "God is Most Great" in the midst of war at the meeting of the two hosts. Grieve not, but rejoice in Paradise. Turn not away from God, the Truth, for God hath inscribed for those who turn away a mighty fire on the Day of Judgment, kindled from their own selves and encompassing them about, and they shall find for themselves no helper besides God, the Most High. O people of the earth! Why do ye think that he who greeteth you with peace from the presence of the Remembrance is not a believer? Verily God hath made the tongues of the believers mirrors of their hearts, and God, your true Lord, is well aware of what the wrong-doers do. God hath not ordained for the one who striveth the like of him who sitteth still. God hath preferred those who strive above those who sit still by a bounty which none knoweth save God, and verily the bounty of your Lord, the Most Merciful, is in the Book of God, the Most High, most great. O people of the earth! Let not Satan deceive you by causing you to sit still rather than ascend unto God, your Worshipped Lord, for the goods of this world are vain, and the reward of the Hereafter with God is, in the Mother Book, most great. Whosoever desireth to go forth from his house as an emigrant unto the Remembrance, for God alone, We, by God the Truth, shall write for him the reward of the Hereafter, and God is powerful over all things. O people of the earth! Observe ye the middle prayer with the Most Great Remembrance, for the Remembrance forbiddeth you from idolatry and evil, and calleth you unto God, the Truth, and He is the Most High, and He is God, the Witness over all things. O ye who believe! When the Book cometh unto you from the Remembrance, then turn ye unto God, the Truth, and purchase weapons for yourselves for the day of gathering, for fighting hath been ordained for the believers by God's leave in this His Most Great Book, contingent upon truth through truth. O ye who believe! Whoso among you turneth back from this Most Great Remembrance, God will surely bring a people whom He loveth as they love God, the Truth, mighty against the believers who strive in God's path upon the straight line, fearing naught in truth through truth. This is God's most great bounty which He bestoweth on whom He willeth, and He is God, the Witness over all things. O people of the earth! When the Herald calleth to prayer with the Remembrance, then turn ye unto God, the Truth, for God hath prepared for the sincere among you a boundless reward with Him, and God increaseth His bounty for whomsoever He willeth, and He is God, powerful over all things. O Concourse of Light! Turn ye unto the Most Great Ridvan.

And He is God, the One who has power over all things. O concourse of lights! Yearn for the Most Great Paradise and consent to martyrdom in the path of the Remembrance, that ye may find your Master to be true to His promise and, in truth, gracious by virtue of the truth. O people of the earth! Slay the idolaters according to the decree of the Book after the permission of the Gate, for God shall soon judge between you and the Remembrance in the gathering place of resurrection with justice ordained. By My glory and majesty! No soul hath been slain in His path but its recompense hath been recorded in the Book, concealed in truth by the truth. And verily I shall not suffer to be lost the reward of those who strive in the path of truth, and I have indeed planted with Mine own hands trees in the form of glory, and upon their branches birds of crimson pearl that glorify God night and day, and verily God is cognizant of all things. And verily many among the people of the Book dispute with thee after the verses, as if they were being driven to the fire. Turn away from them and trust in God, thy Lord. Verily He is cognizant of all things. God desireth through the Remembrance to establish truth and nullify falsehood through truth, and verily God is the Truth, and He is well-informed of His believing servants. O ye believers! Seek no help in the field of battle save from anything but God and trust in Him, for God hath prescribed for Himself your assistance in truth and hath commanded thousands of angels to descend in truth for your aid. Say: All victory is in the hand of God, and He is God, the One who has power over all things. And verily We have sent down upon you from heaven purifying water that ye may cleanse yourselves from satanic desires and drink, through the remembrance of the Most Great Martyr, this cool and pleasant draught. And verily We command the angels to cast terror into the hearts of the idolaters and to strengthen the believers upon the pure path with the upright line of the standing Alif. O angels of God! Strike the necks of these idolaters by God's leave, for they have opposed the Remembrance through falsehood, and these are the companions of the fire, recorded in truth by the truth. O ye believers! When ye meet the idolaters in the field of battle, turn not your backs to them, and whoso turneth his back to them save for strategic reasons hath indeed incurred God's wrath, and his abode shall be hell - a wretched destination. And thou didst not will when thou didst will, but God willed. Say to the believers: Ye fight not the idolaters, but God hath slain them through His power, and He is God, the One who encompasseth all things. O concourse of lights! Hear God's call from around the throne: Verily I am God, there is no God but Him. No soul hath been slain in the path of this Most Great Soul but We record for it the slaying of all souls in God's path - the True One - all together in truth by the truth. So yearn for God's most great reward and obey the Remembrance at the time of glorification, and verily God, your Lord, the Merciful, is cognizant of all things. The worst of creatures in the sight of God in the Mother Book are the deaf and dumb who, when they hear these verses, understand not and falsely imagine lies about the Most Great Remembrance in vain. O concourse of believers! Answer God in the call of the Remembrance from My presence, for God cometh between man and his soul, and verily God is watchful over all things. O people of the earth! Be not false to God\[...\]

And verily God has ever been the Vigilant Observer over all things. O people of the earth! Betray not God and His Remembrance, for should ye do so, ye will have betrayed your own selves. Verily God is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Merciful. Your wealth and your children are but a trial for your souls, therefore fear ye God, for the gathering unto God, the Most High, has been inscribed in truth, by the truth. O people of bounty! Hearken unto this verdant Leaf, sprung from the divine Tree of eternity in the breast of the Remembrance - this, in the name of God, the Most Great. Verily I am God, there is no God but I, the Most High, and verily I have ever been the All-Knowing over the worlds. O people of high station! Enter, God willing, the Egypt of Oneness, for Joseph sits upon the throne of the heart, hidden yet established in truth upon the truth, and in the heart of the fire has he been witnessed. O God, our Lord! Verily my father has died in truth and beheld me not upon the Most Great Word. Therefore inspire him, O my Lord, with my Cause in his resting-place among the angels of the Throne, and make him steadfast in the Most Great Word through Thy bounty, and inscribe his name among those who have been praised around the Gate in the Balance of the Remembrance. And write, O God, for him and for my mother what befits Thee, for Thou art worthy of bounty in truth, and Thou hast ever been powerful over all things. O Solace of Mine eyes! Say by God's leave unto thy parents and unto the people of the Gate: Enter the land of Egypt, God willing, in truth, that ye may be secured from the fire in truth. And He is God, Who has ever been witness over all things.

The Surah of Worship. In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

And He raised his parents upon the throne, and they fell down in prostration before him, and he said: "O my father! This is the interpretation of my vision of old. My Lord hath made it come true. He was indeed good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you from the desert after Satan had stirred up strife between me and my brothers. Verily my Lord is gracious to whom He willeth. He is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."

Alif. Lam. Mim.

God is He besides Whom there is no god, and He is the One Who encompasseth all things. O Solace of Mine Eyes! When those who have associated partners with God plot against thee in thy Cause, turn away from them, for verily We have decreed for them the Greater Fire on the Day of Gathering, and God is witness over all things. Soon will the polytheists say: "O God! If this Remembrance be indeed the truth from Thee, then rain down upon us a chastisement from heaven in truth upon truth, that we might witness it." God hath cursed them for their unbelief. Know they not that God would not chastise them while the Greater Path is among them, nor while they seek forgiveness of God? And verily God hath power over all things.

Those who have emigrated with the Remembrance for the Greater Holy War - God hath ordained for them their true Protector, goodly provision in this world, and in the Hereafter a great reward with God, preserved in the Mother Book in truth upon truth within this Gate. O ye who believe! Fight against the polytheists collectively after the Remembrance's permission, until religion is wholly for God alone. And if they desist, then verily God your true Lord is well-aware of what they do.

O ye who believe! When ye meet a company of unbelievers, strengthen your hearts by remembering the Hereafter and its delights. Remember God and trust in Him, for God is the Truth and ever-prevailing in His Cause, though people read not even a portion of the letters inscribed in the Book. Obey the Remembrance in all things and dispute not concerning any matter in His presence, lest your strength depart from you. Be patient, for God is the Truth, and God watcheth over the patient ones.

O ye who believe! Be not like those who left their homes to champion the Truth, but when they arrived Satan turned them from God's path and they said: "None can overcome us this day." Yet when they beheld the polytheist host, they turned back from battle saying: "Truly we see what ye see not - we fear God, the Lord of the worlds, exceedingly." These are they who behold how the angels smite their faces with swords. The matter is decreed, and in the Mother Book was it ever decreed.

Verily We alter not Our grace toward any people until they first alter their condition toward Our favors. Therefore taste ye the torment of fire. Verily your Lord, the True God, is Strong, Severe. Soon shall We destroy the wrongdoers as We destroyed the people of Pharaoh, with justice and grievous chastisement. The worst of souls before God is he who breaketh his covenant after pledging it, and violateth His command after accepting it. Verily God is independent of all worlds.

Whosoever willeth aught, willeth in truth for his own self. Verily might belongeth to God and His loved ones, as hath been written in truth upon truth in the Mother Book. Grieve not at the suspicions of the deniers in thy presence, but trust in God. He is the All-Hearing, and He is God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. O people of the earth! Whatsoever ye spend in God's true path \[...\]

He is God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing!

O people of the earth! Whatsoever ye spend in the path of God, the Truth, ye shall surely find it preserved in the hands of the Preservers. Many among the people desire not the Truth except through deception. Sufficient unto thee is God, besides Whom there is no God. He it is Who hath strengthened thee through His Word, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise.

God hath united the believers in His remembrance, and these shall not prevail in aught, for authority belongeth to God, the Truth, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise.

O Solace of Mine eyes! God sufficeth thee, and His angels, and those believers who follow thee, though they be few. Urge the believers to fight before thee, for God hath guaranteed them Paradise in truth, and verily God's promise hath been recorded in the Mother Book as one that must needs be fulfilled, according to the Most Great Covenant.

O ye believers! Why do ye fear death, when God, the Truth, is with you wheresoever ye may be? Set your hearts upon the supreme reward of God and meeting your True Lord, for verily the abode of the Hereafter is praiseworthy in the sight of God, your Lord, the All-Merciful.

Verily, they who have believed and emigrated with the Remembrance, and striven with their wealth and their lives in God's path - these are they who abide by the Most Great Covenant and are the companions of Paradise, wherein they shall dwell forever, inscribed in truth by the truth.

The believers are protectors one of another according to the Covenant of the Remembrance. Fear God regarding its violation, for verily God is witness over all things.

God hath ordained for the believing emigrants the forgiveness of the Remembrance and the supreme good-pleasure, decreed in the Book.

We have ordained for blood relations precedence over each other, according to what God hath prescribed in the Mother Book.

This is a Book from God to the Remembrance in truth: Slay not the idolaters during four months, that men may know the sanctity of the Remembrance after the Book. Verily God is compassionate to the believers.

O People of the Book! Slay not the idolaters in the Sacred Month, nor at the Sacred House of the Kaaba, nor in what the Remembrance hath forbidden you after the Book. God desireth justice in truth for you, though ye know naught of the knowledge of the Book, save a little.

O ye believers! God hath not sent down a verse in the Book or in the horizons save that men might know of a truth that the Remembrance is truth from God, and He is God Who knoweth all things.

O people of the Remembrance! Be believers in God and content with His decree in truth. God hath ordained for every soul to taste of death, and there is no averting the decree of God, the Truth, in very truth.

O people of the earth! By your Lord, the Truth, besides Whom there is no God, He hath left no argument for any soul after the Remembrance. Be ye therefore patient in God, the Praiseworthy, the True, the Faithful.

O ye believers! If ye are steadfast in your claim to the Most Great Relief in truth, then follow this Most Great Remembrance in truth. For the helper in His Cause is as the helper in My Cause, and verily God is informed of all things.

O ye believers! When the True Remembrance permitteth in truth, then hasten to the day of the Most Great Pilgrimage and turn not aside from any matter of truth, for verily God and His angels and His Messengers are quit of those who turn aside.

His Messengers stand clear of those who turn away, and verily God is the Truth, and verily this is the exalted Remembrance, and He is the Truth upon the straight path, and hath ever been known. God hath not ordained any covenant for the idolaters after the Book, and verily God wrongeth not mankind in aught. When the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters for the straight religion, and follow not the footsteps of Satan, for God hath truly prepared in the Day of Resurrection a great fire for those who turn away. Verily these souls, if they repent and turn unto the Remembrance and establish prayer and aid the Truth with their wealth and their lives, God will forgive them, for God doth ever watch over all things. He desireth not that the idolaters should maintain the houses of remembrance, for God is in truth independent of all the worlds. We do prescribe unto the believers that they should maintain the houses of God through their aid of the Remembrance. Is then he who aideth the Remembrance like unto him who buildeth a house upon the Truth? Nay, by no means! He who aideth the Remembrance is as one who hath believed in God and the Last Day, and in the hereafter shall dwell beloved upon verdant cushions of Paradise.

O Solace of Mine Eyes! Say by Our leave, and fear not, for thy word before God, the Most High, hath ever been greatly exalted in truth. O people of sobriety! Behold Me in the depths of effacement. God hath revealed unto Me: "Verily I am God, there is no God but Me." When I raised thy parents upon the throne, I said unto them: "Fall ye down in prostration at the Gate in praiseworthy manner," for in the Mother Book he was inscribed among the foremost of those who prostrate themselves before God, the Most High.

O Solace of Mine Eyes! Say unto thy first parents, the two Luminaries, the two Lights in the mystery of the latter ones from the first two lines in the two Names: "O my father! This is the interpretation of the vision of mankind in my true vision, and my Lord hath made it a reality, and God hath shown favor unto my followers when He delivered them from prison after the setting of the moon, and after Satan had sown discord between me and them without indicating the Holy Land here. Praise be to God Who hath lifted sorrow from them through His power, as He willeth for whatsoever He willeth. Verily He is the All-Knowing, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise."

The Surah of Battle

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

O Lord! Thou hast given me of sovereignty and hast taught me the interpretation of events. Creator of the heavens and earth! Thou art my Guardian in this world and the next. Make me to die a Muslim and join me with the righteous. K.H.Y.A.S.

O people of remembrance! Strive in the path of the Most Great God. This remembrance is God's truth, for God hath prepared degrees of mercy for those among you who strive, and God's grace upon the strivers hath been abundantly recorded in the Mother Book.

O ye believers! Do ye love women and children and riches more than martyrdom in the path of the Remembrance? Know ye that God's remembrance is truth and that this world is perishable, and God hath not ordained for it lasting permanence forever. And verily the abode of the hereafter, for those who desire God and His chosen ones, endureth through the eternity of the All-Merciful. This is God's supreme grace which was recorded as mighty in the Mother Book.

God hath aided you through many trials, then hath He sent down the tranquility of the Remembrance upon your hearts that ye might be thankful to God, the Most High, through the power of the Gate.

O people of faith! By God the Truth, the idolaters are unclean, so permit them not to approach the Sacred Mosque nor the Sacred House unless they believe in God, besides Whom there is no God, and follow the path of truth with sincere words. Then may they enter with God's leave, for God doth take account of all things.

Fight those who believe not in God nor His chosen ones, nor prohibit what God and His chosen ones have prohibited. Such are they who stand at the boundary of polytheism and are recorded thus in the Mother Book.

Many among the people consume the wealth of the believers unjustly and hoard gold and silver for themselves rather than spending in the path of holy war for the sake of the Remembrance. These are they who are truly recorded among the people of the pit.

The number of months with God in God's Book is twelve months, whereof four are sacred. This decree in God's Book hath been concealed within the sphere of fire. God hath written in the Mother Book that among the sacred months is the month of Muharram, preserved and treasured for thyself in truth.

By God's decree hath the decree of God, the Most High, been irrevocably ordained.

O ye believers! Fight the idolaters collectively even as they reject the Remembrance collectively. Purify the earth for the Proof and fear God, for the Remembrance taketh account of the believers.

When thou sayest to the believers "Go forth in God's pure path," they cling heavily to earth with its ornaments. Are ye content with this world's life in preference to the Most Great Remembrance? Why ponder ye not the Criterion with true understanding?

God strengtheneth with His remembrance whomsoever He willeth among His servants. The second of the two was an unbeliever in the cave. God hath made the evil word the lowest and God's Word the highest. God prevaileth in His purpose and God knoweth all things.

O ye believers! By God the Truth, did ye but know what I know concerning this Remembrance, ye would not hesitate to sacrifice yourselves before Him. Know ye that God's kingdom in the hereafter is, in God's sight, supreme in truth.

When believers ask thy leave to remain behind, say: "My covenant with God is truth and He is God, the Most High, the Most Great."

O ye believers! Attribute not action unto God \[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most High, the Most Great!

O ye who believe! Attribute not any deed unto God or unto yourselves, for verily dominion resteth uniquely in His hands, in truth. Say: Nothing shall befall us save what God hath prescribed for us in truth. He is our Protector, and He is God Who hath ever been the Guardian over all things. And this is indeed one of the two most excellent things that, in the Mother Book, hath been inscribed round about the Fire.

O ye who believe! Were ye to expend all the treasures of the earth in the path of God, without the Covenant of the Remembrance, God would not accept aught from you, and ye shall, on the Day of Distinction, enter into the Fire - and evil indeed is the Fire as a destination.

Marvel not at the abundance of wealth and children among the idolaters, for God desireth to chastise them in this earthly life and in the life to come, and God hath prepared for them, in truth and by the truth, a grievous punishment.

The idolaters rejoice in their wealth, turning away from the Most Great Remembrance of God within their souls, and they are loath to strive in the path of the Remembrance with love. They have gathered for war to manifest their idolatry against God within themselves, against the Remembrance, in ways hidden from the truth.

Say unto these idolaters: By your Lord! The fire of the Fire is more intense in heat than the deed of idolatry in the path of the Remembrance. Wait ye therefore, for God hath ever been a witness over all peoples.

Those who go not forth with the Remembrance and sit with those who sit in the Fire, and who reject the Book and the Remembrance - God will not accept their plea. And should one of them die, pray not over him, neither stand at his grave, for he hath been inscribed in this Book as one of the idolaters.

O people of the earth! Marvel not at the abundance of wealth and children among some of the unbelievers, for God hath ordained in truth and by the truth that were the world to possess any value with God, even as much as a trifle, the unbelievers would not obtain even a drink of water. God desireth to chastise them in this world and the next, and He is God Who hath ever been knowing of all things.

O Solace of Mine Eyes! When the Command cometh from My presence, summon the people to battle, for God hath stored up for thy day men mighty as mountains in strength, and these have been witnessed in the Mother Book as bearing the name of the Remembrance of God, the Most High.

When any of the believers cometh unto thee seeking leave to remain behind, say: My Lord hath covenanted with me concerning battle, and God accepteth no excuse from anyone save those among you who are weak. Yearn ye for the Most Great Paradise, for this world is transient, while the abode of the Hereafter with God, the Ancient of Days, hath been great in the Mother Book, in truth and by the truth.

Should they desire sedition, grant them leave to remain behind, and impose not upon those of kinship save with most proper consent. Make them understand that the Word of God is indeed the Most Great, and that those who strive in God's path have ever been steadfast upon the straight path.

O people of the earth! By the True God! God hath sent down the Book only in truth, that ye might bear witness to the truth of the Remembrance through the Remembrance, and that ye might aid Him in the Cause on the day of battle. Know ye in truth that God will question you concerning His Cause on the Day of Resurrection, by the witnessed truth, and God hath ever been witness over all things.

Those who have emigrated with the Remembrance for holy war - God, their True Lord, hath ordained for them provision in this world, while the reward of the Hereafter with God, the Great One, hath been established in the Mother Book, in truth and upon the truth, within this Gate.

O people of the Throne! Hear My call from above the Throne: Verily I am God, there is no God but Me. By My glory I declare that no soul hath been slain in the path of this Remembrance except \[...\]

And the reward of the hereafter with God is great in the Mother Book, by the truth and upon the truth, and hath been in this Gate ordained. O people of the Throne! Hear My call from above the Throne: "Verily, I am God, there is no God but I." By My glory I declare: no soul hath been slain in the path of this Remembrance but its reward hath fallen upon Me, and God will surely recompense it with the most excellent reward and a goodly return, and its decree hath been in the Mother Book, by the truth and upon the truth, upraised. And when those who make excuses among the Arabs come seeking permission to remain behind, say: "Unto God belongeth the conclusive argument of the truth." And God hath not exempted from fighting save the helpless among men and those who are unable to go forth in the path of truth, and for the sick there is a right to be excused from fighting. Thus doth God make plain unto you the ordinances of the Book, that ye may be thankful unto God, the Praiseworthy. And God hath written for those who desire to go forth with the Remembrance to aid the Cause but are unable due to lack of means, the reward of those who strive, and God is ever watchful over all things. And God hath written for the foremost among the emigrants and the helpers who followed the Remembrance with goodly submission in the hour of its inception, gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide forever - this is the supreme triumph - and this decree hath been written in the Mother Book in the name of the Gate. O Solace of Mine eyes! Purchase the souls of the believers with Paradise, for God hath indeed purchased the souls of the strivers through the Most Great Name aforetime, and God's promise in the Mother Book hath been fulfilled. How excellent is the transaction with God, with the Most Great Remembrance, and God's covenant in the Mother Book shall be questioned. O people of the earth! Fight the worshippers of idols and of Lat and Uzza, and leave not on earth any of the unbelievers, by the truth and upon the truth. And God hath willed to purify the earth and all upon it for His truth alone, according to the knowledge of the Book, by the truth and upon the truth, soon to come. And He is God, the Witness over all things. And He is God, Who encompasseth all the worlds. And verily God is independent of all the worlds.

Surih of the Pilgrimage

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

That is among the tidings of the unseen which We reveal unto thee. Thou wast not with them when they resolved upon their stratagem. God, beside Whom there is no other God, hath sent down the Book unto mankind wherein lieth the exposition of all things, a mercy and glad tidings to those who believe in God and His signs in supreme truth. Verily God is powerful over all things. He it is Who created man from an extract of clay and breathed into him His spirit in truth, that men might be remembered in the Mother Book according to the Word of the Most Exalted Remembrance. We have indeed sent down the Remembrance on the Night of Power, that mankind might witness that God is powerful over all things. On that night every matter that hath been decreed by God in the Mother Book is made distinct. God hath created for you the Night of Power as a mystery of the Gate, destined to revolve around the Fire. In the Mother Book it is better than a thousand months, which hath been inscribed in truth around the Gate. God hath caused the Day of Ghadir and the Night of Power to be remembered in the sea of love around the Fire by the Remembrance. God hath prescribed for you the prayer of Ghadir and its fast in supreme truth, and the deeds on that day are inscribed in the Mother Book as the decree of ages according to the judgment of the Gate. O people of the East and West! Go forth from your homes to visit the Greater House of God according to the irrevocable decree of your Lord, that ye may be inscribed in the Mother Book around the Gate upon the supreme covenant. O ye who believe! Visit our forefather Husayn in the land of Taff, for God accepteth from his visitors their visitation in truth unto Himself, and this is the supreme triumph, and permission hath been inscribed in all the Tablets by the hands of the All-Merciful. God hath forbidden you to enter the Sacred Precinct except through the Gate, and this decree is truth in the Book of God and hath been inscribed in the Mother Book around the Fire. Know ye the Word of your life in this Gate and seek good in truth, and earn not sin by taking the calf instead of God, for verily the Cause of God hath been mighty in the Mother Book. Spend of manifest refinements and pure wealth in the path of God unto His loved ones. Whoso concealeth a testimony from himself against a soul hath been rejected in the Mother Book from around the Gate. God hath forbidden giving to those who associate partners with the Most High except in cases of kindness, for that hath been lifted by God's leave in His Book, and He is witness over all things. O company of jinn and men! Await the supreme Cause of God from this Arab Youth, Our servant, who hath been named Ali by God the Most High in the Mother Book. Seek deliverance from God, your True Lord, for God is powerful over all things. O people of the earth! God hath made trade lawful for you in His Book and hath forbidden usury. Whoso taketh even an atom's weight of usury from a soul, God will cause him to taste the heat of the Fire on the Day of Resurrection equal to a mighty mountain, and he shall have no helper in the Hereafter, nor shall he find for himself on the Day of Resurrection any protector or helper besides God, except those who repent and return to their source. God will forgive whom He willeth among His servants, for verily He is the Mighty, and He is God Who hath ever been merciful to the believers.

O ye who believe! God hath prescribed for you prayer with remembrance on Friday in truth, by the Most Great Truth, that ye might be recorded in the Mother Book as among those who pray around the Gate.

Remember God on the night of Friday with praise, in truth and by the truth. Verily God hath accepted your deeds on Friday night and its day from each of your weeks, through the truth of the Gate, by God's leave, the Most High, the Praised One.

O servants of the All-Merciful! Verily God and His angels and His messengers pray for our followers, therefore pray ye for them at the dawning of their remembrance and submit their cause unto God, the Most High, the Praised One.

O ye who believe! Eat of the good things wherewith God hath provided you, and draw not near unto usury, nor that which God hath forbidden in His Book aforetime and in this Book. Whoso doeth this hath borne in the days of the Gate, according to the decree of the Book, a manifest sin.

O ye who believe! Make not yourselves, while on earth, without valid excuse in truth, to be separate from the truth, for that is not praised in the Mother Book before God, your True Creator.

Marry believing women whom God hath made chaste according to the covenant of the Book by the pure truth. Verily your Lord God hath ever been merciful to the believers.

Marry the believing women according to the decree of the Book of God, your Lord, for Muhammad will glory in your numbers on the Day of Resurrection.

God will perpetually give them glad tidings of the Remembrance above the Remembrance, and thou shalt see no interruption in the bounties from God.

Observe the prayers at their appointed times and preserve especially the middle prayer, this Remembrance, and be praised by God, the Most High, in the paths of the Gate.

By thy Lord! God will not wrong anyone by so much as the weight of an atom. Whoso performeth a good deed, God will multiply it manifold in truth. And whoso committeth an evil deed, God will requite it with exact justice in truth.

We shall bring forth on the gathering ground from every nation a witness, and We shall bring thee as a witness against these predecessors.

O ye who believe! Draw not nigh unto the Remembrance, nor unto prayer, nor unto the Book while ye are intoxicated, until ye know what ye are saying. Touch not the Book save in a state of purity.

This is God's decree in His Book, and God is indeed Kind, Merciful to the believers.

O people of the earth! We have prescribed for you retaliation in cases of murder: a free person for a free person, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. But if anyone is forgiven by his brother for any part of what is due, then his reward with God is great in the Mother Book.

O Concourse of Lights! By God the Truth! The Most Great Word of God is assuredly a hidden truth, and He is God, the Ancient, the Mighty. Verily the mystery of this Gate is of tremendous import. Were all the oceans of the heavens and earth to become ink, and all things to become pens, ye would not attain nor be capable save of an unconnected Alif, even as now the Command is thus in truth, in the form of heaven and the temple of earth, existent with God, the Lord of all worlds.

O people of attraction from the Temple of Unity! Hear My call from that yellowed Leaf, severed with crimson oil from the Moving Tree in the atmosphere of the cloud - that for whose root God hath ordained nothing upon earth, yet by God's command it is planted in the air of the cloud by the hands of the Remembrance.

This indeed is thy Lord's straight path in the Mother Book. This indeed is the mystery within the innermost mystery, inscribed upon the line beneath the cloud and above the heaven. This indeed is the Arabian form in the Two, witnessed in truth around the Fire. This indeed is the truth, the right-sided temple in the Seventy - two paths mentioned in truth around the Fire, that the believers might be mentioned in that Book by the name of Truth upon the Truth. This indeed is the Light upon Sinai, the One manifest through the Names in the Concourse of Revelation. He is the Truth; none knoweth Him as befitteth Him save He Himself, and He is God, ever exalted and ancient.

This indeed is the Truth expressed in the melody of Batha, the Secret made manifest from the form of the exalted one, the treasured Light in the form of the Dove in the heart of the Fatimid. Exalted be God, His Creator, far above what the wrongdoers ascribe unto Him!

This indeed is the Secret of secrets that was inscribed round about the Water. This indeed is the Pole in the oceans of light that was concealed round about the Fire. This indeed is the Light of lights in the midst of mountains, on the right hand of the Throne behind the Qaf, that was hidden and treasured.

This indeed is the Garment of Manifestation and the Hidden Secret in the heavenly Books that was inscribed round about the Mystery. This indeed is the Tree of the Heart upon Mount Sinai that was witnessed by God, the Truth. These indeed are the sacred Leaves in the pavilions of the spheres of attributes that were written round about the Fire.

This indeed is the Truth in the Mother Book that was decreed round about the Fire. This indeed is the Point at the Beginning that appeared at the Center of the Seal, by the truth, by God's leave, the Ancient, the Praised One.

This indeed is the Secret in the praise of the Book concerning the mysteries of glory from the decree of Fire and Water that was made equal. This indeed is a portion from the Secret - the Secret of the Arabian Ahmad, the center of the Throne in the Water, who by the truth, for God, the Ancient, was both prostrate and beloved.

This indeed is the Secret inscribed in the heart of the Prophet that was by the truth of the Most High concealed. This indeed is the Hidden Mystery in the breast of the brilliant Arabian Friend that was inscribed round about the Fire.

This indeed is the Glorious Pearl in the shell of the Friend in the ocean of the cloud around Paradise that was preserved by God, the Praiseworthy. This indeed is the One Who flees from every refuge by the truth, and He is God Who was ever a witness over thee by the truth.

Thou wert indeed the holy corner of glorification by the truth and the very essence of magnification upon the truth by the truth, with great magnification.

This indeed is the Western Release by the truth upon the exalted hair for crushing after dissolution that was concealed in the Point of Fire. This indeed is the Buraq in the Supreme Concourse, naught resembleth it among the lightning, and it is the Supreme Example in the dissolution of the cloud that was witnessed round about the Fire.

O people of Paradise! Learn the path of servitude from this Bird, verdant in the atmosphere of the cloud and immersed in the sea of crimson musk. Crush yourselves with this white Fire by God, the Truth, if ye be able, that ye may possess the East and the West by the leave of God, the Sovereign of earth and heaven. He is indeed the All-Knowing by the truth, and He is God, powerful over all things.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say: I am the Glory and this is the path of God. I call unto God alone and unto the Expected Remnant. I am indeed the Observer in the two Easts, with clear vision by the truth - I and those who follow me were questioned by the truth round about the Fire.

O Concourse of Lights! Hear My call from this singing Bird in the atmosphere of heaven, in the lofty melody of David the Prophet.

Unto Me, unto Me belongs the decree of the two waters in the two heavens, and unto Me, unto Me belongs the decree of the two airs in the two earths, and unto Me, unto Me belong the four letters in the two names, and unto Me, unto Me belong the four airs in the two lines from two mysteries, and unto Me, unto Me belongs the Bearer of the Throne, seven and one, and unto Me, unto Me belong the eight Paradises, both manifest and hidden, and unto Me, unto Me belongs the decree of the two primal Lights in the two Mounts, and unto Me, unto Me belongs the decree of the two Luminaries in the two latter lines from those two depths, and unto Me, unto Me belongs the decree of the heavens in eight from the Gate as two gates, and unto Me, unto Me belongs the decree of the earths in seven from the Gate with two letters, and unto Me, unto Me belongs all command and judgment, and there is no God but Him, our Lord, the One, the Peerless, and He is God, the Most High, the Most Great.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say: Whatsoever God hath caused to flow from My Pen in this Book was solely by God's leave, the True One, and I have not borne the Book in the mystery of that Gate save as a letter from the Gate which hath ever been witnessed round about the water.

Glorified be God, the True One, there is no God but Him, and He is God, the All-Powerful over all things. And He is God, Independent of all worlds.

The Surih of the Servant

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.

And whoso followeth Me, we are verily upon the truth, by the truth, round about the Fire, accountable.

And We sent none before thee but men from among the people of the towns, to whom We revealed Our Message. Have they not journeyed in the land to see what was the end of those before them? And surely the abode of the Hereafter is best for those who fear God. Will ye not then understand? O people of the Throne! Hearken unto the call of your Lord, the All-Merciful, beside Whom there is no other God, through the tongue of this Remembrance, this Youth, the son of Ali, the Arabian, Who was witnessed in the Mother Book. Listen then to what is revealed unto thee from thy Lord: Verily, I am God, there is no God but Me. Nothing is like unto Him, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.

O people of the earth! Hearken unto the call of the birds upon the tree, verdant with the camphor of the Divine Manifestation, in description of this Arabian Youth, the Muhammadan, the Alid, the Fatimid, the one of Mecca and Medina, of Abtah and Iraq, through that which the All-Merciful hath revealed upon their leaves. Verily, He is the Most High, and He is God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

This is a Youth, fair in complexion, with striking eyes beneath level brows, of balanced form like molten gold, with shoulders like purified silver inclined as goblets, whose majesty hath appeared above the majesty of those gone before, and whose mercy hath spread throughout creation like the mercy of the two Hasans. The Pole Star of heaven hath seen none like unto Him in justice, like the two just ones, and in grace like the two luminaries, gathering in His two names from the most exalted Beloved Ones, the isthmus between the two Commands in the mystery of the two depths, standing like the letter Alif between two lines at the center of the two worlds \[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Praised!

Praise be to God Who hath granted unto the apple of Mine eye in his youth Ahmad, whom We have raised up unto God in truth upon a letter from the knowledge of the Book. And verily the decree concerning his affair hath been determined in the knowledge of the Tablet from God, the Truth.

O apple of Mine eye! Be thou patient with thy Lord's decree concerning thee, for God doeth what He willeth in truth, and He is the All-Wise in justice. He is God, thy Ancient Lord, Who hath ever been praised in His decree.

I have obeyed God's command in truth through God, and I am content with God as my Lord, besides Whom there is no other God. I desire naught save what God, my Lord, willeth in truth, and He is the One Who witnesseth all things.

Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and those who love the remembrance of God, the Most Great, in pure truth, from among the believing men and believing women. Verily Thou art the Possessor of grace and bounty, and Thou art, in truth, powerful over all things.

We have established upon the Most Great Throne the Word of Love in truth for Our servant, and verily God and His angels and His chosen ones are witnesses unto him in all matters at the Point of Fire, according to what God hath decreed in the Book and what He shall decree. They have been witnesses in his right in truth.

We have indeed preferred Our remembrance above all the worlds, inasmuch as God, the Truth, hath answered unto Himself. He is the One, the Single, the Self-Subsisting, besides Whom there is no other God, and He is the Witness over all things.

O apple of Mine eye! Let not the words of the polytheists grieve thee when they say: "What aileth this Persian youth who eateth food and walketh in the markets and converseth with people?" This is a weighty word of truth that was previously spoken concerning Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and ye shall never find any change in Our ways of the past or future.

O people of the earth! Give thanks unto God, for We have delivered you from the divines of conjecture and have brought you to the right side of the blessed Mount - this comely Arabian Youth in Whose grasp God hath placed the kingdom of the heavens and earth, folded within a handful of dust upon the earth.

O people of the cloud! Hearken unto My call from My remembrance concerning the Point of Fire. This is God, besides Whom there is no other God. Worship Him, then, upon the upright Alif around the Gate, for this is the Path that extendeth before God, the Truth.

O apple of Mine eye! Proclaim then at the Mount, the mystery of Light: "Verily I am the servant" in truth at the Center of Revelation from the Dayspring of Light. There is no God but Him, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O people of the cloud! Know ye that this is an Arabian Youth Who speaketh with truth at the Pole of Water from the Center of Fire. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, and He is God, the Ancient and Mighty.

This indeed is the Light in the Fire above the Water. There is no God but Him, and He is God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

And when He ascendeth to the atmosphere of heaven from the Throne, He speaketh from the mystery of dust - God's mighty secret - in the concourse of air from the most exalted cloud, and He is God, the Witness over all things.

He is God, the Witness over all things! When He sits upon the dust, He speaks of the mystery of the Beloved like unto a fish writhing upon the ground, as though He had been slain upon the earth by the sword of men, alone in truth and by the truth. And I behold Him performing ablutions with His blood for the hidden secret between the lines at the time of manifestation. When those who are veiled from meeting the Beloved see Him, they imagine Him to be like snow settled upon the peak of the greatest cold mountain. And when those who have rent asunder the veils of attributes see Him, they confess before God the Truth that they know not even a little concerning His reality. When is He cast down upon the earth? When is He prevented from the throne? Glory be to God, the Most High! This indeed is the mystery sanctified above the description of attributes, severed. God is Most Great! God is Most Great, with a most exalted greatness! None knoweth how to mention Him save He Himself, and He is God, the Mighty, the Wise.

Verily this is a youth of the essence of clay at the dawning-place in the Muhammadan Sun, who was in the Mother Book, in the mystery of light, dawning upon the point of fire, stationed. And verily this is a youth of salt and the greatest mercury - the Persians say this is a king of Shiraz, though it was not and shall not be thus, for verily in the Mother Book he was from the fruit of the Arabs and the noblest of nobles, from the eloquent company around the fire, recorded. He is the light in the mount and the mount in the dawning-place of manifestation, which was by God's leave concealed upon the mountain of the snow of manifestation at the point of joy. Verily this is an Arab youth in creation but non-Arab in truth before the Lord and creation, who was around the fire, concerning the mystery of dust at the point of attributes, witnessed.

O concourse of lights! Hearken unto My call from this refined, white leaf: "Verily I am God, there is no God but Me. Say: None believe in Our signs save those who, when reminded of them, fall down in prostration to God, the Truth, and glorify their Lord with praise, and they are not proud." In truth, He is God, your True Lord, and is witness over all things.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Speak by God's leave in the melody of the two beloveds and say: "Verily I am the Truth with the two lights in the two years, and verily I am the Speaker from God in the two mounts, and verily I am the One Who sends down by God these two Furqans upon the two beloveds in the two names - this unto the beloved Muhammad, advanced in years in the two years - wherein are two Furqans from the Lord of the worlds unto the people of the two paths from the people of the East and West. And verily God was witness over the worlds."

O people of the earth! God hath testified to the truth, and His angels and the believers are witnesses with justice that this Remembrance is the servant of God and Our Word of truth. Verily God hath sent down the verses unto His awaited Proof, and I, by God's leave, have sent them down with the angels of the divine cloud unto the heart of My Greatest Remembrance, that people might believe in God and His words, and that they might assist the Remembrance in My Greatest Cause. And He is God, the Witness over all things.

O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Establish prayer in truth upon a line of the equator at the declining of the sun, by God's leave, in the realm of glory, and remember God, thy Lord, until the darkness of night, according to the decree of the Book, prescribed from the mystery of the Gate.

Remember thou God thy Lord until the darkness of night, according to the decree of the Book, from the mystery of the Gate, as prescribed. And pray for the Dawning Place of the Light in the horizon of darkness, for verily this is the Book of Dawn which hath been witnessed in the Mother Book. And arise from the night for the Ancient Remembrance of thy Lord, Who is none other than He, for verily thou art in truth the Station of the Praised One in the Mother Book, and thou wert, of a truth, the object of His purpose with God. And say: "O Lord! Cause me to enter into an ocean of wonderment in the station of Thy love, and forgive those who have entered this Gate in truth, in the places of the Command of Thy attributes, and make me a sovereign over the Command from Thy presence, for verily Thou art powerful over all things." O Solace of the Eyes! Say: "I am naught but the Sign of the Divine Identity in the Ocean of Oneness, and verily polytheism at the time of turning away from the Most Great Word, which God hath made to be with me in truth, was found to exist above the earth." O people of the Divine Cloud! Hearken unto My call from the Lamp within the Lamp that maketh white this Glass within the crimson Glass, this that is the saffron earth in the House of the Gate which was in truth made to speak. Verily I am God, there is no God but Him. I have raised up the heavens and earth around that Word from a letter like unto it. Therefore, obey My Word, for verily I am the Truth, there is no God but Him. I am the Most High, and I have ever encompassed all the worlds through God, the Truth. And hearken unto this Most Great Interpretation from the tongue of this Most Great Human Being whom I have reared with My hands, whom no air of human nature hath ever touched. Verily He is the Truth upon the Truth, and in the Mother Book His station hath been inscribed as the decree of Fire. And say in truth: "We sent not before thee any but men unto whom We revealed: 'Be ye of the people of that blessed city and journey in the land of the heart with His aid.' And know ye that for those who join partners with Him is the punishment of the hereafter with fire in fire, which hath been inscribed with fire." And He is God, the Witness over all things. And verily God hath ever encompassed all the worlds. And verily thou art through God independent of all the worlds.

\[This is the Surih of the Foremost, In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate\]

Until when the Messengers despaired and thought they had been denied, Our help came to them, delivering whomsoever We willed; and Our might shall not be turned back from people who are sinners.

The remembrance of God in the Blessed Tree - hearken thou to the call of God: "Verily, I am God, there is no God but I, and I am the Most High, ever have I been great."

We have verily ordained for the first believer in Our Servant, from the greatest of blessings, that which had been decreed in the Mother Book round about the Fire. And We have made him to be recorded in the Point of the Line among the lines of them that came before.

O thou Gate! Take this and fill thyself with the camphor water of manifestation, and be thou, for God's sake, like unto a purified piece of iron heated by the ancient Fire, a mighty helper of the Truth through the Truth, by the wondrous permission.

Ask ye the Remembrance concerning the paths of the Gate, for verily the Gates to the knowledge that draweth near, in the straight and distant Line, have ever been, in truth and by the truth, accountable before the Gate. God is with them who enter the Gate through the Gate, and with them who believe in the Book and in the Most Great Remembrance round about the Gate in this Most Great Path - these have ever been, in truth and by the truth, well-pleasing.

God hath this day guided His servant upon His exalted path in the circuit of that most exalted Gate, praised in truth and by the truth. We have verily ordained for him in the hereafter, in truth and by the truth, in the Garden of Eden round about the sanctuary, an exalted kingdom wherein is mentioned the Most Great Name of God - there is no God but He, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting - and He is God, powerful over all things.

We have verily ordained for the second believer in Our Servant, and for the third, and for those who followed him among the others, a book of the greatest mercy which hath ever been, round about the Gate, inscribed in truth upon the truth. We have ordained between thee and the believers manifest villages, and have ordained therein journeying by God's leave, in truth upon the truth. Let them journey therein by night and by day, looking unto God, the Truth, through the decree of the Book, according to that which God hath ordained round about the Gate.

That ye may seek of Our bounty that which God hath ordained for you in this Gate from blessed villages, treasured round about the Fire in the Most Great Truth upon the Mighty Truth, concealed. And verily there have come down to you this day men from the Holy Land. Say: Return ye to your dwellings and ask God of His grace, for verily the help of God hath ever been nigh unto the believers in that Gate, in truth and by the truth.

Follow not what Satan casteth into your souls. God hath promised you Paradise while Satan calleth you to the Fire. Which of these two stations is more worthy of security, if ye be praised in the religion of God, the Most High, in truth and by the truth?

The Remembrance of God among you is like unto none of your divines. By your Lord! He is the Truth from God, and hath ever been a pure Muslim, steadfast in the true religion at the Point of Fire round about the Water.

O ye believers! Why do ye clothe the Remembrance with denial? Will ye not ponder the interpretation of the Book? Verily your Lord God is the Truth, and verily the Remembrance from God, the Most High, is the Truth, and the Command of God hath ever been written in the Mother Book round about the Fire by the hands of the Remembrance.

None among the people of the Book believe in the Remembrance of God save those for whom grace hath preceded from their Lord.\[...\]

None shall believe in the mention of God among the People of the Book save those for whom divine providence was foreordained by their Lord. Verily guidance is God's guidance, and God hath placed grace within your hands. We bestow Our mercy upon whomsoever We will, for God is the Truth, the Lord of surpassing bounty, and He is God, the Witness over all things. O people! God hath placed between you and Our verses, regarding this Gate, a veil of justice wrapped in truth, encompassing the waters, concealed. Verily ye have an appointment on the Day of Resurrection upon the Most Great Path, in truth, around the Fire, where ye shall be questioned. God shall teach you the remembrance of Our servant on that Day, in very truth, at the heart of the Fire, witnessed. By your Lord! Ye shall cry out and swoon and say: "Would that we had been as naught upon the earth!" Verily Our distance upon this Path is beyond the two Easts, and today thou seest none besides the mention of God, the Exalted One, as a helper before God, the Self-Sufficient, in truth. There God, your True Lord, shall say: "O My servants! Did not the Truth and His verses come unto you from every direction from Our presence, in truth, lofty and mighty?" By your Lord, the All-Merciful! Ye shall surely say: "We were indeed heedless of this, even after the snow came to us from the mountain of hail, in truth, by the leave of God, the Exalted One" - and He is God, the All-Knowing of all things. We have indeed removed from you, by the leave of God, the Exalted One, on that Day, your covering, and your sight today, God willing, is as iron around the Gate in the Mother Book. And verily these believers, when they come unto thee that thou shouldst seek forgiveness of God for them, they shall find God, their True Lord, Oft-Returning, Merciful at the Gate. The unbelievers shall say: "Lord! Return us to the world upon a remembrance from Thy true covenant in the hands of the Remembrance, renewed in truth." "We shall surely believe in Him and aid Him in truth, for we were in the worldly life deprived of His Cause contrary to truth." There the Exalted God shall say: "Did they not read Our Book in the Most Great Truth among you: 'Take not two gods'? He is but one God, so taste ye the heat of your polytheism regarding God, the Exalted One - in truth, this is the Great Fire, as hath been decreed in the judgment of the Book from the judgment of the Gate." The Fire shall burn their foreheads and their sides, and the angel shall proclaim amongst them: "This is what ye hoarded for yourselves, withholding from the True Self of God contrary to truth" - and God is well-aware of what ye do. Did not God warn you regarding His Self in the House? What aileth you that ye believe not in God, the All-Praised, and in His wondrous verses in very truth? And verily God is witness to what ye do. We have indeed warned you by Our own selves that ye might be discerning of the mention of God, the Exalted One, in the mystery of this Gate. O servants of the All-Merciful! Know ye that God created you not, nor raised you up, save as a single soul. So turn ye unto the Cause of God which We have sent down among you in the Most Great Truth. Soon shall ye behold Our signs in the land of Return, in very truth, nigh at hand. We have indeed commanded you to return to your dwellings that ye might know that God knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth\[...\]

And those on earth understand but little of the knowledge of the Book in truth, in very truth. Verily, those who hear the verses from God, blessed in the Most Great Truth, yet perceive not Our signs in any degree - We shall soon inform you of what you have wrought for yourselves on the Day of Resurrection. There shall you find, apart from Our Command, in truth and in very truth, no great authority.

O people of the Throne! Hear My call from this Arabian Youth Who speaketh not from desire, but from the revelation of His Lord, the Most High. God hath indeed brought Him to a station of nearness, or nearer still, and hath elevated Him upon His Word as the Mystery of Response from Himself unto Himself. And verily God is witness over all things.

O Word of God! Hearken unto My call. I am the Truth, there is no God but Him. I was thy hearing when there was no hearing but Mine hearing, and I was thy sight when there was no sight but Mine sight, and I was thy hand when there was no hand but Mine hand. And I was thy outward manifestation upon the inward, and thy inward reality upon the Truth, when there was no outward or inward save Mine own Self, the Truth. I am indeed the Truth, there is no God but I, the Exalted One Who hath ever been supremely great in truth.

Hearken then to My call, that Most Great Interpretation from the Ancient One, thy Lord, the Almighty, in truth and very truth, wondrous to behold. And verily the people had despaired of the Gates regarding the Most Great Word, and they thought they had been denied the Remembrance, when Our help came to them through this Arabian Youth, of the valley of Batha, of Mecca and Medina, Who standeth upon the Path in truth, in pure truth, steadfast.

Through Him We deliver whomsoever We will, and Our might cannot be stayed by those who turn away from Our Word. Verily the Remembrance, in truth and very truth, hath been praised at the heart of the Fire. And He is God, the Reckoner over all things. Verily God hath power over all things.

Surah of the Believers

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

Verily in their stories is a lesson for men of understanding. It is not a tale invented, but a confirmation of what went before it, a detailed exposition of all things, and a guide and a mercy to those who believe. Alif Lam Mim. We have placed between you and the blessed cities, after this Gate, pure souls who call the people to the Most Great Religion of God and who fear naught save God, the True One. These are they who have been inscribed in the Mother Book as the companions of Paradise. We have made this Book as signs for those possessed of understanding, who glorify God night and day and who swerve not from the command of God, the Truth, from the Gate, even to the extent of a date-stone. O ye who are endowed with insight among the people of the Gate! This is Our Book which speaketh unto you with truth. Do ye imagine that God hath placed beyond it any blessed cities? By God, the Truth! Ye have no protector besides it. Why do ye not behold the wondrous signs of God, the Most High? By God! After your denial We shall cause you to taste severe chastisement from God, according to the decree of the Book concerning the ordinance of the Gate - a mighty fire. Soon shall ye find your deeds on the Day of Resurrection upon the gathering place reduced to scattered dust. Verily men have come to thee from this Holy Land, and have hastened towards the Cause of God contrary to the decree of the Book regarding the Gate. Say: Return ye to your dwellings and remember God in your private and public moments according to the ways of the Gate, with truth upon truth, from the Point of Fire abundantly. By God! The Cause hath come to you suddenly from Us in the purified land, through the Most Great Word, with truth upon truth, drawing nigh. There shall the people behold God, the Most High, through the paths of the Gate, with intense truth upon truth. God shall soon forgive you for what ye do without His leave, contrary to the Gate and against the truth, for God is verily oft-returning, merciful to the believers. Who among you hath believed in God, the Most High, apart from this Gate, concerning which mankind shall be questioned? God shall soon torment you on the Day of Resurrection with the heat of the tree that groweth in the land of prison, which hath been decreed in the Mother Book as the Zaqqum tree of the Gate. Do We not cause you to fluctuate night and day? How is it that ye walk in God's earth without truth and believe not in Our signs with pure and sufficient truth? He is God, there is no God but Him. God hath appointed none in this your day other than His servant as a witness unto the worlds, with truth upon truth from His presence. Say: O people of the Euphrates! There is no abiding place for you, so return to your dwellings and await the Most Great Cause of God with truth upon truth, which draweth nigh. By your Lord! The Truth hath come to you from before you and from your left with the most great evidences, repeatedly with weighty truth upon truth. Yet ye perceive not Our signs with truth upon truth, while the All-Merciful calleth you through His remembrance in that Most Great Gate, and the matter hath been decreed in the Mother Book. If ye rest assured in truth concerning yourselves, why are ye not able to acquire a little good from that Most Great and Most High Gate? O thou beloved! Hearken unto My call from God, thy True Lord, concerning thy most great self. God! There is no God but He. O My servants! Prostrate yourselves before God\[...\]

O ye who have found tranquility in the Truth concerning your own selves, wherefore do ye not strive to obtain goodly benefit from this Most Great and Exalted Gate, even in small measure? O thou beloved one! Hearken unto My call from God, thy True Lord, concerning thine own most great self. God, there is no God but Him. O My servants! Prostrate yourselves before God and worship Him in the path of this Most Great Gate, and use pure fragrance in your prayers and at other times to the extent ye are able, and send the finest thereof to the Most Great Remembrance, and take for yourselves a ring of red carnelian inscribed with the name of the Gate, that ye may be remembered before God, the Ancient, in the precincts of that Exalted Gate.

Verily We guide from among Our servants whomsoever hath believed in God and His signs in truth, and he hath indeed been well-pleasing before that Gate in very truth. Woe unto those who write Our names with their own hands yet call upon naught but idols besides God, the Exalted, in very truth. Then when the Remembrance cometh unto them with the Remembrance, Satan veils them from the Remembrance after they have heard the wondrous Word of God from the tongue of the Gate as witnessed.

Verily the believers are they who say: "Indeed He is the Truth from God, and He is God, the All-Knowing of all things." O people of the Divine Cloud! Hearken unto My call from this Luminous Moon, for which I desired no eclipse upon the countenance of this Youth of East and West, whom ye shall find in all the Tablets as a mystery mysteriously hidden, inscribed in crimson lines, concealed in truth around the Fire.

Say: God hath revealed unto Me: "Verily, I am God, there is no God but I, the Worshipped One. I have created none among the Gates like unto the Most Great Word of Remembrance." And all have come unto Him on the Day of Return around the Fire as was promised. Verily have We sent down this Book in truth, that in its stories may be a lesson for those of understanding among the people of the Gate, who have been witnessed around the Fire.

O people of the earth! The Point hath reached its zenith, so hearken unto My call from this Arabian Youth, the Muhammadan, the Alid, whom ye shall find in all the Tablets as the Most Great Mystery, witnessed around the Fire. O Most Great Word! Say: I am not a tale falsely devised concerning mankind, but I have stood before God on a Day that hath neither bound nor description, and verily God, my Lord, hath been in truth a witness unto Me.

O people of the earth! This Book is an exposition of all things, a guidance and mercy for those who seek God through the Gate, bowing in truth, praiseworthy. O concourse of creation! Hearken unto My call from the Point of the Heart through this Most Great Arabian Youth, the Eloquent One. Verily, I am God, there is no God but I. I have not revealed in this Book concerning the Most Great Remembrance save letters exemplifying the letter, like unto the disconnected point that was around the letter Ba, and the Truth was "in truth" conjoined.

No soul hath changed a letter of this Book or interpreted it according to his own opinion but We have decreed for him in the Mother Book the fire of the coffin in the depths of hell, abiding therein forever in very truth, eternally. We shall not forgive him, nor shall We ordain for him on the Day of Resurrection any helper, not even to the measure of a speck or the husk of a date-stone. Read ye therefore from this Book what ye are able \[...\]

Read from this Book as much as ye are able, and after its recitation remember God upon the word of truth in His Book of truth. Glorified be thy Lord, Who is none other than He, far above that which they attribute unto Him, and exalted be the description of His Word above all that they associate with Him. He is God Who hath ever been, in truth and of a truth, praiseworthy. The peace of God be upon the Most Great Word, as beseemeth Him. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and He is God, powerful over all things. Enter not the Houses of Remembrance except by His leave, for verily they prostrate themselves before God at the Gate, and God is indeed aware of all things. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say: I am Solomon in sovereignty; follow Me and follow not the footsteps of Satan, for verily sovereignty over 'Ali hath, by God's leave, been inscribed in the Mother Book. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say: God hath not ordained for Mine own self, nor for the People of the House from Mine own self, the like of what God hath ordained for you, and God hath willed to purify the House and its people from all defilement, and verily God is powerful over all things. O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say: I ask of you no recompense, for it is with God, my Lord, in the Mother Book, and hath ever existed, in truth and of a truth. And verily My recompense is with God, in truth and of a truth, and was decreed on the Day of Beginning. Verily God and His angels pronounce blessings upon the Prophet and His family. O ye who believe! Invoke blessings upon them as God hath blessed them and their followers, and He is God, Who hath ever been, in truth, witness unto all things. And He is God Who hath ever encompassed all things.

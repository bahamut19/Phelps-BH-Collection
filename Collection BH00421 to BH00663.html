<p>=== START BH00420 ===</p>
<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, O Rida, for having hearkened unto the most sweet call when it was raised from the Divine Lote-Tree in the name of thy Lord, the Most Glorious, and for having believed in God, the Sovereign, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Be thou a herald of this Name amongst the servants and one who makes mention of thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. If thou findest in thyself the power, rend asunder the veils of them that have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: O people, the Day hath come and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Omnipotent, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Should thou behold one who turneth away from the Countenance while styling himself the Guide, say: O servant, be fair for God’s sake! Were it not for the Glory (Baha), who would exalt the mention of thy Lord between earth and heaven? Reflect and be of the fair-minded. The Rock hath cried out with the loudest voice: The Desired One hath come and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the One, the Peerless, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Verily, they who have turned away have not found the fragrance of the All-Merciful in the Bayan - nay, they are among the bewildered ones. Say: Read thou the Bayan, detached from all else, by the Most Merciful! If thou regardest it with the eye of certitude, thou wilt cast aside all creation and hasten to the court of thy Lord, saying: “I believe in Thee, O God of all who are in the heavens and on earth!”</p>
<p>Say: Do ye behold anyone having mention in His presence? Nay, by the Lord of the Throne, were ye of them that know! There hath dawned from the horizon of grace a Sun whereon hath been inscribed by the Pen of Revelation: “He Who was hidden in the knowledge of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised, hath appeared.” Say: While under the swords of the enemies, I summon the peoples of creation unto the Lord of Names. Thus have I been commanded by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. I call thee at this daybreak, purely for the sake of God, detached from thyself and all that thou hast and all that is on earth - to this every fair-minded and discerning one beareth witness. I have not compromised in God’s Cause with the rulers of the earth. We have sent down to each one of them that which perfected God’s proof and evidence unto all created things. Read thou what was revealed in the Tablet to the Sultan and ponder it, that perchance the eye of fairness may be opened and thou mayest not oppose God through tyranny, and mayest be convinced that through Him every wise command hath been revealed.</p>
<p>Say: Hath the crowing of the crow prevented thee from turning to thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful? Fear God, then return unto Him with a sound heart. By God! The fragrance of the All-Merciful hath wafted throughout all contingent being. Blessed is he who hath found it and perceived it and hastened and said: “Thou art, Thou art, O Desire of them that know!” I know not by what proof he hath turned away from the All-Merciful. Say: Hast thou not heard what was revealed aforetime by the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible? Beware, beware lest the Bayan and its letters and what was revealed therein prevent thee from Him by Whose acceptance all things were made to testify. This is what hath been sent down from the Pen of Revelation from One Who is mighty and beautiful. Verily, He hath made the Bayan one of My signs, yet ye cast at Me the arrows of denial at every moment. Delude not yourselves. Open your eyes unto the Most Great Vision that ye may recognize Him Who suspended the Bayan by the movement of His finger, the One with power over all worlds. When the way of men was barred, We ordained acceptance through hearts. Verily thy Lord is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth.</p>
<p>Then turn to the perfumer who was named Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali. Say: O servant, abandon the buzzing of flies! The All-Giver hath come, riding upon the clouds. Then hearken unto what the Dove warbleth upon the twigs of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, on this Day whereon the Sovereign of Names hath been established upon the throne of grandeur and power. By My life! The ears have been created to hearken unto My Word, and the eyes to behold My Beauty, and the tongues to make mention of Me, which mention God hath made the sovereign of all mentions. The sincere ones shall find naught in the Bayan save the fragrance of My Name, whereby all regions have been perfumed. O perfumer! Doth it beseem thee to deprive thyself of this perfume which hath been wafted from the garment of the All-Merciful at the midmost heart of creation? Nay, by His own Self, the Mighty, the Bountiful! Turn thy face toward Paradise and say: My soul be a sacrifice for Thy tribulation, O Dawning-Place of Names, and my spirit be a ransom for Thy imprisonment, O Thou through Whom the convulsions seized the peoples of all worlds! It behooveth thee to abandon vain imaginings and proclaim amongst the people: The Self-Subsisting hath come! Hasten unto Him with your hearts, O people of understanding! Whoso turneth away from this Cause, every atom shall denounce him. Were it not for My remembrance, the Bayan would not have been revealed, nor would the Tablets have been adorned with My Name. The unitarians have taken flight, and the idols have lamented, and the mountains have passed away. If thou fearest for thy faith, preserve this Tablet, so that when thou art questioned in the presence of God by what proof thou didst believe, bring it forth from the horizon of thy pocket and say: By this Book from which the breezes of the All-Merciful have wafted throughout all regions. Then shalt thou witness the Prophets approaching thee, taking it, kissing it, placing it upon their eyes, and saying: Blessed art thou for having found the fragrance of the All-Merciful when He came with power and sovereignty. By Him Who caused the tongue of dawn to speak His praise! If thou wouldst abandon vain imaginings and turn thy gaze toward the Most Great Vision, and ponder that which hath been sent down from the presence of the Lord of Destiny, thou wouldst at once fall unconscious, and when thou didst arise thou wouldst proclaim the Most Great Name amongst the servants. There is no hatred in My heart for anyone. I call thee purely for the sake of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Chosen One. Then will the Holy Spirit speak from the horizon of nearness: The proof and evidence have been perfected for thee through this Tablet whereby the horizon of utterance hath shone forth.</p>
<p>Then turn to him who was named Hashim: Say: Shatter the idols of vain imaginings for [the sovereignty of] thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Turn with thy heart to the Qiblih of the world. Say: I have turned to Thee, O Thou by Whose Name the standards have been raised aloft. Art thou content with the pool when the Most Great Ocean is before thy face? Cast all created things behind thee, turning to thy Lord. Then drink the Salsabil of utterance in the name of thy Lord Who controlleth the winds. They who argue from what they possess to prove what they believe - these but play with their own vain imaginings as children play. This is not the day for doubt. Open thine eyes that thou mayest behold the Sun of Certitude at its noontide splendor. This is a call which, had the Beloved heard it, He would have cried: “Here am I, O Thou Beloved of all in earth and heaven!” I know not by what proof ye have been kept back from the Lord of all proofs, O people of the religions. Rend asunder the veils of idle fancy with the fingers of certitude. Thus hath the All-Merciful revealed it in the Bayan. Observe the words of others and what hath been revealed in this Tablet, then judge fairly, O people of understanding. Reflect on what hath appeared from others and what hath shone forth from the horizon of this Cause, then discriminate, O people of insight. Were the Word of God to be confined to a single word, verily that word would be the sovereign of all words. The sincere ones would find in it that by which spirits soar. Would that ye knew that to which ye cling - that which is hidden behind the veil! Do ye follow him who is unable to speak face to face? To this testify the servants who were with Us when We migrated from Baghdad for the sake of God, the Lord of all men. Have mercy on yourselves and oppose not Him through Whom the Laws were ordained and religions were established. The eye of compassion weepeth for humanity while they are in joy and delight. Soon shall they know that from which they were heedless, whereupon they shall find for themselves no protector.</p>
<p>O my God! Thou knowest that in this Tablet I have desired naught save to manifest Thy Cause unto Thy servants and to exalt Thy Word amidst Thy creation. I have not compromised with anyone in that which Thou didst command me through Thy sovereignty, and I called out to all in such wise that my call encompassed those who dwell in Thy earth and heaven, until I raised the standards of Thy Cause in Thy domains and the lights of Thy countenance shone forth in Thy lands. Among the people are those who denied Me, those who rejected My proof, those who desired to slay Me, those who rose in opposition, those who claimed that “he hath stolen the verses and writeth them in his name among the servants,” and those who fabricated against Me that which is beyond the power of utterance to describe. The fire of hatred grew so intense that they cast Me into the Most Great Prison. When I entered therein, I arose once again to raise the call, moved by the ecstasy of Thy love, O Lord of all names! I sacrificed my all for Thy Cause, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of earth and heaven. I delivered Thy messages unto the kings with clear proof and evidence, that they might know that tribulation hath not deterred Me from that which I purposed, O Thou in Whose grasp is the kingdom of creation. I sent to each one of them a Tablet wherein I opened the gates of meaning and exposition, and from whose horizon shone forth the Sun of truth and explanation for all who dwell in the realm of possibility. Thou knowest, O my God, that in all this I desired not myself nor my survival, but rather to establish Thy oneness among the people of Thy realm and to manifest Thy singleness unto those who dwell in Thy lands. Because of this, the oppressors among Thy creatures gathered against Me time and again and desired what they desired. Praise be to Thee in all conditions! I have entrusted all affairs unto Thee and I yearn for what Thou hast ordained for me in Thy Tablets. Verily Thou knowest what is within my soul, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Thou knowest, O my God, that my pen hath not moved except in remembrance of Thee and with Thy leave, nor hath my tongue spoken save by Thy command and Thy will. When the appointed time came, I desired to remind Thy servants who were veiled in Thy days and who hesitated in Thy Cause, that they might turn toward the direction of Thy good-pleasure and the horizon of Thy favors. O my God! If Thou seest them worthy of the outpourings of Thy mercy which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy Will and the clouds of Thy grace, make them know the Manifestation of Thy Self, through Whom Thou hast adorned the Tablets of the Book of Thy creation and embellished the heaven of Thy grace and will. Aid them to turn toward the direction of Thy gifts, that they may unite in Thy Cause and speak forth Thy Name. This is what Thou didst command all in Thy Book. Verily, I have called them, O my God, purely for Thy sake, lest their desires keep them back from the shore of the ocean of Thy forgiveness. Thou hast ever been independent of all else besides Thee. The acceptance of all who are on earth profiteth Thee not, nor doth their turning away harm Thee. Every atom testifieth that Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Help in Peril.</p>
<p>In the name of the Beloved of the worlds.</p>
<p>O Rida! God willing, through divine grace and heavenly bounties, mayest thou be occupied at all times with the mention of the All-Merciful. I swear by the Most Great Name that the tongue was created for the remembrance of God - if it attaineth not thereunto it is assuredly severed - and the ears were created to hearken unto His words, and likewise all the limbs and members. How excellent is the state of that soul who in these days is occupied with the remembrance of God and uttereth His praise. His book is present before the Throne and the gaze of God is fixed upon it. Be thou thankful and numbered with them that praise Him.</p>
<p>Verses have been revealed in this Tablet specifically for certain veiled souls who are in that land. However, thou must recite them with the utmost wisdom to each of these souls individually, that perchance they may hear the call and forsake all they possess for the love of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Give not the original Tablet into their hands except after their complete certitude.</p>
<p>O Rida! Teaching hath several conditions. Thus hath spoken the tongue of the Truthful, the Trustworthy. Whosoever desireth to teach, if he be bound for a destination, must sanctify and purify his outward being from all things of the world and his inward being from their remembrance. Thus must he be who would teach the Cause of his Lord, the Protector, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. His provision must be the fear of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and his armor must be his detachment from all else save Him and his trust in Him. At such time is it befitting to teach God’s Cause and make mention of the Ever-Abiding Beloved. And if he desireth to teach in his own city, he must arise from his place through God’s power and turn his face toward God and walk with complete detachment until he entereth that place, and then speak with utmost wisdom of that which he is commanded. This is the command of Truth that hath flowed from the Fountainhead of the utterance of the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>First read thou this most exalted Tablet several times until thou thyself becomest aware of its hidden mysteries and sublime utterances, and then recite it with the melody of the heart to each one. And the glory be upon thee and upon thy sister who hath believed and turned toward God and attained His presence and seen and heard and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds!” Thou hast ever been and art remembered in the Holy Court. God willing, thou must strive to serve the Truth in a manner befitting. Be not grieved by the world and whatsoever pertaineth unto it. Verily He ordaineth what He willeth for whomsoever He pleaseth. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>In the name of God, Who hath cast His splendour over all creation! O concourse of earth and heaven! Give ear to the testimony of God that proceedeth from the mouth of your Lord, the All-Glorious. He verily hath testified, in Himself and by Himself, ere the heaven of His Cause was raised up and the clouds of His Decree were gathered together, that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who hath appeared is that Most Great Name through which His ancient proof and testimony have been established before all who are in the heavens and on the earth.</p>
<p>Verily God hath testified, in Himself and by Himself, and in His inmost Essence, that there is none other God but Him and that He Who is come through the power of truth is the Manifestation of His most excellent names and the Dawning-Place of His most exalted attributes. Through Him the voice of the mystic Morn rang out from the horizon of eternity and the Most Great Spirit spoke forth before the Divine Lote-Tree, saying: “This, verily, is He Who hath been intended in the Cities of Names and mentioned in the Tablets revealed from the empyrean of the Will of your Lord, the Ruler of earth and heaven. He, indeed, is the most great Instrument amidst the nations, Who hath come to regenerate the whole world.”</p>
<p>Verily God hath testified, in Himself and by Himself, and ere the creation of the world and the manifestation of His names and attributes, that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who is come upon the clouds of divine decree is the Trust of God amongst you and the Revealer of His Essence in your midst.</p>
<p>We verily behold, at this hour and from His realm, all the denizens of earth and heaven, and summon them to this Beauty that hath solaced the eyes of the inmates of Paradise and the dwellers of the tabernacle of holiness, them that have fixed their gaze on this Scene of resplendent glory and whom the veils of human limitations have failed to debar from beholding the countenance of God, the Almighty, the Most Wondrous. He it is Who proclaimeth within all things: “Verily, I am your Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate. From time immemorial I was a Treasure hidden in a station unknown to all save Mine own Self, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Cast away all that ye possess and soar on the wings of detachment into this atmosphere wherein waft the breezes of the mercy of your Lord, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.”</p>
<p>By My life! The Day is come which from all eternity was concealed in the treasuries of the might of your Lord. Rejoice in this blessed, this glorious and sublime Day. For He verily is Mine own Appearance amongst you, and whoso maketh the slightest distinction between Him and Me hath indeed strayed far from the straight path of truth. He it is Who hath caused the Mystic Dove to warble upon the twigs of the Tree of glory, saying: “By the one true God! The Best-Beloved of the worlds is come!” Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Can anyone befittingly thank Thee for such blessings as Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy oneness and the firmament of Thy Will, blessings which Thou hast reserved for the people of Baha in the realm of creation? Nay, by Thy might, O Thou the Beloved of the worlds and the sole Desire of them that have recognized Thee! Wert Thou to endow every creature of earth and heaven with a myriad tongues, even to the number of the atoms of the universe, and were they to yield Thee thanks, so long as Thy kingdom and Thy dominion endure, for the bounties which Thou hast bestowed upon Thy loved ones in this Day–a Day whereon Thou hast revealed Thyself in Thine own Essence and inmost Being to the dwellers of earth and heaven, and in Thy Beauty to the inhabitants of the cities of eternity, and through Thy Names to them that are immersed in the billowing oceans of grandeur–yet would their thanksgiving fade into nothingness before that which Thou hast bestowed upon them through Thy grace and bounty.</p>
<p>I know not, O my God, which among Thy gifts to extol in this Day, a Day that Thou hast made to be the source of all Thy days and the dawning-place whence the rays of the light of Thine Essence and the splendours of the glory of Thy countenance have shone forth. Shall I praise the heavenly repast which Thou hast sent down in this Day unto the people of Baha, whom Thou hast singled out for Thy favour amongst the dwellers of earth and heaven? This, verily, is a sustenance borne in the vessel of Thy words, from every letter of which a myriad suns of divine wisdom and utterance dawn forth and the lights of authority and exposition shine resplendent. This, verily, is a sustenance whose substance is such inner meanings as had from everlasting lain concealed within Thine inviolable treasuries and hidden beneath the tabernacles of Thy glory. Or shall I, O my God, extol Thine appearance in this Day from the dawning-place of Thine Essence; or Thine establishment, before the gaze of all men, upon the throne of Thy name, the All-Bountiful; or yet Thy proclamation, through the Tongue of might and power, to all things visible and invisible? By Myself, the True One! The Hidden Secret and Treasured Mystery hath been revealed. Whosoever seeketh Me shall behold Me.</p>
<p>I swear by Thy glory, O Fashioner of names and Creator of earth and heaven! The tongues of Thy creatures are powerless to render thanks for the favours Thou hast bestowed upon them in this Day, a Day from which Thou hast made all Thy days to proceed. This is the Day whereon Thou hast summoned the well-favoured to the Dayspring of Thy nearness and the sincere to the Dawning-Place of the light of Thy countenance. This is the Day concerning which Thou didst covenant with every Prophet to herald unto all the advent of Him Who shall be manifested therein with Thy sovereign might and celestial power.</p>
<p>This is the Day whereon Muhammad, the Apostle of God, cried out from the midmost heart of Paradise, saying: “O peoples of the earth! By God, the Beloved of the worlds and the Desire of every understanding heart is come! He, verily, is the One to Whose voice I hearkened on My Night Journey but Whose beauty I was not to behold until the days attained their consummation in this Day, a Day which is the adornment of all the days of God, the Sovereign Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised. This is the Day whereon the rule of His grace and all-pervading mercy hath been so universally established as to embrace every soul, for He hath in truth summoned each and all to His presence and hath shed upon all things the splendour of His glorious and refulgent beauty.”</p>
<p>This is the Day whereon the Spirit proclaimed from the midmost heart of heaven: “O concourse of creation! He Who is the sovereign Ruler of all hath been made manifest. That which pertaineth to the Kingdom of My Lord hath been fulfilled. He Who is the Beloved of My heart and the Helper of My Cause is now come. Follow Him, and be not of those that have turned aside. This is the Day whereon every veil hath been parted, and your Lord, the Almighty, the Most Bountiful, hath appeared and fulfilled through His appearance all that was promised aforetime. Hasten then to this resplendent, this most luminous Beauty!</p>
<p>“O priests! Tell Our servants to ring not the bells save in His name, the All-Glorious, the Most High. This is the Day whereon the sore athirst have attained the stream of everlasting life and the yearning souls have beheld the Vision of the All-Merciful. This is the Day whereon the lowly have been exalted, the poor enriched, the sick made whole, the deaf given to hear His melody, and the blind made to see. Render thanks, then, and be not of those who join partners with God. The Kingdom of God doth in truth circle round Him. It is for His sake that I adorned the cross with My body and then arose from the dead to perfect His remembrance amongst men.</p>
<p>“O people of the Gospel! Take heed lest ye direct your prayers towards Me after having turned away from Mine all-glorious Father, Who changed, through His love, Abraham’s fire into light. He who awaiteth another when once He hath appeared is indeed in grievous error. Hasten, then, to the river of the mercy of your Lord, the All-Merciful, and beware lest ye withhold yourselves from its soft-flowing waters. We have, verily, reared you for this Day. Peruse ye the Book, that ye may apprehend the meaning of My words in My days. Verily, I revealed Myself only for the sake of His Cause, and I came amongst you solely to herald the Kingdom of God, your Lord and the Lord of the worlds. That which was hidden is now revealed, and that which was concealed is now come. Bestir yourselves to greet this Day, a Day whereon the gates of heaven have been flung open, and the clouds of eternity have rained down, and the Nightingale of His Cause hath warbled its melody upon the twigs of the Divine Lote-Tree, and the hearts of the Concourse on high have been seized with longing in the all-highest Paradise, and the Maids of Heaven have hastened forth from their celestial chambers towards His mighty Throne. Cast away all that ye possess and cleave unto that which hath been enjoined upon you by this Ancient Beauty.</p>
<p>O concourse of divines! Still your pens, for the Pen of Glory hath spoken. Lay aside your books, for the Book hath appeared that compriseth all that hath been said aforetime and sufficeth all the inhabitants of the earth. Rise above the horizon of certitude in the name of your Lord, the All-Merciful, and tear asunder the veils that have come between you and the Lord of all creation.</p>
<p>Thus commandeth you the Spirit, Who offered up His life that the world might be quickened and that the Desire of every heart might appear. And He, verily, hath appeared through the power of truth. Follow Him, and cling not unto that which ye possess of the proclamations of former times. For the trumpet-blast hath been sounded, and lo! the earth of idle fancy hath been cleft asunder; and the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken from the pavilion of glory, saying: The Kingdom in this Day is God’s, the All-Possessing, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great! The dead have risen and the souls have been gathered together, and yet still We behold you entombed in the sepulchres of heedlessness and desire. Fear God, O people! Rise from amongst the dead and turn your faces towards the Dayspring of His grace which shineth above this resplendent horizon. I, verily, await His command, that by His leave I might descend into the world, even as I ascended from it. He, verily, hath the power to ordain whatsoever He pleaseth.</p>
<p>O followers of the Gospel! Do ye seek Jerusalem, when He Who built the House of God therein by a mere indication of His will hath come? Far have ye wandered in the paths of error! Of a certainty, no deed will be accepted in this Day unless it be performed by His leave, and the invocation of no soul shall rise up unto God unless it be uttered for His love. Thus hath the decree been fulfilled and the command established by Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>This is the Day whereon Moses lifted up His voice from the Sinai of Our name, the Almighty, saying: “O people! Verily the Day is come! This is He at Whose separation I wept sore in the desert of longing, and for Whose love I bewailed in the wilderness of ardent love. And when I purposed to enter the sanctuary of His nearness and to gaze upon His beauty, He restrained Me through the power of His sovereign might and withheld Me from the desire of My heart. Whereupon He addressed Me, saying: ‘Thou shalt never behold Me!’ and returned Me to the splendours of the lights of His mighty Throne. Such was the longing with which I was then consumed as I am powerless to describe and the ears of the true believers unable to hear. But lo, He hath now appeared with the power of truth and unveiled to you His beauty. At every moment He proclaimeth: ‘O concourse of creation, look and ye shall behold Me!’ By God, this is the Word that hath proceeded from the mouth of the Will of your Lord, the All-Merciful. It behoveth you to offer up your souls for His sake, if ye be of them that judge with fairness. Thus have I informed you, O people, of Him Whose remoteness hath lacerated My heart and Who hath made Me to quaff the cup of separation. Bear witness unto Him, and be not of the heedless. Blessed are your eyes for having beheld, and your ears for having hearkened. And woe unto them that have deprived themselves of this resplendent Vision.”</p>
<p>This is the Day whereon the Point of the Bayan called out from the midmost heart of Paradise, saying: “O people! This is He in Whose path I laid down My life. This is He for Whose sake I revealed Myself and of Whose presence I bore unto you the most joyful tidings. Beware lest ye deny the One but for Whom the Day-Star of the Bayan would never have dawned nor would the verses of the All-Merciful have been revealed. By God! He it is Who caused the morn of inner meaning and explanation to break, and the gates of divine reunion to be opened before the faces of all the peoples of the earth. It is by His Name that the cities of names have been adorned; it is by His remembrance that the hearts of the chosen ones have been set ablaze. Beware lest ye deal with Him as ye dealt with Me. I testify that I was but a herald of His Revelation unto all who are in heaven and on earth, and that I conditioned the Bayan upon His leave and good-pleasure. I swear by God! It is for His love that I rose up amongst you and consorted with you. Were it not for Him, I would assuredly not have revealed a single word or verse. Cling ye to the hem of the robe of His mercy, and hold fast to the cord of His love. This is the Day whereon every atom proclaimeth: ‘By the Possessor of all names and attributes! Verily, He Who is invoked by all that are in heaven is now come!’”</p>
<p>Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having adorned the preamble of the book of eternity with this most luminous Day, a Day whereon Thou didst shed the splendour of Thy most excellent names and most exalted attributes upon all created things. This, verily, is a Day whereon Thou hast ordained that each of Thy names be endowed with the potentialities of all Thy names. Blessed, then, be they that have turned towards Thee, attained Thy presence, and hearkened unto Thy call.</p>
<p>O Lord, my God! I beseech Thee by this Day, and by Thy most consummate Name through which the Most Great Ocean hath surged, to protect the people of Baha from them that have disbelieved in Thy mighty signs. Make them then, O my God, to be the exponents of Thine ascendancy and Thy might, that they may arise to glorify Thee and to celebrate Thy praise amidst Thy servants, in such wise that neither the veils of the people of the earth, nor their insinuations, nor the onslaught of them that have arisen to put out Thy light, may keep them back from Thee. O God! Deprive them not of the gentle breezes that are wafting in this Day, a Day whereon every atom proclaimeth: “Verily, Thou art God; no God is there but Thee!” O Lord, adorn them with the ornaments of constancy and certitude, and cause them to be champions of Thy Cause amidst all creation.</p>
<p>O my God and the God of all the worlds! O my desire and the desire of every understanding heart! I implore Thee, by Him Who hath caused the sun of Thy revelation and inspiration to dawn, to ordain for the people of this Day that which Thou hast ordained for the chosen ones amongst Thy servants. Send down then upon them such liberal effusions of Thy grace as none hath previously attained, and cause them to circle round the court of Thy nearness and the sanctuary of Thy presence. Inspire them, then, in Thy Cause with that which setteth ablaze the hearts and souls of men. Make each one of them to be as a lamp of Thy remembrance unto those servants of Thine whom self and passion have veiled from recognizing the Manifestation of Thine Essence and the Dayspring of Thy signs.</p>
<p>O Lord! Thou art He to Whose power and sovereignty every mighty one hath testified, and to Whose majesty and grace every great one hath borne witness. Bestow, then, upon Thy loved ones that which beseemeth this Day, a Day which Thou hast made to be a luminous ornament upon the brow of all Thy days, and which Thou hast caused to shine above the horizon of eternity. Send down then upon them, from the clouds of Thy oneness and the heaven of Thy grace, that which will enable them to dispense with aught else except Thee.</p>
<p>O Lord! Give them to drink, from the hands of Thy mercy, a draught from that river of everlasting life that floweth from the right hand of Thy Throne, and aid them to abide by that which Thou hast revealed in Thy perspicuous Book. Thou, verily, ordainest as Thou pleasest. No God is there but Thee, the Most Exalted, the Sovereign Protector, the All-Compelling, the Almighty, the Most Bountiful.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath opened the gates of divine knowledge through the keys of utterance and hath revealed that which had been hidden from time immemorial and concealed from minds and eyes. Glory, praise, peace and splendor be upon the Hands of His Cause who have inhaled the fragrance of the Day of God and have turned to Him with illumined hearts, and who have taken the chalices of prosperity in My Most Great Name from the hands of bounty. These are servants whom God hath described in His Books, His Scriptures, His Psalms and His Tablets, and whom He hath made the Hands of His Cause in His lands. Upon them be mercy from His presence and loving-kindness from His own Self. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Ever-Flowing, the Mighty, the All-Giving.</p>
<p>O Haydar! Thy letter hath come into the presence of the Most Great Scene, the place wherein the Lord of Destiny hath spoken and made mention of His loved ones, and revealed unto them that whereby their names, their remembrance, their spirits, and their deeds in this Straight Path shall endure. Upon them be the glory of God, the Lord of the worlds. O Haydar! Rejoice and give thanks that thy letter hath gained the ear of the Wronged One, even as sorrows have encompassed Him from all sides through that which the hands of those who have broken the Covenant and denied the signs of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, have wrought. Blessed is the servant who hath turned and stood before all with such steadfastness as hath thrown into confusion the hearts of the transgressors. Say: O people of God! Put away corruption and tyranny, and take hold of justice and equity. By My life! Ye were created for the reformation of the world and the education of its peoples. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth as He pleaseth. Within His grasp are the reins of all affairs. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Almighty. Convey My greetings to My loved ones who have drunk the wine of divine knowledge from the hands of My bounty and who have arisen to serve My Cause, the Mighty, the All-Wise. O My loved ones in that land! Hear My call from the direction of My prison. Verily, He will protect you and guide you unto God, your Lord and the Lord of the heavens and the earths.</p>
<p>O Haydar! Say: O peoples of the earth! Fear God, then judge with fairness concerning that which hath appeared in truth, and be not of the oppressors. I was silent until God gave Me utterance, and I was still until His Will set Me in motion. The Books of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, bear witness unto this. Put away tyranny and take hold of justice. Verily, He will preserve you and be with you in every world of the worlds of God. He is the Protector of him who turneth unto Him and the Guardian of the sincere ones. We have created all beings for this Day, yet the people are in manifest doubt. They see, yet they deny; they hear, yet they turn away. Verily, they are accounted among the most lost in My clear Book.</p>
<p>We have desired at this time to make mention of My loved ones whose names were inscribed on a white leaf. Thy Lord is verily the All-Merciful, the Bountiful. O Husayn-’Ali! The face of the Wronged One hath turned toward thee from this exalted station and hath mentioned thee in such wise as to enrapture the Concourse on High and the dwellers of Paradise. Blessed are the fair-minded! Say: The Bayan circleth round Him and the Book standeth before His face, yet most of the people are heedless. Say: Through Him the ocean of utterance hath surged and the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath wafted, could ye but know it. Say: Through the Pen He hath outstripped the swords of the nations and hath forbidden conflict and strife, and hath abrogated holy war. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. This is the Hidden One to Whom the Books have testified, and this is the News whereof Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and before Him every trusted Messenger gave glad-tidings.</p>
<p>O Zaynu’l-’Abidin! The Pen from this Prison hath turned towards thee and revealed that whereat all things have cried out, and the Kingdom and the Dominion, the Majesty and the Glory have called out: “Unto God belongeth this wondrous and glorious Day!” We have made mention of thee and thy father in such wise as shall endure and remain steadfast in the Book of God, the Ancient. Be thou thankful for this supreme bounty and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of eternity, for having adorned me with the ornament of recognition and guided me to the Dayspring of utterance. I beseech Thee by the power of Thy verses and their influence to make me steadfast in Thy love such that neither the oppression of the oppressors nor the ascendancy of the idolaters who have cast behind them Thy Covenant and have followed what hath appeared from the daysprings of fancy and idle imaginings shall deter me. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I beseech Thee by the dawning-places of Thy knowledge and the daysprings of Thy wisdom to aid me to assist Thy Cause through the hosts of trustworthiness and true religion. Verily, Thou art the Ruler over whatsoever Thou willest through Thy firm and unshakeable command.”</p>
<p>O ’Ali! The discourse of the Mount hath returned through the appearance of its Interlocutor, and the Tree hath cried out: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of this exalted station!” Blessed is the ear that hath gained the honor of My call and the heart that hath turned to My luminous horizon. Blessed is the eye that the desires of self have not prevented from beholding the Most Exalted Horizon, and the hand that hath taken hold of the Book of God with such power as hath rendered powerless all who are in the heavens and on earth. Say: O loved ones of God! Do ye hear and do ye remain patient? Where is the sighing of your hearts and the lamentation of your souls? Have ye recognized what hath appeared in truth, or are ye among the hesitating ones? Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God, my Lord, my Support, my Goal, my Object of worship, and the Ultimate End of my desire! By Thy might and majesty, Thy greatness and power, I long to lay my face upon every spot of Thy earth that perchance it may be honored by having been touched by the feet of Thy loved ones. O Lord! Forgive the transgressions of Thy servants and Thy loved ones, and ordain for them that which shall preserve them from all else save Thee in Thy days. I testify that Thou art the Generous, that Thou art the Merciful. Nothing whatsoever escapeth Thy knowledge. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou desirest. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Most Great.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Yadu’llah and remind him of that which hath flowed from the tongue of Grandeur in the Kingdom of utterance, that he may give thanks and be of those who are thankful. We beseech God to strengthen thee to take hold of His Book with such power as the might of the world cannot withstand, and with such steadfastness as the doubts of nations cannot shake. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty over whatsoever He willeth through this Name whereby the limbs of the world have quaked, save those whom God, the Forgiving, the Merciful, hath willed.</p>
<p>O Ruhu’llah! We sent forth the Spirit aforetime and gave the people glad tidings of this announcement whereby the earth and heaven were transformed and the hearts of the transgressors were troubled. And before Him We sent Moses with clear signs and commanded him to announce unto the people the Day of God, the Mighty, the Great - this Day wherein the Interlocutor of the Mount hath been established upon the throne of Manifestation and calleth out with the most exalted call: “O concourse of earth and heaven! By God, that which was hidden in knowledge hath appeared and He hath come through Whose manifestation the eyes of the near ones have been solaced.” Thus hath the Sun of utterance shone forth from this station which hath been built in My Name, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Nasru’llah! Victory hath come, yet the people are wrapped in thick veils. The oppressor threateneth Me with tribulations while God promiseth Me victory. Verily, He is the most truthful of speakers. Say: He hath manifested His Cause with such sovereignty as cannot be weakened by the hosts of the world nor hindered by the clamor of the ignorant who have held back the servants from the Law of God, the Protector, the Almighty over every small and great one.</p>
<p>O Tongue of Grandeur! Make mention of him who was named Siyyid Muhammad, who soared on wings of longing to the Daystar of the horizons until he attained that station which God had made the circling-point of the sincere ones. O Muhammad! Remember when thou didst seek the ultimate goal and the loftiest summit, and didst traverse the path when thou didst attain unto the Guide in the days of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thou didst cross land and sea until thou didst enter the fortified City which was foretold in the Psalms and before it in the Books of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Thou didst stand before the Gate which was opened by the Key of Grace to all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thou didst witness and hear the Call, and didst attain unto that which had been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books of the Prophets. Thou didst appear before the Throne of the Lord, and didst hear His call and behold His horizon. This perspicuous Tablet beareth witness to this. Blessed art thou, and blessed are thy hearing and thy sight. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid thee to stand firm in the Greater Steadfastness and to ordain for thee that which He hath ordained for those who have drunk the choice wine of martyrdom from the hands of His bounty. Verily, He remembereth him who remembereth Him, and loveth him who loveth Him. He is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful. We bear witness that thou hast drunk the choice wine of reunion when all were forbidden save whom God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, did will. Say: My God, my God, my Lord, my Support, my Goal, my Adored One, my Beloved! I love to make mention of Thee throughout the regions of Thy earth and to call upon Thee in all days by Thy Name amongst Thy servants. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty which hath dominated all existence, both seen and unseen, and by Thy Command whereby Thou hast subdued the world and the hearts of the nations, to make me speak Thy praise and call out Thy Name with wisdom and utterance. Then I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty whereby the limbs of every ignorant one did tremble and the heart of every opposer was disturbed, to ordain for me from the Pen of Grace that which befitteth the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy generosity. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Powerful, the Forgiving, the Kind.</p>
<p>We have desired at this moment to make mention of one from whom We perceived the fragrance of the love of God, the Lord of this exalted station, and We wish to conclude the Book with his remembrance, that the choice wine of utterance may draw him to a station wherein the call is raised by command of the Ancient Ordainer. We arose one day desiring another land, and when We arrived We beheld its willows arranged in rows. We rested beneath their long hanging branches, and whenever the winds of will moved them to the right there was heard from their rustling “The All-Merciful hath come with manifest sovereignty,” and to the left was heard from them “The Hidden One hath appeared with His name, the Self-Subsisting,” as though they gave glad tidings to the trees of the world of this Cause which hath appeared through God’s Will, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O Son of Glory! Hear the call raised from the Mount of Knowledge at the right of the Spot of Proof from the Divine Lote-Tree: “Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Generous.” We beseech God to assist thee to know that which most of His servants are prevented from knowing. Verily, He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Protector of all who are in the heavens and earth.</p>
<p>We have manifested the Cause and revealed in diverse books that which shall appear in future ages and centuries. With thy Lord is the knowledge of all things, yet the people are in strange doubt. They see, yet deny; they hear, yet turn away. Verily, they are among the misguided before the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Say: Be fair, O people, then help your Lord with wisdom and utterance. Thus hath the matter been decreed from God, the Lord of lords. Say: The bounty hath been completed and the proof perfected. Fear the All-Merciful, O concourse of servants in the lands.</p>
<p>We beseech God to open before thy face the gate of utterance and to confirm thee in propagating His Cause with proof and evidence. Let not the derision of enemies grieve thee, nor the might of those who have denied God, the Lord of the beginning and the end. Say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having given me to drink the cup of Thy knowledge from the hand of Thy bounty and for illumining my heart with the light of certitude through Thy grace and favor. My Lord! Thou seest me turning toward the heaven of Thy bounty, clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy mercy, beseeching at the door of Thy generosity, and hoping for the wonders of Thy favor. I beseech Thee by the blood that was shed in Thy path and by the breasts that were pierced for the exaltation of Thy Cause and the manifestation of Thy Word, to assist me with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, that I may help Thy Cause among Thy servants and make mention of Thee with such remembrances as shall draw unto Thee the hearts of Thy creation.</p>
<p>My Lord! I am Thy servant who hath confessed his transgressions before the waves of Thy forgiveness and his sins before the dawning-places of the Day-Star of Thy pardon. How many nights did I sleep upon my couch, heedless of Thy manifestation and of hearkening to Thy most sweet call as it was raised between earth and heaven! And how many days was I occupied with my affairs, hesitating in Thy Cause! My Lord! I am he who confesseth his poverty, his want, and his need before the kingdom of Thy wealth, Thy pardon, and Thy bestowal. By Thy glory! I am ashamed to make mention of Thee or to describe Thee save that Thou adorn my head with the crown of Thy pardon and my temple with the ornament of Thy forgiveness. Alas, alas, for that which hath escaped me in Thy days!</p>
<p>My Lord! Thou seest the sinner standing before the gate of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the dawning-places of Thy revelation to make me steadfast and firm in Thy announcement whereby the feet of Thy creation have slipped save those whom the hand of Thy generosity did rescue. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>

All praise be to God Who hath fulfilled what He revealed unto all His Prophets and Messengers, and hath given glad tidings unto all of His days, among which is the Day that He promised us in His inviolable Book through His words, exalted be His dominion: “the day when God will enrich everyone out of His abundance.” And verily this is our Day, wherein I witness that He hath enriched all who have entered beneath His shade from the abundance of His knowledge and wisdom, to such degree that He hath placed the reins of all knowledge in the grasp of the lowliest of His servants and in the hands of the most abject of His creatures when they hold fast to the cord of His love in the days of His Manifestation.</p>
<p>All praise be to God Who inspireth whom He willeth with the hosts of His revelation and casteth into the heart of whomsoever He desireth the light of His knowledge. There is no God but Him, Who hath manifested Himself through His own Self to such extent that no veil remaineth save the light of His beauty, and no cloud save the intensity of His revelation.</p>
<p>Then blessings and peace be upon the most noble of His chosen ones, the lord of His creation, and upon his family and his progeny, and then upon His friends who have arisen to carry out His Cause and have remained steadfast in His love.</p>
<p>And now, be it known that thy beloved letter was received and was the source of joy and gladness. God willing, may this blessing ever accompany thee and this confirmation remain constant, that from time to time thou mayest seek knowledge of the condition of those wandering in the desert of disappointment and obscurity, and show them kindness. May God grant thee the best of rewards and enable thee to do what He loveth and approveth.</p>
<p>As to thy question regarding how rights can be restored in the world after death and how the rights of people can be fulfilled in the Greater Resurrection, which hath been interpreted as the Day of Recompense, and how this can be conceived and made possible, given that these ornaments, properties and rights which are sought after and visible in this vain life have no existence in the worlds beyond death, and even if they did exist would yield no benefit or fruit to the rightholders - how then can the restoration of rights be spoken of in those worlds, as is commonly said that the All-Merciful God may at times forgive His own rights and grant pardon, but He forgiveth not the rights of people until they are fulfilled[…]</p>
<p>O brother! The realities of things manifest and appear with diverse aspects and varying appearances, reality after reality, in every world. The wise ones who have drunk from the wine of inner meanings have affirmed the embodiment of deeds. How excellent are the words of Him Who said! The All-Glorious One declares, and the Dayspring of the Revelation of the All-Merciful has stated: “People shall be rewarded according to their deeds - good for good, and evil for evil.” Thus it becomes evident that deeds shall endure, and every attribute shall have existence, so that by the very attribute and deed itself shall they be recompensed. Therefore, every attribute and every deed that appears from any doer has a form in every world and manifests itself therein, “that every soul may be rewarded for what it has earned, and He is swift in reckoning.”</p>
<p>And when we wish to explain this matter and describe how things appear in the countless worlds, I can find no better example that is closer to understanding and comprehension than the world of sleep, for it was said “Sleep is the brother of death” - so that you may know the brother by the resemblance to his brother. Observe then that in the world of dreams you witness certain things, and after awakening in this world you interpret and explain them with different names, forms and attributes. Then, with the passage of time, things unfold exactly as interpreted and explained.</p>
<p>O brother! When you yourself have experienced dreams and seen therein things that had one name and attribute there, but have another name and attribute here, then likewise affirm this difference of forms in the world after death. Know with certainty that the reality, essence, oneness, form and attributes differ. And if you have not witnessed this station with your own eyes, then turn to the interpretations of the mystics among the interpreters, who have interpreted every deed and word, and explained every thing. The Most Truthful of Speakers mentions the dream of Joseph (peace be upon our age and upon him) and his interpretations of the dreams of the two persons mentioned in the Book. Now consider what kind of world it is where father and mother are seen in the form of sun and moon, and brother appears as a star, and what kind of world this is where the opposite is seen, where sun and moon appeared as father and mother, and star was perceived as brother. His words, exalted be His sovereignty: “I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating themselves before me.” The interpretation of this dream became manifest when that holy one sat upon the throne of glory and Jacob (peace be upon him) with eleven brothers fell at his feet. Thus, when this matter is proven and established, the vindication of every right in every world shall be given in the form that pertains to that world and […]</p>
<p>Assuredly, if it were otherwise, right would not be vindicated. Let Me give thee an illustration that perchance through multiple examples what hath been stated may be brought closer to understanding and the matter may be confirmed. Consider: if in springtime someone were to usurp a seed or pit from another and plant it in his own garden until it groweth green and flourishing, and finally in summer beareth fruit or becometh a tree, and then a just sovereign desireth in this summer season to restore the right of the wronged one - how would he proceed? Would he take in exchange the seed or pit, or would he seize the very tree with its fruit and restore it? Assuredly thou wouldst say the tree, even though this form is different from that form, and this name and attribute different from that name and attribute it possessed in spring. Indeed, that seed and pit, according to thy reckoning, no longer exists in summer, and even if returned exactly as it was, it would yield no fruit for its owner and produce no result, since the spring season which was the time for planting hath passed, and the seed and pit would be but useless implements. This is according to outward vision that was mentioned - that it existeth not and yieldeth no fruit. However, in truth and reality this seed and pit doth exist and is manifest in the form of tree and fruit, which is higher and more excellent. And it may well be that right hath been vindicated in this very world though thou art unaware, just as at times riches and possessions become the garment of tribulations and calamities, and tribulation and calamity appear in the form of wealth. Thus the loss of wealth sometimes becometh the cause and means of averting calamity, and in this regard it mattereth not whether this loss of wealth be through heavenly causes or through someone’s oppression followed by its seizure. Therefore whoever seizeth and taketh such wealth hath removed calamity and tribulation from thee and brought it upon himself. Can any vindication of right better than this be conceived? Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! And were I to expound on the manifestations of deeds, actions and words which appear in countless different forms in the divine worlds and lift the veil, there would be fear that on one hand holy souls would abandon their bodies and ascend to the exalted stations of the All-Merciful, while evil oppressive souls would yield up the ghost in fear of what they had wrought in their vain lives. O what longing for spiritual virtues, goodly deeds, truthful and beneficial words, and that which appeareth therefrom of the raised heaven and spread earth and shining suns and gleaming moons and brilliant stars and pure springs and flowing rivers and gentle breezes and lofty palaces and towering trees and gathered fruits and low-hanging clusters and singing birds and reddened leaves and fragrant flowers! Then I say: Security! Security! O my Lord, the All-Merciful, from evil deeds and […]</p>
<p>Evil deeds, unacceptable actions, harmful lies and that which proceeds from them appear in creation in the form of fires, hell, the Zaqqum tree, thorny plants, and in the form of all wickedness, abhorrence, illness, sorrows, poisons, swords, arrows and spears. God is Most Great! Beyond this, the revelation of mysteries is not permitted. And I say: Glory, then Majesty, then Grandeur belong to God, the One, the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>I bring thee another example from the divine world of religious law which corresponds to the world of creation, and I complete the analogy through divine laws. Perhaps to the extent that thou art aware of divine worlds, thou wilt know and discover the similarity of the world, that thou mayest apply it to infinite worlds.</p>
<p>I give the example of Islamic law and the law that preceded it, of which thou art aware and cannot deny. If a Christian, according to his law and custom, demands payment for wine or a portion of swine meat from one of his co-religionists, and afterward both become honored by accepting Islam, and the deputies of the Most Holy Law wish to secure the right of the wronged one - how do they proceed and exact the right, given that in Islamic law wine and swine meat are of no use and have no value and yield no fruit for the rightful owner? Thou hast no choice but to say that compensation must be given from what is lawful in Islamic law, or that its value must be paid according to what is established and determined among those who consider it lawful, just as similar rulings are recorded and written in some instances in the books of jurisprudence. And if I wished to bring thee a hundred thousand other examples, both mystical and common, by God’s might and power I would not be incapable, but I fear it would become lengthy and cause thee weariness and thou wouldst be deprived of what has been presented. Therefore I conclude by saying: Praise be to God Who guided us to the recognition of His Most Great Name and taught us what the nations knew not.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Holy!</p>
<p>This is a letter from the Prisoner to him who hath believed in God, the Omnipotent, the Single, the One, the Almighty, that he may rejoice in God’s remembrance of him and be numbered among those who have attained.</p>
<p>O thou who art young in love and mature in wisdom! Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thy days have been linked with the Days of God, through whose effulgent lights the denizens of the Concourse on High have been illumined and the eyes of those near unto God have been solaced. Say: Whoso harboureth in his heart the love of God is verily in the springtime of youth, though a thousand years may have passed over him; and whoso is deprived thereof is indeed in the depths of age, though he be but in the prime of life. Thus hath the decree been inscribed in a preserved and mighty Tablet.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou hast hearkened unto the Word of God and hast been quickened thereby. Arise, therefore, among the servants to praise My Supreme and Most Great Self. Let not the happenings of the world grieve thee. Detach thyself from all things, then turn unto God, thy Beloved and the Beloved of all the worlds. He hath not forgotten thee and hath been with thee under all conditions. He is aware of thy love for Him and hath sent down verses unto thee as a testimony for thee and an evidence unto all the worlds.</p>
<p>Gladden the people with this Cause and grieve not over those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, the Sovereign, the Omnipotent, the All-Wise. Say: These are the days whereof We forewarned you aforetime, that the sincere ones would be in grave peril. Shun the enemies of God, then draw nigh unto those on whose faces thou perceivest the radiance of the All-Merciful. Thus doth the Supreme Pen command thee in this resplendent and luminous morn.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Ali hath come unto you with the truth, and this is His Temple among you, speaking from the right hand of the Throne: O people of the Bayan! By God, this is indeed My Self and My Beloved Who hath come unto you with manifest sovereignty. Beware lest ye differ concerning Him and dispute with Him as did the people of the Furqan when I came unto them from the dawning-place of the Spirit with a mighty command. Fear God, O people, and reject not the truth through what ye possess, and turn not back on your heels, and be not of the losers. This is God’s proof among you, and His evidence within you, and His testimony amongst all created things. Hold fast unto it, then detach yourselves from those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, your Lord and the Lord of the exalted Throne.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest toward the sanctuary of holiness! Be thou assured in thy soul that God hath ordained for thee in His presence a station of glory and honor. Blessed is he who entereth therein and abideth therein, and this is indeed a bounty that equals not whatsoever hath been created in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Believe in Him Who hath come unto you with the truth and Who calleth you unto God, your Lord, and be not of them who join partners with Him. He desireth naught for you save to draw you nigh unto a station of sublime glory. Fear God and deny not Him in Whom ye believed aforetime, and be ye of the faithful. Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, through utterance, and follow not those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. Thus doth God counsel you in truth that ye may be among those who act.</p>
<p>And thou, convey the Cause of thy Lord and be not silent in remembering thy Lord, and be of those who remember. Verily, whoso conveyeth His Cause, He will strengthen him with the truth through angels drawn nigh. Unite the loved ones of God in that land, then gather them unto the Law which hath flowed in truth from the presence of the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Make mention in the Book of Muhammad, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of God and be of them that are glad. O Muhammad! Be praiseworthy in deed, and arise amidst men with the praise of thy Lord, for this is the most excellent of all deeds, wert thou of them that know. God hath prescribed unto every soul the promulgation of His Cause, and whoso quickeneth a soul with the life of faith, it is as though he had quickened all them that dwell on earth. Beware lest thou grieve over aught. Take thou fast hold of the Most Great Handle within thyself and be not of them that slumber.</p>
<p>Then make mention in the Book of him who hath been named ’Ali in the Kingdom of God, the Most High, the Most Great. O ’Ali! Blessed art thou in that thou hast been named with this Most Great Name, whereby the heavens of Command were rolled up and spread out again, and this is a truth certain. By it was established the Balance of Justice and the Dove of Eternity warbled upon the twigs of the mighty Tree. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord and fear not the hosts of Satan. Thy Lord, verily, aideth him who aideth Him and strengtheneth him with the hosts of the unseen. He, verily, is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Then make mention in the Book of him who hath been named Hasan, that he may be benevolent in the Cause of God, his Lord and the Lord of all worlds. O Hasan! Dost thou sleep upon thy couch while the Beloved is in the hands of the oppressors? Dost thou take thy ease while the Temple of the Youth lieth imprisoned in this remote prison? Say: Verily, He is content with God’s good-pleasure, though the clouds of destiny may rain down upon Him the darts of tribulation at every moment, before and after. He giveth thanks unto His Lord in all this, and yearneth to meet Him in a station of glorious and resplendent might. He crieth out: “O Beloved of the worlds! If my body be a veil between me and Thee, then lift it by Thy sovereign might and power. And if my form be a barrier between me and Thee, then render it non-existent through Thy power that hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth.” Thus warbleth the Cock of the Divine Throne, when He descended from the highest branches of the Lote-Tree of the Far Boundary and found solace with God’s loving servants. Beyond this, this Bird hath melodies which none in all the worlds can hear save him who hath detached himself from all things and hath tasted the sweetness of remembrance from this Most Great, Most Ancient, and Most Glorious Remembrance.</p>
<p>Then make mention from Our presence of thy son who hath been named with this Name, whereby they who disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds, were struck with terror, whereby the faces of them that have professed the unity of God were illumined, and whereby the hearts of them that yearn have soared unto the dominion of God, the King, the Just, the Wise. O Husayn! Wert thou to learn of this Husayn, thou wouldst surely weep in the wilderness like unto the bereaved, nay more grievously still, and God is witness unto this. Wert thou to open thine eye and behold Me, thou wouldst find My soul at that moment beneath the dagger of Shimr, then the point of the spear, then the swords of the idolaters. Yea, by the life of the Beloved! Thus it behooveth My soul, and I besought God for this ere the creation of the heavens and the earth. For verily, a body that hath not been made a target for the spears of the idolaters, the swords of the perverse, and the arrows of the hypocrites–by God, it would never profit Me, nor would I ever desire it. To this testify all atoms, but the people are in profound heedlessness. Say: The Spirit belongeth unto the Lord of the Spirit, and none among all the worlds can dispose of it. By My life! Were but one word to be cast upon you from that station, ye would surely sacrifice your souls for love of My beauty and out of attachment to My transcendent, mighty and wondrous Self. O Most Exalted Pen! Take hold of thy reins and rend not further the veil of mysteries[…]</p>
<p>Then make mention of him who was named Zaynu’l-’Abidin, that he may be mindful of his Lord’s remembrance amidst Our heedless servants. O Zaynu’l-’Abidin! Hearken unto My call from the direction of the Prison, that there is none other God but Him. His is the greatness and the power, His is the might and the dominion, and in His grasp lies the kingdom of the hidden and the manifest, and He encompasses all things. Moreover, He Who hath come unto you is the Proof of God unto His creation and His Balance amongst the worlds. Bear thou witness, O servant, to that which God hath witnessed, and be not of the silent ones. Arise to praise thy Lord - open thy tongue in utterance concerning this Youth Who hath been afflicted at the hands of the oppressors. Thus have We commanded thee in truth, out of Our love for thee and for the loved ones.</p>
<p>Then convey My greetings unto the devoted women who have believed in God, that they may remember their Lord at eventide and at dawn, and be detached from all the worlds. Let them be patient in God and trust in Him in all matters, for verily He loveth His devoted maidservants and His devoted servants.</p>
<p>Then make mention from Us to the son of him who was named ’Abdu’llah, that the winds of his Lord’s will may move him - winds that blow from His exalted, transcendent and mighty paradise. O servant! Blessed art thou for having been mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen in these days wherein the Sun of Eternity hath shone forth from the All-Glorious Horizon, by which the denizens of the highest Paradise and the Concourse on high were illumined, were ye of those who know.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear God and spread not corruption in the land after its reformation, and shed not blood. Thus doth the Pen of Command admonish you in this remote Prison. Say: O people! Adorn yourselves with the ornament of righteousness, your tongues with the praise of God, and your hearts with His love - this is better for you than the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. Beware lest ye differ in the Cause of God. Gather ye together around His Cause, whereby the faces of those who have recognized His unity will be illumined. Thus have We counseled those who have believed in God and were among the successful ones.</p>
<p>And thou, O youth, give thanks unto God thy Lord, then turn thy face toward the House and say:</p>
<p>O my God and my Master! I am he who hath turned his face toward the seat of Thy throne, and I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which all who are in the heavens and on earth were shaken, save those whom Thou didst preserve through Thy grace and didst number among the sincere ones, that Thou withhold not from me the wonders of Thy gifts and favors, and that the sweet fragrances of Thy mercy and bestowals be not cut off from me. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest, and Thou art the All-Compelling, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Glorious. O Lord! Make me steadfast in Thy love and firm in Thy Cause in such wise that my feet shall not slip even though all created things should oppose me.</p>
<p>Thus have We commanded thee in truth. Act thou according to what thou hast been bidden by One Forgiving, Merciful.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Return to the mention of him in whose name this Tablet hath been revealed, as a token of grace unto him from his Lord, the Most High, the Great, that he may rejoice once again in his soul at these verses which have been sent down from the heaven of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and that he may inhale the fragrance of the Youth from the raiment of utterance and be of the thankful ones. O servant! Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for having singled thee out for this supreme grace, for verily His mercy hath preceded all created things and His bounty hath encompassed all who dwell in His realm. Convey Our greetings unto him who was named Muhammad-’Ali, that he may detach himself from the world and turn unto God, his Lord, and draw near unto the shore of this Most Great, this Mighty Ocean. Say: It behooveth one like thee to detach thyself from all allusions and to burn away the veils with the fire of the love of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Arise to serve God and His Cause, then forbid the people from that which displeaseth His good-pleasure. Thus hath the command been revealed in this Revelation, and thy Lord is, verily, witness and well-informed of this. We have forbidden the servants from transgression and wickedness, and have commanded them to fear God, the Mighty, the Wise. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, then guide the people to the spring which hath flowed forth from the Will of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, in this wondrous and sublime Paradise. Say: O people! Aid the religion of God through your deeds, and be not of the transgressors. Beware lest ye cast the ordinances of God behind your backs and follow the ways of the oppressors. We showed thee aforetime in thy dream that which would guide thee to this Paradise. Ponder, that thou mayest recognize and be filled with manifest joy. Nothing escapes His knowledge, and with Him is the knowledge of the heavens and the earth. Say: Knowledge is the recognition of God and the Manifestation of His Self in these days, were ye of them that perceive. Without this, nothing shall be mentioned before God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers of old. Satan shall soon appear unto you in human form; take ye refuge in God from his evil, O concourse of believers! Verily, they who have not believed in this Revelation, nothing shall profit them, even if they possess all the books of the ancients and the moderns. And the mercy which descendeth from the clouds of grace be upon thee and upon those who have turned towards the direction of God with pure and luminous hearts. The Most Glorious. If thou art able to attain unto the presence of the Countenance, We have verily permitted thee to do so, as a bounty from Us and a mercy from Our presence upon thee, that thou mayest be of the thankful ones. However, this should be without causing any grief or creating any disturbance; otherwise, remain in thy place and then proclaim the Cause of God. This is greater than all that is great.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most High!</p>
<p>This is a letter from the Prisoner to him who hath believed in God, his Lord, the Most High, the Most Great, and who hath attained the presence of the Youth and heard from Him what none else hath heard, were ye to be of the fair-minded. Upon him have shone the lights of the Countenance, and the breezes of the All-Merciful have stirred him, and the melodies of God, the Almighty, the Most High, the All-Knowing, have attracted him. Hearken unto the words of Him Who calleth thee, then cast behind thee all that thou hast and take what thy Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate, hath given thee. Beware lest thou be veiled by what hath been revealed in the Bayan from Him through Whose will the religions of former times were manifested. Beware lest thou be veiled by its letters and its mirrors and what was created therein from Him through Whose word all things proclaim “There is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Wise.” This is what We have commanded thee in the outward realm of the Cause, even as it was sent down in the Bayan from the presence of the Ancient Sender. If thou wouldst observe with keen sight, by God the Truth, thou wouldst not find in the Bayan a single word but that thou wouldst discover therefrom the fragrance of My mighty and wondrous remembrance. For every word God took the covenant of My Self before His Own Self, wert thou of those who know. Say: The Point of the Bayan moved only by My Name, breathed only in My remembrance, and spoke only in My praise. To this testifieth what was revealed by Him, and His own self beareth witness to what I say. And verily, at this moment, He liveth in this sublime horizon and declareth: “O Muhammad! Hearken unto the words of Him Who calleth thee unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Commit not that whereby the sanctity of the Cause would be violated amongst the people, and be not of those who were veiled from God on the day when the clouds were cleft asunder and the Beloved came with His name, the Most High, the Most Great.” These are they who rose in opposition and protest, and among them were those who denounced Him as an infidel, and those who warred against Him, and those who cited the verses of the past and thereby objected to His wronged and lonely Self.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Hearest thou not the melodies of God in this mighty and glorious melody? Perceivest thou not the fragrance of God from this luminous and shining raiment? Beholdest thou not the power of God in this power that hath encompassed the worlds? Hast thou not seen the sovereignty of God and heard His uprise amidst the hosts of His enemies? By God, all that hath appeared from Him is a proof and evidence, yea, a testimony unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. Say: This indeed is the path of God, therefore walk ye therein and be not of the patient ones. This verily is the melody of God which hath been raised from the direction of the Throne; hearken unto it, O people, and be not of the doubters. This indeed is His countenance which hath shone forth from the horizon of the will of the Most Merciful in this most wonderful and wondrous Paradise.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! This is verily the News that had been inscribed in all the Tablets, and this is the Cause at which all who are in the heavens and on earth were dismayed, except such as God preserved through His grace and power from His presence, and gave to drink of the Kawthar of immortality from the fingers of thy Lord’s will, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and made them among those who are firmly established. Should this Countenance be veiled by whatsoever countenance ye desire, be ye among those who turn towards it. O Muhammad! By God, this is verily the Beauty of the heavens and earth, wert thou of them that are assured. This is the Beauty the like of which hath never appeared in all creation. Ponder then, that thou mayest witness what God hath testified in the atoms of the Bayan and at this very moment. O Muhammad! Should anyone come forth and adduce all that was revealed from time immemorial, it would profit him not a whit except he acknowledge this Manifestation which hath dawned in this luminous Morn. Say: Truth itself moveth with Him, were ye of them that know. Know thou moreover that every tree planted in the Bayan was planted solely for this Most Great, this Mighty Manifestation. Hear My words, then detach thyself for the sake of God, thy Beloved and the Beloved of them that know. Then incline thine inward ear unto the melodies of the birds of sorrow in the Paradise of exposition in My remembrance and praise, that haply thou mayest detach thyself from all else but Me and turn unto the face of thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Not a letter, nor a word, nor any utterance was recorded in the Bayan except it was revealed concerning My Cause, and to this testifieth all things, wert thou of the fair-minded. Wouldst thou be of them who hesitated in the Cause of God on the day when the Manifestation of His Self came unto them with manifest sovereignty, who clung to the words revealed aforetime and objected thereby to His Self, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent? If thou fearest for thy faith, preserve this Tablet, and should anyone object to thee by any proof concerning thy belief in God, bring forth this Tablet and say: By this holy, mighty and resplendent Book! By God, I intended naught in these words save to proclaim the Cause of thy Lord, and God is indeed witness and knowing of this. I desired not Mine own self, but rather what God desired for His near servants. My will was naught but His Will, and what He desired was indeed My desire, wert thou of them that know. I speak not except by His leave, and move not except by His binding, firm and mighty command. Hear My words, then cast aside what thou hast and arise to serve the Cause of God, thy Lord. He will verily aid thee with the truth, and His help through the sincere ones is nigh. Come forth from behind the veils of allusion, then turn thy face unto the concourse of the Furqan and say: The test hath come to you from the direction of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Fear God and be not of them that hesitate. Say: This is verily a Youth Who hath come unto you with God’s testimony, His proof, His evidence, His signs, His grandeur and His sovereignty. Nothing can withhold Him from His Cause, nor can the heavens and earth stand against Him. The Kingdom of God marcheth before Him, and behind Him are the hosts of divine revelation and inspiration, and on His right hand a company of angels. Then turn unto the concourse of the Gospel and say: The Most Great, the Mighty News hath come unto you. By God, He Who ascended unto heaven hath in truth descended and standeth before the Face. Fear God and be not of the heedless. He hath come to give life unto the world and to unite all its peoples, and this is better for you, did ye but know. He hath sacrificed His spirit once again for all who are in the heavens and on earth, out of His love for God, the Almighty, the August, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>Say to the priest: Beware lest thou ring the bells. By the True One! The Most Great Bell hath appeared, rung by the fingers of the Will of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, in the Throne of Glory, and by it have been attracted the realities of all created things - they who have purified their vision from human limitations and turned unto this Most Great Prospect, the Seat of God, the Almighty, the Great, the Glorious. Fear thou no one. Arise through My power and sovereignty, then deliver My messages, and be not of the patient ones. Then turn thy gaze unto the concourse of the Torah and say: He hath come unto you - the Sovereign of Names and Attributes, within Whose grasp lieth the kingdom of verses, and there hath appeared at His right hand that which was promised unto you of the House of David. Indeed, He is the Promised One in your midst, and now He calleth unto you from the right of the throne of your Lord, the Loving. O concourse of the Jews! How long will ye slumber upon the couch of ignorance and heedlessness? Lift up your heads, for lo! the Sun hath risen from the horizon of majesty and hath reached its zenith. Be illumined by its light and be not of them that are veiled.</p>
<p>Say: In the name of God and by God! Then turn to the people of the Bayan and say: O people! Have ye not been promised in the Tablets of your Lord, the All-Merciful, this Revelation which hath come to you with the proof of God, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing? If ye deny it, by what proof can ye establish your faith in God, your Lord? Bring it forth and be not of the patient ones. This is the Self of ’Ali in your midst, the Manifestation of Muhammad among you, and the Spirit of the Spirit between the heavens and the earths. He desireth naught for Himself and calleth you at all times unto God, your Lord. Have mercy, O people, and slay Him not with the swords of hatred, and be not of the wrongdoers. Judge fairly within yourselves: Have ye found in the Bayan aught that would not serve as evidence of My remembrance and praise? Nay, by His Self, the Ancient of Days! Were ye to inhale the leaves of the Bayan, from every leaf thereof ye would discover the fragrance of My holy and glorious Raiment. Beware, O people, lest ye pierce Him with the arrows of idle fancies and vain imaginings, and be of the losers. I desired not to manifest Myself amongst you, but God did manifest Me in truth, caused Me to speak His verses, and sent Me unto all the worlds. This indeed is the Lamp which your Beloved and the Beloved of the mystics hath kindled, and this is the Fire which the Will of your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath ignited at the heart of all creation. Were anyone to hearken unto the sighing of but a single spark thereof, he would hear that this is the Beloved of God Who hath appeared among you, and this is the Object of worship of all worlds. I possess nothing of Mine own, for He speaketh by My tongue as He willeth. If this be My crime, then I am not the first of the transgressors. Ponder upon God’s Messengers and His Emissaries: They all spoke as this Spirit hath spoken among you, as testify the realities of all things and the bearers of the mighty throne. If ye help not this Wronged One, at least oppose Him not. Fear ye God Who sent down the Bayan and the former Books. By His Best-Beloved Self! I desired not to be a ruler over those on earth, but rather to convey unto them that which I was bidden by the Mighty, the Beauteous, that He might detach them from earthly things and cause them to ascend unto a station beyond the recognition of the polytheists and the comprehension of the opposers. Thou knowest that I have found no safe haven in My days, but have at all times been at the mercy of the oppressors, and there hath befallen Me that which hath befallen no one before Me - thou wouldst bear witness to this wert thou to be of the fair-minded. I have arisen to make mention of God amidst His creation to the extent of My ability, and have not fallen short in proclaiming His Cause throughout the heavens and the earth. These are days the like of which the eye of creation hath never seen, and in the like of which none of God’s Messengers hath appeared save this most wondrous and incomparable Revelation. Through this Revelation is the decree of origination made manifest, were ye of them that are assured, and through this Revelation hath the power of God been established among His servants and His sovereignty manifested unto all possessed of keen insight and knowledge.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! We have indeed answered thee before this, and thou wast present before Us and heard from Us that which most of mankind have not heard, and thou hast become acquainted with My nature and My remembrance amongst these heedless ones. Beware lest thou deprive thyself of this Most Great, this Mighty Ocean. Verily, he whom the people had taken as their lord appeared before the Presence with evident submissiveness. Yet when We exalted his mention, he sought to shed My blood by following his self and his passion, and thus did he deal with Us in this remote Prison. Say: O people! Fear God and follow not those who cannot distinguish their left from their right. Thus have We recounted unto thee what hath befallen the Youth, and cast upon thee that which shall draw thee nigh unto God, thy Lord, that thou mayest be of them that attain. Detach thyself from thine own self, then from the world, and arise to serve thy Lord’s Cause with manifest power. If mankind were to gather around this Ocean which surgeth within itself for its own sake, and from each of whose waves there proclaimeth every billow that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Gracious! Beware lest names withhold thee from Him Who brought them into being, and dominion from its Possessor. Purify thyself from all things, then thy tongue from the mention of all peoples. Then, shouldst thou make mention before men of the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, thy words would influence them, save those from whom the spirit of life hath been taken. These are but ashes of the earth; they shall never be quickened, even should the spirit be breathed into them throughout the duration of God’s kingdom, the Mighty, the Powerful. We have sent thee aforetime Tablets of transcendent glory, a single word of which sufficeth all created things. Hearken unto that which We have commanded thee, for love of thine own self, and be not of the transgressors. This beseemeth thee and will render thee independent of all that thou hast known and learned, and of all that hath been created between the heavens and the earth. And the Spirit and glory rest upon thee and upon those who have believed in God and are of them that are well-assured.</p>

<p>He is the All-Commanding, the All-Wise!</p>
<p>O Nightingale! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of all worlds! We address thee in the Persian tongue. Verily, We love to make mention of thee and give thee glad tidings of My grace, My bounty, and My mercy which have preceded thee and aided thee in teaching My Most Great Cause and My Mighty Message. God knoweth, and thou knowest, that the Pen of God hath never ceased to make mention of His servants and counsel them. We have bestowed upon them that which will preserve them, exalt them, strengthen them, and draw them nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Time and again have We made mention of that which leadeth to the elevation, advancement and refinement of souls, and the conditions required of teachers have shone forth from the horizon of divine Tablets. We beseech God to aid all to achieve that which draweth hearts near and attracteth them. The Most Exalted Pen lamenteth and declareth: Today the people of Baha must guide the people of the world through deeds and character, and lead them to the straight path.</p>
<p>One night in the realm of vision, We addressed one of the claimants to love who dwelleth outside this land with this blessed verse: “Thou wast created to aid My Cause, yet thou didst aid Mine enemies through deeds more powerful than the hosts of kings and rulers.” Other verses were also revealed to him, and We have mentioned this verse in certain Tablets. Ask thou of God to raise up souls who will arise to aid the Cause of the Wronged One with perfect sanctity, detachment and severance - an arising that no laxity can overtake nor sitting down follow. The loved ones are few and the enemies many.</p>
<p>O Nightingale! Upon thee be My glory! Strive that perchance the servants may not be deprived of the waves of the divine ocean of inner meanings. Most are veiled by names, which have become the greatest barrier, thus preventing them from drawing nigh to the Most Exalted Horizon. Say: O people of Baha! Should unseemly conduct appear from any one of you, that one hath been and is an helper of the enemies of Truth, for heedless souls, upon hearing of a reprehensible act, kindle the fire of corruption and begin to spread it, attributing it to the Source.</p>
<p>Repeatedly hath this exalted word descended from the Most Exalted Pen: The hosts that can render victorious the Truth are goodly deeds and praiseworthy character, and the leader and commander of these hosts is the fear of God. By My life! Few indeed are the ears worthy of hearing this call. From the beginning of the Cause We have borne countless afflictions that perchance the heedless souls might become aware and attain to that which beseemeth them. The Cause of God is as manifest as the sun, brilliant and luminous[…]</p>
<p>O Friends! Extinguish the lamp of error and kindle within your hearts and souls the everlasting beacons of guidance, for ere long the assayers of all being will accept naught but the purest virtue in the presence of the Adored One, and naught but spotless deeds shall be accepted by Him.</p>
<p>This is written in the first line of the Tablet and concealed in the pavilion of God’s protection:</p>
<p>O My servant! Let not a single breath deprive thee of the imperishable sovereignty, and forfeit not the celestial dominion of Paradise for a fleeting desire. This is the living waters of Kawthar, flowing from the fountain-pen of the All-Merciful. Well is it with them that drink thereof.</p>
<p>O earthly plant! How is it that thou wilt not touch thy garment with sugar-stained hands, yet with a heart defiled by desire and passion thou seekest intimacy with Me and yearnest to enter My holy dominions? Far, far be it from you, from that which ye desire! […]</p>
<p>O Nightingale! The purpose is that it be made known to all that from the earliest days the Supreme Pen hath commanded all to sanctification, detachment, and that whereby the Cause is exalted. These sublime words were revealed in the Tablet of Majesty: “Today the helper of the Truth hath been goodly deeds and praiseworthy character.” Repeatedly hath this exalted word been revealed from the Supreme Pen: “The harm to this Wronged One came not from the chains and fetters of the Land of ?a, nor from the oppression of the tyrants of the Land of Mim. Rather it came from souls who claim to love Him and count themselves among the people of Baha, yet are found to be obedient to self and passion.” Today must the friends be illumined with the light of piety and enkindled with the fire of detachment. This is the counsel of the Truth, exalted be His glory, both aforetime and hereafter. Well is it with them that act!</p>
<p>In truth I say: from whomsoever appeareth the fire of desire and passion, he is not and hath never been of the Truth. The friends must be adorned with the ornament of detachment, piety, trustworthiness and religion. In the Hidden Words We have said: “O ye that are fair in the outward and dark in the inward! Your likeness is as the clear, bitter water which to outward seeming is crystal pure but of which, when tested by the divine Assayer, not a drop is accepted. Yea, the sun’s rays fall alike upon the dust and the mirror, yet differ they in reflection even as doth the star from the earth, nay measureless is the difference!”</p>
<p>The influence of the Word hath ever been dependent upon sanctification of self. Say: O my God, my God! Illumine the hearts of Thy loved ones with the light of Thy knowledge, and aid them to champion Thy Cause through utterance from which the fragrance of Thy sanctity is diffused. O Lord! Withhold them not from the ocean of Thy bounty, nor from the outpourings of Thy days. I beseech Thee to assist them in whatsoever good Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention the loved ones of the land of Shin and likewise other lands. The excellence of that blessed land among hallowed regions is evident and manifest as the sun. Blessed is it and blessed are its people who have drunk the wine of revelation from the chalices of the bounty of their Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. Thou didst mention certain souls and their enkindlement with the fire of divine love. Praised be God, each one hath attained unto the waves of the ocean of utterance. We have mentioned them all with a mention that is sanctified above change and effacement. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Powerful. Give them My glad-tidings, remind them of My verses, and illumine them with the lights of My wondrous utterance. The Afnan of that land, upon them be My glory and loving-kindness, have attained unto that which hath no peer or likeness. We beseech God to manifest through them the standards of His might in His lands and the banners of His guidance amongst His servants.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Jinab-i-’Abdu’l-?amid, upon him be Baha, and of his attraction and ardor. Praise be to God, he turned to the Cause in its early days and attained the honor of meeting and reaching his goal. We beseech God to assist him that he may arise to serve the Cause, that perchance certain unseemly deeds may be transformed into pure and goodly acts.</p>
<p>O servant before ?a and Mim! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison and take hold of the reins of the Cause with wisdom and utterance. Give the people to drink, at one time from the choice wine of utterance, and at another from the Kawthar of divine knowledge. Say: O people! By the True One, ye were created for this Day. Cast aside vain imaginings and their manifestations, and conjectures and their sources. The veil hath been removed and the Creator of all things hath come with the banners of verses and the standards of clear proofs. Hasten with your hearts and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the Day of Return, and glory be unto Thee, O Master of all necks. Thus have We sent down the verses and expounded them in truth and sent them unto thee, that thou mayest arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as to cause the hearts of the wicked to tremble. Today the servants are heedless; were they to become aware and find their purpose, all would arise to serve. Their divines have kept them back from the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We beseech God to assist all to turn in repentance, for verily He is the Kind, the Forgiving.</p>
<p>Specifically for some of the aforementioned friends, exalted, wondrous and holy Tablets have been sent down from the heaven of God’s will. God willing, they shall drink from the Kawthar of the utterance of the All-Merciful and receive their portion from the ocean of true unity. He is the Giver, He is the Bestower, He is the Generous One.</p>
<p>Verily We make mention of the friends of God in Mim and Ya, then Mim, and We have sent down for them Tablets from the heaven of loving-kindness and favor. We beseech God to grant them the bounty of attaining His Tablets and to gladden them with that which He hath ordained for those who have turned unto Him from God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: My God, my God! By Thy power, raise up one who will arise to serve Thy Cause in such wise that nothing whatsoever shall deter him, nor shall the might of potentates frighten him, nor shall the clamor of the powerful weaken him. O my Lord! Thou seest Thy chosen ones in the hands of the heedless among Thy creatures. I beseech Thee, O Ancient King and Sovereign of nations, by Thy Most Great Name, to ordain for those who have entered beneath Thy shadow the reward of attaining Thy presence and that which Thou hast destined for Thy chosen ones. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Protector of all that was and shall be.</p>
<p>And We make mention of My handmaidens and My leaves who have believed in God, the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Say: O handmaidens of God! The Wronged One beseecheth God to draw you nigh and to assist you to be chaste, virtuous, righteous and God-fearing. Aid your Lord through pure and goodly deeds and blessed, praiseworthy conduct. O handmaidens of God! The world hath been encompassed by extinction. Blessed is the soul whom the concerns of the days have not kept back from the Lord of all names. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty be upon thee, O nightingale, and upon those who are with thee and who hearken unto thy words concerning this momentous News.</p>
<p>As commanded, deliver a copy of this blessed Tablet and the other holy Tablet which was revealed in thy name to Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’l-?amid, upon him be the glory of God.</p>

<p>In the Name of Our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath spoken that whereby the people were drawn unto Him, and through which the sincere ones hastened to the station of nearness, of holiness and of glory, and the unified ones to the place of might, grandeur and majesty. The wine of the utterance of the All-Merciful hath seized all who are in the realm of possibility, save those who violated the Covenant and broke God’s pledge on the Day of Meeting. Praise be to God Who hath manifested Himself through the name of Beauty to all regions; the first to attain unto this radiance were the lovers, whom every person of insight beholdeth in a state of attraction and burning. These are servants whom neither the conditions of the divines have withheld from God, the Lord of all names, nor the might of princes from the straight path. They arose and proclaimed: “God is our Lord, our Creator and our Provider. We have believed in Him and held fast to the cord of His favors and clung to the hem of His mercy.” Thus were they seized with such tyranny the like of which the eye of creation hath not seen, and there befell them in the path of God that which causeth bodies to quake at its mere mention. They arose and spoke until they sacrificed their lives in the path of God, their Goal and their Beloved. And among them was one who dwelt in His presence and abided under His shadow. The heat of love had seized him to such degree that he was set ablaze and soared in the atmosphere of the love of the All-Merciful. When he ascended, God purified him from all the odors of this world and the hand of grace admitted him to a station that cannot be described in words. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>Thereafter, O My beloved, the Servant received your letter which spoke of your recognition, your mention and your turning to the Supreme Horizon. When I read and understood its contents, I repaired to a station which meanings cannot reach, nor utterance, nor can the bird of knowledge approach it. I was present and presented that wherewith you praised God, the Lord of the Throne and of earth, the Master of the hereafter and of the former times. When the letter was completed, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that whereby spirits took flight. He said, exalted be His grandeur and His greatness:</p>
<p>In His Name, the Hearing, the All-Seeing […]</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Most Exalted Horizon! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One from the precincts of the luminous Spot, the Station which hath been mentioned in the Scriptures of God, the Lord of all worlds. That which was hidden from time immemorial hath been revealed, and He hath summoned all unto Him on a Day wherein the gentle breeze hath wafted and the Herald hath proclaimed: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” Blessed art thou for having turned towards Him and recognized Him when the servants turned away, save those whom God, the Lord of this resplendent Day, did choose. Blessed is he who hath arisen in My Name, and blessed is the silent one who hath spoken forth this mighty News. Thou didst attain unto My mention before, and now once again, as a token of grace from God. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the choice wine of revelation, and woe unto the heedless. We recount what hath befallen Us in this Most Great Prison. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Bountiful. The Bird of Faithfulness hath soared from the prison to the most exalted Summit, whereupon My Most Exalted Pen hath spoken that which nothing in the kingdom of creation can equal, as every fair-minded and perspicacious one doth testify. He hath attained unto that which cannot be mentioned in words. Give thanks unto God for this bounty, before which, when it was manifested, every possessor of distinction bowed down in humble submission. On the Day of Ascension, the Concourse on High and a company of angels and the Spirit welcomed him. Thus doth the Tongue of Grandeur make mention unto thee from this glorious station. We make mention of thy brother, thy mother, and thy sister, then those who are with you and have turned unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. We send greetings from this Station to the loved ones of God in that land and give them the glad tidings of My mercy which hath preceded all things and My grace which hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. We make mention of My leaves who have attained unto the supreme steadfastness in the days of their Lord, the Sovereign of all beings, in such wise that their feet have not slipped from the Path of God, the Almighty, the Powerful. The splendor that shineth forth from the horizon of My mercy and the peace that hath appeared from the direction of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon them, both men and women, and upon those whom the affairs of the world have not kept back from this mighty and wondrous Cause.</p>
<p>[The remainder of the text continues with a personal letter in Persian discussing various matters related to the passing of a believer, mentioning correspondences received, and concluding with reference to a revelation about to be shared…]</p>
<p>O friends of the All-Merciful! He says that this day is most beloved and blessed, for the Speaker of Sinai calls out with the most exalted call and the Dawning-Place of Revelation appears in the most glorious array. Whosoever attains unto it, the Concourse on High takes pride in mentioning him and the dwellers of the highest Paradise seek his presence. Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto the recognition of the Day of God and hast testified to that which God Himself hath testified. This hath been and is among the greatest bounties of God. By My life! He hath no peer or likeness. All who are on earth sought this Day, yet after its appearance all remained veiled save whom God wished. They occupy themselves with two fleeting days and are deprived and forbidden from the eternal bounty and everlasting feast. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having aided me in a Cause from which the divines of Thy earth and the learned of Thy lands were hindered. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Manifestation and the rushing winds of Thy grace to grant me steadfastness in Thy Cause. Unto Thee be praise, O Lord of Names, and unto Thee be glory, O Creator of the heavens! How can I praise and thank Thee for having remembered me in Thy prison and for having turned toward me while I was in the hands of the oppressors among Thy creatures. I beseech Thee not to deprive me of the outpourings of Thy days. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Exalted, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>This is what was sent down from the heaven of grace to Aqa Muhammad-Taqi, upon him be 669 [Baha’u’llah]. His words, exalted be His majesty:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Compassionate, the Bountiful</p>
<p>We heard thy mention and mentioned thee, and I am the All-Knowing Rememberer. We saw thee turning toward Us and We turned toward thee, and I am the One with power over what I will. We found the fragrance of thy love and sent thee the musk of inner meanings in the vessels of words, and I am the Bountiful Giver. Thou wert mentioned before by My Most Exalted Pen and this is yet another time, and I am the All-Wise Expositor. Give thanks unto God for this bounty and glorify Him with praise, and I am the All-Informed Educator.</p>
<p>This is what was sent down to Mulla Muhammad-Hasan, upon him be the glory of God. His words, exalted be His majesty:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Hasan! Blessed art thou for having attained unto My days and heard My call and answered thy Lord, when those in all lands turned away save whom God, the Lord of the worlds, wished. Some time ago thou didst attain unto the mention of God. By the life of God! Nothing can equal it. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath attained unto this most exalted and most high station. The bounty is great, the seeker rare. They who are on earth have gathered around the putrid carcasses of passion and desire, and are deprived of the descended feast from the heaven of the bounty of God, exalted be His glory. Convey the greetings of the Wronged One to the people of the village. The mention of all, whether male or female, and likewise the service of each one, is clear and evident in the Most Holy Court. No deed remains hidden. He is the All-Seeing and He is the All-Hearing. He testifies and sees, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We send Our greetings from this spot upon them and We have accepted what they have done in the path of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Soon shall they behold the recompense of their deeds and actions in this Most Great, this ordained Cause. Hold fast unto the cord of unity that its effects may be manifest in all regions. Thus doth the Lord of the Covenant counsel you as a bounty from His presence, and He is the Mighty, the Loving. Let not the affairs of men grieve you. The world shall pass away, and that which hath been sent down unto you from God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, shall endure. Glory be upon you and upon those who hold fast unto the Book of God and act according to what hath been sent down therein from the presence of an ancient Revealer. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>In the days when His Holiness the departed and exalted one, upon whom be all the Most Glorious Glory of God, was outwardly circumambulating, missives were sent to him from that land and from the people of the village. He gave all of them to this servant, and they were presented before the Throne. The purpose is that the gentlemen of that land and the people of the village should know that no deed is ever lost in the sight of God, nor shall it be, and each soul has been and shall be rewarded according to their righteous deeds. The service of each one has been accepted at the Most Holy Court - His is the praise, the thanksgiving, and the glory, and His is the kindness, the bounty and the grandeur. This evanescent servant beseeches and hopes that the All-Glorious Truth may make all aware and sustain them with the fruits of the Tree that is neither of the East nor of the West. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Let this blessed verse be ever before your eyes - the Most Merciful One says in the Qur’an, exalted be His Word: “O my son! If there be (but) the weight of a mustard-seed and it were (hidden) in a rock, or (anywhere) in the heavens or on earth, God will bring it forth.” All matters are manifest and evident, to this my Lord, the All-Seeing, the Kind, bears witness. How blessed is the state of one who in this Divine Day has recognized Him and has arisen to serve His Cause. The servant beseeches his Lord to assist His loved ones to do what He loves and is pleased with, and whereby His Cause may be exalted in the Kingdom of Creation. Verily, He does what He wills. There is no God but He, the Most High, the Most Exalted. The Glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon you and upon those who have clung to the hem of their Lord’s grace, the All-Forgiving, the Merciful. And praise be to God, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>It is submitted that His honor Karbala’i Aqa Husayn, son of the exalted departed one - may God elevate his station and upon him be the glory of God, his Lord - sent a letter to this servant, and its reply was presented, and there descended from the heaven of Divine Will, specifically for him, that which the world cannot equal. And he had mentioned the people of the village; the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed in this servant’s handwriting specifically for him, and in the letter which this servant sent to the aforementioned person, mention of the people of the village and the honored Leaf and His honor Haji Muhammad-’Ali - upon them be the glory of God - was again revealed from the heaven of Divine Will and sent. The purpose is that mention of the friends and loved ones has been and continues to be made in various places - some have outwardly received it and continue to receive it, and mention of others remains preserved in the Treasury of Infallibility until such time as grace may assist and deliver it. And one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed specifically for the mother and sister - upon them be the glory of God. God willing, they will be blessed by it and be gladdened by what was revealed for them. And praise be upon you from God, the Lord of the Manifestation.</p>

<p>O Nabil, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the Single One, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Most High!</p>
<p>These are the verses of God, sent down in truth from the presence of the Mighty, the All-Knowing. God hath made them the sign of His Revelation unto all those in the Concourse on High, and the mirror of His Beauty unto all who dwell in the kingdom of creation, and His conclusive proof unto all created things. He hath made them in themselves an evidence of His Own Self, and through them He sent forth the Messengers of old, testifying that there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Most Powerful. Through them He hath ordained the measures of His Cause for all who are in the heavens and on earth, and detailed every wise command. He hath deposited within every soul that whereby it may know its Lord, and without this His proof unto His creatures would not be complete, nor His evidence perfected before all worlds. He hath made the knowledge of His Self to be through His Self and through that which proceedeth from His presence, and not through aught else, whereunto testify all created things and, beyond them, all the Sacred Scriptures and Books that have been sent down from His hallowed, inaccessible and glorious dominion. The knowledge of His Self hath never been associated with anything amongst all that hath been created between the heavens and the earth, for all else is known through Him, while He is known through His Own Self, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Say: Verily His Cause cannot be confused with aught else, and it shineth forth from the horizon of holiness with a light which no veils can obscure, nor can the denial of these deniers prevent it.</p>
<p>O Nabil! Hearken unto the voice of Him Who weepeth within His soul - a weeping that causeth the eye of ’Ali in the Most Exalted Companion to weep, and thereafter the eyes of the Prophets and Messengers - because of what hath befallen Him at the hands of those whom He taught in days past and aided from His presence throughout all months and years. By God! Such tribulations have touched Me as have touched no one else amongst all created things, and there hath descended upon Me that which hath descended upon no soul. Thou wouldst surely believe Me if thou wouldst ponder My Cause and the multitude of Mine enemies from among the peoples of former times and those who reckon themselves among the doers of good. They claim within themselves that they have believed in God and His signs, yet when He appeared unto them with His sovereignty, His grandeur and His power, they disbelieved in Him and became numbered with the idolaters. Say: The Spirit speaketh in all things, saying that this is He Who was mentioned in the scriptures of the ancients, and this is He Who was purposed in the books of the Messengers. He desireth nothing for Himself, and is imprisoned in a place where the love of anyone profiteth Him not, nor the acceptance of all creation. He remindeth men for the sake of God and desireth from them no recompense. His reward is with Him Who created Him in truth and sent Him to the worlds with manifest sovereignty and a lucid Book. He commandeth righteousness and piety, forbiddeth wickedness and indecency, and guideth them to the paradise that they may enter it in security. Say: O people! Were ye to behold the signs of God and His manifestation with your own eyes, ye would recognize Him in less than a moment and would stand firm in His Cause in such wise that no trial could cause you to stumble, nor could the opposition of all the worlds hinder you. But whoso looketh not upon Him with his own eyes shall never know Him and shall be overturned by every trial, as thou hast witnessed in these days and art among those who bear witness. Verily, those who claimed to have recognized the Primal Point - had their recognition been true - would not have wavered at the appearance of His latter Manifestation, nor would their feet have slipped from the path, for He appeared with a revelation whose lights encompassed all who dwell in the kingdom. When they denied this Manifestation, it became evident that they had not truly known Him as He was in Himself, but had known only one of His names. Thus when He appeared with another name, they dispersed from around Him and returned to their former state. Thus do We clarify the matter for thee that thou mayest be endowed with insight from God, the King, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing. These are the worshippers of names in the sight of thy Lord, and they have no share of the cup of nearness.</p>
<p>O Nabil! By God, a trial hath appeared which hath caused all who are in the heavens and on earth to burn, and at this moment all things are burning within themselves, if thou be of them that perceive. The pillars of existence have been shaken, the bearers of the Throne have fled, the denizens of the realms of might have been thunderstruck upon the dust of extinction, the luminous ones have perished upon the exalted Mount, and intoxication hath overtaken the dwellers of the cities of knowledge and wisdom - all are now among the dead, save them whose eyes God hath opened with the light of recognition and whose hearts have been assured by the breezes that waft from the direction of a magnificent throne. These shall not be moved by the winds of the south and north, nor shall they be turned aside by the opposition of all who are in the heavens and earth, for this trial is a trial for those who have not witnessed the power of God and who have been in doubt concerning the meeting with their Lord, after the heaven of names was rent asunder and God came upon clouds of inner meanings with clear and manifest sovereignty. As for those who have known God by His Self and by what hath appeared from Him - these have drunk the pure wine of holiness in the most exalted Paradise from the hand of the mercy of thy Lord, the Most High, the Inaccessible, the Sublime, the Mighty, the Beauteous. Leave thou the cup of annihilation and take with the hand of contentment the chalice of everlasting life through the sovereignty of the name of thy Most Glorious Lord. Say: In the name of God, the Exalted, the Most High, the All-Powerful. Then drink thereof and be of the detached ones. By My life! When thou drinkest thereof, the tongues of the inhabitants of the Paradise of Refuge shall speak, then the tongues of those who dwell nigh the Divine Lote-Tree, and beyond them the Tongue of Grandeur shall proclaim: “Well is it with thee, O thou who art assured of God and who drinkest from the cup of His grace, the Inaccessible, the Mighty, the Wondrous!” Hearken unto the words of him who loveth thee for the sake of God, then rend asunder the veils through a power from Us and a sovereignty from Our presence, and fear no one but trust in God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers. Say: O people! Do ye imagine within yourselves that the signs of God could be confused with those of His creation? Nay, by the Sovereign of the Throne, if ye be of the fair-minded! Say: Were all who are in the heavens and on earth to gather together to walk as the Ancient Beauty walketh, they would never be able nor would they have the power - how much less the power that hath encompassed all created things or that which proceedeth from His mighty, omnipotent, and powerful Pen. And every letter that issueth from His mouth verily sustaineth all things as they are. Thus hath the Most Great Spirit spoken in this holy and magnificent Tablet.</p>
<p>O Nabil! Take hold of the Tablet with the power of God and withhold not thyself from that which hath been ordained for thee in the dominion of God, the All-Possessing, the Mighty, the Invincible, the All-Wise. Fear thou no one, for verily He will protect thee as He hath protected thee in truth, and will exalt thee amongst His servants, and will aid thee with the truth. He is, in truth, the best of helpers and supporters. Soon will He return thee to thy habitation, and thine eyes shall be solaced through His grace. He, verily, is the Most Merciful of the merciful.</p>
<p>By God, O Nabil! I have desired naught in this world, nor have I sought anything for Myself. My deeds bear witness to My words, if thou be of them that ponder. I have desired naught save ascension unto God, and at all times do I beseech Him to raise Me up unto Him and deliver Me from these people who speak naught except that which their idle fancies command them, and who are of the heedless ones. Shouldst thou become aware of My suffering, thou wouldst not be able to contain thyself and would weep as weep they who have lost their beloved ones.</p>
<p>By God! Were I to desire to acquaint anyone with what hath befallen Me, I would not be able, for the root of the matter hath remained hidden from the eyes of all the servants, save from two souls: one who was named Ahmad from thy land, who was raised unto God and martyred in His path and was of the martyrs; and the other who was named Kalim, who is with Us and around whom the decree doth revolve. God is witness to what I say.</p>
<p>Ponder thou this Cause, and My mention, and My rising amongst the people, and My concealment, that God may acquaint thee with that which no one hath been acquainted, for He inspireth His servants with whatsoever He willeth, and He is powerful over all things. When thou knowest, thou wilt become aware of My tribulation which no one in all creation hath borne, and thou wilt hear in My words a cry and lamentation.</p>
<p>If thou desirest to know God’s Cause in these days, purify thyself from all things, then arise from thy place, turn thy face toward God and say: “O my Lord! I am he who hath turned his face unto Thy face, the Everlasting, the Ever-Abiding, the Sanctified, the Luminous, and who hath detached himself from all things and entered beneath the shadow of Thy Most Great Mercy which hath encompassed the worlds. O my Lord! Deprive me not of the breezes of the dawn of Thy manifestation and Thy presence, and distance me not from the revelations of the glory of Thy mercy and favors. O my Lord! Cause me to know Thy beauty, then raise me unto that atmosphere wherein are heard the melodies of the birds of eternity, which Thou hast sanctified from the knowledge of all created things save such as have detached themselves wholly from all else but Thee and have laid hold on the hem of Thy wondrous and mighty bounty. O my Lord! Illumine my sight for the vision of the lights of Thy beauty and purify my heart for the recognition of Thy supreme and most great Self.”</p>
<p>Then go forth from the city wherein thou dwellest and distance thyself therefrom a thousand paces. Then stand and raise thy hands unto God with firm and steadfast certainty and say: “O my Lord! I am he who hath raised his hands unto the heaven of Thy bounty and bestowal. Send down, then, upon me that which befitteth the sovereignty of Thy generosity and gifts. Thou art, verily, powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O my Lord! I am he who hath abandoned his self and his desires and hastened toward the direction of Thy Cause and Thy good-pleasure, and hath advanced toward the sanctuary of Thy nearness and the Kaaba of Thy reunion and meeting. Make me not, O my God, deprived of that which is with Thee, nor despairing of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Thou art He Who hath ever been in the heights of power, might, and majesty, and wilt ever remain in the exaltation of loftiness, grandeur, and glory. Verily, Thou art near and responsive to him who calleth upon Thee.”</p>
<p>By God, O Nabil! If thou wouldst act in accordance with what We have commanded thee in pure truth, then with thine innate hearing thou wouldst hear the call of all things in this Most Great Announcement, and thou wouldst recognize God’s sovereignty and His manifestation, then His grandeur and His power. Thou wouldst hear what no one hath heard and witness that of which all creation remaineth heedless, save those whom God’s guidance hath preceded and whom He hath made the hands of His Cause among His creatures and the lights of His countenance amidst the worlds. Say: O people! By God, from all that appeareth from the holy direction there appear the signs of God, would ye but witness them. And from each letter thereof wafteth the fragrance of Paradise, which none can detect save those endowed with a refined sense of smell. Would that thou hadst been with Us in this migration and hadst become aware of the mysteries We have veiled from the servants out of Our desire to glorify God’s Cause, thy Lord, and hadst been among those who are informed. We beseech God to inform thee in those days and to impart unto thee that of which most of the servants remain heedless. Verily, He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. Soon there shall appear before thee that from which thou wilt find the Youth’s aversion, and thou wilt be commanded by a command which thou wilt not accept, and thou shalt leave it behind thee through a power from thy Lord, the Eternal, the All-Wise. This is of the tidings of the unseen which We have informed thee in truth, that thou mayest act in accordance with what thou hast been commanded by the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. All this is from My love for thee, and everything created and yet to be created testifieth thereunto, and then this Faithful Pen. O Nabil! Rend asunder the veils of dominion, then behold with the Greatest Vision. By God! The Cause hath been exalted and made manifest, and the Sun hath dawned from the horizon of a renowned Name, and the Face of God, the Hidden, hath appeared. Then shalt thou find the polytheists in turmoil and dust, and the monotheists in light and radiance. Say: Verily He hath appeared more swiftly than the twinkling of an eye, and none hath any escape from Him save that he either believeth in Him or denieth all the signs and returneth to the nethermost fire. And rejoice thou within thyself, then give the glad tidings unto the people that the Beauty hath appeared without veil or covering. Say: The Sun hath dawned from the holy horizon, then the Moon hath been cleft asunder. Thus doth the Pen of Decree teach thee that thou mayest be among the people of insight. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the love of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Ruler, the Powerful, the Omnipotent.</p>

<p>O thou Ismu’llah Zayn, upon thee be all the most glorious glory! He is God, exalted be His station, the All-Bountiful, the All-Giving!</p>
<p>Praise be befitting and worthy of that Omnipotent One Who, despite the turning away of kings and subjects, the indifference of divines, theologians and mystics, and the aversion of the people of the cities and lands, and the dispersion of affairs and separation of means, did gather His loved ones in the field and garden and made them circumambulate the Most Exalted Castle which hath been made the seat of the Throne of the Lord of Names. He is that Sovereign Omnipotent One Whom the power of the world cannot weaken, and the clamor of the nations cannot prevent from His purpose. He hath done what He willed and doeth what He pleaseth. Verily He is the Single, the One, the Unique, the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant who is present hath come with thy letter wherein was mentioned he who circumambulated the Throne when its seat was in Zawra and in the Land of Mystery, wherein was revealed that which was hidden in God’s knowledge, the Lord of all worlds. O Hasan! Blessed art thou and blessed are they whom the affairs of creation did not prevent from the Truth, who turned with radiant faces toward My most exalted horizon and bore witness to that which the Tongue of Grandeur had testified before the creation of the heavens and earths. Thy mention hath been presented in a leaf sent by My Name who was named Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We have seen thy name and have revealed for thee that which God hath made as a spirit for bodies, a light for the horizons, water for the trees, and glory for the righteous. When thou attainest unto it and hearkenest unto it, say:</p>
<p>“Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Desire of the world, for having remembered Thy servant in the Most Great Prison. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance and the stars of the heaven of Thy knowledge, to make me content with Thy good-pleasure, steadfast in service to Thy loved ones, speaking in Thy praise, and holding fast unto the wisdom Thou hast sent down in Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>We make mention of Our loved ones there who have not broken My Covenant and Testament and who turned to the Most Exalted Horizon when the Call was raised between earth and heaven. Blessed are they, their eyes, their hearts, their breasts, and their ears. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken forth from this Most Glorious Horizon. Blessed is he who hath heard and seen, and woe unto every heedless and remote one.</p>
<p>O people of God! We have adorned the heaven of knowledge with the stars of wisdom and utterance, and have sent down for those near unto Us that which shall draw them nigh unto My Straight Path. Give thanks unto God for having aided you to turn unto Him, to face toward His countenance, to gaze toward His direction, to hold fast unto His cord, and to cling to His luminous hem. We have made mention of you in diverse Tablets and have ordained for you in the Book the good of the hereafter and of the former time. To this doth the Tongue of Grandeur bear witness in this exalted station.</p>
<p>O Siyyid Muhammad-’Ali! Your letter hath reached the Wronged One, and from it We perceived the fragrance of thy praise in the remembrance of God, thy Creator, thy Fashioner, thy Sustainer and thy Quickener, Who hath sent down unto thee the proof and made manifest unto thee the way, until thou didst attain and win that which lay hidden in the treasuries of the unseen and was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. We heard thy call and summoned thee from the most sacred side of the Throne: “Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Single, the All-Informed.” We have mentioned thee aforetime with that which surpasseth all that can be seen on earth. Be thankful unto thy Lord for this great bounty. We bear witness that thou didst hearken unto the call of thy Lord, didst attain His presence, didst behold His horizon, and didst stand before a door which was opened unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. O Muhammad! The Single, the One, hath made mention of thee and given thee glad tidings of His favors, of which none is aware save His all-knowing Self. Blessed art thou for having cast behind thee idle fancies and turned unto the ocean that hath manifested its waves before the faces of the world, and unto the Lote-Tree that hath revealed its fruits among the nations. Thus hath the Pen spoken while the Wronged One was in the Most Great Prison through that which the hands of the idolaters have wrought.</p>
<p>O Ali! Hear once again the call of thy Lord, the Lord of all names, Whom neither the clamor of the princes, nor the barking of the divines, nor the clamoring of the wayward could deter. He hath arisen before all faces with a power that hath shaken the pillars of tyranny when the Wondrous One appeared before the people with God’s mighty and irrefutable Book. He raised His hands and said: “O King! I have brought thee from the Most Great Announcement a mighty Book.” Thereupon the people’s limbs trembled with the fear of God, the Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy son whose letter hath reached the Throne while the Prisoner was in manifest grief by reason of what the hands of the people of the Bayan had wrought, they who turned away from the All-Merciful after He came unto them with the Kingdom of verses and the dominion of wisdom and utterance, with a sovereignty that hath conquered all who are in the heavens and the earth. We make mention of Our loved ones there and remind them of My verses and counsel them with that which beseemeth their kinship to God, the Lord of the worlds. Thus hath the Pen shed forth its effusions and the Sun its radiance. Blessed is he who hath taken and attained unto the grace of God, the Originator, the Wondrous One. We love to make mention of every name that is there and give them glad tidings of My loving-kindness, My mercy and My favor that hath encompassed all existence. O people of God! Hear once again My sweetest call from the Prison. Verily, there is no God but I, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. We have revealed in the Book whatsoever hath appeared and shall appear. To this testify honored servants whom neither the might of the Pharaohs deterred from drawing nigh unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. They stood before all faces and spoke what the Book had uttered - the Book that was hidden in the treasury of knowledge and inscribed by the Pen of Revelation in this exalted station. Beware lest the affairs of creation debar you from the Truth. Cast away idle fancies, clinging to the cord of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. O Zain! Upon thee be My glory, My mercy and My loving-kindness. The servant present hath brought thy letter and laid it before the Wronged One. We have answered thee as a grace from Us, and I am verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Thou art he whom the affairs of the world have not deterred from the Lord of Eternity. Thou hast heard what ears were prevented from hearing and seen what eyes were hindered from beholding, as a recompense for their deeds on this Promised Day. When thou findest the fragrance of My utterance, give thanks unto God, thy Lord, and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O my Best-Beloved and Best-Beloved of the Prophets, and praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of the Kingdom. Thou movest it as Thou pleasest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Protector, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting.” Blessed art thou and blessed is he who loveth thee and turneth unto thee and holdeth fast unto the cord of thy love. He is indeed of the people of Baha in God’s Book, the Sovereign of might. O Zain! We have heard the call from the land of Kaf and Ra before Dal wherein ascended one of My loved ones who was named Nasru’llah in this praiseworthy station. We have revealed for him that which hath made the countenance of existence smile. He is of those who believed in God when people were lost in the wilderness of idle fancies and vain imaginings. He shattered the idols of fancy in the name of the Lord of all beings, turned unto Him and said: “Here am I, here am I, O God of the seen and unseen! Here am I, here am I, O Lord of existence!” He testified to that which God had testified and turned toward Him when those around him turned away, following every heedless and veiled one. He bore witness to Me before all faces, to this doth testify the Pen of God when the Temple of Grandeur was established upon the throne of His name, the All-Loving. We have exalted him and […]</p>
<p>We elevated him to the Highest Companion and revealed for him that which gladdens hearts and souls, and We revealed for his brother that which will cause its fragrances to endure throughout the duration of My Most Beautiful Names. We beseech the Most High to preserve him and strengthen him in a manner befitting this Cause, whereby skins have trembled. We have also mentioned his other brother - verily he remembers those who have turned to him just as he remembered before his loved ones who held fast to His extended cord.</p>
<p>We make mention of Ismail who attained the presence of the Throne and heard with his own ear My call. We have counseled him with that which We counseled Our loved ones in the Scriptures and Tablets. O Ismail! Upon thee be My glory! We mentioned thee before, and at this time verses have been revealed before which other verses bow down in humility. We counsel thee as We counseled thee before with that which will elevate the station of man in the contingent world. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who hath come from the heaven of Command with verses of grandeur whereby the earths and heavens were illumined. Aid thy Lord through wisdom and utterance, and through the hosts of deeds and virtuous conduct. Thus have We commanded thee before and at this time when the fragrance of utterance hath been wafted throughout creation. Set aside what the people possess, then turn thy face toward God, the Lord of Lords. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Whenever I contemplate Thy days, my standing before Thy face, the manifestations of Thy favors, the evidences of Thy bounties, and the hidden gifts of Thy grace, such agitation seizeth me that I long to hide my face beneath the dust, O Thou Who holdest all necks in Thy grasp! O Lord! The fire of separation from Thee hath consumed me, and Thy remoteness and estrangement hath caused my death. I beseech Thee by the Fire wherewith Thou didst manifest Thyself unto Moses on the Mount of Thy knowledge, and by Thy Name through which Thou didst deliver Thy loved ones and chosen ones, to make me aided in the service of Thy Cause in such wise that I may detach myself from all that is mine, turning toward the horizon of Thy good-pleasure and holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty and grace. I beseech Thee, O God of the world, by the ocean of Thy generosity and the heaven of Thy bounty, to forgive me through Thy grace and favors. Then send down upon me from the clouds of Thy mercy that which will purify me from all else save Thee, draw me nigh unto Thee, grant me Thy good-pleasure and cause me to speak Thy praise. Verily Thou art the Lord of the world and the Sovereign of nations. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Conquering, the Powerful. O God, my God! Send Thy blessings upon Thy loved ones and chosen ones who have arisen to exalt Thy Word. Verily Thou art the Almighty Whom neither the hosts of the world nor the might of nations can frustrate. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. Thou art, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O My Name Zain! Upon thee be My glory, My mercy and My loving-kindness. We wish to make mention of him who was named Asadu’llah in the Book of God, the Lord of Lords. He turned to the Most High Horizon and traversed land and sea until he arrived at the place wherein the Call was raised. We bear witness that he is of the people of Baha in the Book of God, the Lord of all men. He heard what most of the servants have not heard, and witnessed the mighty signs of his Lord when mankind was in wondrous drunkenness. He attained and drank the choice sealed wine from the hands of My bounty, and achieved that which was recorded in the Scriptures and Tablets. We have mentioned him and do mention him in this station as a grace from Us, yea a grace from Us, and I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We caused him to hear My call and showed him My horizon and revealed for him that whereby the horizons were illumined. O Asad! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. We have mentioned thee - dost thou recognize from which Pen? From the Pen of God, the Lord of all religions. When thou beholdest the waves of the sea and findest the fragrance of utterance from the Book of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, say: […]</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who controlleth the verses and manifesteth the clear signs! I beseech Thee by the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of Thy utterance and by the waves of the ocean of Thy knowledge to assist me in Thy remembrance and Thy praise and in serving Thy Cause amidst Thy servants. O my Lord! Withhold not from me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have sacrificed all they possessed in their longing to attain Thy presence. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the throne on high and of the dust beneath. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.</p>
<p>We make mention of Our loved ones there and give them the glad-tidings of My favor and My loving-kindness and My mercy that have encompassed all regions. O My loved ones! This is a Day wherein the lips of all things have smiled at the revelation of that which lay hidden from time immemorial. Give thanks unto your Lord, the Most Merciful, for this bounty the like of which the eye of creation hath never beheld. We seal this epistle with the mention of him who was named Yusuf in the Book of Names, who stood before the Countenance and heard the call of God, the Lord of the Day of Return. He drew nigh and hastened until he attained the presence of the Face and heard that for the hearing of which ears were created. Blessed be he and blessed be his eyes for what they beheld and blessed be his face for having turned toward the Face of God, the One, the Chosen. He heard My call and drank the choice wine of revelation from the hands of My bounty. We beseech God, exalted be He, to strengthen him in serving the Cause and inspire him with that which will attract the inhabitants of the lands. Verily, He is the Lord of creation and the Ruler in the return. There is none other God but Him, the Most Exalted, the Most High.</p>

<p>He is God–exalted is His station in majesty and power!</p>
<p>Praise sanctified from the breath of all the world befitteth the most holy court of the Beloved One, before Whom all the words in existence are powerless and fall short of indicating even one letter and conjunction of His creation in their allusive state. Glory be to God! What rank have mere words that they should comprehend and present that before a single verse of the verses of His grandeur all things and manifestations of names lie unconscious and bewildered. Exalted is His grandeur, exalted is His sovereignty, exalted is His glory and His power! The force of His Will hath adorned the Ancient Day with a new ornament and attributed it unto Himself, in such wise that it is as though nothing more wondrous had ever appeared in the world of being, nor ever shall appear. Every ancient thing boweth down before this new thing, and every hidden thing is humbled before this manifest one. I testify that there is none other God but Him. His are the majesty and the power, His are the loftiness and the authority. He doeth what He willeth and commandeth what He pleaseth, and He is the Ruler, the Mighty, the Manifest.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou by Whose Name the ocean of utterance surgeth in the world of possibility and the nightingale of eternity warbleth upon the branches! I beseech Thee by the Name through which the gates of heaven were opened and the Most Exalted Horizon was illumined, to aid Thy loved ones to draw nigh unto the shore of the ocean of Thy recognition and to remain steadfast in this Cause whereby the feet of the most distinguished among Thy creatures have slipped. O Lord! The faces have turned unto Thy face and the hands have been raised toward the heaven of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Throne and by them that circle round it in Thy days, to show them that which hath shone forth and gleamed from the horizon of the heaven of Thy Manifestation. Then gather them beneath the shadow of Thy Most Exalted Word, through which all things have uttered: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the All-Knowing.”</p>
<p>And furthermore, I acknowledge receipt of your letter which brought joy and delight. The fragrance of the love of the Beloved of the worlds was diffused therefrom. God willing, may you ever be occupied with His remembrance and praise, and arise to serve Him in such wise that the light of praise may encompass the Kingdom of Utterance. Exalted is this most impregnable, most holy station! After this evanescent servant gained knowledge thereof, he turned toward the immortal realm and presented before His presence whatsoever was mentioned and written. He said: “O Abu’l-Hasan! God willing, mayest thou attain unto that which God hath desired, and in all conditions gaze toward the horizon of contentment. By the pearl of the sea of oneness and the dawning of the sun of divine unity! All the seas of the world cannot equal one drop from the ocean of contentment. Blessed is the soul that hath spoken for God’s sake and walked in His path. Today the sun of bounty is shining and the orb of loving-kindness is dawning and the heaven of mercy is raised up. Blessed are they who, for the sake of these two fleeting days, have not deprived themselves of the immortal Kingdom. Convey with the utmost joy and fragrance greetings from this Wronged One to all those souls who have accepted the Truth. Say: O friends! God willing, may ye appear before the faces of men adorned with the ornaments of trustworthiness, truthfulness and steadfastness, that all may be illumined and adorned by the effulgences of the light of these suns. Every deed that appeareth purely for the sake of God is as a shining and luminous sun. Under all conditions, hold fast unto that which is praiseworthy and fix your gaze upon that which hath been revealed in the Book. Read ye what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an where He saith: ‘Do good even as God hath dealt well with thee.’ The steadfast souls must become dawning-places of spiritual virtues and rising-points of goodly deeds. Remind all of that which beseemeth them. O Abu’l-Hasan! The call is most loud, but the weight of greed and desire hath prevented ears from hearing. Beseech God to rend asunder, with the arm of might, the veils that have hindered them, and to guide all to the most exalted Paradise.” End.</p>
<p>This evanescent one is ever immersed in the ocean of wonderment, for the lights of His luminous countenance are visible and manifest and the suns of His revealed verses are blazing and evident like fire upon the highest standards; yet people remain veiled and deprived. This servant begs and supplicates and implores, and from the Mighty Truth hopes for compassion and grace and response. May His mercy encompass all and His call awaken them. His is the command; He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>As to what they wrote concerning the father named after the Desired One, upon them both be the Glory of God, it was presented and He spoke these sublime words:</p>
<p>In the Name of the All-Knowing, the All-Wise […]</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qablih-Javad! Rejoice in that the Wronged One makes mention of thee from the precincts of His Most Great Prison, that thou mayest be glad and be of the thankful. A letter hath come to the Prison from him who was named Abu’l-Hasan, wherein was thy mention. We make mention of thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. Grieve not at anything, but put thy trust in God, the Lord of all worlds. He, verily, aideth whom He willeth through the hosts of earth and heaven, and ordaineth for whomsoever He desireth the reward of His presence, the Mighty, the Precious. Say: He hath come with the truth, and speaketh the truth, and summoneth all unto the truth, yet most of mankind remain heedless. They have cast away that which profiteth them and have taken that which leadeth them to the lowest of the low. We have found the fragrance of thy love; We have turned toward thee and have revealed unto thee this perspicuous Tablet. By My life! Whosoever attaineth unto a drop from the ocean of fairness will cry out and say: “By God! A mighty Book hath been sent down!” Rejoice thou in that the Most Great Joy maketh mention of thee whilst surrounded by sorrows from those who have denied the right of God and His loved ones, and have turned away from Him in that they have followed every ignorant doubter. Thus hath the gate of Paradise been opened by the finger of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, and He hath caused thee to hear the cooing of the Dove of the Cause upon the branches. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qablih-Hasan! Praise be to God that thou hast drunk from the ocean of knowledge and received thy portion from the realm of vision. We made mention of thee before, and God willing, thou shalt at all times be illumined and radiant through the lights of the Sun of divine mercy. We have heard thy call and witnessed thy turning, and from the prison We have turned toward thee. Blessed art thou for having turned and attained, and woe unto the heedless! How many are those who have broken the Covenant and been deprived of the Dawning-Place of grace. Strange it is that while the Dawn hath appeared and a sweet-scented breeze wafteth with utmost delicacy and gentleness from the direction of the Robe, yet the people of the earth remain heedless and veiled therefrom. A dark smoke hath prevented most from beholding. Have they not seen the divine Books, or have they not read the Furqan which distinguisheth between truth and falsehood? To what cord do they cling and to what hem do they hold? They turn away from the light and incline toward the fire; they are far removed from the rays of the Sun of Revelation and are debarred from the living waters. Thus have their souls enticed them, while they perceive not. O Hasan! Rejoice thou in My mention of thee and My turning toward thee, and say:</p>
<p>O God of the Kingdom and the Realm, Lord of grandeur and might! I beseech Thee by the Name through which the sincere have hastened to the ocean of Thy reunion and the near ones to the fountain of Thy presence, to ordain for me through the Pen of Thy decree that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. O Lord! I am he who hath turned unto the Kaaba of Thy nearness and hath attained unto the hearing of Thy call. I beseech Thee to assist me in Thy remembrance and enable me to do that which Thou lovest and approvest. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Overshadowing, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Some time ago, a letter from them reached this servant, and this evanescent one sent a reply, as was also done previously. Both letters from this evanescent one were adorned and illumined with the light of the Sun of the favor of the Beloved of the world. God willing, may they ever abide beneath the shade of the Tree of Providence and be engaged in service to the Cause. Likewise, a petition arrived from Mulla Muhammad Ibrahim, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah], which was presented at the Most Holy Court, and this response descended from the Kingdom of utterance. God willing, may they attain unto it.</p>
<p>He is God, the Hearing, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and We have heard thy call and that wherewith thou didst commune with God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed is the tongue that hath attained to the mention of God and the heart that hath been adorned with the lights of His love, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. The world and its ornaments, its favors and its bounties shall pass away, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Give thanks unto God for having illumined thy heart with the lights of His knowledge and enabled thee to turn unto Him on a day wherein the limbs of the world trembled for fear of God, the Almighty, the Powerful. O Ibrahim! The Wronged One declareth: Where is the fire that I might enter it for His love and His Name, and where is the spear that I might advance toward it with My breast in this straight Path? By My life! Were anyone to taste the sweetness of My utterance, it would draw him to a station wherein neither the might of the world would frighten him nor the ornaments of any great ruler occupy him. Say: O my God! This is my face which hath turned unto Thy face, seeking the wine of Thy bounty and steadfastness in Thy path. Wilt Thou deprive it of the wonders of Thy grace or grant it what it seeketh through Thy generosity and favor? I testify that Thou hast never disappointed those who have hoped in Thee, nor hast Thou turned away those who have sought Thee. Verily, Thou art the Forgiving, the Bountiful. Write down for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee in all conditions. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>The souls mentioned in thy letter have, praise be to God, attained unto divine bounty and been blessed with eternal grace. God willing, they must not let slip this lofty and most exalted station and must remain vigilant throughout the nights and days, for thieves lie in wait and traitors stand ready at their posts. The servant beseecheth his Lord to protect His loved ones from the evil of every deceiver and the schemes of every suspicious plotter. Likewise, in the letter of Aqa Muhammad Javad, mention was made of Master Baqir, which was presented before the Throne. This is what was revealed in response:</p>
<p>In the Name of the Peerless Lord</p>
<p>Consider man as the heaven wherein the sun and moon are his pure and goodly deeds, and the stars his spiritual qualities. God willing, may all the friends of Truth be adorned with this most mighty and holy ornament. Today the ocean of awareness surgeth and the sun of knowledge shineth forth. Hearken and discover, that ye may endure. The authoritative Word hath ever been and shall remain the quickener of soul and spirit, and in each of its letters lieth concealed the river of life. Blessed is the soul that hath drunk therefrom and been adorned with the ornament of everlasting life. Verily, He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the Almighty, the Mighty, the Wise. We made mention of thee before, and this time too thou hast been illumined by the Sun of utterance of the Lord of Mercy. God willing, mayest thou preserve this divine gift from the eyes of the treacherous and the thieves. The Glory be upon thee and upon My loved ones in that place. Verily, We have remembered them and given them glad tidings through My gracious mention.</p>
<p>This servant’s submission is that you should convey sublime greetings on my behalf to him who bears the name of the Desired One. Undoubtedly you have already delivered the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet that was revealed specifically for him, and he has attained unto it. Praise be to God, he has been and continues to be assisted through God’s grace. Likewise, convey greetings to the friends in other lands who are truly attaining and are gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon. And convey mention, salutations and greetings to his honor Aqa Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be the glory of God. And make mention that, God willing, may you be assisted, confirmed and successful in that which God loves and with which He is well-pleased. The glory be upon you and upon them both and upon those who have turned with radiant faces toward the Most Exalted Horizon. Praise be to God, the Lord of the throne and of the dust.</p>

<p>He is God, the King, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting!</p>
<p>These are the verses of God, the All-Encompassing, the Self-Subsisting, unto those who have believed in God and His verses, and who are secure from the terror of polytheism. Say: O people! Why do ye deny Me when ye witness that I have come to you with verses that cause the hearts of them that have believed to tremble and minds to be bewildered? O people! Have ye forgotten the decree of God that was sent down in the Bayan from the presence of the Mighty, the Well-Beloved, and the covenant He took from you in every Book, nay in every recorded scroll, that ye should not deny the verses of God when they are revealed in truth, nor dispute with Him Who cometh unto you with preserved tablets of glory? And if ye believe not in Him, oppose Him not. Fear God, then deny not His Beauty. We have indeed sent down aforetime unto Muhammad, the Messenger of God, if ye but understand. None dispute the verses of God except those who disbelieve. Thus was it sent down aforetime from the presence of God, the All-Encompassing, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O people! Fear God and be not proud before Him at Whose might all are dismayed. Beware lest ye render your works vain and cling to what ye possess rather than to that which hath been sent down in truth from the presence of the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Sanctify thyself, then remind the servants of what the Spirit hath cast upon thee. Fear no one and grieve not for what hath befallen thee of adversity and hardship. Put thy trust in God, thy Lord, and be not of those who reflect not upon the verses of God. By God! If thou wert to arise for the love of God and His servant, God would assist thee against all who are on earth. Verily, there is no God but Him. He aideth whom He willeth through His word “Be,” and it is! Thus do We recite unto you of the verses of God and cast upon you that which will tranquilize your hearts and the hearts of those who behold naught save through the Greatest Vision in this concealed and luminous Beauty. And thou, rend asunder the veils of idle fancy, then emerge from behind the clouds with a power from Us and a might from Our presence, that thou mayest witness what no one among creation hath witnessed. This is what We have caused thee to witness in truth in this holy and praiseworthy station. Beware lest thou be like unto those who follow naught but their vain desires and who wander in the valley of idle fancy.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast asked concerning human nature, know thou that all men have been created according to the nature of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. He hath ordained for every soul the measures of His decree as inscribed in the preserved tablets of glory. Yet all this manifesteth through your own volition, even as ye witness in your own deeds. Consider, for instance, that which hath been forbidden unto the servants in the Book, as ye observe in the Bayan, wherein God hath permitted what He willeth by His command and forbidden what He pleaseth by His sovereignty. Say: All this is in the Book - do ye not witness it? Yet people, after knowing that from which they were prohibited, still commit it. Can this be attributed to God or to their own selves, if ye be fair-minded? Say: No good thing proceedeth from any source except from God, while no evil originateth from any source except from yourselves. Do ye not comprehend? This hath been revealed in all the Tablets, if ye but knew. Yea, He knoweth your deeds before their appearance, even as He knoweth them after they are manifest. There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all things are preserved with Him in the tablets of holy concealment. This knowledge doth not cause the deed in His creation, even as your knowledge of something is not the cause of its appearance in what ye have willed or will, have known or will know. Thus do We cast upon thee from the verses of divine innovation and expound them with truth, that perchance the people may become assured of the signs of their Lord. Therefore, ponder within thyself concerning that which thou hast asked, that God may open unto thy heart the gates of knowledge and wisdom, and cause thee to witness the creation of all things, and acquaint thee with the mysteries of what was and what will be. By God! All this is easier with Him than all else. He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth among His creation by a command from His presence, and verily He is the Mighty, the Glorious, the Best-Beloved. And thou art a bird soaring in the holy atmosphere wherein move the breezes of the Ever-Living. Beware lest thou be of them who stand still. Rather, strive within thyself to ascend at every moment to another heaven and another atmosphere, that thou mayest discover at every instant the mysteries of a hidden innovation. For there is no end to the heaven of His grace, nor any beginning to the earth of His bounty, that it might be completed by foot or wing or the comprehension of minds. Rend asunder the veils by My Name, the Mighty, the Beloved, and turn not unto anyone except God, thy Lord. Set thy face toward the luminous and visible Countenance, that the greatness of turbans may not prevent thee from entering the sanctuary of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Holy. For We have found the people of the Bayan to be like the people of the Furqan, nay rather more veiled, if ye but knew. They speak as others spoke before and act as did the nations of old. Soon shall ye know. Strive thou, therefore, within thyself lest thou walk in their footsteps. Rather, walk in the footsteps of God, thy Lord, on this luminous, blessed, and extended path. Were thou to ask them concerning the difference between themselves and others, they would speak without understanding. Thus have their souls enticed them, and their hearts have hardened through that which they have earned.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast asked of me, know thou that I am a servant who hath believed in God and His signs and His Messengers and His Books, making no distinction between any of them, and thus have I been commanded by God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. I have believed in all that hath been sent down from Him and in that which is now being revealed from the heaven of holy love. I follow what I have been commanded in the Book, by God’s might and power, and I desire not to transgress a single letter thereof. To this do bear witness mine own self and mine essence, then my tongue, if ye be of them that perceive. I declare lawful unto myself whatsoever God hath made lawful in the Bayan, and forbidden whatsoever He hath forbidden, and I believe in all that hath been revealed therein, if ye be of them that believe. Verily they who make lawful what God hath forbidden them and forbid what God hath made lawful in the Book - these understand nothing and know not. But this question beseemeth no one among men, for this is a station whereon the Pen moveth not, nor doth ink flow, if ye be of them that know. Were this question from another than thee, We would not have answered with a single letter, but as We desired for thee a certain station, We have answered thee that thou mayest perchance awaken unto thyself and be of them that are guided in these days wherein every soul is intoxicated and all have turned away from His beauty, save them who have detached themselves wholly from all they have heard and who behold with the eye of sanctity. By the True One! Thou hast asked about a station greater than the creation of the heavens and earth, which God hath placed above the testimonies of His servants - none shall understand it save them that are endued with knowledge. Yea, people understand according to their ranks and stations, not according to that which hath been ordained for it. Glorified, glorified be He above all that ye ask! If thou wouldst rend asunder the veil from thine eyes and ascend unto the holy atmosphere in this air that wafteth in this heaven, and detach thyself from all who are in the heavens and earth and from every prolonged matter, the Spirit would cast into thy breast from this station that which would make thee independent of all that hath been created and shall be created, and sufficient unto thee above all things that were and that shall be. Thus doth the Pen of Command recite unto thee from God’s wisdom, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and cast upon thee that which shall draw thee nigh unto a glorious and praiseworthy station, from whose precincts most of the servants have been debarred, and none shall attain thereunto save they who recline upon the couches of eternity.</p>
<p>And as to what thou hast asked concerning my son, know thou that my sons, if they follow the ordinances of God and transgress not beyond that which hath been decreed in the Bayan, the Book of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, and enjoin upon themselves and upon the servants that which is good and forbid that which is evil, and bear witness to that which God hath testified in His decisive and irrevocable verses, and believe in Him Whom God shall manifest on the Day when the time of the first and the last shall be reckoned, and on which all shall be brought before God, their Lord, and differ not in the Cause of God nor transgress His sacred Law that hath been ordained and inscribed - then know ye that they are the leaves of the Tree of Unity and its fruits, and through them the clouds rain down and the mists are lifted by grace, if ye be of them that are assured. They are the kindred of God among you and the people of His household in your midst, and His mercy unto all worlds, if ye be of them that know. Through them the breezes of God waft over you and the winds of might pass over them that are nigh, and they are the Pen of God and His Command and His Word amongst His creatures, and through them He taketh and giveth, if ye be of them that understand. Through them the earth hath been illumined with the light of thy Lord and the signs of His grace have appeared unto them that deny not the signs of God. Therefore, whoso harmeth them hath harmed Me, and whoso turneth away from them hath turned away from the path of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Soon shall become manifest the turning away of them that have turned aside and their pride against Us and their transgression against Our souls without any clear proof or preserved scripture. Say: O people! They are the signs of God among you. Beware lest ye dispute with them or slay them or be of them who act wickedly and perceive it not. They are the captives of God on earth and have fallen beneath the hands of the oppressors in this land which lieth behind exalted mountains. All this befell them at a time when they were but children in the kingdom and had committed no sin, but rather for the sake of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Beloved. And from among them, he in whom this quality is innate, God causeth to flow from his tongue the verses of His power, and he is of them whom God hath specially chosen for His Cause. Verily, there is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and we all act by His command. We beseech God to aid them to obey Him and to grant them that which will gladden their hearts and the hearts of them that turn at all times toward the court of God, and to forgive their misdeeds and make them to be of them that shall inherit the Paradise of the All-Highest from God, the Mighty, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Thus have We bestowed Our favor upon thee in this Tablet and revealed unto thee that which was concealed from others, as a grace from Us unto thee and unto them who are guided by God’s guidance at this dawning-place. And thou, preserve this Tablet as thou wouldst thine eye. Beware lest thou disclose it to anyone save them that are worthy. Thus doth the Command of God enjoin thee concerning that which is hidden. Transgress not beyond that which thou hast been bidden, for We have found the people of the Bayan to be more veiled than all the peoples of the earth, save whom thy Lord willeth. Thus have We taken account of the matter, if ye be of them that reckon. We beseech God to aid them to follow His Cause that they may rend asunder the veils and emerge from behind the clouds with authority from God, the Powerful, the Most Holy.</p>
<p>Know then that We answered thy questions at the time when thy letter in eloquent Persian appeared before Us. But as no messenger was found to convey it to thee, We cast it into the sea by Our command, lest thereby the clamor of the idolaters be raised. In His hand is the dominion of all things. He eraseth what He willeth and confirmeth what He pleaseth, and with Him are the holy and preserved Tablets. Therefore, We answered three of them in an eloquent Arabic tongue, and withheld the Pen from the remaining two by virtue of a wisdom which none should know save God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. The Pen shall flow in its time when the Command cometh from the horizon of holy and glorious might. Should God will and desire it - verily there is no God but Him - He ordaineth what He pleaseth and manifesteth what He desireth. All spirit and glory and eternity be upon thee, that thou mayest be among those who are steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord.</p>

<p>In the Name of Our Lord, the Most Invincible, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>The essence of praise and glorification befitteth the Lord of Names, Who hath conquered the cities of the hearts of them that are endued with understanding through the hosts of utterance and expression. From time immemorial, out of pure bounty and grace, He hath summoned the peoples of the world to the most exalted horizon. His mercy hath ever preceded all else, and His grace hath outstripped all things. Every tongue proclaimeth His greatness and every face is turned toward His horizon. The oceans of the world bear witness to His grandeur and the heavens testify to His exaltation. The transgressions of the peoples of the world have not withheld His favors, nor have the errors of nations stayed His Will. He eraseth whatsoever He willeth and confirmeth whatsoever He pleaseth. The pavilion of power hath been raised through His Name and the tabernacle of world order hath been pitched by His Will. Exalted be His station, exalted be His might, exalted be His grandeur and power, and exalted be His glory and majesty!</p>
<p>Alas, alas! Souls that are defiled with fancy and vain imaginings are incapable of drawing nigh unto Him. Pure sanctification and complete detachment are required for one to attain unto the lights of the Kingdom and taste the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful. Now the peoples of the world are observed to be veiled and deprived of the supreme blessing, for the flesh and blood of most are commingled with tales and sayings and the conditions of names and the differences of things. Glory be to God! How can such souls be worthy of this Court and befitting of this station, unless the True One, exalted be His glory, should through His power create servants who are capable of hearkening unto the call and worthy of beholding the Most Exalted Horizon? Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His Word “Be” and it is!</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God of Names and Sovereign over all things! The Servant testifieth that Thou wert alone and single; no one was seen to champion Thy Cause or arise to serve Thee. Thou didst stand alone before the faces of the world in days wherein the hearts of Thy servants were agitated, and Thou didst call all to the ultimate goal, the most exalted station, and the highest summit. When the horizon of proof was illumined and that which was treasured in the storehouse of knowledge was manifested, Thine enemies who claim adherence to the Bayan emerged from behind the veils and perpetrated that which caused the dwellers of the cities of certitude to lament. I beseech Thee, O Thou Desire of the world and Lord of the nations, by Thy Most Great Name, to assist Thy Cause through Thyself and Thy Will and Thy Purpose. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter was received. Praise be to God, the fragrance of love wafted therefrom and the light of faith shone from its horizon. After it was read and perused, it was presented before the countenance of the Lord of all mankind. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken in reply, blessed and exalted be His Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One, the Prisoner […]</p>
<p>O Ahmad! The divine Bird hath been imprisoned in the talons of the enemy. The Sun at the horizon of inner meaning hath been veiled by dark clouds from the light, and the Euphrates of the All-Merciful’s mercy hath been held back from flowing by the wickedness of souls. At a time when that which hath been revealed from the heaven of His Will is equivalent to all the books of the past and future, some among the people of the Bayan have risen against Him. It seemeth they are not content with shedding His most pure blood. Those who are heedless and unaware of the root of the Cause claim knowledge and have arisen to mislead receptive souls. Like unto the Shi’ihs they have aimed at the station of the Divine Unity. Throughout ages and centuries they occupied themselves with mention of the Truth from pulpits and praised their own beliefs, yet after the appearance of the Sun of Truth, all engaged in cursing and execration from pulpits in mosques, gatherings and assemblies. Finally both the learned and the ignorant pronounced Him an infidel and issued the death warrant for His most pure blood.</p>
<p>Now too the people of the Bayan cling to such vain imaginings and hold fast to such idle fancies. O people of God! With penetrating vision, attentive ears, pure tongues and illumined faces, behold and hearken and speak. Today the people of Baha are those who see none as existing save God and His loved ones. Say: Pass beyond the realm of names that ye may attain the Most Exalted Paradise which is the station of true unity. Today none but God is worthy of mention, for this is His Day and His Manifestation. The books of the world suffice not, and that which is with the peoples availeth not. With clear certitude and upright stance, arise for the Cause of God - such an arising that neither the doubts of the people of the Bayan nor the might of all in creation shall prevent or deprive you from the goal of all existence.</p>
<p>Reflect upon the deeds and actions of the former people, and likewise upon their results and fruits, that perchance ye may not be deprived of the Lord of the Day of Judgment through the croaking of the crows and the deception of the deceivers. We convey greetings to the friends in that land and those round about, and We counsel them to that which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in the Tablets. O people of God! Whatsoever hath come to pass or shall come to pass was revealed aforetime in God’s Book - with Him is the knowledge of all things in a clear Book.</p>
<p>Likewise We convey greetings to the handmaidens of God in that land and give them the glad-tidings of God’s grace and favor - exalted be His glory. All must engage in the remembrance of the Lord of all beings with utmost sanctity and detachment throughout the nights and days. By God’s life! He hath ordained for His loved ones and handmaidens that which shall bring joy to the eyes and gladness to the hearts and souls.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Give praise to the Goal of the world that He granted thee the grace to witness, meet, hearken and stand before His presence. By God’s life! Each of these mentioned stations cannot be equaled by the world and all that is therein. The nature of this world is that its Owner hath abandoned it and left it to others. In such case what value can be attached to it that one should be saddened or gladdened by it? Its existence is affliction and its absence is trial. Blessed are the people of Baha, meaning those souls who soar on the wings of love and detachment and behold themselves free and independent of the world and all its peoples in this day[…]</p>
<p>On this Sunday, the eighteenth of the month of Hajj, this Wronged One was seated upon the carpet sent by that honored one, which had been forwarded previously, in the Mansion of Mazra’ih, engaged in these remembrances: “Blessed art thou, and blessed is thy son, and blessed are they that are with thee. By the life of God! Verily he who hath ascended is in a glorious station and a radiant spot.” This ephemeral servant submits that the world is once again encompassed by the vain imaginings of false souls. The party of God must protect itself through His Name. The enemy appears in the guise of friendship to steal away the pearl of the love of Truth. Were Satan to appear in his own garment, no soul would be attracted to him, but he comes in the garment of the people of truth and engages in praise and glorification for the purpose of leading astray. This servant has ever beseeched and hoped from the true Omnipotent One that He may protect His loved ones from the evil of Satan. Verily, He has power over all things.</p>
<p>Some time ago, two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets were revealed and sent specifically to that honored one, wherein mention was made from the Supreme Pen of the departed and forgiven one who ascended unto God. They attained to that which had been the hope of those near and sincere ones. The other Tablets which were requested in His presence were given to the honored friend, His Eminence Amin, Haji Mirza Abu’l-Hasan, upon him be the glory of God and His favor, to be delivered to that honored one, and especially in these days he was written to with emphasis to send them.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about the receipt of the trust, whatever reached that honored one reached this servant. That honored one has been and is, by God’s grace, trustworthy. There is no room for doubt or uncertainty in this matter. Praise be to our Lord Who guided me and guided you to His path, made clear to us His way, manifested to us His evidence, showed us the horizon of His revelation, and made us hear His call. We beseech Him to protect us from the evil of His enemies and the wickedness of His servants. Verily, He is our Master and our Protector, our Guardian and our Provider, the One Who gives us life and causes us to die, and our Helper in recognizing His firm and mighty Cause.</p>
<p>From my brother, His Eminence Aqa Mulla ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God, also whatever should have arrived has arrived. This servant conveys greetings to him and gives him the glad tidings of God’s favor, exalted be His glory, and the acceptance of what was sent. Blessed is he, happy is he.</p>
<p>And concerning what was written about the friends in that land, that they are engaged with utmost love and unity in the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory, and likewise all are holding fast to wisdom in such wise that the clamor of the heedless has subsided - after this matter was submitted in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, these verses were revealed from the heaven of the favor of the Lord of Lords. His blessed and exalted Word: […]</p>
<p>O friends of Truth! He accepted all the tribulations of the earth and arose alone to promote the Cause. Neither the might of the people nor the clamor of men kept Him from mentioning and praising God. He revealed that which He willed. Had there been any worth or station in this world, He would surely not have accepted these tribulations. You must, with utmost joy and eagerness, ecstasy and gladness, be engaged in the mention of Truth, and despite the heedless ones, drink from the most exalted chalice and partake of the sealed wine. The adherence of God’s loved ones to wisdom has been and is acceptable in His sight. Blessed are ye for having adhered to it, recognized its station and that which appears therefrom. The Supreme Pen counsels all to steadfastness, and likewise all must supplicate God day and night to protect His servants from the vain imaginings of the past, lest there appear again in the world the likes of the Shi’ihs and those heedless souls. The deniers of the Bayan are occupied with the same vain imaginings and with utmost deceit and hypocrisy have arisen against the loved ones, and through outward love and friendship have afflicted and continue to afflict the people with the wilderness of idle fancies. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist this party in such wise that they may regard all else save God as non-existent and as nothing. This is the station of true unity. Blessed is he who has adhered to it, detached from those who have hesitated in this Most Great, this mighty Cause. Concerning the late and forgiven His Honor Ibn, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, what was written - the manifest and evident grace has shone forth from the horizon of divine bounty, both in the previously revealed Tablet and in other sublime and holy Tablets. Upon him be God’s mercy, His grace, His compassion and His bounty. The one God is my witness that these are the days of death, for each of the steadfast loved ones who has ascended has been mentioned by the Supreme Pen - a mention that perishes not and changes not. Exalted is the mercy of our Lord and great is His bounty upon us. We beseech Him to protect us from the evil of His enemies and to draw us near unto Him in all conditions. Glory and praise and honor be upon you and upon God’s loved ones who have drunk the wine of steadfastness from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Generous.</p>

<p>18th of Dhi’l-Hajjih-i-Haram 1302</p>
<p>The piece of brocade, the rifle and the cloak that were sent previously have arrived, and likewise the piece of brocade that was in Tehran has also arrived, and the brocade sent by His Honor Aqa ’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, has also arrived. God willing, Tablets will be revealed and sent specifically for those mentioned and others, upon them be the Glory of God. I convey greetings to Ibn and the friends of that land. God willing, may each one be illumined with the light of steadfastness, arise to serve, and be engaged in divine mention. Verily, He is the Protector of the sincere ones and those possessed of certitude. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Thou my Lord the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified beyond the comprehension of minds and intellects, beseemeth the holy court of that Self-Subsisting Lord Who, unaided and alone, arose before the faces of the heedless and summoned all upon earth - be they princes, divines or jurisprudents - to the Most Exalted Horizon. The might of the world restrained Him not, nor did the opposition of nations deter Him from His remembrance and utterance. The more affliction intensified, the more powerful became His utterance, until He addressed all the monarchs of the earth without veil or covering. His verses encompassed the world, and His evidences illumined receptive hearts and souls like unto the sun. Exalted be His grandeur, elevated be His dominion, triumphant be His might and power!</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O God of all beings and Educator of all created things! Thou seest Thy loved ones in the hands of Thine enemies, and Thy Self imprisoned in ’Akka in the hands of the heedless among Thy creatures. I beseech Thee, O Thou Desire of the world, by Thy Command through which the rain of Thy knowledge was showered upon the hearts of those near unto Thee among Thy creation and those who have turned towards Thee among Thy servants, and by the penetrating influence of Thy Word and the power of Thy Will, to assist Thy loved ones and chosen ones in spreading Thy signs, Thy remembrance and Thy praise amongst Thy servants. O my Lord! Ordain for them through the Pen of Destiny that which will draw them nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>[The remainder appears to be a tablet containing both narrative and revealed passages that continues beyond the excerpt provided…]</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having opened before the faces of Thy loved ones the gates of wisdom and understanding, for having guided them to Thy path, illumined their hearts with the light of Thy knowledge, and taught them that which draweth them nigh unto the sanctuary of Thy holiness. I beseech Thee, O Lord, by them who hastened to the place of sacrifice in their longing to meet Thee, whom neither the might of princes deterred from turning unto Thee nor from acknowledging that which Thou didst reveal in Thy Book. I moreover beseech Thee by them who, by Thy leave, turned toward Thy horizon, who stood before the gate of Thy grandeur, who heard Thy call, who witnessed the horizon of Thy Revelation, and who circled round Thy will, to ordain for Thy loved ones that which shall aid them in making mention of Thee and offering praise unto Thee, and in promoting Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Transform the most eloquent tongue into the language of light. Say: Praise be to God! Today the horizon of the heaven of understanding is illumined and radiant with the Sun of Truth. He Who conversed on Sinai is seated upon the throne of Revelation. From the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree is heard the blessed word “He Who was promised hath come.” That soul should illumine and set ablaze hearts and minds with the light of utterance and the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree, that all may attain unto that for which they were created. This Wronged One hath, from the first day until now, without veil or concealment, summoned all unto that which God hath willed. Blessed are they who have responded and who have uttered the word “Yea.” Glory be to God! It is not known to what the deniers cling. The verses have encompassed the world and the evidences are more manifest than the sun, yet the heedless servants remain veiled save whom God willeth. Nevertheless, the power of Truth hath prevailed and the might of the Word hath encompassed all, such that despite the opposition of kings and subjects and the worshippers of idle fancies, and despite all hindrances and prohibitions, the light of the Cause is seen dawning in every land. Soon shall appear that which We have sent down in the Holy Books and Tablets, even as appeared that which We had formerly announced unto the people. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! That soul hath attained unto the verses of the Most Exalted Pen and is adorned with the mention of God, glorified be His majesty. Though today the fruits of matters be hidden from eyes, yet ere long shall appear that which hath proceeded from the tongue of grandeur, and those who have turned unto Him shall behold the fruits of their deeds. Verily, He doth not suffer to be lost the reward of the doers of good.</p>
<p>As to what was asked whether the soul endureth after the body’s death or not, and if it endureth, what its condition will be - after this matter was submitted before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, these sublime words were revealed, blessed and exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>Concerning thy question about the spirit and its survival after its ascension, know thou that it will ascend at the time of its departure until it attaineth the presence of God in a form that neither the revolution of ages and centuries, nor the changes and chances of the world can alter. It will endure as long as the Kingdom of God, His sovereignty, His dominion and power will endure. It manifests the signs of God and His attributes, and reveals His loving kindness and bounty. The pen cannot depict this station nor can any description adequately express its nature, for it is exalted above any description or praise. The Hand of Divine Bounty will cause it to enter a station that no word can appropriately describe, nor can any trace of it be found in the visible world.</p>
<p>Blessed is the spirit that hath emerged from the body purified from the doubts and superstitions of the nations. Such a spirit moveth in the atmosphere of God’s good-pleasure and entereth the Supreme Paradise. The Maids of Heaven, dwellers of the loftiest mansions, shall circle around it, and the Prophets of God and His chosen ones will seek its companionship. With them that soul shall freely converse, and shall recount unto them that which it hath endured in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. Should anyone be made aware of what is pre-ordained for him in the worlds of God, the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below, he would immediately yearn with a great longing for that most exalted, most sanctified and most resplendent station.</p>
<p>In the Persian tongue, hear thou, O ’Abdu’l-Vahhab, upon thee be my Baha! Concerning thy question about the immortality of the spirit, this Wronged One beareth witness to its immortality. And as to thy question about its nature, verily it cannot be described and ought not to be mentioned save to a limited degree. The Prophets and Messengers came to guide mankind to the straight path of Truth, and their purpose was that the servants might be so trained that at the time of their ascension they would, with utmost sanctity, detachment and dedication, set their faces toward the Supreme Companion. By the life of God! The effulgences of these spirits are the cause of the world’s progress and the advancement of its peoples. They are the essence of existence and the supreme cause of all the world’s appearances and crafts. Through them the clouds pour down rain and the earth bringeth forth its fruits. Nothing among all things existeth without a cause, reason and origin, and the greatest cause hath been and shall ever be these sanctified spirits. The difference between this world and that world is like unto the difference between the embryonic world and this earthly life. After ascension the soul appeareth before God in a form that is worthy of immortality and suited to that world. This immortality is temporal, not essential, for it hath a cause, while essential immortality is uncaused and belongeth exclusively to God, exalted be His glory. Well is it with them that understand!</p>
<p>If thou wouldst reflect upon the deeds of the Prophets, thou wouldst bear witness with absolute certitude that there are worlds besides this world. The philosophers of the earth, as revealed in the Tablet of Wisdom by the Supreme Pen, have mostly acknowledged and accepted what was revealed in the divine Books. However, the materialists who believe in nature have written concerning the Prophets that they were wise men who, for the education of the people, made mention of heaven and hell, reward and punishment. Now consider: all people in every age have regarded the Prophets as superior to all others. Some have called these pure Essences wise men, while others have recognized them as being from God. Now if such souls had considered divine worlds to be limited to this earthly life, they would never have surrendered themselves to their enemies nor endured unprecedented trials and tribulations. Should anyone with a pure heart and penetrating vision meditate upon that which hath shone forth from the Supreme Pen, he would exclaim with his innate tongue: “Now hath the truth become manifest!”</p>
<p>As to thy question about resurrection, that which hath been revealed in the Book of Certitude is sufficient. Well is it with them that understand!</p>
<p>Convey my greetings to him who is named M., upon him be the Glory of God. Today the friends must occupy themselves with service to the Cause, and that service is teaching, which must be carried out with wisdom and utterance. All must hold fast unto this. We beseech God to assist you and aid you in that which beseemeth His Day.</p>
<p>We make mention in this place of him who is named ’Abdu’l-Husayn, and We remember him with Our verses and give him the glad-tidings of Our loving-kindness. We ask God to assist him in that which will draw him near unto Him in all conditions.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant makes mention of the friends of God and implores success for each one, that they may exert their utmost endeavor so that perchance the horizons may be illumined with the light of unity. In any case, the Cause of God has been and ever will be all-compelling. We must all beseech Him to confirm souls for the specific purpose of teaching the Cause - but souls who are adorned with the conditions set forth by the Most Exalted Pen. In one of the Tablets these sublime words were revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of all beings. His blessed and exalted Word declares: “Blessed is the soul whose head is adorned with the crown of detachment and whose temple is beautified with the ornament of resignation and contentment.” The teachers must summon the servants to the most exalted horizon with perfect sanctity and detachment. They must speak for God and act for the sake of God alone. These and similar utterances have repeatedly been revealed in the Book of God and the divine Scriptures and Tablets. Some, praise be to God, are illumined with the light of certitude and act according to the commandments and ordinances, but others, despite their recognition and acknowledgment of what has been revealed, hesitate in their actions. In this connection, one verse is mentioned. His blessed and exalted Word declares: “My affliction is not My imprisonment and what I have suffered from My enemies, but rather the deeds of My loved ones who claim attachment to Me yet commit that which causes My heart and My pen to lament…” Such verses have repeatedly descended from the heaven of Will. Blessed is he who holds fast unto them and acts according to what hath been ordained in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. Glory and praise and honor be upon you and upon those who are with you in this Most Great Cause and Momentous Announcement. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>This is the Surih of Sacrifice which hath been sent down from the heaven of command unto him whom We have named the Sacrificed One in the Kingdom of Names, that he may set his face wholly toward God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>He is the Ever-Abiding, the Most Wondrous!</p>
<p>God doth bear witness from the throne of grandeur and majesty that verily I am God, there is none other God but Me, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And He doth bear witness at this moment from the kingdom of might and glory that there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The Ancient Being doth acknowledge from the heaven of power and majesty that verily I am God, there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Best-Beloved. And this Most Great Word doth acknowledge that there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Best-Beloved. God hath testified within His Own Self, unto His Own Self, through His Own Self, that He is God, there is none other God but Me, the Manifest, the Witnessed. And I do testify within My Own Self, unto My Own Self, through My Own Self, that verily I am God, there is none other God but Him, the Manifest, the Resplendent, the Concealed.</p>
<p>O Beauty of the Most Ancient! Sprinkle upon all created things from the ocean of Thy bounteous grace, that perchance they may be touched by the fragrant breezes of holiness from this Camphor which hath appeared in the Temple of Manifestation, and flow from this Salsabil which God hath sent forth in the form of the Pen and made it a sign of His knowledge between the heavens and earth; yet few among the people perceive.</p>
<p>O Sovereign of Eternity! How can I cast upon all created things the signs of the glory of Thy sovereignty when the idolaters have encompassed Me on every side and laid hands of bondage upon this luminous, mighty and beloved Mouth? And when I mention among them wondrous remembrances, it but increaseth the hatred in the breasts of these wicked ones. Thou knowest what hath befallen Thy Self, and verily Thou art the Truth, the Knower of the Unseen.</p>
<p>O Sacrificed One! Raise thy head from slumber, then open thy tongue in utterance through My Name, the Powerful, the Bountiful. Fear no one, for thy Lord will guard thee from Satan and his manifestations, and will protect thee through His mighty and manifest sovereignty. And if thou desirest to enter this station before whose courtyard stand the realities of the highest ones and the angels who circle round the Throne, it behooveth thee to detach thyself from all who are in the heavens and earth, from all that hath been and shall be, and to make My love thy companion, My recognition thy purpose, and trust in thy Lord, the All-Knowing, thy stronghold in these days wherein all have turned away from His beauty and taken for themselves lords besides God, and thus do they act. And when thou art adorned with that which We have commanded thee, God shall open the eye of thy heart and thou shalt witness what none hath witnessed, and know what none hath known among those who claim within themselves that which God hath not permitted them and say what they comprehend not. Therefore, leave the idolaters and what they possess, then ascend on holy wings to the atmosphere of nearness, that thou mayest reach the Most Great Paradise in this hidden and treasured Word.</p>
<p>Say: O people! By God, I speak not from idle fancy, but rather the Spirit speaks within my breast - this is my proof, if you be of the fair-minded. O people! If this be my crime, I am not the first to have committed a crime before God; rather, honored servants feared God and did not refute the truth with your mouths. Then look with the eye of fairness upon that which has been sent down in truth from the dominion of God, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. If you dispute these words, by God, the decree of faith will not be confirmed for you regarding what was revealed to Ali of his Lord’s verses, and before him to God’s Messengers, if you but knew. O people! Have mercy upon yourselves and measure not this Cause by your own standards. Be among those who, when their Lord’s verses are recited unto them, are moved with yearning for His presence and fall prostrate upon their faces.</p>
<p>O Dhabih! By the True One, verily the Youth has fallen into the pit of hatred. Would that there were some wayfarers to let down the bucket of victory, that perchance the Youth might be drawn forth and the faces of the dwellers of the heavens and earth be illumined. Thus has the decree of destiny been inscribed upon preserved tablets of glory. Thus does this Pen recount unto thee, having drunk from the living waters of the Kawthar of the All-Merciful, and having grown in the holy land at the heart of Paradise, from which flows the Kawthar of glory - yet people can scarce comprehend. Know then that a sedition has appeared whereby the heavens of idle fancy were cleft asunder, the sun of creation darkened, and the falsehood of those who claimed faith in God’s verses, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, was exposed. Say: O people! These are in truth the verses of Ali. Beware lest you wax proud against them; rather be among those who humble themselves. Say: By God, the clouds of grace have been raised up, raining the water of life upon all created things - this from your Lord’s bounty, the All-Merciful, if you be of those who are certain. Have you seen any bounty greater than this? Nay, by the Self of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Beloved! Have you found in all creation a mercy more vast than this? Nay, by My Self, the Bestower, did you but know!</p>
<p>Among the people are those who inquire about this Announcement from those who fancy themselves guided. Say: O people! He needs nothing to prove His Cause from all that exists between the heavens and earth. All else was created by His Word, would you but reflect on His verses. Say: His proof is His Own Self, and His existence His authority - none knows this save those who have turned with sanctified countenance to their Lord’s face and are among those who perceive their Lord’s words with insight. Beware lest you hesitate in your Lord’s Cause. Look then with sanctified vision upon the proofs of the Prophets and Messengers, that the matter may become easy for you, that you may shatter the idols of vain imaginings through your Lord’s authority, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, and be among those who recline upon the cushions of glory. Know then that all that has flowed from the Pen of Counsel has been only from My love for thee, else thy Lord is independent of all who are in the heavens and earth. He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth, ordaining as He pleaseth through His word “Be” and it is. Strive then within thyself that Satan’s whispers lead thee not astray from the paths of the All-Merciful. Then stand firm in thy Lord’s Cause and be of those who view His Cause through the eye of God.</p>
<p>Say: O people! All that ye possess and that wherein ye pride yourselves is confirmed by the verses of God, and these are His verses sent down from the heaven of creation. Beware lest ye deny them and thereby make your works vain, and be not of those who follow every babbler and then disbelieve in the verses of their Lord. Know thou that We have made thee an ambassador from Us that thou mayest give glad tidings unto the people concerning this Cause whereby every bearer of a burden hath cast off her burden, and the veils of power have enveloped the eyes of the inhabitants of the heavens and earth save for a numbered few who have taken their station behind the pavilion of glory and drawn nigh unto the Sinai of nearness. These are they who swim in the depths of the Cause. Strip thyself of all things that the hand of grace may take thee and raise thee to a seat of glorious and beloved might, and may attire thee in that which shall illumine all created things. This is of thy Lord’s bounty unto thee if thou burnest it not with the fires of allusions and standest firm in thy Lord’s Cause, following not every rejected idolator. Beware lest thou confine thyself within the bounds of allusions or be veiled by the veils of signs. Rend asunder the veils by Our authority, then burn the allusions with this Fire that hath been kindled in the Sinai of eternity and hath been manifested unto this Pen in such wise as to draw unto it the hearts of those who follow the signs of God. Ponder upon the people of the Furqan and all that was in their possession that thou mayest sanctify thyself from the allusions of the people and be established in praiseworthy constancy. Leave the kingdom, then ascend unto this heaven that thou mayest discover that which none hath discovered save whom thy Lord, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting, willeth. If thou wouldst free thyself and ponder upon My migration in the year We arrived in Iraq, by God this would suffice thee above all else and make thee one of those who reflect upon the verses of their Lord. Through this was perfected God’s proof unto His servants and His testimony unto His chosen ones, and was completed His favor unto His loved ones, and His countenance shone forth unto His creation. Yet when the veils of idle fancy seized the people, they reflected not upon it but were heedless of their Lord’s command. Say: O people! Do not as did the people of the Furqan, and place not the reins of your recognition in anyone’s hands. Seize ye the grace in these days, then witness with your own eyes. When the verses of your Lord are recited unto you, turn not back on your heels, and be not of those who object to the verses of God and then mock them from their seats.</p>
<p>O Dhabi?! Thou hast been sacrificed at every instant during twenty years, and none knoweth this save thy Lord, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Know thou that when the Dhabi? of old desired to reach the station of sacrifice, redemption came unto him from the heaven of divine decree. But this Dhabi? accepted no redemption and was sacrificed by the sword of hatred wielded by these transgressors who comprehend not what they do. Shouldst thou detach thy gaze from mortal allusions and ascend unto the Most Sublime Vision, thou wouldst witness his head raised aloft upon the spear of hypocrisy from the direction of the horizons, and thou wouldst weep as weep the lovers who were prevented by the decrees of destiny from attaining the seat of glory of the Beloved. O Dhabi?! Purify thy sight from all contingent things and whatsoever lieth therein, and from all possibility and whatsoever is thereupon, that thou mayest recognize the handiwork of God Who hath perfected the creation of all things, and enter the house of mysteries wherein none hath entered save whom thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting, hath willed. Moreover, recognize the worth of these days wherein the countenance of the Youth shineth amongst you, and make good what thou hast missed in recognizing Him. By God! This is better for thee than the kingdom of the heavens and earth and than all that ye do or know. Soon shall ye place the fingers of remorse between the teeth of bewilderment, and ye shall not find the Youth though ye search throughout all the heavens and earth. Thus doth the Pen of divine decree cast upon thee from the mysteries of destiny, that perchance the servants may emerge from the sepulchres of heedlessness and detach themselves from all that preventeth them from attaining unto the seat of knowledge–this Paradise which God hath sanctified from the observations of such as join partners with their Lord. And when the garment of the Youth cometh unto thee stained with truthful blood, place it upon thy face, then inhale therefrom the fragrance of the All-Merciful, then redden thy face therewith and raise thy cry with a crimson face between earth and heaven, that perchance the people of the veils might burn away the veils of idle fancy and emerge naked from the garments of allusion, ascending unto the heaven of names and attributes–this station, the transcendent, the mighty, the praiseworthy. And verily when the Dhabi? of old desired to enter the seat of nearness, the heaven of his Lord, the Most High, Satan appeared in human form and desired to prevent him from entering the sanctuary of a treasured holiness. When We made this known unto him, he cast him away with stones through Our sovereignty and might. Thus was the matter ordained, if thou be of them that know. Follow thou his example and act as he acted, such that shouldst thou witness anyone desiring to prevent thee from the love of this Youth, know thou that he is verily Satan who hath appeared in human form. Seek refuge, then, in God and drive him away with a piercing flame. Beware lest thou turn to aught else; rather, set thy heart toward this holy and beloved shore. By God, O Dhabi?! All that thou hast heard from the beginning hath appeared from Us, but We concealed it through a wisdom known only to the sincere ones. Through this most of the servants rebelled against Us unknowingly. We were patient in tribulations and shall remain patient through God’s might and power until the Beauty of the Ancient of Days shall come with the authority of triumph and grant victory unto His servant–a victory before which all that was and shall be, shall be powerless. And the Spirit, and Glory, and Splendor be upon thee and upon those who are patient in the good-pleasure of their Lord.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath revealed Himself unto all who are in creation through the manifestation of His Most Exalted Pen, and hath deposited within the realities of all things the sign of His unity, that none should be veiled from the Sovereign of Names Who hath appeared through His Most Great and Most Glorious Name, and that no soul should be debarred from beholding the Light that shineth from the horizon of eternity. Whereupon the Manifestations of unity in the realm of divinity were attracted, and the realities of detachment in the realm of might hastened forth, and the essences of oneness in the kingdom of heaven were stirred, and the embodiments of limitation in the world of man were thunderstruck - among them were those who were thunderstruck and recovered, and those who were thunderstruck and returned to nothingness. Exalted is the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens, through Whom agitation seized the dwellers of the cities of names, and transformation appeared in that Beginning which is itself the ultimate End. Praise be to God Who hath manifested Himself unto all created things through His Name which He hath sanctified above all names and attributes. Thereupon the essential realities were exalted, and the inherent qualities shone forth, and the pure substances were confounded, and the eternal realities turned towards Him, and the divine identities drew nigh. Verily, He is as He is - He cannot be described by unity, for the manifestations of this name were created by His command and brought into being by the movement of His Pen; nor can He be characterized by holiness, for the dawning-places of this name were realized through the outpourings of the ocean of His bounty and are moved by Him; nor can He be known by sanctity, for the daysprings of this name are but servants at the gate of the city of His Cause and prostrate themselves at the dawning of the lights of His glory. Exalted, exalted is He above being known through aught else but Himself or being described by any other than Him. All that is bounded by the limits of creation is created within His dominion and is as nothing before the manifestations of His sovereignty and power. When He desired to make Himself known, He created all things through His pervading Will and all beings through His all-encompassing Purpose, and called all to the Dayspring of His signs and the Dawning-Place of His evidences. Among them were those who hastened and turned towards Him, those who drew back and returned, and those who drew near and then withdrew. Blessed is he who hath drunk the choice wine of steadfastness in the days of God and remained firm in the Cause in such wise that the manifestations of denial, who waxed proud and clung to idols, could not hinder him. We bear witness that there is none other God but Him. From time immemorial the court of His holiness hath been sanctified above all likenesses and similitudes, and the heaven of His nearness hath been exalted above all peers and utterances. There is none other God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice for your love! The servant hath been blessed by the words that shone forth from the horizon of your heart, which is adorned with the ornament of love for our Beloved and the Beloved of the world, our Goal and the Goal of all nations, and found therein what a loved one findeth from his beloved. I have thanked God for this, and beseech Him to honor us continually with your sublime letters, for through them hearts are gladdened and eyes are consoled. Yet the servant is perplexed by those who rise at one moment and fall at another - in the morning they claim faith in God, and in the evening they deny the Lord of Names, as if they were yellowed, withered leaves moved by their own desires. By the life of God! They are a people who neither understand nor perceive. We beseech God to preserve all from the whisperings of Satan and draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>The letter from your honor which was addressed to His Holiness the Name of God - upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God - reached me and I was privileged to peruse it. Regarding what you had written about Mirza Ahmad-i-Kirmani, this servant deemed it necessary to present a detailed account so that your honor and other friends who have drunk from the Kawthar of the knowledge of divine grace from the hands of the All-Merciful may become informed and remain protected from the mischief and denial of the corruptors and atheists. In God do I place my trust and from Him do I seek assistance in all conditions.</p>
<p>Several years ago, on one of those days when His Holiness Amin - upon him be the Glory of God - was present before the Blessed Beauty, He addressed him saying that a foul and repugnant odor was being perceived from the direction of the land of Kaf and Ra (Kirman). From this sun of utterance which dawned from the dawning-place of the Mouth of the Will of the Lord of Religions, this servant understood that some contrary matter must appear from that land, yet I remained perplexed as to what would manifest and through whom it would arise. Likewise, in the Most Holy Book, verses of the same import were revealed from the heaven of Will. His exalted Word states: “O Land of Kaf and Ra! We, verily, see in thee what is not pleasing to God, and We observe from thee that which none besides God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, can perceive. And We find that which secretly passes through thee. With Us is the knowledge of all things recorded in a clear Tablet.”</p>
<p>Should one meditate upon these verses revealed from the heaven of Divine Unity, one would observe how the knowledge of God encompasses all things - not an atom’s weight in the heavens or on earth escapes His knowledge. He is verily the Expositor, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. From these verses and blessed utterance it can be understood that besides the aforementioned unknown and imaginary person, other souls must also appear from that land. However, the Supreme Pen gives glad-tidings to that land, saying: Be not grieved by these unknown souls, for soon there shall appear within thee souls who will recognize the truth, who will sacrifice all who are in the world in His path of love, who will speak of Him and arise to serve Him. He is verily the Informed One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>In any case, after some time two petitions arrived consecutively from Mirza Ahmad, one from the direction of Ha (Haifa) and another from a different direction. In his petitions he had expressed limitless humility and contrition. He had also written a letter to this servant. Subsequently, a Tablet was revealed concerning him from the horizon of the Pen of Divine Providence. They commanded: “Send this Tablet and write your own reply to him as well, mentioning in your letter the account of the foul odor that was perceived from that land, and likewise the verses from the Most Holy Book.” From this statement this servant understood that some contrary matter must appear from him, yet great perplexity overtook this servant, for this person had expressed utmost servitude and submission in his petitions both before and after, and had likewise shown perfect sincerity and love toward this servant who is absolute nothingness. The Blessed Tablet outwardly indicated […]</p>
<p>But this servant wrote a response as commanded and mentioned therein the matters discussed. After receiving it he paid no attention. When his honor Ismullah M.H. went to the land of K.R., he claimed that some previously revealed tablets addressed to others had been revealed specifically for him. Among these was a Persian passage revealed in the Land of Mystery, wherein all the addresses in that tablet were to Ahmad. He claimed “This Ahmad is me.” Then when his honor Ismullah made certain statements, he submitted “What if I too become great under the shadow of Truth?” Later when his honor Dhabih, upon him be the Glory of God, arrived in that land and saw this servant’s letter, he told him “You are the one intended by these statements.” A complete estrangement occurred between them to such an extent that his honor Dhabih avoided and shunned him. His honor Dhabih wrote the details to this servant. After rejecting his honor Dhabih, he appeared in a different light, as you have written. However, he is not steadfast on any path. Every soul acts according to its own manner and returns to its origin. Now observe how inconstant, faithless and unstable some souls are. Shame upon those who believed then disbelieved, drew near then withdrew. These are servants who incline with every wind and are moved by every fancy, supposing themselves to be guided. Nay, by the Lord of the Throne and earth! They worship their desires but know it not. Strange that after beholding the ocean of meanings and its waves, and witnessing the Sun of utterance and its effulgence, one should be deprived thereof and cling to vain desire which is utter nothingness. Indeed not every eye is capable of beholding the true Sun, nor is every soul worthy of immersion in the ocean of meanings. Every kind seeks its own kind, and every branch will return to its root. In previous tablets the Supreme Pen forewarned all of the cawing of the ravens. These ravens are of two kinds: One kind claims belief at first then arises in complete rejection; the other kind makes claims and speaks without divine permission. These are tidings that have flowed from the divine Pen and will surely come to pass. If his honor Amin has reached your presence, inquire from him the details of what was submitted, for in those days both this servant and he were bewildered as to what would emerge from the land of K.R. By God the Truth, the heart nearly melted, for in these days the like of which has never appeared in creation, when all atoms proclaim that there is no God but Him, such souls who know not whence they came or whither they go cling to their own fancies, remain deprived of the Dayspring of certitude and the clear Book, and busy themselves with corruption and opposition. Fie upon them and upon those who hear their words, follow their desires, are moved by their passions and what their devils command them. These are dried leaves moved by the winds of passion.</p>
<p>This servant is astonished by those who, through heeding the foolish utterances of imaginary beings, remain deprived of the path of Divine unity. As to the baseness, degradation and paucity of understanding of mankind, this suffices - that for years they were worshippers of idols and even now exist upon the earth yet remain unaware; they worship the calf and perceive not; they follow Baal and know not; they bow before Al-Lat and comprehend not; they cleave to false gods and remember not. I swear by the Sun of Revelation that if people would reflect even less than that upon what hath been manifested and what hath dawned from the horizon of the world, they would pass beyond all else but God and turn towards that luminous horizon which is sanctified above mention and utterance. We beseech God to purify and sanctify the earth from the breaths of malicious souls and from the dark dust of vain imaginings. Verily He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>The request is that you convey greetings to the loved ones of that land on behalf of this evanescent one and say: O loved ones of the All-Merciful! It behooveth you to be as firmly-fixed mountains, as bright lamps, as shining lights, as fruit-bearing trees, as life-giving springs, and as penetrating vision in the Cause of God, the Lord of creation. Be ye in such wise in God’s path that the hosts of the world terrify you not, nor the gathering of nations, that the intimations of the learned grieve you not, nor the mentions of the mystics veil you. Hold fast to the firm and mighty cord.</p>
<p>In brief, whatsoever hath been revealed in the divine Tablets concerning steadfastness and its stations - the purpose is that all the loved ones throughout the horizons should become the very essence of steadfastness, and from all of them this most exalted station and most glorious rank should become manifest. Now it is observed that certain souls are like grass of the earth - a slight breeze scattereth them and their roots. We beseech God to protect His loved ones, to grant them the wine of steadfastness, and to adorn them with this most holy, most impregnable, most luminous ornament.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath opened wide the portals of arts and knowledge through the key of His Most Holy, Most Great, Most Glorious Name, whereby He hath pitched the pavilion of glory at the most exalted station in the realm of creation, and through which He hath caused the waves of the ocean of utterance to surge, and the stars of the heaven of divine knowledge to shine, and the sun of remembrance to shed its radiance, and the earth of certitude to yield its treasures, and the mountains their mines. Exalted, exalted is He Who hath revealed through it the mysteries of His Book and that which lay hidden in His knowledge and was veiled from the eyes of His servants. Praise be to God Who hath opened upon the countenance of His Glory the gate of His tribulation and destiny, and sent down upon Him from the heaven of His bounty the verses of His grace and the standards of His utterance. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Not a thing escapeth His knowledge. He adorneth whomsoever He willeth with the ornament of His bounty and generosity, and divests whomsoever He pleaseth of the garments of His might and majesty. He, verily, is the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Bountiful. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Wise. We bear witness that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who hath come from the horizon of the heaven of utterance is the Hidden Secret and the Treasured Mystery, at Whose manifestation all things proclaimed: “The Kingdom is God’s, Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below, the Lord of the world to come and of this world.”</p>
<p>O thou who standest before the Gate and who, in thy final goal, seeketh after God, the Lord of all men! Know thou that We bear witness that thou hast drunk the choice wine of the love of God, the Lord of the worlds, and hast turned toward His horizon while most of the people were turning away. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to strengthen thee with His sovereignty and to aid thee in manifesting His Cause in such wise that thou mayest arise before the faces of His servants and take the chalice of utterance from the hands of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and drink therefrom despite those who denied Him Whom the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise have recognized, as well as those who circle round the Throne of their Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful, at eventide and at dawn. Say: O people of God! By the life of God, We had taken for Ourself a brother and aided him to serve Our Cause before Our face, and revealed for him that which diffused the fragrance of God’s utterance throughout all else. We then raised him to a station beyond which the stations of the servants and the reach of those in all lands were cut off. But when he saw himself in that most holy, most noble, most mighty, most exalted station, pride seized him until he turned away from God, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection and He Who conversed on Sinai. I beseech Thee, O God of the world and Desire of the nations, to aid him and those who turned away to return unto Thee and to repent at the door of Thy mercy. Thou knowest that I summoned him in all conditions unto Thee until he drew against Me the sword of hatred and there appeared from him that which caused the limbs of all things to quake. O Lord! Help him to return to the door of Thy mercy, which Thou hast opened through Thy Most Great Name unto all peoples. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O thou who gazeth toward the horizon of utterance and who holdeth fast to the cord of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the All-Merciful! Know thou with certain knowledge that the Wronged One desireth naught but the exaltation of the Word of God and the manifestation of His Cause amidst His servants. By this hath the fire of envy and hatred been kindled. Beseech thou God, thy Lord, to quench it through the living waters of His utterance. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His mighty and wondrous Word. Blessed art thou, O Sadiq, in that God hath aided thee to turn unto Him, to hold fast to His cord, and to cling to the hem of His mercy.</p>
<p>Hear thou in the Persian tongue the divine call from the direction of the Prison of ’Akka. Verily it draweth thee unto a station wherein the ranks of the world and the doubts of nations shall not prevent thee from drawing nigh unto the All-Informed One. All created things bear witness that this servant’s purpose in arising and bearing the wrongs of mankind hath been that bonds might be loosened and the captive set free. Should any soul deny or stray from its shelter, it mattereth not; nay rather, we are grateful, for afterwards the difference will become clear and distinction made between pearl and potsherd. Say: O my God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy radiant light. O my God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy all-embracing remembrance and by Thy dawning, gleaming Name to transform the abasement of Thy loved ones into glory and their weakness into strength. Thou art verily the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the Wise. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by the poverty of Thy lovers to open before their faces the gates of Thy wealth. Thou art verily the Bountiful, the Generous. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the Word whereby were attracted the hearts of all things and the souls of all beings, and by the Light whereby were illumined the hearts of the sincere ones, and by Thy sovereignty wherewith Thou didst subdue all names, to ordain for me by Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall abide with me in every world of Thy worlds. Thou art He to Whose power testifieth all in existence, both seen and unseen. There is none other God but Thee, the Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>We beseech God to aid thee to serve His Cause and to enable thee to hold fast unto whatsoever leadeth to the exaltation of His Word and the manifestation of His Cause. Say: O people! By God, the Promised Day hath come and the Book hath been sent down and the Throne hath been adorned by the Lord of all men, yet doubt stirreth in hearts. This is naught but a wondrous matter. O people! The Day hath come and the Self-Subsisting calleth out: The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of Lords! O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Should anyone ask thee concerning the Ark of God, say: Verily it is amidst the waves. Thus did My tongue speak aforetime in the kingdom of My utterance, and at this moment: Verily My brother whom We reared over successive years hath risen up before the kingdom of utterance and committed that which caused the near ones and the sincere to weep at eventide and at dawn. Thus did the Wronged One suffer at the hands of him whom We had raised to the most exalted station. Would anyone deny what hath flowed from the Pen? Nay, by My life, save he who casteth justice behind him, clinging to tyranny and oppression. I beseech Thee, O Joy of the World, to transform the sorrows of Thy servants into gladness. Thou art verily the Kind, the Forgiving. Take once again the cup of utterance from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, then drink therefrom in His Name through which He subdued the kingdoms of wisdom and utterance. He is verily the Powerful through His sovereignty and the Manifest through His signs. There is none other God but He, the Commander, the Wise.</p>
<p>O ?! This is a Book that calleth out from every direction: O Manifestations of Names and Attributes! The Revealer of Verses hath come with the standards of knowledge and wisdom. Nothing escapeth His knowledge. He heareth the call of His loved ones and answereth them through His grace and mercy. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! We bear witness that thou didst attain and win the choice wine of immortality from the hands of bounty and what is in the Crimson Scroll from the Pen of God, the Lord of all men. Thou art he whom God did strengthen to turn towards Him in His days, and caused to speak His praise, and revealed unto thee what was hidden from eyes and sight.</p>
<p>As to what was asked concerning the blessed word “He” appearing in the garment of “I,” and hidden in “I am the One Witnessed,” and its restriction in this Revelation: For the Daysprings of Divine Revelation and the Manifestations of His Cause there is, in every station, an utterance, and at every rank, a mention. At times they speak with “Verily, I am God,” and at other times they utter “I am a servant who hath believed in God.” Since this word hath been revealed in this Dispensation, it is specific thereto. For the birds of the Paradise of inner meanings, it is a melody when they are seated upon the throne of “I have with God a station,” speaking with an utterance transcending the limited expressions current among men. The aforementioned word is but a single word, yet in the eyes of those endowed with insight, it hath been revealed from the King of Words through the Dawning-Places of Divine utterance, according to time and station, that which the world of existence is powerless and incapable of comprehending.</p>
<p>O thou who dwellest in My vicinity and drinketh the choice wine of My utterance! This Wronged One hath not attended schools nor engaged in formal discourse. Out of pure bounty to thee are these few words mentioned and shall continue to be mentioned. In stations where they regard the purpose of creation and its effects, they ask about all matters and manifest the utmost servitude. And when they behold the signs deposited within existence, they speak that which transcendeth comprehension and minds. Thus it is that in one station, looking toward the expression of humility, submissiveness and utter poverty, they utter “My Lord, show me,” and the purpose of this word is to express powerlessness, nothingness and evanescence before the manifestation and appearance of the might and grandeur of God, exalted be His glory.</p>
<p>In brief, the Manifestations of God at times express power, wealth and independence, and at times they express weakness, poverty and evanescence. The purpose of these two stations, two mentions and two utterances hath been and is to demonstrate the power and might of God, exalted be His glory.</p>
<p>As to what was asked concerning the blessed verse about the Son of Mary, this word is clear and evident. According to the opinion of the learned ones, it is a rhetorical question meaning “Didst thou say…?” Since the followers of Christ believe in the trinity, meaning the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, therefore the purpose of the verse was to reject the statements and beliefs of that people. In the innermost mystery He says: “Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee! Thou knowest what is in my soul, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. I seek Thy forgiveness for what the heedless say. Glory be unto Thee! I am of those who repent.”</p>
<p>And as to what was asked concerning the verse “God forgiveth not that partners should be set up with Him; but He forgiveth anything else,” it is incumbent in this day upon this party to beseech from the Truth that He may enable them to attain unto true Divine Unity. Every soul who fixeth his gaze upon and cleaveth unto God, glorified be His majesty, and Him alone, is reckoned before God as one of the people of unity and is accepted; otherwise he is accounted among the idolaters. Thus were the Shi’ih party idolaters while they counted themselves unitarians; they were ignorant while they deemed themselves learned. From the recompense of deeds on the Day of Judgment, the stations of that party are manifest and evident as the sun. And as to what thou didst mention concerning the Unseen and the knowledge of the Prophets, there hath been and is no doubt that knowledge of the Unseen is exclusively reserved to the Ancient Being, glorified be His majesty, and all the Prophets unanimously acknowledge this fact. “None knoweth the Unseen save He” is established and proven. Likewise the blessed verse “No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision,” for the impenetrable Unseen hath been and ever shall be hidden, and outward vision is powerless and incapable of beholding and comprehending it. These outward eyes have not been and are not capable of beholding even outward things, much less that which is concealed behind the veils of the Unseen. The Wronged One testifieth with His outer and inner tongue that “No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision, and He is the All-Subtle, the All-Informed.” Both the outer and inner eye are powerless and incapable of beholding. If thou wouldst hear from Me, purify thy heart and pen and tongue from that which beseemeth not the days of God, then confine thy affairs to teaching His Cause and guiding His creation. And now that honored one should speak of that which causeth eagerness and longing, and is the cause of ascent and elevation in those immersed in the sea of sanctity. These mentions are the cause of pause. We beseech God to give thee to drink of a cup whose effect shall sanctify thy being from the words of them that are veiled, and purify thine essence from the doubts of the suspicious ones and the uncertainties of the barking ones. There hath been and is no doubt that in this Most Great Revelation there hath appeared that which existed not before. The Cause hath attained to such a station that the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - hath spoken “I am the first of the worshippers.” We beseech of the Truth that He may sanctify that honored one through the Kawthar of holy utterance. Verily He is powerful over all things. Say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me unto the horizon of Thy manifestation and caused me to hear Thy sweetest call and the rustling of Thy Most Exalted Pen. My Lord! Rear me according to Thy will and not my will. Then make me a standard of Thy Name in Thy lands and an ensign of Thy Cause amongst Thy servants. I testify to my poverty and Thy wealth, my powerlessness and Thy might. I beseech Thee by Thyself and by Thy signs and Thy standing before the faces of Thy creation, to remember me in all conditions at Thy mention, O Thou through Whose Name the Mother Book hath spoken in the final abode.</p>

<p>Exalted art Thou, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by those whom Thou hast bidden to observe the Fast for the sake of Thy love and good-pleasure, who have demonstrated their allegiance to Thy law and followed Thy verses and precepts, and who have broken their fast while enjoying near access to Thee and beholding Thy countenance. By Thy glory! Since they are turning to the court of Thy good-pleasure, all their days are days of fasting. Were the mouth of Thy will to address them saying: “Observe, for My beauty’s sake, the fast, O people, and set no limit to its duration,” I swear by the majesty of Thy glory, that every one of them will faithfully observe it, will abstain from whatsoever will violate Thy law, and will continue to do so until they yield up their souls unto Thee, for they have tasted the sweetness of Thy call, and become inebriated with Thy remembrance and praise and with the words proceeding from the lips of Thy command.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O Lord, by Thyself, the Exalted, the Most High, and by Thy Latter Manifestation through Whom the kingdom of names and the dominion of attributes have been convulsed, and the inhabitants of earth and heaven became intoxicated, and all who dwell in the realms of Revelation and creation trembled except such as have fasted from all that is repugnant to Thy good-pleasure and restrained themselves from turning toward aught besides Thee, to include us among them and to write down our names on the Tablet whereon Thou hast inscribed their names. O God, through the wonders of Thy might and the tokens of Thy sovereignty and grandeur, Thou didst send forth their names from out of the sea of Thy names, and didst create their inner essences out of the substance of Thy love, and their inmost beings from the spirit of Thy Cause. Theirs is a reunion not succeeded by separation, a nearness that knoweth no remoteness, and a perpetuity that hath no end. Verily, these are servants who ever recount Thee, who eternally circle round Thee, and who circumambulate the sanctuary of Thy presence and the Kaaba of reunion with Thee. Thou hast ordained, O my God, no distinction between them and Thee, except that when they beheld the lights of Thy countenance, they set their faces towards Thee, and prostrated themselves before Thy beauty, submissive to Thy greatness and severed from all things besides Thee.</p>
<p>We have fasted this day, O my Lord, by Thy command and Thy bidding in accordance with what Thou hast revealed in Thy perspicuous Book. We have withheld our souls from passion and from whatsoever Thou abhorest until the day drew to an end and the time arrived to break the Fast. Wherefore, I implore Thee, O Desire of the hearts of ardent lovers and Beloved of the souls of them who are endued with understanding, O Rapture of the breasts of them that yearn after Thee and Object of the desire of them that seek Thee, to cause us to soar in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and the heaven of Thy presence, and to accept from us what we have performed in the pathway of Thy love and good-pleasure. Write down our names, then, among those who have acknowledged Thy oneness and confessed to Thy singleness and who have humbled themselves before the evidences of Thy majesty and the tokens of Thy grandeur, those who have taken refuge in Thy nearness and sought shelter in Thee, who have expended their lives in their eagerness to meet Thee and attain the court of Thy presence, and who have cast the world behind their backs for love of Thee and severed every tie with aught save Thee in their eagerness to draw nigh unto Thee. These are servants whose hearts melt in ardent desire for Thy beauty at the mention of Thy Name, and whose eyes overflow with tears in their longing to find Thee and enter the precincts of Thy court.</p>
<p>This is, O my Lord, my tongue which testifieth to Thy unity and peerlessness, mine eye which beholdeth the seat of Thy generosity and manifold bounties, and mine ear which is ready to hearken unto Thy summons and Thine utterance, for I am assured, O my God, that Thou hast decreed the words proceeding out of the mouth of Thy will to be inexhaustible, and unto them the ears which Thou hast sanctified to hear Thy words and verses are at all times hearkening. And these are my hands, O my Lord, uplifted toward the heaven of Thy favor and tender mercy. Wilt Thou, then, turn away this poor one who hath taken to himself no beloved except Thee, no bestower beside Thee, nor king other than Thee, no shelter save beneath the shadow of Thy mercy, and no refuge but before Thy gate, which Thou hast opened unto all who dwell in Thy heaven and on Thine earth? Nay, by Thy glory! I am he whose confidence in Thy loving kindness will remain undaunted even though Thou wert to afflict me with torments for the duration of Thy dominion; and should anyone ask me about Thee, every limb of my body would proclaim: “He is beloved in His acts and obeyed in His decree, merciful in His nature and compassionate to His creatures!”</p>
<p>Thy might beareth me witness, O Well-Beloved of the hearts of them that yearn after Thee, wert Thou to turn me away from Thy door and abandon me to the swords of the tyrants amongst Thy servants and to the rods of the ungodly amongst Thy creatures, and should someone ask me about Thee, every hair of my body would still declare: “He is, in truth, the Best Beloved of the worlds; He is the Most Bountiful; He is the Ever-Abiding! He draweth me nigh whilst distancing me from Himself; He granteth me His sanctuary whilst debarring me from His presence. None found I more merciful than He, by Whom I have become independent of all else but Him and have been raised up above aught besides Himself.”</p>
<p>Well is it with the one, O my God, who hath been so enriched by Thee as to be made independent of the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Rich is the one who hath held fast to the cord of Thy wealth, is submissive before Thy face, and for whom Thou art sufficient above all things. Poor is the one who hath dispensed with Thee, waxed proud before Thee, turned away from Thy presence, and disbelieved in Thy signs. Suffer me, then, O my God and my Beloved, to be numbered with those whom the breezes of Thy will move as they list, not with those whom the wind of self and passion stirreth and directeth as it pleaseth. No God is there but Thee, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Most Bountiful.</p>
<p>All glory be to Thee, O my God, for Thou hast graciously enabled me to fast during this month which Thou hast related to Thy Name, the Most Exalted, and called ’Ala (Loftiness). Thou hast commanded that Thy servants and Thy people should fast therein and seek thereby to draw nearer unto Thee. The days and months of the year have culminated with the Fast, even as the first month began with Thy Name, Baha, that all might testify that Thou art the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden, and be well assured that the glory of all names is conferred only through the glory of Thy Cause and the word expounded by Thy will and revealed through Thy purpose. Thou hast ordained that this month be a remembrance and honor from Thee, and a sign of Thy presence amongst them, that they may not forget Thy grandeur and Thy majesty, Thy sovereignty and Thy glory, and may be well assured that from time immemorial Thou hast ever been and wilt ever be Ruler over the entire creation. Nothing created in the heavens or on the earth can hinder Thee in Thy governance, nor can anyone in the realms of Revelation and creation prevent Thee from fulfilling Thy purpose.</p>
<p>I implore Thee, O my God, by Thy name whereby all the kindreds of the earth have wailed, except such as Thou hast safeguarded with Thine unerring protection and sheltered beneath the shadow of Thy transcendent mercy, to make us so firm in Thy Cause and steadfast in Thy love that were Thy servants to rise up against Thee and Thy people turn away from Thee, and no one would remain on earth to invoke Thy name or set his face toward the sanctuary of communion with Thee and the Kaaba of Thy sanctity, I would still arise singly and alone to render Thy Cause victorious, to exalt Thy word, to proclaim Thy sovereignty, and to celebrate the praise of Thine august Self. And this, O Lord, even though each time I venture to extol Thee by any name, I am filled with perplexity, for I am fully aware that all of Thine exalted attributes and all of the most excellent names which I associate with Thee and by which in Thy holy presence I supplicate Thee, reflect naught but the measure of mine own understanding, inasmuch as whenever I have regarded a name to be laudable, I have associated it with Thyself.</p>
<p>Immeasurably exalted is Thy true state above the description or knowledge of anyone besides Thee, and sanctified art Thou from the glorification of Thy creatures and the praise of Thy servants in their attempts to ascend unto Thee. Whatsoever appeareth from Thy servants is limited by the limitations of their own selves and is created by their own idle fancies and imaginings.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O my Beloved, for mine inability to befittingly praise Thee and for my shortcomings during Thy days! If I acclaim Thee, O my God, as Him Who knoweth all things, I readily perceive that shouldst Thou point to a mute rock with a single finger of Thy will, Thou wouldst enable it to unfold the knowledge of all past and future ages; and if I extol Thee as the All-Powerful, I find that one word issuing from the mouth of Thy purpose is sufficient to convulse the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Thy glory beareth me witness, O Beloved of all that recognize Thee, should any learned one fail to confess his ignorance before the revelations of Thy knowledge, he would be accounted the most ignorant of Thy people; and should any mighty one refuse to admit his weakness before the evidences of Thy power, he would be considered the weakest and the most heedless of Thy creatures. Given my knowledge and certainty that this is so, how can I extol Thee or describe and praise Thee? Wherefore, knowing my weakness, I have hastened toward the shelter of Thy strength; and realizing my poverty, I have sought refuge under the shadow of Thy wealth; and recognizing my powerlessness, I have arisen to stand before the tabernacle of Thy power and might. Wilt thou cast away this poor one after he hath taken no one but Thee as his succorer, or turn away this stranger after he hath found no one but Thee to be his true beloved?</p>
<p>Thou knowest all that is in me, O Lord, but I know not what is in Thee. Have mercy then upon me through Thy loving providence and inspire me with that which shall give peace to my heart during Thy days and tranquillity to my soul through the revelations of Thy sacred presence. All created things have been illumined with the splendors of the lights of Thy countenance, O Lord, and the dwellers of earth and heaven are shining resplendently on account of the manifestations of Thine incomparable majesty, in such wise that I behold nothing without first beholding within it the revelation of Thyself, a revelation which is hidden from the sight of those among Thy servants who lie fast asleep.</p>
<p>Deprive me not, O my Lord, of Thy grace which hath encompassed all the realms of existence, whether visible or invisible. Wilt Thou stay far removed, O my God, after Thou hast invited all mankind to return and draw nigh unto Thee, and urged them to hold fast to Thy cord? Wilt Thou cast me out, O my Beloved, even when Thou hast promised in Thine incorruptible Book and in Thy wondrous verses to gather all those who yearn after Thee within the pavilion of Thy gracious providence, and those who desire Thee under the shadow of Thy bountiful favor, and those who search for Thee under the canopy of Thy mercy and loving-kindness?</p>
<p>I swear by Thy might, O my God, that my lamentations have halted my heart within me, and its groans have seized the reins from my hands! At whatever time I reassure myself and gladden my soul with the wonders of Thy mercy, the tokens of Thy gracious providence, and the evidences of Thy generosity, I tremble before the manifestations of Thy justice and the signs of Thy wrath. I recognize that Thou art known by these two names and described by these two attributes, yet Thou carest not whether Thou art invoked by Thy name the Ever-Forgiving, or Thy name the Wrathful. By Thy glory, were it not for my knowledge that Thy mercy surpasseth all things, the limbs of my body would have ceased to exist, my reality been extinguished and my inner being reduced to utter nothingness. But when I behold that Thy grace encompasseth all things and Thy mercy embraceth the entire creation, my soul and my inmost being become well assured.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O my God, for the things that have escaped me during Thy days, and again alas, alas, O Desire of my heart, for what I have left undone in service and obedience to Thee during these days the likes of which the eyes of Thy chosen ones and trusted ones have never witnessed! I entreat Thee, O my Lord, by Thy Self and by the Manifestation of Thy Cause Who is seated upon the throne of Thy mercy, to confirm me in Thy service and good-pleasure. Guard me, then, from those who have turned away from Thee and disbelieved in Thy verses, who have denied Thy truth, resisted Thine evidences, and violated Thy Covenant and testament.</p>
<p>All praise, O Lord my God, be unto Him Who is the Manifestation of Thine Essence,</p>
<p>the Dayspring of Thy oneness, the Mine of Thy knowledge, the Source of Thy Revelation, the Repository of Thine inspiration, the Seat of Thy sovereignty, and the Dawning-Place of Thy Divinity–He Who is the Primal Point, the Most Exalted Countenance, the Ancient Root, and the Quickener of nations; and glory be upon him who was the first to believe in Him and in His verses, whom Thou didst make a throne for the ascendancy of Thy most sublime Word, a focal-point for the manifestation of Thy most excellent names, a dayspring of the radiance of the Sun of Thy providence, a dawning-place for the appearance of Thy names and attributes, and a treasury of the pearls of Thy wisdom and Thy commandments. And all honor be upon him who was the last to come unto Him, whose arrival was like His arrival, and Thy manifestation in him like Thy manifestation in Him , except that he was illumined with the lights of His face and prostrated himself before Him and testified to his servitude unto Him; and glory be upon those who were martyred in His path and who offered up their lives for love of His beauty.</p>
<p>We testify, O my God, that these are servants who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs, who have sought the sanctuary of Thy presence and turned toward Thy countenance, who have directed their faces toward the court of Thy nearness and walked in the path of Thy good-pleasure, who have worshipped Thee according to Thy desire and detached themselves from all but Thee. O Lord, confer upon their spirits and their bodies at all times a share of the wonders of Thine all-encompassing mercy. Thou art, verily, powerful to do as Thou pleaseth. No God is there save Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, Whose help is implored by all men.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O Lord, by Him and by them, and by Him Whom Thou hast established on the throne of Thy Faith and caused to overshadow all the dwellers of earth and heaven, to purify us from our transgressions, to ordain for us a seat of truth in Thy presence and to cause us to associate with those whom the adversities of the world and its misfortunes have not hindered from turning toward Thee. Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Protector, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>

<p>We have sent down the Book and it speaks before the faces of the servants: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of Lords!” It gives glad tidings to those who have advanced towards what hath been ordained for them from the Supreme Pen, and it warns those who have denied God and His verses and turned away from the Dawning-Place of utterance.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Hear the call from the Blessed Crimson Tree that there is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Bestower. When the promise came and the appointed time was fulfilled, We came from the Dayspring of Power with the signs of God, the Lord of the Final End. The Point of the Bayan was at My right hand, and before My face were the Messengers of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Chosen One. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto My days, advanced toward My horizon, turned unto My face, and heard the call of the Prophets and Messengers in this Cause whereby the pillars were shaken and the idols fell senseless. We were seated upon the throne of sorrow by reason of what befell Us from the Dayspring of hatred - whereat the Most Exalted Paradise lamented, as did those who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide.</p>
<p>The Most Great Branch came before the Face with a letter from one who loved Me, who was named ’Ali-Akbar by the Pen of God, the Manifester of clear signs. We heard what he uttered and We answered him as a grace from Our presence, for verily I am the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. O ’Ali-Akbar! Upon thee be My Glory! Thou art he who traversed the paths until thou didst arrive at the shore of the Most Great Ocean and heard the call of the Wronged One, Who hath suffered in the path of God that which caused all atoms to lament. Thou didst arrive, hear, and witness what had been the hope of those near unto God from time immemorial. O ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar! The Wronged One remembereth thee from the precincts of the Prison and remembereth those whom thou didst mention in thy letter, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. We have previously made mention of thy brother, then of those who have believed in God, the One, the Peerless, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. We desired to mention each one in such wise as would attract him to a station wherein the conditions of the world would not prevent him, nor the objections of the people of the Bayan who denied the All-Merciful when He came to them with power and sovereignty.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! We now speak in the Persian tongue that all may partake of the Kawthar of the All-Merciful’s utterance and attain unto the most great steadfastness.</p>
<p>O Sulayman (Master Sulayman)! The Supreme Pen declareth: All the peoples of the world have been created to know the Day of God. Every Messenger hath given the glad-tidings of this Day to the people and counseled them concerning it. The previous Books, which were sent down from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful’s utterance upon the Prophets and His chosen ones, bear witness to this truth. Nevertheless, the servants remain heedless and deprived of recognizing the Creator of all things and the Judge of the Day of Reckoning. The cause and reason for this greatest deprivation and thick veil have been and continue to be the divines of the age, who have in truth seized the recompense of all deeds and prevented others from the ocean of light that surgeth before the face of the Lord of the Manifestation. Praise be to the Goal of the world that He hath assisted thee - thou didst hear and attain. Now We counsel thee and the party of God to preserve that which hath been bestowed. The Glory from Us be upon those who have advanced, heard, and answered their Lord, the Hearing, the Responding One.</p>
<p>O Hasan-’Ali! The Mother Book declareth: Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto the traces of the Supreme Pen and hast been nourished from the Kawthar of the love of the Lord of Names.

Say […]</p>
<p>I ask Thee, O my God, by Thy Most Exalted Pen and by the lights of Thy countenance, O Thou Possessor of the Kingdom of eternity, to aid me to be steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the hosts of the world nor the cawing of the nations who have denied Thee and Thy signs may frighten me. Then I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which befitteth Thy bounty and Thy bestowal. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O ’Ali (Jenab-i-’Ali ibn Muhammad Kazim)! The Preserved Tablet declareth: Thou hast attained unto that which hath flowed from the Pen of God’s Will in the divine Books. Praise be to God, thou hast been enabled to hearken unto the scratching of the Pen, the flowing of the Kawthar of utterance, and the rushing of the breeze of loving-kindness. Blessed art thou and blessed is thy teacher. Thou hast ever been and art still beneath His glance. All thy relatives and friends are recipients of God’s favors. Ask thou of God that He may strengthen all to be steadfast, for the cawing ones have been and are lying in wait. We beseech God to assist you all in all things to mention Him, to praise Him, to serve Him, and to do that which will exalt His mighty and wondrous Cause.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-Husayn (Aqa Ghulam-Husayn of ?)! Upon thee be My glory. Thou hast attained unto My mention and the traces of My Most Exalted Pen. I swear by the Great Announcement that this is and hath ever been a great bounty. Know thou its station and occupy thyself with thanksgiving and praise to the Goal of the world’s desire. Today all must turn in unity and accord, and should any unacceptable matter arise, they must hasten with utmost speed to resolve it. They must arise for God’s sake and occupy themselves with service for His sake. Today any word that causeth discord is not and hath never been acceptable in God’s sight. Convey My greetings to the loved ones and remind them of what hath been mentioned, that perchance all desires may be annihilated in God’s Will - that is, that they may speak and move according to what God hath willed. That which hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen is effective in all things. The Lord of Names beareth witness unto this in this exalted station.</p>
<p>O Husayn (Ustad Husayn)! The Mother Book declareth: Say: O God, my Deity, my King, my Goal! With what tongue shall I render Thee thanks? I was heedless, Thou didst make me aware; I was turning away, Thou didst aid me to turn towards Thee; I was dead, Thou didst grant me life through the water of life; I was withered, Thou didst bestow freshness through the Kawthar of utterance which flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful. O Lord! The existence of all things is generated by Thy bounty; deprive them not of the ocean of Thy generosity and the sea of Thy mercy. At all times do I seek Thy grace and confirmation, and from the heaven of Thy favor do I implore Thy ancient gift. Thou art the Lord of bounty and the Sovereign of the Kingdom of eternity.</p>
<p>O Mahdi (Ustad Mahdi the Builder)! The Wronged One mentioneth thee from the Most Great Prison and calleth out to thee. This is that Call which appeared from the Divine Lote-Tree, and this is that Call which the Beloved attained unto in His ascension, and this is that Manifestation whereof the Spirit gave glad-tidings and Moses made mention. Blessed is the soul whom the cawing of the croakers, the authority of the oppressors, and the tyranny of the ignorant ones hath not debarred from the Day of God nor deprived of His outpourings. We enjoin all to be steadfast and counsel them to observe that which is befitting to God’s Cause. Blessed are they that act accordingly.</p>
<p>O Salman (Master Salman the builder)! In the days when He Who conversed with God upon the Mount was seated upon the throne of manifestation in Baghdad, He informed all of the birds of night, the cawing of the ravens, and the corruption of the infidels, so that the people of God might be preserved through the grace of the traces of the Supreme Pen from the evil of such souls. This was not confined to any particular place, and perchance in this land too there may arise that which causeth discord. We counsel all to remain steadfast in the Cause and to act as beseemeth the days of God, the Lord of all worlds. Before the passing of a thousand years, any claim is forbidden, and whosoever maketh such a claim is, in the sight of God, rejected and unacceptable. Hearken unto the voice of the Wronged One and hold fast unto that which He hath commanded. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. There is no God but Him, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-Husayn (Master Ghulam-Husayn the builder)! The Hidden Secret declareth: The verses have been sent down, the evidences are manifest, the path is clear, and the proof is visible, yet all remain veiled and debarred. Give thanks to the Ancient King that He assisted thee and guided thee, and in the Most Great Prison He is occupied with thy remembrance. This station is beyond description. By the Most Great Announcement! If thou wert to render thanks for this supreme word which hath flowed from the Supreme Pen throughout the duration of the kingdom and the heavenly dominion, it would not equal or compare with this supreme bounty. We beseech God to assist all to perform such deeds and to manifest such character as are the hosts of God in this Most Great Revelation. If thou hast attained unto the fragrance of the utterance of the All-Merciful, arise and say:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Thou through Whom the Resurrection hath come to pass, the Hour hath appeared, the Cry hath been raised, the mountains have passed away, and that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds, hath been manifested.</p>
<p>O Weaver (Aqa Rida the weaver)! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Ascension. Beseech God to assist thee in weaving a garment which the arrows of the opposers of the Bayan and the swords of the polytheists of the Qur’an cannot pierce. This blessed garment hath its warp of trust in God and its woof of detachment. This garment hath ever been suitable for the temples of those who are assured, steadfast and firm. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto it and hath found itself free and detached from all else but God.</p>
<p>O Husayn (Husayn son of Aqa Muhammad Nasir Lari)! The people of Iran considered themselves monotheists, yet on the Day of Manifestation all were found to be polytheists, save a few. The recompense of their deeds hath in the end deprived them of the knowledge of the Self-Sufficient One. White and green turbans and the kissing of hands became the cause of pride and the source of hindrance. Not one among the well-known divines did, at the beginning, draw nigh unto the ocean of nearness, nor did they partake of the Living Waters which flow and stream forth in every moment from the Pen of the All-Merciful. Strive ye, that the people of God, one and all, may attain unto true unity, may see all except God as non-existent and count them as nothing. Today the Sun of Unity hath dawned from the horizon of detachment. Naught is mentioned therein save Him alone. Blessed is he that hath attained, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Taqi (Aqa Muhammad-Taqi, son of Aqa Muhammad-Ja’far Isfahani)! Upon thee be My Baha! The hosts of God, who are the supporters and helpers of His Cause, in this Most Great Revelation have ever been and shall continue to be goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct. All must render assistance to the Cause of God through these divine hosts. Today is the day of mention and praise, and today is the day of deeds. Repeatedly hath this utterance flowed from the Pen of the Most Merciful, that all may fix their gaze upon it and hold fast unto it. Corruption, contention and strife have never been and shall never be pleasing unto God. O people of God! Consider this time a precious opportunity, that ye may perchance succeed in performing a deed whose fragrance shall endure forever and whose mention shall be everlasting. In these days, this Wronged One hath been afflicted by the imaginings of the oppressors, and there hath befallen Him anew that which caused the Supreme Pen to lament and the Tablet to cry out. Nevertheless, He was not hindered from making mention of the people of God, nor did He pause. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this manifest grace. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds and Goal of them that have recognized Thee!</p>
<p>O Muhammad (Master Muhammad the Builder)! God willing, mayest thou be assisted to build a House that shall be raised up in the name of God. The mention thereof shall ever shine and be manifest like unto the sun from the horizon of the heaven of utterance, and shall endure and remain forever. Likewise, may ye be confirmed to strengthen the foundation of steadfastness, which today is greater than any good deed and taketh precedence over every other matter. Render thanks unto the Desired One, Who hath made mention of thee in the Most Great Prison, which is known as the Praiseworthy Place. We send Our greetings to the loved ones in that land and bid them to that which beseemeth the days of God. Under all conditions, occupy yourselves with the remembrance of God and His praise. This is My counsel and My testament unto My servants who have attained unto My days, who have soared in My atmosphere, who have held fast unto My cord, and who have acted according to that which is in My Great Book.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O God of earth and throne, Lord of all beings and Sovereign of the hereafter and the former times! I beseech Thee by the Crimson Ark which Thou hast made the dwelling-place of the people of Baha, to illumine Thy lands with the lights of Thy countenance and the hearts of Thy servants with the revelations of the Sun of Thy knowledge. O Lord! Thou seest them in the hands of the wicked among Thy creatures as captives and strangers. O Lord! The Pharaohs’ conditions, the tyrants’ wishes, and the Caesars’ designs have gained ascendancy over them. O Lord! The fire of hatred from the oppressors among Thy creatures and the rebellious among Thy creation hath encompassed them. They pass judgment upon Thy chosen ones according to their desires and act according to their own inclinations in ways that cause the dwellers of the pavilion of infallibility and the tabernacle of grandeur to lament. O Lord! Thou hearest the sighs of the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise at what hath befallen Thy loved ones in Thy days, and the cries of the inhabitants of the cities of names at what they have witnessed from the oppressors among Thy creation who pronounced judgment against Thee and sought to slay Thee by night and day. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Thou knowest and seest; there is no God but Thee, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O God of the world, to protect Thy loved ones from the evil of those whose tyranny caused the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise to cry out, and to extinguish the fire that hath been kindled by rancor and hatred. O Lord! Thou art the Strong, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Glorious. The mighty among Thy servants cannot prevent Thee, nor can the power of those in the lands render Thee powerless. I pray and offer salutations and glorification upon Thy Prophets, Thy Messengers, Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones who cast the world aside, turning to the pavilion of Thy grandeur which the hand of Thy power hath raised for the establishment of Thy throne.</p>
<p>O Lord! They are the lamps of Thy Cause, the suns of Thy wisdom, and the moons in the heaven of Thy providence. I beseech Thee by them, by the light of their faces, by the sweetness of their utterance, by their knowledge and wisdom, by their arising and their aid, by their patience and forbearance, by their humility and submissiveness, and by their steadfastness, to ordain for Thy chosen ones that which will protect them from the arrows of the idolaters among Thy servants and the spears of the heedless among Thy creation. The servant knoweth with absolute certainty that if Thou wert to reveal today unto Thine enemies what Thou hast revealed unto Thy loved ones, the wine of revelation would so overcome them that they would hasten to the ocean of Thy bounty and turn to the Most Exalted Horizon–the station from which the lights of the Sun of Thy countenance have shone forth.</p>
<p>O my God and my Beloved! Thou seest my tears and hearest my sighs. I beseech Thee to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones from the Pen of Thy decree, of adversity and tribulation, lest any of Thy loved ones be saddened in Thy shadow. O Lord! The fire of Thy love hath set the world ablaze and by it the hearts of the peoples have melted. I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name through which mysteries have been revealed and traces have appeared, to make known to Thy loved ones what Thou hast ordained for them by Thy Pen, O Lord of all names and Creator of heaven, and to enable them to attain the station of nearness, sanctity and beauty–the station wherein whosoever reacheth it is not dismayed by what hath befallen or may befall him in Thy path. By Thy glory, O Thou Goal of them that know! The servant loveth to show them what Thou hast ordained for them through Thy bounty, that it may so attract them that they would see every affliction as sweet for Thy good-pleasure and every hardship as comfort in Thy love. However, Thy wisdom hath prevented me from disclosure and Thy fear hath forbidden me from revelation. There is no God but Thee, the Powerful, the Exalted, the Commanding, the Sovereign, the Ruler, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart, thou who art mentioned in the court of my Purpose and your Purpose, my Beloved and your Beloved, and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and the earth! The fragrance of thy words hath revealed to me the intensity of thy longing and the blazing of the fire of thy love for God, the Lord of the worlds. When I drank the water of love and affection from the chalices of thy words, and found the sweetness of thy remembrance and praise of our Lord and your Lord, I betook myself to the Most Exalted Station until I attained the presence of His Countenance. And after gaining permission, I presented that which the nightingale of thy longing warbled upon the branches of thy knowledge. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which the world hath witnessed, saying:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Speaking, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O Ali! The Wronged One hath heard thy mention and thy praise in the letter thou didst send to the servant present before the Countenance, and We have revealed for thee that which hath attracted the hearts of them that are possessed of understanding. The Most Great Proof hath appeared, and the Lord of Eternity proclaimeth with the loudest voice: The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful! Say: This is the Day wherein the Mother of the Bayan and the Mother Book walketh and speaketh, while the people are in doubt and schism. We have sent down the proof and made manifest the way, as a grace from Us. Verily, thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. All things have testified to the Lord of Names, and the Supreme Pen speaketh and saith: By God! The Hidden One hath appeared with the banners of His signs. This is the Day wherein the Ocean of Utterance beareth witness to the Lord of Religions, and the Divine Lote-Tree speaketh and giveth the glad tidings to the servants of this Revelation, through which the horizons have been illumined.</p>
<p>O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of My love! Night and day, the Pen and the Tongue are occupied with the mention of the friends of God, and naught can equal even a letter thereof. Give thou the glad-tidings of the favors of the Lord of Names to the people of Baha, both manifest and hidden, that perchance the sorrows of the world may not prevent them from the Lord of Eternity. I swear by the Ocean of Divine Utterance that the survival of the world and its growth and elevation have been and are for the sake of the loved ones of Truth. The poverty that is now witnessed is the cause of wealth and riches, and likewise weakness is the cause of power and might. O Ali! The lights of the Sun of Justice shall emerge from behind the dark clouds and illumine the world. Convey My greetings to them that drink the choice wine of inner meanings, and say: Death is written once for every soul, and this is an irrevocable decree inscribed by the Supreme Pen in God’s Book. Blessed is the soul whose life and death are for God and occur in His path. All must today observe wisdom and act in accordance with it, and arise to serve the Cause with the utmost joy and fragrance. Man hath been created for love and knowledge. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto that which God, the Lord of all that was and shall be, hath desired. By My life! These two days are not worthy of attention. Beseech God that He may enable all to achieve that which is loved and mentioned in His presence. Say: Drink ye My choice sealed wine in My Name, the Self-Subsisting. It will attract you to a station wherein the conditions of the world will not sadden you, nor will the clamor of those who have turned away from God, the Exalted, the Great.</p>
<p>Say: O friends! Know ye the worth of your stations and preserve them through the Name of God, the Most Glorious. Were the veil to be lifted and less than a needle’s eye of the station of God’s chosen ones be revealed, all the world would turn towards the Most Great Name. Now the manifestations, conditions and ephemeral beings of the earth have prevented the people from the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness. And what is meant by ephemeral conditions and colors are the divines of the age who are the cause of prevention. They are the greatest veil that hath intervened between the lights of the Face and humanity. Would that they had attained unto a drop from the ocean of knowledge! They have borne an ocean of vain imaginings and a city of idle fancies, and in the marketplace of heedlessness they seek customers. Their likeness is as one who hath been named “the Wolf,” whose deeds and allotted time have been set down by the Pen of the All-Merciful in the Tablet of Proof. Say: O friends! In all circumstances fix your gaze upon wisdom and hold fast unto it. Put your trust in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He is with you, hearing what your tongues utter and seeing your deeds. He, verily, is the Witness, the Hearer, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Upon thee be My Glory, and upon them, and upon whosoever was present before the Face and recordeth that which descendeth from the Kingdom of Utterance of his Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful, and upon those who circle round the Throne with manifest sincerity.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! That beloved one hath been and is adorned with the ornament of the grace of God, the Most Glorious. The world cannot equal this bounty, nor can the birds of the hearts comprehend it. Although for some time this evanescent servant hath not been enabled to reply to that beloved one’s letter, this was not due to any lack of sincerity. God, the All-Knowing, is witness and testifier that they are ever before mine eyes and present in my heart. Several petitions from that land attained the Most Holy Court and responses to some were revealed in those same days. Nevertheless, due to consummate wisdom and events occurring in this land and other considerations, there was delay until this time when, by the command and will of the Lord of Oneness, it was sent. God willing, they will attain unto it and drink from the Kawthar of divine utterance - a drink that the vicissitudes of time shall not efface nor remove from sight. All the Prophets and Messengers have awaited this Day, as have the saints and chosen ones, and in the nights and days they have beseeched and implored God, the Most Glorious, that they might be enabled to hearken unto this call and be honored and distinguished by the word of His good-pleasure. Soon will the stations of those souls who have drunk the wine of steadfastness and attained unto the Word of God become manifest and evident in the earth.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about hearing that the Most Great Branch - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps - hath chosen to travel: Yes, all that was revealed by the Supreme Pen upon first arrival in the prison hath become fully manifest and evident. At first arrival in the Most Great Prison conditions were exceedingly difficult, until the Supreme Pen gave the glad-tidings that the prison gates would be opened - whoso willeth may go forth and whoso willeth may enter therein. Until now, each year He hath journeyed in whatever direction He hath chosen and none hath objected; rather, all have shown the utmost submissiveness and humility. Had the existing souls moved according to what God desired, now would the whole earth be seen as one land. The details of this land remain concealed and unmentioned. Knowledge is with God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>You made mention of the Devil of Cyprus having been released, as reported. Would that he were released and would associate with people for a while, so that what is hidden might become clear and evident. Consider, O beloved of my heart, how he was concealed behind numerous veils, city after city, while God, exalted be His glory, was alone in the hands of His servants. Yet when the banner “Verily He is God, there is none other God but Him” was raised in the most exalted station, the buzzing of flies emerged from behind the veil, uttering that which neither the tyrants nor Pharaohs of old had uttered. The tyrants and Pharaohs mentioned in every instance are, according to the explanation of the All-Merciful, the divines of the age who in every era and century have been the cause of people’s hindrance and veiling. I testify that they have gone astray and led others astray. Soon shall they find themselves in the lowest depths.</p>
<p>What you sent arrived and, praise be to God, was adorned with the ornament of acceptance. This evanescent one’s petition is that, should wisdom permit, convey my greetings to the friends in that land who soar on wings of steadfastness in the atmosphere of the love of the Beloved of the worlds. God willing, may you remain firm and steadfast in the Cause of the Lord of all possibility with the utmost power, might, spirit and joy, and may you drink at all times from the living waters. This is the day for the manifestation of refined conduct, goodly character, and pure deeds. We beseech God to adorn all with these and to aid them to achieve in the assemblage of the world that which He loves and is pleased with. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. There is none other God but Him, the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of utterance of our Lord, the Most Merciful, be upon you and upon those with you and upon those whom the affairs of creation have not hindered from the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The path is clear, the way is evident, the proof is manifest, and the banner of the Revelation is raised upon the highest standards. Yet the people remain heedless and veiled. Glory be to God! The fragrance of the divine raiment hath encompassed the world, and the lights of the dawn of His Revelation have illumined the horizons. Yet the unjust people remain heedless and deprived of all, for they are occupied with their own concerns and are far removed and barred from that which is with God. One stands amazed at what hath prevented their eyes from beholding the ocean of inner meanings and their ears from hearkening to the Word of God. The scratching of the Supreme Pen is raised both night and day. For what purpose was life created, and for what day was consciousness brought into being? What was the purpose of sight, and what of hearing? Blessed are they who ponder the Cause of God and discover its purpose. This exalted and blessed word was repeatedly heard from the Tongue of Grandeur, blessed and exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>“O servant! Until they pass beyond the gulf of names, they shall not attain to the ocean of inner meanings. The people of former times throughout ages and centuries were worshippers of vain imaginings, yet counted themselves among the people of unity. They were the most lost among the peoples of the world, yet deemed themselves the most exalted and learned. On the Day of Revelation, the loss of those people became clear and evident to all, for both the learned and the ignorant committed that which no other people had ever perpetrated.”</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O God, Lord of all beings and the Object of all creation! I beseech Thee by Thy all-encompassing knowledge, Thy pervading Will, Thy pre-existing mercy, and Thy all-compelling purpose, and Thy triumphant power, to make known unto Thy loved ones and chosen ones that which will preserve them from all else but Thee and draw them nigh unto Thee. Then inscribe for them in Thy Scriptures and Tablets that which shall be a light unto them in all the worlds of Thy worlds. O Lord! Withhold them not from the rain-showers of Thy grace, nor from the outpourings of Thy days. Adorn them, O my God, with the ornament of steadfastness and fidelity. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all names and the Creator of the heavens. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant, on Friday the 4th of the revered month of Sha’ban, while seated in his place, wondering at the greatness of the Cause of God and contemplating the heedlessness and misguidance of the people of the world, at that moment received a letter from Haifa from Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Taqi, upon him be the glory of God, and in that letter was a letter from you which you had written to him. After seeing, reading and reviewing it, for the sake of God I proceeded to the Most Exalted Station and presented before His presence that which was mentioned and written. Blessed and exalted be His Word:</p>
<p>“Verily, I am the Hearer, and I am the Answerer.”</p>
<p>We make mention of the loved ones of that land, and continue to do so, and We give the glad-tidings of God’s special favors to the people of God. We have, out of wisdom, concealed the names, but in the Crimson Book they are recorded and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen. By the life of God! They have attained unto that which hath no equal and no likeness. Soon shall the world return to nothingness. Every person of insight and understanding hath testified and continues to testify to the transience of all that is visible. However, that which hath been ordained for the people of God shall neither change nor alter. The hand of events shall fall short of its hem, and it shall remain sanctified and protected from the changes of the world. O people of God! Know ye the value of these days and act as behooveth you. Today the heaven of inner meanings is adorned and illumined with the effulgences of the Sun of Revelation. From all directions is heard the cry “The Chosen One hath come,” and from all things is heard “The Lord of the Kingdom of eternity hath come.” The banner of “He doeth what He willeth” is raised, and the standard of “Verily He is the Truth” is unfurled and visible. Blessed are they whom the doubts and intimations of the people of the Furqan and the Bayan have not debarred from the horizon of the All-Merciful. O Muhammad! Hear with thy inner ear the call of the Beloved of the worlds. We beseech God to adorn thee with the ornament of His most excellent names and most exalted attributes, for verily the hosts that aid and assist the Truth this day have been and continue to be goodly and acceptable deeds. Blessed is he who hath been named by the Spirit’s good-pleasure from the Pen of God, the Lord of lords. We testify that he turned towards God and attained His presence while people were in strange slumber. He was present, witnessed, and heard the call of the Lord of Names from His most exalted horizon, and acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur uttered when He came with power and sovereignty. We have mentioned him before in such wise that its fragrance shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. To this beareth witness the Mother Book in its most exalted station. Thus have We sent down from the heaven of grace and bounty that which draweth all near unto the Dayspring of Lights. Convey thou the greetings of the Wronged One to the loved ones of that land and give them the glad-tidings of God’s favors. All are mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and are recorded by the Pen of Revelation. No deed hath been or shall be hidden. All are manifest and evident before His face. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We beseech God to illumine all with the lights of His countenance and to set them ablaze with the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree, that all the peoples of the world may attain unto these twin bounties and arise with perfect steadfastness to promote the Cause of God. O people of God! Today the Sun of Truth is shining and the light of divine unity is manifest and clear. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto the lights of true unity and hath received its portion from the divine fragrances of this Day. Today some among the people of the Bayan are observed to be more lost than the previous parties. We counsel you to preserve the pearls of the love of God, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earths. The glory from Us be upon you and upon those whom the clamor of the deniers hath not kept back from the Lord of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>Glory be unto God! Verses are being revealed like rain-showers from the heaven of divine Will, and He Who conversed on Sinai is seated upon the throne of Revelation and is manifest. Yet the faithless people remain veiled, save for a few. The smoke of idle fancies and the dust of self and passion have prevented the world from recognizing the Lord of Names. Say: O people of the Bayan! Are you content to cling to vain imaginings like the people of former times throughout the ages, and ultimately to occupy yourselves with cursing and denouncing from pulpits the One Who is your Goal and Beloved, and to issue decrees for the shedding of His most pure blood? Take heed, O ye who have eyes to see! Take heed, O ye who have insight! For a thousand and two hundred years and more, each sect has clung to a name and engaged in conflict and strife, until on the Day of Reckoning there appeared from the learned and the ignorant of that sect that which caused the Eye of God to weep and the Pen of God to lament. This evanescent servant conveys greetings and glorification to the friends of God and those who drink the pure wine of truth, and declares that it is binding and obligatory upon all to arise to aid the Cause and to protect the helpless servants from the dawning-places of conjecture, that perchance former vain imaginings might not be renewed and suppositions might not veil the lights of certitude. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Protector over what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning Aqa Mirza Aqa and Aqa Mulla Rida, upon them be the glory of God, mention of them attained the presence of the Goal of the worlds and achieved the honor of being heard. This is what was revealed for them from the Kingdom of utterance of our Lord, the All-Merciful. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed</p>
<p>O Mirza Aqa! A letter reached the Wronged One in prison wherein thy mention was recorded, and it achieved the honor of being heard. These sublime words were revealed from the Dayspring of divine verses: Today the world is illumined with the lights of the True Sun of Divine Unity. Blessed are they whom the doubts of the deluded and the doings of the aggressive have not debarred from turning toward the countenance of the Ancient Beauty, which hath shone forth and is manifest from the supreme horizon. Say: O people! Rend asunder the veils of doubt and uncertainty and turn ye to the horizon of certitude. Reflect upon the former sect and take heed. We beseech God the Exalted to assist thee and those who have believed to act according to what hath been revealed in His perspicuous Book. Know thou the value of this mention, for from it wafteth the fragrance of eternity. Occupy thyself with the praise and glorification of the Lord of the Ancient.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Rida! Hearken unto the call from the prison. Verily there is no God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. The ocean of knowledge hath surged through My Most Great Name, and the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath wafted from the breezes of what hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is he who hath perceived and witnessed, and woe unto every heedless doubter. When thou hearest My call and attainest unto My verses, say: […]</p>
<p>My God, my God! Prevent me not from Thy remembrance and praise in Thy days, and withhold me not from that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones. O Lord! The poor one seeketh the ocean of Thy riches, and the sick one the sea of Thy healing. I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty which hath subdued all things, and by Thy command which hath dominated all names, and by the breezes of Thy days, to assist me to be steadfast in Thy Cause and to arise to serve Thy loved ones. O Lord! Thou seest me turning unto Thee, clinging to the handle of Thy bounty, and holding fast to the hem of the robe of Thy grace. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of what is with Thee, then ordain for me that which shall be a lamp before mine eyes in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Praise and gratitude be unto Him! They have attained unto that which hath no likeness or equal. All the people of S, meaning those who are holding fast to the firm cord of God, and likewise the companions of the Mosque of Bardi - each one hath attained unto the mention of God, glorified be His majesty. This lowly one beseecheth God, glorified be His majesty, that He may cause all to be enkindled with the fire of the Sacred Tree - an enkindlement that neither opposition, nor heedlessness, nor clamor, nor tumult can extinguish. This is the day of remembrance and praise, of steadfastness and faithfulness. The evanescence of the world is evident and manifest to everyone; therefore, let not those possessed of keen vision and hearing be deprived of the Sovereign of the Kingdom of immortality. Ever hath this most exalted Word been heard from the Supreme Pen - may our spirit and the spirit of all in the kingdom of command and creation be offered up for His sake - His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>O people of God! This is the day of remembrance and praise, and this is the day of steadfastness and faithfulness, and this is the day wherein the treachery of eyes and that which the breasts conceal become manifest, and this is the day wherein that which was hidden and treasured in hearts and minds is revealed.</p>
<p>Such utterances have repeatedly been heard. They must appreciate the value of these days and occupy themselves with that which is befitting.</p>
<p>O God of Names and Creator of heaven! I beseech Thee by the name of Baha, and the light of Baha, and the manifestation of Baha, and the mystery of Baha, and the knowledge of Baha, and the mercy of Baha, and the bounty of Baha, and the generosity of Baha, and the grace of Baha, and the days of Baha, and the utterance of Baha, and the wisdom of Baha, to assist Thy loved ones and Thy chosen ones to make up for what hath escaped them in Thy days. O Lord! Thou art the Generous and Thou art the Merciful. Withhold not Thy chosen ones from turning unto the ocean of Thy knowledge, and distance them not from the court of Thy nearness and Thy presence. Thou art He Who hath testified to Thy generosity through all created things, and to Thy grace through all contingent beings. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous. And praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>

<p>O Ashraf! The smoke of heedlessness and the dust of idle fancies have prevented the world from beholding the effulgent rays of the Countenance of the Lord of all beings, and deprived it of the waves of the Most Great Ocean. O Ashraf! Upon thee be My glory. Momentous is this Cause - this is that News of whose greatness all heavenly Books have testified, this is that News at which the limbs of the peoples of the world have quaked and the hearts of the divines and the doctors of law have trembled. Convey My greetings to the loved ones of God. Say: Take ye My choice sealed wine in My Name, the Self-Subsisting, then drink thereof in despite of the people of the Bayan who have turned away from the All-Merciful and disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds. In these days it is most needful to reflect on what hath passed, and is accounted as worship before God, nay rather, is mentioned as the sovereign of all acts of worship. The traditions of old have surely been before thine eyes. The purpose is that in this Most Great Revelation the servants may attain unto true unity. O Ashraf! We have rent asunder some of the veils while others remain as barriers preventing the servants from turning to the Supreme Horizon. By God’s life! Until they pass beyond the gulf of names they shall not attain to the Most Great Ocean. This word hath repeatedly flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, yet the people understand not, the people perceive not, the people know not. This is the Day of God wherein none is mentioned save Him. O Ashraf! From the rustling of the winds is heard “The Cleaver of the Dawn hath come,” and from the whispering of the Divine Lote Tree “The Lord of all creation hath come,” and from the murmuring of the living waters “The All-Merciful hath come.” Where then is the hearing ear, and where the penetrating vision? By God’s life! This is the Day of sight and the Day of hearing, for the call of God, exalted be His glory, is raised from the Supreme Paradise, and the light of the Countenance of the Sun of Being is shining forth from the horizon of Manifestation, radiant and evident. In all ages and centuries the ignorant divines have forbidden and continue to forbid the servants from God, exalted be His glory. In their primary station and first rank, they are in the throes of death - their souls transform light into fire, acceptance into rejection, and knowledge into ignorance. In truth, they seize the human spirit. God protect us and you.</p>
<p>O party of God! Ponder the Shi’ih sect. Through ages and centuries they occupied themselves with mutual execration and denunciation, and when speaking of the Herald, they uttered “may God hasten His relief.” Yet when the dawn of hope appeared and the world was illumined by the radiant splendors of the Sun of Oneness, they all arose in opposition until they committed that which caused the denizens of the cities of justice to weep and all things to lament with great lamentation. Consider the fruit of their deeds: It was the martyrdom of the Lord of the world. The divines issued the verdict for His death, and the people, following them, wrought that which caused the eyes of the Prophets to weep. Reflect upon the beginning of that sect - what calumnies were raised, and how these calumnies became the cause of hatred and were visited upon the Herald. Now again the people of the Bayan with tongues of falsehood and delusion engage in the same utterances. The worthless ones of the world claim to be pearls, and the bats of existence pretend to the station of the sun. Protect the weak in the name of the Strong One of Truth. Guide the ignorant to the ocean of knowledge, that perchance the world may be purified and not again be sullied with the clay of suspicion and fancy. Verses have been sent down from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful equal to all previous Books, and evidences have appeared in such wise that none has excuse for hesitation or denial, unless they wholly deviate from the straight path and deprive themselves of fairness and truth. The Surih of Kings, the Tablet of Ra’is and their like bear witness to what has been mentioned and testify to what has proceeded from the Most Exalted Pen. Today, whatever will be manifested from the deeds of that heedless party is clear and evident to the loved ones of God. They draw nigh unto what was mentioned at the beginning of the Tablet, and they understand. Whosoever attains unto this counts the world as non-existent, let alone the braying of the ignorant mentioned in the Scriptures and Tablets. From Kaf and Ra it appeared. Glory be to God! Despite their ignorance, they have uttered that which no idolator before had ever said. Blessed art thou, O Ashraf, in that thou hast heard the Call and turned toward it and responded on a Day when eyes were fixed in terror, hearts were constricted, the sighs of the lovers ascended, and the tears of the people of the Covenant were shed. The Greater Branch was present before the Wronged One, and We read what thou didst commune with and call upon God, thy Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne. We have answered thee with verses that neither the treasures of the earth nor what the kings and rulers possess can equal, that thou mayest rejoice and thank thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. Say: O people of God! Be as mountains in the Cause of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, in such wise that neither the blasts of allusions nor the storms of expressions from those who have turned away from God, the Lord of all worlds, may move you.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Shukru’llah, that he may hear the call of the Lord of Eternity from the precincts of His Most Great Prison and give thanks unto his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have aforetime made mention of thee through verses from which the fragrance of divine revelation was wafted throughout the world, and at this hour through that which hath brought joy to the eyes of them that are nigh unto God. Take hold of the verses of God with such strength as is bestowed by Him, that neither the might of the people nor the allusions of them that have been heedless of this manifest Cause may hold thee back. Say: O concourse of the earth! Fear ye the All-Merciful, and utter not that which hath caused the denizens of Paradise and they that circle round the Throne to lament at all times. By God! The Revealer of verses hath come with the standards of inner meanings and utterance, calling you unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Cast away what ye possess and take hold of that which God, the Mighty, the Beauteous, hath enjoined. The books of the world profit you not this day save through this Book which speaketh before the faces of the nations by the leave of an All-Knowing Commander. Thus have We sent down the verses and expounded them in truth and dispatched them unto thee, that thou mayest be endowed with insight into this momentous announcement. We counsel thee and them that have believed to show forth supreme steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of the learned have slipped and the hearts of the mystics have been perturbed, save him whom God hath delivered and preserved as a token of His grace - and He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. We have sent down for thee what thou didst desire from ’Amman, as a mercy from thy Lord, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who hath been named Darab, whom thou didst mention in thy letter, that he may remember his Lord, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. We made mention of him aforetime with such remembrance as drew unto it the hearts of the Concourse on High and they that circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn. O Darab! The All-Bountiful remembered thee before and remembereth thee at this hour. Verily He remembereth him that remembereth Him, turneth unto him that turneth unto Him, and answereth every call raised in His love. He is, verily, powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is. Grieve not over aught. In all matters place thy trust in Him from Whose knowledge nothing escapeth. All created things have testified that He is the Truth, the Knower of the Unseen. We counsel thee with that whereby the Cause of God may be exalted - this is among the most excellent of deeds, though most of the people understand not. Hold fast unto the cord of goodly deeds and cleave unto its blessed and mighty hem. Say: O my God and my Lord! I beseech Thee by the mysteries of Thy knowledge and the pearls of the ocean of Thy wisdom, and by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue the lands and didst send down unto Thy servants that which drew them nigh unto the court of Thy holiness and the carpet of Thy companionship, to aid me to be steadfast in Thy Cause. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Faramarz! Do you know who has turned to you, and do you know who wishes to make mention of you? Say: Yea, by my Lord! But the people are in evident delusion. Take hold of the verses of God with His strength in such wise that neither the allusions of the divines weaken you, nor the might of the aggressors frighten you - they who have broken God’s Covenant and His Testament and have pronounced judgment against Him when He came with manifest sovereignty. We make mention of Our loved ones there who have testified to that which God has testified, and have acknowledged that whereto My Most Exalted Pen has moved in this glorious station, and before it in the Land of Mystery, and before that in Zavra, and before that in the Land of Ta. Thus does the Wronged One relate unto thee that thou mayest know and be of them that know. We have stood before all faces and called out with the most exalted call, and summoned them to the Most Exalted Horizon in such wise that neither their clamor weakened Me, nor their hosts and their ranks hindered Me. When the Cause was revealed, a band of wolves emerged from behind the veils and sought Me out. Verily thy Lord is the True One, the Faithful. Thus was the matter decreed, yet most of the people are heedless. O people of God! Be not grieved by anything. Arise to serve the Cause with supreme steadfastness. Thus does the Lord of all being command you, both before and at this time. Upon you be My glory, My mercy and My loving-kindness, which have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>O Ashraf! We have seen thy letter containing the names of those who have arisen to serve the Cause, turning to the Most Exalted Horizon. We testify that they heard and responded, and aided the Cause of their Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Ali! Thy name was presented by the Most Great Branch before the Face in the Most Great Scene. We have revealed for thee that which will gladden thy heart and console thine eyes and the eyes of those who have believed in God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O Youth named Husayn! We made mention of thee before, and We make mention of thee at this time. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Generous. My Most Exalted Pen hath moved to thy name and thy mention in such wise that its fragrance shall never fade throughout the duration of My mighty and impregnable Kingdom.</p>
<p>O Nabil-i-Baqir! The cawing of the crows and the clamor of the transgressors who have cast the Book of God behind their backs in following their own desires have grown loud. They are indeed among the idolaters in the Book of God, the Most High, the Great. Blessed art thou for thy turning unto Him, thy sincerity, thy devotion, thy steadfastness, and thy rising up in service to thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. There hath flowed from the Pen of the Most Merciful the Living Waters for you. Blessed is he who hath drunk thereof, and woe unto the heedless. We counsel you at the end of this Tablet with deeds whereby the Cause of God may be exalted among His servants, that there may be manifested that which was hidden in knowledge and recorded in the Book.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Yusuf that he may arise to that which befitteth the days of his Lord, the Lord of all men. There hath come before Us a letter from one who hath loved Us and drunk the choice wine of Our loving-kindness from the hands of Our bounty, and therein was thy mention. We make mention of thee as a favor from Us, for We are the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Be not grieved by anything. In all matters put thy trust in God, the Lord of Lords. We adorned thee before with the ornament of My remembrance, and this is yet another time, as a mercy from Us which hath preceded most names. He before Whom is the knowledge of the Book beareth witness to this. When thou dost discover the fragrant breezes of thy Lord’s utterance, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast remembered me in Thy Most Great Prison! I testify that Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in earth and heaven.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Qasim! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee from this praiseworthy station, before which every lofty station and every exalted palace hath bowed down in submission. Beware lest thou be veiled by the doubts of the divines through whose rejection the people in every age have turned away from God, the One, the Chosen. Remember thy Lord by night and by day, at eventide and at dawn. He hath made mention of thee in such wise as nothing in all creation can equal. To this testifieth the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree which proclaimeth: There is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. Thus hath the fragrance of utterance been wafted throughout all contingent being. Blessed is he who hath inhaled it, who hath arisen and hath said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Revealer of the verses and Manifestor of clear tokens!”</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and Glory</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who summoned His Afnan to the Divine Lote-Tree, to the Supreme Horizon, to the Ultimate Goal, and to the Most Glorious Vista, and permitted them to turn towards the ocean of His oneness and the depths of the sea of His unity, and aided them according to His will until He brought them into His presence and caused them to hear His sweetest call, and manifested Himself to them through His most beautiful names. Exalted is He Who made them know Him and drew them unto Him. They are those who, when they heard, responded, and drank the wine of reunion from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. The Supreme Pen hath testified to their love, their orientation, their presence, and their arrival at the Most Great Scene, the Station wherein the Lord of Destiny proclaimeth that there is none other God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God of the Afnan and Lord of all existence! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the All-Merciful, to assist them at all times in Thy remembrance and praise, and in arising to serve Thee with wisdom and utterance. O Lord! Thou beholdest them turning toward the horizon of Thy grace, gazing upon the lights of Thy countenance, and clinging to the hem of Thy bounty. They traversed land and sea until they entered the Luminous Spot, the place which Thou didst make the circling-point of Thy loved ones, Thy chosen ones, and the Concourse on high. I beseech Thee to ordain for them that whereby their spirits, bodies, forms, names, and remembrances shall endure throughout the dominion of the kingdom and the realm. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Transcendent, the Single, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who invited the Afnan of the Tree and blessed them with the water of reunion. They turned and were blessed with divine bounties, and through God’s grace a special place opposite the mansion was designated for them. This evanescent servant beseeches and hopes that the Supreme Pen will bestow upon all Afnan the reward of nearness and meeting. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>May my spirit be a sacrifice for your steadfastness! The heart of this evanescent one has melted upon seeing how the servants have deprived themselves of the outpourings of the Most Great Sea, and their heedlessness has reached such a point that they have cast aside the Intended One and followed every heedless and rejected one. All atoms cry out, yet ears are deprived of hearing them, save those whom God willeth. They reflect not upon the vicissitudes and conflicts of the world. At every moment it demonstrates and speaks of its own transience, yet people remain heedless of hearing and seeing it through what their hands have wrought aforetime. They see that they depart and return not, yet they neither understand nor perceive. At every moment they witness members of their own kind returning to dust with complete regret and remorse, yet they remain veiled, proud, and heedless. Verily, this servant, with his tongue and the tongues of the Afnan of the Tree, calls upon God to assist the servants to turn unto Him and to prosper them in that which He loves and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Lord of the Hereafter and of the former life, and in His grasp is the Kingdom of creation. There is none other God but He, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>After praise and laudation this evanescent servant presents that the handwriting of your eminence that was recorded on 10 of S adorned anew the evidences of sincerity. Praise and gratitude be unto Him that time and again this servant becomes enkindled with the fire of love for your eminence and achieves the traces of his pen. O beloved of my heart! When I read what was presented before His countenance, the fire was ignited in my innermost being and the heat of longing seized me in such wise that it moved me instantly. Then I took the letter and ascended with it to the Most Exalted Horizon until I attained the presence and presented what was in it. Then the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which attracted the hearts of those near and the Messengers. He, exalted be His glory, said: “O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory! We have heard thy call and thy lamentation and thy cry in the love of God, the Lord of the Throne and earth, and the Master of the hereafter and the former times. We answer thee with that which God hath made the spirit of life for the Concourse on High and the choice sealed wine for the people of Baha. Verily thy Lord is the Hearing, the Responding. Rejoice in that the fragrance of longing and yearning hath been wafted from thy words. The call of the All-Merciful attracted thee and caused thee to speak that which beseemeth thee on this Day which God hath made its light from the lights of His Face, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who by Thy will made the Tree to speak unto the Interlocutor, and caused the Night Journey to attain unto the Beloved, and honored the heaven with the Spirit, in that Thou hast caused my call to achieve Thy hearing, and my face to be turned to Thy face, and my heart to be a treasury of Thy love, and my eye to observe the wonders of Thy grace, and my tongue to make mention and speak Thy praise. I beseech Thee to assist me at all times in Thy service and to strengthen me in that whereby Thy Cause may be exalted amongst Thy servants and my mention among the Concourse on High through Thy bounty and favor. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Almighty.”</p>
<p>God willing, be occupied at all times with the remembrance of the Beloved. Every remembrance that appeareth from the seat of certitude is as light for the world and as spirit for the bodies of nations. Blessed art thou and My Afnan who have believed in My verses and My sovereignty and My power and My might, and who have drunk the choice wine of My love and have attained unto My presence and appeared before My face and heard My call, and those who have acted according to that which they were commanded in My Book which We sent down from the kingdom of My utterance and the heaven of My bounty. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about reading and reciting the Tablet of Burhan and sending it according to the command to Rajab, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah], all was presented before His presence. He said: “It behooveth him to praise God for having established him in the service of His firm and wise Cause.”</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseeches God to strengthen that honored one at all times to accomplish that which He hath strengthened him to do. And concerning what you wrote about his honor S, we beseech God to make him aware and entirely focused, in such wise that perishable things shall not prevent him from attaining the immortal Kingdom. It is submitted that a few days ago the response to the queries of his honor Aqay-i-Afnan A and H - upon him be all glory - was revealed from the Dawning-Place of Revelation and was sent by command to your honor to be forwarded after perusal. That which is beloved before the Divine Presence today, and incumbent upon the Afnans of the Sacred Tree, is to show consideration to the people of the Twin Luminous Lights. If that matter which his honor Aqay-i-Afnan wrote concerning the payment of debts is carried out, thereafter it would be pleasing to the Afnans to execute general charitable works. This servant submitted this matter because whatever transpires in these days will serve and continue to serve as an example to all, and furthermore, in future ages when people become aware of it they will surely follow this example, and this has been and will be the cause of the expansion of hearts and the comfort of devoted souls. Now if anything is needed for the two sons of the Twin Luminous Lights and their families, it will be sent from this source, but the payment of debts takes precedence in all conditions. What was heard from the Tongue of Grandeur is this: that the honored Afnans should execute whatever they deem advisable in this matter after examining what is recorded in the ledger.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote that if the means for paying the debts of the King of Martyrs were to be arranged all at once and hastily it would be unwise - this was submitted before the Divine Presence and He said: “Yes, what he hath spoken is true. In all matters they must be mindful of wisdom.”</p>
<p>And regarding what you wrote about something being written to his honor S that would give him assurance about what your honor had written to him - God willing this will be done according to your honor’s instruction, but the debts must be determined. By command: mere verbal claims regarding debts are not sufficient - the ledger must be consulted and whatever is recorded therein must be paid. The enemies have accomplished their purpose; they have no further use for the ledger. His honor S should either personally or through someone appointed by him tell that one who hath associated partners with God that people are claiming debts from the martyred wronged one, and the truth or falsehood of these claims is not known - give us the ledger so that after examining it the debts may be paid. The purpose is that your honor should become informed of matters and after being informed should act according to what you have intended and what is beloved before the Divine Presence.</p>
<p>And concerning what was written about the funds, the noble letter arrived and was submitted. He commanded that either a property be built from it or land be purchased so that enduring traces may remain for the senders. Previously these details were commanded to be written and sent to his honor Name of God M - upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God - and then your honor’s letter arrived stating that one portion had been sent and the other portion would be sent the following week, and news of the first portion has also arrived from the land of S, and there is also some land, that is a village, at auction though its matter has not yet been concluded.</p>
<p>And another matter is that, in accordance with wisdom, the Afnan (upon them be all His Most Glorious Glory) were granted leave early. From the day of arrival to the day of departure completed one vahid. They stayed two days in the prison-land and the rest in this land which is now the seat of the Throne. Another matter is that your second prayer mentioned in another leaf was presented before His presence. This is what the All-Bestowing revealed in response: “O My Afnan! Once again have I heard thy mention and praise, and once again have I witnessed thy turning to God, the Goal of all the worlds. Thou hast called upon thy Lord in His tongue and with what He hath revealed from His Kingdom. Blessed is the tongue that hath spoken His praise and the pen that hath flowed with His beauteous praise. He hath indeed ordained for thee what thou didst desire and hath aided thee in His service. He, verily, is the Generous Bestower.”</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about turning towards the Most Holy Land, it was presented. He said that in all circumstances they must be mindful of wisdom. This year a number of Afnan (upon them be the Glory of God) have turned towards it. If they were to turn towards it next year, it might prove contrary to revealed wisdom. By My life, O My Afnan! There hath been written for you from the Supreme Pen the reward of meeting Me and attaining My presence. Thy Lord is, verily, the Truthful, the Informer, the All-Knowing. From the Supreme Pen hath flowed concerning the Afnan that which no one hath known or will ever know. Praise be to God, ye have drunk from the wine of faith, recognition and certitude, and have attained to His mention, praise and service to His Cause. All good is for him who hath drunk the wine of recognition and hath attained the supreme steadfastness in this mighty Cause. In this case, ye have reached the ocean of reunion and drunk from the Kawthar of His presence. The Cause is in His mighty grasp. How many souls who are near are counted among the remote, and how many who are separated are in very reunion. Therefore, if it be deemed contrary to wisdom, movement is not permitted. Praise the Beloved of the world Who aided thee to turn towards Him, to mention and praise Him. In His grasp are the reins of all affairs. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Today the garden of praise is adorned with the names of the friends of God - those whom the possessions of men have not prevented from that which is with God, whom neither the wickedness of the atheists, nor the clamor of the polytheists, nor the tumult of the aggressors has debarred from the Most Great Ocean. Today, whosoever gazes toward the Most Exalted Horizon and clings to the Most Great Handle is accounted as one of the party of God. All friends must strive with utmost endeavor that they may be distinguished and honored among all peoples by this most great title and most exalted word. Behold the Truth with the eye of truth. Leave behind the pool of names created for the worshippers of names, that perchance ye may attain unto the ocean of inner meanings that lies before all faces. This evanescent servant hath ever mentioned the friends of God in the Most Holy Court according to his capacity, and hath sought divine confirmation for each one, purely for His sake. It is hoped that the party of God may in these days, which are attributed to the Truth, attain unto true unity - that they may see naught but the Truth and hear naught but the Truth, for in this Day none but the Truth is mentioned.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God of the seen and the unseen, Who art established upon the throne of Thy Name, the All-Loving! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the dawning-places of Thy revelation to assist Thy people to be steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that they may place the world beneath their feet, ascending unto Thy Most Great Name and turning unto it with their faces, their hearts, their breasts, their eyes, and their very veins, so that no name may remain in all creation save Thy name, O Most Merciful, and no description save Thy description, O Thou through Whom the Sun of Proof hath shone forth from the horizon of certitude. O Lord! Take the hands of Thy loved ones with the hands of Thy power, then preserve them from the evil of the people of the Bayan who have turned away from Thee and from that which Thou hast. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest, and Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter was received, and likewise thy previous letter. After they were read and their contents noted, we approached the presence of the Lord of all beings, and after permission was granted, they were presented before His face and were honored to be heard. His word, exalted be His glory and universal be His bounty:</p>
<p>He is the One Who calleth from the Divine Lote-Tree by His Most Glorious Name!</p>
<p>This is a mention from Our presence to My loved ones and friends who have cast away the world in their longing for My nearness, My meeting, and the recognition of My mighty and great Self. O Mahmud! The All-Loving mentioneth thee from His glorious station that the utterance of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, may attract thee to the horizon of divine knowledge and cause thee to hear what the Son of Imran heard when he entered the wilderness of certitude and heard the call: “Verily, there is no God but I, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” We have mentioned those who have believed, both before and after, as the Tongue of Grandeur in this exalted station doth testify. This is a Day wherein from every word of God’s words a call is raised between earth and heaven. By God’s life! Each one of these words hath a tongue, and each tongue hath a tongue. Were We to expound this station as it truly is, all who are on earth would be thunderstruck, save whom God willeth, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O people of God! Cast aside all else, for He hath come with the truth and hath summoned all to the horizon from which hath shone the Sun of this Revelation, whereby the Hour hath appeared with its signs, and the mountains have been set in motion by the command of One Who is powerful and omnipotent. Beware lest ye be hindered by the croaking of every croaker, or the braying of every brayer, or the doubts of any learned one who hath pronounced against God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Listen to the Divine Call in the Persian tongue. Throughout all ages and centuries, the divines and doctors of the earth have been the cause of rejection and negligence, for the Dawning Places of Revelation and the Daysprings of the Cause, at first, behold all who are on earth at one station and one rank, and summon all from what they possess to what God possesses. These matters conflict with the glory and leadership of the outward divines, thus they arise in opposition, contention and disputation. Even so have they done, and most have attained martyrdom through the decree of those oppressive souls. All corruption in the world hath been and shall be from such souls. Consider Jesus, Son of Mary, Who came with proof from the intention of the worlds - all Jewish divines and idolatrous priests decreed His death. Reflect on the Seal of the Prophets, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - the Christian, Jewish and idolatrous priests arose against Him. Consider the first appearance of the Point of the Bayan, may the spirit of all in the kingdom of the Cause be sacrificed for Him. The chief of all the divines of Persia in those days was Shaykh Muhammad Hasan Najafi. He arose in opposition at first, and afterward the divines of the lands and the heedless dead arose in opposition, and from the pulpits engaged in cursing and reviling the Master of the world. Finally, through their decree that Holy Being was martyred. All know this matter, whether they witnessed or heard it, for several lying, heedless ones trained the people in vain imaginings and suckled them at the breast of idle fancies, and determined His appearance would be from Jabulqa and Jabulsa, such that if a soul spoke of His birth, they would immediately decree his death. In brief, those vain imaginings became the sword of cruelty that fell upon the Dawning Place of faithfulness. Now too, some among the people of the Bayan, whether turbaned or not, have renewed those vain imaginings. May God protect His servants. Consider the Shi’ih sect - for centuries and ages they counted themselves the greatest, most learned and most discerning of servants. The fruit of their deeds on the Day of Recompense was that they arose to curse, revile and slay the Lord [of the worlds]. O people of God! Guard yourselves by the Name of God, glorified be His majesty. Take the cup of detachment and drink it in the name of the Creator of new creation. Stand firm in Him with such steadfastness that all the world shall be powerless to prevent you. Reflect on what hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, that perchance the heedless souls may not prevent you from the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of unity, nay rather, may they be powerless to speak. Today the water of mercy floweth, the Sun of truth shineth, and the ocean of knowledge surgeth. Whosoever attaineth thereunto is mentioned as the most exalted of creation before the Truth. These utterances have repeatedly flowed from the Pen of Him Who is the Manifestation of names and attributes, that all may preserve and protect them, and perchance remain preserved from the whispers of the slinking whisperer and the satans of the earth. The satans at first appear in the guise of friendship and through love lead man to hell. God protect us and you from their evil.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Sarchah! The Lord of the worlds remembers you from His Most Great Prison and gives you glad tidings of that which hath been sent down for you in the Book of God, the Lord of lords. Beware lest the clouds of glory prevent you from the Self-Sufficing, the Most High, Who hath come from the heaven of grace with the hosts of revelation and the standards of inspiration. Blessed is he who ariseth and saith: “O people of the Bayan! Fear God and reject not the truth through that which ye possess. Fear the All-Merciful Who hath come with power and sovereignty.” Beware lest ye act as ye acted in former days. Cast away vain imaginings and idle fancies. The horizon of the Manifestation hath been illumined by the Day-Star of certitude. In former days ye committed that which caused the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise to lament, and those who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide. We make mention of the people of Qaf who witnessed that which God witnessed in the beginning of the Cause when the Light was shining from the horizon of Iraq. That which We promised you in the Scriptures and Tablets hath been fulfilled. We counsel you to manifest supreme steadfastness in this Cause whereby feet have slipped, and to show forth trustworthiness and godliness and that whereby the Cause of God is exalted amongst His servants. We mentioned you before with a mention at whose appearance all other mentions bowed down in prostration. Be as mountains in the Cause of God. Thus hath He Who hath with Him the Mother Book commanded you before and after. O party of God in that land! Beware lest the doubts of the divines or the might of princes hold you back. Abandon the world, placing your trust in God, the Lord of all men. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you and upon those who have arisen and said: “God is our Lord and the Lord of earth and heaven and the Master of the beginning and the end.”</p>
<p>As to your having appointed this servant as your representative for circumambulation and visitation, praise be to God, on behalf of your honor and the friends of that land, I performed the circumambulation of the Point round which circle the near ones and the sincere, and the visitation was also accomplished. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant the reward thereof in this world and the next. Today that which is preeminent with God and is reckoned among the most exalted of deeds is steadfastness in His Cause, and so it shall ever be. God willing, may ye attain unto it.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about having sent numerous letters without receiving replies, the reason for not sending responses has been and continues to be the volume of correspondence. God is my witness that whenever this evanescent one has found opportunity, he hath occupied himself with serving the friends and answering their letters. Communications and missives arrive from all directions, and due to the press of occupation it often happens that responses are delayed by one or two years. The loved ones of God should not be disheartened by such delay, for this servant’s excuse is as clear as the sun. Nevertheless, I seek forgiveness and beseech God, glorified be His majesty, for assistance in fulfilling this momentous task. The command is in His hand - He doeth what He willeth and decreeth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>As to what was written that the friends in that region are dejected and saddened by not receiving news from the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, this matter was presented at the station of “God was, and there was nothing else besides Him.” His blessed and exalted Word: The friends of God, glorified be His majesty, are all remembered and recorded by the Supreme Pen. The outpourings of the True Bestower are manifest and descending at all times. The friends in every land should gather together with wisdom and utterance in meetings and assemblies to read the verses of God, for the verses kindle the fire of love and ignite its flame. However, they must observe wisdom in all conditions, and gatherings of five to nine persons are sufficient. The locations must also be varied, for if they are held in one place, the heedless will become aware and cause commotion. Praise be to God, in all cities and regions the divine verses are present and visible. He is the Quickener of the world and the Gladdener of the hearts of the sincere ones and those near unto Him. Blessed is he who holdeth fast unto them, succeedeth in reading them, and becometh among the helpers of His Cause and the protectors of its reins.</p>
<p>That which hath flowed from the Supreme Pen is sufficient and standeth in need of no interpreter or expositor. This evanescent servant conveyeth greetings and praise to all the friends, and beseecheth for all steadfastness from the Exalted True One. Today is the day of remembrance and praise, for the Beloved of the world is manifest. Today is the day of steadfastness, for the clamorous ones are countless. Today is the day of true unity - whosoever is illumined by its lights is recorded among those near unto God in the Manifest Book. Strive that ye may attain to that which is intended, that ye may drink from the everlasting cup and partake of the eternal chalice, which is the recognition of the Purpose of the world and steadfastness in His Cause. Glory and praise be upon you and upon God’s friends there and in all regions, and upon every man whose foot hath not slipped from the Path. Praise be to God, the Lord of lords and the Master of the beginning and the end.</p>

<p>This is the Tablet of God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting, to the loved ones of God in Khalajabad. He is the One Who speaks in the Kingdom of Utterance.</p>
<p>We have desired to make mention of My friends out of My grace, for verily I am the Ancient Bestower, that the call may attract them to the Supreme Horizon and draw them nigh unto a station wherein naught is seen save God and His signs. Thus hath the Pen spoken while the Lord of Eternity was in His Most Great Prison.</p>
<p>O Baqir! We have sent down verses unto thee and revealed that which testifieth to My loving-kindness, My grace, My bounty, My generosity and My mercy, which have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Give thou the glad-tidings of My remembrance unto My servants and of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My Will, that they may give thanks unto their Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful. We have made mention of them before and adorned them with the tokens of My Most Exalted Pen, for I am the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! We have seen thy remembrance and have remembered thee, and We have heard thy call and have answered thee through this Clear Book, every letter of which beareth witness to the unity of God and His singleness, and to that which hath been sent down in His precious and wondrous Tablet. Give thanks unto God for this most great favor and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds, for having guided me unto Thy straight path and caused me to turn toward Thy horizon while the people were in manifest denial. Beware lest the doubts of those who have denied the Day of Judgment keep thee back. Arise to serve the Cause and remind the people of the verses of God, the Almighty, the Powerful. Thus have the waves of the ocean of utterance surged and the fragrances of the All-Merciful been wafted. Blessed is he who hath found and turned towards Him, and woe unto every heedless and remote one.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Asghar! When thou art illumined by the lights of the Day-Star of utterance and hast quaffed the choice wine of life from the Book of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, say: My God, my God! Nearness to Thee is my hope, beneath Thy shadow is my purpose, in Thy presence is my aim, before Thee is my desire, meeting Thee is the utmost object of my hope, and attaining Thy presence is my wish. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me through Thy grace and mercy, O Thou Most Merciful of the merciful!</p>
<p>O namesake of the Desired One! When the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree hath enkindled thee on the Mount of Utterance and the attraction of thy Lord’s call hath seized thee, say: My God, my God! Thy call hath attracted me, and the fire of Thy love hath enkindled me, and Thy separation hath taken patience from my grasp. Have mercy upon me, O my Creator and my Desired One! Ordain for me to attain unto Thy presence and to stand before the door of Thy grandeur, or decree for me the reward of meeting Thee. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! When thou hast attained unto the Kawthar of immortality which hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen, say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having given me to drink of the Kawthar of Thy utterance and guided me unto Thy path and sent down unto me Thy verses. I beseech Thee by the lights of the morn of Thy Manifestation and the signs of Thy unity and the banners of Thy power to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O My Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Lutf-’Ali and give him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and inform him of that which hath appeared and shone forth in the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. Verily thy mention is a lamp of prosperity for the people of the world and a sign of eternity amidst the nations. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto the heedless ones.</p>
<p>O Siyyid Muhammad! When thou beholdest the waves of the ocean of My utterance and art seized by the fragrances of My verses, say: […]</p>
<p>My God, my God! Blessed is the pathway that leadeth unto Thee and the evidence sent down from the heaven of Thy loving-kindness. Blessed is the earth honored by Thy footsteps, the place that hath been granted Thy presence, and the servant who hath heard Thy call and turned with his heart toward Thy most exalted horizon. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Cause through which the treasures of knowledge and arts were revealed and the river of utterance flowed throughout creation, to ordain for me that which shall make me content with Thy good-pleasure and acknowledging of what hath proceeded from Thy Most Exalted Pen. May I never say concerning any of Thy commandments, “why” or “wherefore.” O Lord! I wish to be submissive, humble and content before the manifestations of Thy power and decree. Thou art the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Siyyid ’Ali! Thy name hath been honored by the glance of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, and He hath revealed for thee that which fire cannot consume, nor dust devour, nor air alter, nor the passage of ages and centuries change. It shall endure as long as My kingdom and My remembrance among My servants endure. Preserve this station through My Name. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! When thou hearest the nightingales of My utterance singing upon the highest branches and the dove of My knowledge cooing from the most exalted station, say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names and King of the Kingdom of eternity! Glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all things! I beseech Thee by the light of Thy Cause, the rustling of the Tree of Thy Manifestation, the flowing of the Kawthar of Thy utterance, and the rushing of the winds in the garden of Thy bounty, to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have offered up their breasts in Thy path, their eyes for Thy love, their spirits for the exaltation of Thy Most Exalted Word, and their bodies for the manifestation of Thy Cause, O Lord of all beings and Master of the throne above and the earth below! Thou art the Omnipotent through Thy will and the All-Compelling through Thy sovereignty. There is none other God but Thee, the Ancient Commander.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of Hasan who hath heard and turned, and desired to drink the Kawthar of utterance from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the All-Merciful, and to arise to serve His Cause and His loved ones through whom the signs of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, have been spread abroad.</p>
<p>O Husayn! The Ancient Beauty turneth unto thee from the Most Great Prison and counseleth thee and His loved ones to justice and fairness, and to trustworthiness whereby the light of glory and detachment hath shone forth throughout creation. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord. He hath assisted thee and honored thee with the traces of His Most Exalted Pen. He is, verily, the Almighty in both the beginning and the return.</p>
<p>O Habibu’llah! The Beloved hath come, yet the servants turned away and the people of the lands opposed Him. The matter grew so severe that the verse of emigration was sent down from the heaven of divine Will. When He departed, the House wept at His separation while the smile of Yathrib appeared at His meeting. O people of God! Behold then remember what befell God’s Messengers and His chosen ones, and what was said concerning Him Who sent them, and what was visited upon Him by a wicked and most lost people.</p>
<p>O Muhammad Ja’far! The Wronged One mentioneth thee for the sake of God that thou mayest find the fragrance of utterance and remain steadfast in a Cause at which every deceiver hath lamented, every heedless one hath been disturbed, the foot of every ignorant one hath slipped, and the fire of hatred hath been kindled in the heart of every remote scholar and every stubborn oppressor. We beseech God to assist thee and My loved ones to remain steadfast in this mighty Cause.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Kazim! Is He Who is remembered in prison or under the will of every oppressor who turned away and denied? Is the Beloved among His loved ones or between the fangs of wolves? The embodiment of tyranny has mounted the throne of oppression and has committed that which caused the countenances of the Most Exalted Paradise to strike their faces in grief. Thus has the matter been decreed in this manifest Prison. Yet his oppression hath not prevented Us from manifesting justice, nor his denial from exalting the Word, nor his polytheism from proclaiming the unity of God, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Neither his might nor his power have deterred Us, nor have his hosts frightened Us. To this beareth witness whosoever hath attained Our presence and every truthful and trustworthy one.</p>
<p>O Ali-Murad! The Beloved of the world lamenteth for Himself and saith: The peoples enter temples, churches, mosques and cloisters in My name, yet they are heedless of My Self, turn away from My presence, and do that which causeth My breast to be straitened and My heart, My Pen, the dwellers of the pavilion of My glory and the tabernacle of My grandeur to lament. Thus hath heedlessness encompassed them from all sides. We beseech God to unveil for them a token of His grace and guide them to the straight path.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Hashim! The call is most loud, yet the channels of hearing are in manifest constraint. Beseech ye God not to deprive His servants. Praise be to God, souls who have accepted the Faith have each been blessed with the lights of the Luminary of utterance and have drunk from the hand of bounty the water of everlasting life. O people of God! Ye are the fruits of the Tree of Knowledge. Let not this exalted station slip from your grasp. Hold fast unto that which is befitting and worthy.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Husayn! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He counseleth all to that which is the cause and source of God’s good-pleasure, exalted be His glory. Great is the Cause. The people of God must at all times fix their gaze upon the horizon of the All-Merciful and beseech Him to protect them from the doubts of the barking ones and the insinuations of the transgressors. We beseech God to protect thee and His loved ones from the evil of those who have broken God’s Covenant and His Testament, who have disputed His verses and denied His proof and His evidence. Verily, He is the Almighty over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Single, the One, the Protector, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-’Ali! When thou hearest the call of God, the Lord of Lords, and drinkest the choice wine of utterance at journey’s end, turn thy face toward God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling, and say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I have cast away all else but Thee, holding fast the cord of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by the fragrances of Thy verses, the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen, and by the Word whereby they who have professed Thy unity have soared to the atmosphere of Thy nearness and good-pleasure, and the sincere ones to the precincts of Thy might and grandeur, to ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for such of Thy servants as are drawn to Thee, who have been so inebriated by the wine of Thy sweet utterance that they have forgotten all else but Thee, turning their faces to the light of Thy countenance. O Lord! Thou seest me gazing toward the horizon of Thy Cause, awaiting the wonders of Thy grace. Send down upon me a mercy from Thy presence. Verily, Thou art He through Whose Name the ocean of generosity hath surged in the world. There is none other God but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-Husayn! The Wronged One calleth aloud from the horizon of the prison, guiding all mankind. Glory be to God! The lights of His Revelation have encompassed the world, and the Cause of God hath appeared manifest as the sun. Yet the peoples of the world remain occupied with their own concerns, deprived and forbidden from the rain of divine mercy and the spring showers of heavenly grace. The conjectures of His servants have prevented them from that which is hidden, and their vain imaginings have debarred them from the Self-Subsisting Lord. Blessed is he whom the people’s turning away hath not hindered, and mighty is he whom the oppression of the servants hath not weakened. If anyone today should deny this Most Great Cause, what other cause could he succeed in proving? Nay, by God! He who turneth away from this manifest and evident Cause hath ever been turned away from the Truth. To this beareth witness My Pen, through whose scratching all things were attracted and moved to utterance: The Promise hath come, and the Promised One hath appeared with manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! The One True God hath come with the standards of His verses and appeared with the banners of His clear signs. Yet the various peoples remain deprived and forbidden from Him. Each faction holdeth fast to a cord and cleaveth to a vain imagination. The colors of the world and the ornaments of the peoples are a barrier that interveneth. Blessed is the one possessed of power who, with the arm of certitude, hath rent asunder the veils and removed the barrier. Throughout the nights and days, the Tongue of Grandeur hath mentioned and continueth to mention the peoples with loving counsels and goodly exhortations, reminding them thereof. We beseech God to aid all and guide them to the Dayspring of lights. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of My handmaidens who have heard the call and turned to the Most Exalted Horizon, and who have believed in Him Who hath come from the horizon of might with the standards of verses. We beseech God to aid them, make them successful, and ordain for them that which will draw them nigh unto God, the Lord of Lords. O My handmaidens and My leaves! Give praise to the Goal of the world in that ye have, in the Most Great Prison, attained unto the word “O My handmaiden!” The ears of God’s loved ones have ever awaited this blessed word, and most have lamented in their longing to hear the word “O My servant!” The reins of grace have ever been and still are in the mighty grasp of God. He doeth what He willeth and is not asked of what He doeth. He is indeed the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing. Blessed are ye, for ye have recognized the days of God’s Manifestation and attained unto the knowledge of the True Goal. Well is it with you and joy be unto you. Beseech ye God that He suffer not His handmaidens to be afflicted with vain imaginings as were the handmaidens of the Shi’ih sect. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, and worthy to answer prayer.</p>

<p>May my spirit be sacrificed for you! The blessed letter that you had previously sent arrived later, bringing joy to heart and soul. Praise be to God, once again the holy spiritual breezes and true intimations of divine companionship were inhaled from the paradise of meaningful love. I was blessed with the jewels of wisdom and utterance, and with exquisite novel expressions and sublime words. That which you confided in God, your Lord, was repeatedly presented before the Throne, time and time again. Once more, countless suns of favor have risen and shone forth from the horizon of grace of the King of Names, specifically for your honor. Blessed be your tongue for having mentioned the Beloved of the worlds and for having spoken with the raptures of those attracted and the melodies of the yearning ones. By God, through these the hearts of the sincere were attracted and the souls of the lovers were enthralled. Regarding the names previously mentioned, unique and wondrous Tablets were revealed and sent for each one. Blessed are they, for their names were mentioned by the Pen of Revelation and the gaze of God was directed toward them from this Great Prison. However, the names were not mentioned in the Tablets, for wisdom’s sake. Your honor may dispense them as appropriate, for each Tablet is specifically for one of those names that were mentioned before the Throne, and their names have been recorded in a mighty Tablet. As for the names of the people of S that you wrote about in your subsequent letter, God willing, they will be revealed and sent later. That beloved one should not mention divine favors to all until the Tablets arrive. And regarding the Tablets that you mentioned Aqa Mirza ’Ali-Naqi had requested, wondrous and sublime Tablets were revealed and sent. Give him the glad-tidings and convey infinite greetings from this evanescent one.</p>
<p>Again it hath been revealed from the right hand of the Divine Command: Some people have been and are requesting special worldly ornaments from the Most Holy Court, and this is exceedingly far from justice and fairness. From the beginning of this Revelation until now, never have We made any intimation to anyone regarding such matters - holy is the hem of the Cause from the mention of such things, much less their practice. It is incumbent upon all to counsel such souls and to declare unto them what cometh from God. The Herald of Divine Unity proclaimeth from the realm of Godhead: O ye loved ones! Soil not the holy hem with the clay of earthly things, and speak not according to the promptings of self and desire. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of the Cause, which shineth with utmost brilliance and light from the heaven of the prison, that they who have turned to the Qiblih of existence must today be sanctified and detached from the seen and the unseen. If they engage in teaching, they must do so with pure intent, in a spirit of complete detachment and independence, with lofty purpose and a sanctified nature, turning to all regions with the fragrances of the All-Possessing. It behooveth such souls to make their provision trust in God and their raiment the love of their Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, that their words may take effect. Those souls who today fix their gaze upon the desires of self and the ornaments of this vanishing world are seen to be exceedingly remote. In most times, there have been no outward ornaments in the court of the All-Merciful, and those who circled round were in great hardship. Nevertheless, never hath there shone forth from the Dayspring of the Supreme Pen any mention of the world or word indicating it. And if any soul was blessed to send a gift to the Most Holy Court, it was accepted as a token of grace, although were We to desire all the riches of earth and take possession thereof, none would have the right to question it. No deed hath been or will be more abhorrent than to beg among people in the name of God. It is incumbent upon that soul and the friends of God to summon the people to the most great detachment and the most great sanctification, that the fragrance of His most glorious Robe may be inhaled from His loved ones. However, the wealthy must be mindful of the poor, for the station of the patient among the poor is great in the sight of God. By My life! No station can equal it save what God willeth. Blessed is the poor one who is patient and concealing, and blessed is the rich one who giveth and preferreth others. God willing, the poor should strive and engage in crafts and trades, for this hath been made obligatory upon everyone in this most great Revelation and is accounted among good deeds in the sight of God. And whoso acteth upon it, the hidden assistance of God will assuredly encompass him. He enricheth whomsoever He willeth through His grace. He, verily, hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Likewise, from the Dayspring of the merciful Will, words have shone forth concerning the protection of souls and the education of the people of the nation and realm, the benefits of which shall reach all who are on earth, were they to hearken to what hath been sent down from the heaven of the Command. At present it is not expedient that these be sent. They remain suspended in the heaven of Will until such time as the divine Purpose shall determine they be sent. The Command is in His grasp. Strive earnestly in the education of souls, for this hath been and shall remain among the most important of all things. And glory be upon thee, O thou who hearest Our call in the remembrance of thy Lord, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Possessing.</p>
<p>According to the Most Holy and Supreme Command, send copies of this letter with haste to the land of [Ya] and Sh and S and other countries. Furthermore, twenty tumans have been allocated to be delivered to you for the children of Ismu’llah-il-Munir-il-Anvar, upon him be the Most Glorious Baha. Furthermore, that person has been given the choice; He said: “If they follow the truth, what is on earth is theirs, otherwise thy Lord is the best of inheritors.” However, it is incumbent upon all to be attentive to their condition at the time of acceptance. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have turned with radiant faces toward the Most Glorious Horizon and have detached themselves from the worlds.</p>
<p>Likewise, from the Dawning-place of the utterance of the All-Merciful, say to the loved ones of God that the first quality of humanity is fairness, and all matters depend upon it. Let them reflect somewhat upon the tribulations and afflictions of this Prisoner, Who has spent His entire life in the hands of enemies, and every day was afflicted with a fresh trial in the path of divine love, until the Cause of God was raised up among the servants. Now if someone should arise and, following his own imaginings, occupy himself secretly and openly with causing division among the people - is such a one to be accounted among the fair-minded? Nay, by His Self, the One Who rules over the worlds! By My life, My heart laments and Mine eyes weep for the Cause of God and for those who say what they understand not and imagine within themselves that which they perceive not. Today it behooveth all to cling to the Most Great Name. There is no refuge or haven save Him. They must unite the people. Should anyone, though he be dwelling in the highest heights of grandeur, utter words that would cause division among the people, divert them from the shores of the Most Great Ocean and turn their attention to any direction save the praiseworthy station which is manifested within human limitations and directions, all existence beareth witness that he is deprived of the breezes of the All-Merciful. Say: Be fair, O people of understanding. He that is unfair hath no humanity.</p>
<p>God is aware of all souls and what they possess. The forbearance of God hath caused people to become heedless, for He doth not rend asunder the veil before its time, and due to the precedence of mercy, wrathful manifestations have been prevented. Therefore most people, being engaged secretly in that which they commit, have imagined God to be unaware of it. Nay, by His All-Knowing and All-Informed Self! All is visible and evident in the mirror of His knowledge. Say: Praise be to Thee, O Concealer of the weaklings’ faults, and praise be to Thee, O Forgiver of the heedless ones’ sins! We forbade the people from following delusion that they might recognize the sovereign Truth and that which appeareth from His presence. Now they are seen to be afflicted with the vain imaginings of their own selves. By My life, they themselves are the deluded ones and perceive it not, and that which they utter is delusion though they comprehend it not. We beseech God to assist all and to make them know Him and their own selves. By My life, whoso attaineth unto His knowledge soareth in the atmosphere of His love and detacheth himself from the worlds, turning not his attention to all who are on earth, how much less to those who speak according to their desires that which God hath not permitted them.</p>
<p>Say: Today is the day of hearkening. Hearken unto the voice of the Wronged One. Speak ye in the name of Truth, and be adorned with the ornament of His remembrance, and illumined with the lights of His love. This is the key to hearts and the polish of existence. He who remaineth heedless of that which hath flowed from the Finger of Will is in manifest error. Righteousness and uprightness are conditions of faith, not difference and corruption. Convey that which thou hast been commanded by the Trustworthy One. The Glory be upon thee, O thou who rememberest My Name, who gazeth toward My direction, and who uttereth the praise of thy Gracious Lord.</p>
<p>At one time, I was present before the Throne, and He commanded: “Write to Ali - O Ali! In certain places, some have outwardly clung to one of the branches of this Divine Tree, seeking thereby to lead weak souls from the shore of oneness to the wilderness of polytheism and error. In truth, these people’s secret purpose was never and is not the branch of the Tree, but rather their own selfish desires. God will reveal what is in their souls and what is hidden in their breasts. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. People must be strictly forbidden from entering such places, and every possible effort must be made to protect the Cause from all directions, lest the evil ones find a way to infiltrate.</p>
<p>O Ali! Strange indeed are the people who each day soar with a different desire and wander in a wilderness. These souls never truly sought the branch, nor will they; rather, they have made him a means for attracting people to themselves. God protect us and you from the evil of such as these. Out of consideration for past mercy, We have not exposed the secret of these souls in this instance, that perchance they might become aware and feel remorse. They have also deceived some village folk with their vain imaginings. If someone could, with wisdom and kindness, guide these weak ones to the shore of the might of oneness, it would be praiseworthy. And the Glory be upon you and those with you.”</p>
<p>This servant submits that since the veil has not been rent in this instance and counsels of loving kindness have been sent down from the Pen of Command to those souls, therefore, as commanded, your honor should also not expose them but speak with perfect wisdom, that perchance they might become aware. Otherwise, God will rend the veil. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Your honor knows that it is now nearly ten months since this petition was submitted, and likewise a petition to his honor the illustrious Nabil (upon him be the remembrance of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful), along with certain passages from the Most Holy Court that needed - indeed, absolutely needed - to be delivered. It was delayed all this time and did not arrive, so it has been sent by a new route. We hope, God willing, that it will arrive soon. Furthermore, two special cloaks have been bestowed, one for his honor Nabil and one for your honor. Upon you be the Glory of God and His remembrance. As commanded, at least once every month, the friends of God in whatever land they reside should, either collectively or individually, read whatever divine utterances have been revealed in this leaf and meditate upon them.</p>

<p>That which was revealed for him who was named Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin around the Throne and among the people of earth was named Zaynu’l-’Abidin, and God made him an adornment for those who worship their Lord among all created things between the heavens and earths.</p>
<p>In the Name of the Most Invincible, Most Exalted, Most Holy, Most Glorious</p>
<p>God testifies that there is no God but Him and that ’Ali-Qabli-Nabil is His servant and His Glory. The days of servitude have passed and the Glory has appeared with a sovereignty that has encompassed all created things. Then the clamor was raised from all who are in the heavens and earth except those whom We protected from the depths of fire and whom We saved through Our grace. Thus were We powerful over all things and predominant over all in the kingdom. Say: O people! The thunderbolt of the Cause has come to you, then the breezes of torment. Beware that you show mercy to [yourselves] and do not dispute with Him Who has come to you with all the signs and Who speaks to you at all times that which the Ancient Being spoke within His breast. The reins of patience and forbearance have been taken from Him and He speaks as He wishes and is not questioned about what He wishes, and verily He has power over all things. And whenever I became powerless before Him: “O my Lord! Have mercy upon my soul and leave me not in the hands of the wicked. You witness how these wolves have surrounded me, yet He does not hear from me and speaks in all things that ‘I am God, there is no God but Me. I created all possible things for the knowledge of My Self and brought beings into existence to attain My presence.’ And then I manifested My Self in truth as a grace from Us, and thus was the matter decreed from the direction of wisdom in truth.” Say: O people! By God the Truth, verily He speaks now and utters what He wishes and wills, and I am not able to prevent Him. And if I try to prevent Him, by God He will not hear from me. Verily He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and He is wise over all things. O people! You cannot slay me with the swords of your rancor. By God, verily your Beloved has manifested me in truth, and all created things bear witness to this, if you be informed thereof. O people! If this be my sin, then ’Ali came to you before with what I have brought you, and before him Muhammad the Messenger of God, and before him the Spirit. Thus has the matter been from time immemorial, if you be aware thereof. Fear God and dispute not His signs, war not against His Self, and deprive not yourselves of the mercy that encompasses the worlds. Then know, O thou who gazest upon the Countenance, that from the thicket of hypocrisy has emerged a band of wolves, and among them is he who cried out within himself: “Is God able to make sweet bitter, or black white?” Say: Yea, by my Lord! Verily He is powerful over what He wishes. He changes all things at every moment, if you be discerning thereof. Nothing in the heavens and earth can frustrate Him. Rather, impotence is an attribute of His servants, while He has ever been sanctified beyond the description of His creation and powerful over all things. And among them is he who said that this Manifestation has appeared too soon, and this is not from God’s practice that has gone before. Say: Yea, by my Lord! This is that innovation the like of which the eye of creation has never witnessed, and thus does the Tongue of Truth speak in the heaven of mighty and lofty glory. Beyond that, say: Verily He has ever been manifest above all things, but you did not recognize Him because the veils of fancy and desire seized you and […]</p>
<p>Every possessor of knowledge beareth witness to this truth: If ye would judge fairly within yourselves and ponder upon those days when the Day-Star of the horizons shone forth from the quarter of Iraq - by God! No eye there was but witnessed from Him what none other had witnessed, and heard what none among all created things had heard. Such indeed was the matter, did ye but know it. God Himself walked among you and spoke unto you with His holy tongue, yet ye knew Him not and remained veiled from His presence. Say: By God! After Me no ear shall hear what was heard from My tongue, nor shall any eye behold what was witnessed in My beauty. But when We found you veiled by fancy and desire, We concealed Our countenance and manifested it not to you, though it was shining like the sun from a glorious horizon.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear God and act not as did the people of the Furqan towards ’Ali. Be ye ashamed before God Who created you for this Day and gave you glad tidings of this Manifestation in all the Tablets through a sublime and exalted Pen. And thou, O Zaynu’l-Baqa, grieve not because of these people and what proceedeth from their mouths. Leave their mention, their selves, and all that pertaineth unto them, then turn thy face unto thy Lord and be steadfast in His path. Take heed lest thou be impatient in the Cause of thy Lord. Rather, speak forth between earth and heaven as We commanded thee before and now command thee again, as a token of Our grace unto thee and unto those who hearken unto thy words concerning God, thy Lord, and who take refuge in the shadow of thy Lord’s protection, remaining faithful to the truth.</p>
<p>Be thankful unto God thy Lord for having purified thee from the defilement of these people. Leave them and all their followers - they are but as a handful of clay in thy Lord’s sight, nay less than that, wert thou to know. Purify thine ear that thou mayest hear what the Dove of the Cause warbleth in all things. By the True God! Then wilt thou hear the call from all that hath been created between earth and heaven. Thus have We rent asunder the veil by Our command, for verily We have power over all things. We have uttered a Word and suspended it in the air - it verily attracteth the essences of all created things while casting aside their accidents. It is the magnet of divine attraction, remembered before the Throne. Through it God separateth light from darkness, the fortunate from the wretched, the rejector from the acceptor. Thus doth He what He willeth by His command, and He is indeed wise over all things.</p>
<p>Know thou that what thou hast called unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds, hath come before Us. We have heard the sighing of thy heart and the lamentation of thy soul, and We have accepted from thee both what thou hast done and what thou hast not done, as a grace from Our presence, that thou mayest be among the thankful. We have aided thee in the Cause and shall continue to aid thee as We wish, by Our command, for verily We are the Commander. We have distinguished thee among all creation through Our love, wherefore thou shouldst glory among the concourse of the worlds. Be thou steadfast in the Cause in such wise that thou seest naught in existence save My hallowed, mighty and luminous Beauty, and beholdest all else besides God thy Lord as dust kneaded with brackish water. They have no mention or name with thy Lord today, save those who have ascended unto God and attained the riches of the heavens and earth, and verily it is for the love of thy Lord and […]</p>
<p>He who was not with Him is indeed the poorest of creatures - to this every discerning and fair-minded person beareth witness. Thou dost not ride upon the camel, nor dost thou disgrace thy Lord, for We have forgiven thee before thy asking and clothed thee in the robe of forgiveness before all creation. Therefore keep this to thyself, then thank God thy Lord for having enabled thee to recognize His Self and to stand before His presence, and for having detached thee from all else besides Him. Verily He is the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Blessed art thou for having entrusted thy affairs to the Best Bestower, the Most Excellent Helper, and the Most Great Trustee. Be thou therefore assured in thyself through God’s might and power, then turn thy face toward the House and say: “O my Lord! Praise be unto Thee for what Thou hast bestowed upon me from the wonders of Thy favors and enabled me to entrust my affairs to Thy Self, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.” Thus doth God single out whom He willeth through His grace and purify his heart from the defilement of the idolaters.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast mentioned regarding rights and such matters, We have verily appointed thee as a trustee from Our presence over all the worlds. All that thou hast done, committed and performed, We have accepted from thee. Grieve not within thyself but be assured through the grace of thy Ancient Lord. There have shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord’s fingers resplendent words and consummate wisdom, which We have sent unto thee that thou mayest witness and be of those who are well-informed. We desired in this Tablet to inform thee of what hath befallen Us, but We have restrained the Pen from mentioning sorrows lest thou be disturbed within thyself and grieve for what hath befallen the Self of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Say: By God! There hath befallen Us what hath not befallen any of the Manifestations of old, and I have been tried in the mouth of the serpent, and none knoweth this save My mighty and beloved Self. At first he desired to slay Me, but when God frustrated his desire, he then arose to calumny, and there flowed from his pen that which he himself witnessed, showing no shame before Him Who created and nurtured him, and taught him morning and evening. When he saw the people were foolish, he committed this sin within himself and was among those who play. Had people possessed illumined vision, they would surely have witnessed in his calumnies his falsehood and would have discovered what lay within his breast of hatred for God and enmity toward Him. But the people do not understand. Would that thou hadst been informed of the essence of his affair, but We have veiled it as a wisdom from Our presence which none comprehend save those who are endowed with understanding. Days passed during which no one could mention what befell God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. We showed patience and concealed matters until God should bring about His purpose. Verily He is the Almighty over all things, doing what He willeth through His command “Be” and it is.</p>
<p>Your letter has reached the Exalted Presence, and as to what you mentioned regarding the transactions that have occurred - what is done is done, be not troubled. You are trustworthy in the sight of God. Arise at all times to aid the Cause. What is beloved in the sight of God today has been and will ever be the recognition of His Being. Whosoever guideth a soul shall have ordained for him an infinite reward. O Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin! God, exalted be His mention, hath not manifested such falsehood in any people as He hath in the people of the Bayan. For in every people, a thousand or more or less years would pass before one would appear by whom the truthful could be distinguished from the false, and the monotheist from the polytheist. But since the people of the Bayan regarded themselves as the most discerning among the peoples of the earth and superior to all creation - to such extent that they considered all others veiled while deeming themselves as having recognized God and among those who had attained His presence - therefore but one breath of test blew, and it caused them all to fall back to the lowest station of previous peoples. Thus they have argued against God with the same arguments that the foremost among the followers of the Furqan used at the time of the manifestation of the Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - and they inflicted upon the Truth what they inflicted. Away with such wrongdoing people! Indeed, they have uttered words and advanced proofs such as no people had ever advanced, even though the veils have not yet been lifted, and what hath been mentioned is less than can be counted in the sight of God. Yet these immature servants have raised such objections as no people had ever raised at the time of a Manifestation. Soon will the tablets of fire spread to all regions. Leave them behind you, then turn toward God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. And regarding the names mentioned in your letter of those who have ascended unto God, verses from the heaven of glory have been specially revealed for each one and sent in a scroll. God willing, it will have reached you and you will deliver them. And the glory be upon you and upon him who hath occupied the seat of independence in this firm and wondrous Cause.</p>

<p>He is God - exalted be His glory, His grandeur and power!</p>
<p>O Name of Bounty! Upon thee be My Baha! The letters from Jinab-i-Samandar, upon him be My Baha, have arrived continuously, yet for some time nothing has been sent from the Most Holy Court. The saplings in the gardens of inner meanings have grown and continue to grow from the Kawthar of divine bounty. The outpourings of the Most Great Sea are the cause and reason for the appearance and manifestation of the crafts and things of the world. By the life of God! The world’s sustenance is from Him. Blessed are they who reflect, and blessed are they who perceive.</p>
<p>The mention of those souls that were in the letters - each one has been blessed with the lights of the Sun of grace and kindness. Their mention has been made and recorded by the Supreme Pen. Blessed are they and theirs shall be a goodly return. We beseech God to assist the loved ones of that land that they may all be occupied with the remembrance of the Lord of all beings in the nights and days, and that they may not in any circumstance exceed the bounds of wisdom. Let them speak with moderation, teach with moderation, and act with moderation. Let Jinab-i-Samandar convey greetings to all on behalf of the Wronged One and gladden them with God’s bounty, exalted be His glory. We testify that he arose to serve the Cause on a day wherein every lion fled, every standing one sat, every tranquil one was disturbed, and every swift one halted. Upon him be the glory of God, His mercy, His grace, and His favor.</p>
<p>O Name of Bounty! Upon thee be My Baha! The letter of Khalil which he sent to thee was noted. We found in it the fragrance of his love and his enkindlement in the Cause of God, the Lord of the mighty throne. He has taken the cup of success and drunk therefrom in the name of his Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. He has arisen to serve the Cause and desired to turn towards the Most Exalted Horizon. We testify that he has fulfilled God’s Covenant and His Testament, and has succeeded in discharging His rights in following His mighty and glorious Command. We have granted him permission, as a mercy from Us, that he may proceed with wisdom to the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness. We thank God, the Lord of the Exalted House. He desired to leave his homeland out of love for the Most Exalted Homeland and longing to attain the presence of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Hear in the Persian tongue: Jinab-i-Khalil, upon him be My Baha, has been granted permission, but after setting his affairs in order and arranging them, and setting in order the affairs of those left behind, for if they wish to travel with the people it would be difficult and very arduous. In solitude there is spirit and rest for those who turn to God, but wisdom does not endorse solitude. One is necessary and two are not forbidden. In any case, the smaller the group, the more spirituality is witnessed.</p>
<p>And Jinab-i-Muhammad-Karim, upon him be the glory of God, has previously been granted permission. We ask God to assist him in what He loves and is pleased with, and to manifest through him what befits His days. Verily, He has power over all things.</p>
<p>O Samandar, upon thee be my Baha! The numerous supplications from his honour the Trustee (Amin) have reached the Most Holy Court, wherein he hath made mention of his honour Nabil-i-Akbar, upon whom be the glory of God and His favours, and likewise mention of his honour Javad and those with him, upon whom be the glory of God, and hath made mention of his honour ’Aziz Khan and his honour Morteza-Qoli and Nuru’llah Khan, and hath sought for each that which leadeth to divine confirmation and success. Praise be to God that all are remembered and have attained unto the grace of God, exalted be His glory. We beseech Him not to deprive any soul on earth of the choice wine of inner meanings, and to bestow from the ocean of His bounty and knowledge a complete portion. The affairs of the world and attachment thereto have prevented mankind from the divine path and deprived them of that freedom and detachment which are among the greatest gifts of the Lord. They are fettered by the chains of idle fancies and vain imaginings until they return to their own station. The recompense for the deeds of the people of the world hath been made manifest in the form of ignorant divines who deny Him. These are they who cut off the way of God and lead His servants astray. Beseech ye God to protect all from the evil of such souls. The fire of these souls is seen to be more fierce than the fire of Nimrod. O Lord! Protect Thy servants from the evil of these people, then assist them with the hosts of deeds and virtues. Verily Thou art the Strong, the Triumphant, the Almighty.</p>
<p>O my Nabil! O thou who gazest toward the Most Sublime Horizon! Today from the rustling of the Sadratu’l-Muntaha was heard this most exalted Word: “Nabil-i-Akbar hath passed by the Most Great Scene. Let him aid his Lord, the Most Merciful, through utterance. By My life! He was created to serve this wise Cause and this mighty News. We, from this station, send Our glorification upon thy face and make mention of thee as We have mentioned thee before and will mention thee hereafter. To this beareth witness the Mother Book in this exalted station.”</p>
<p>O Samandar! Convey with the utmost joy and fragrance the greetings of the Wronged One to the friends in that land. God is the Hearer, the Answerer. The sweet savours of the love of each one have reached the Most Holy Court. Blessed are they whom the earthquake of the Hour hath not disturbed, and whom the might of the heedless ones hath not deprived of God. A soul who is manifestly filled with pride and who boasteth of worldly ornaments is at times consumed with the fire of wrath, thundering and flashing, and at other times his lamentation riseth high due to some slight ailment. Nevertheless he hath not become aware, nor will he become aware until death overtaketh him. At every moment they witness change, decline and extinction, yet they are not mindful. My Most Exalted Pen testifieth that they are among the most lost.</p>
<p>Muhammad-Karim hath arrived and the petitions from that land have reached the Most Holy Court. Each one hath been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and his name hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed are they who in the days of God have attained unto His mention and been adorned with His favours. However, in accordance with wisdom, the response to these petitions hath been outwardly delayed until God shall bring about His decree.</p>
<p>And regarding Jinab-i-Abu’l-Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God, who mentioned Jinab-i-Muhammad-’Ali alif mim - we beseech God to aid him to arise in service to His Cause and to utter that which is befitting for His sake. In all conditions he must observe wisdom. He hath attained the mention of the Wronged One in this Station which hath been named by the Most Beautiful Names. Give him these glad-tidings and convey to him greetings from the Wronged One, that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones.</p>
<p>He hath also mentioned the honored wife of ’Abdu’l-?amid Khan. Her mention hath been before the Holy Presence both in the past and present, and numerous Tablets have been revealed in her name. We have remembered her and continue to remember her, and We counsel her to show forth the Greater Steadfastness in this Mighty Cause. In truth, every leaf that hath clung to the Divine Lote-Tree is mentioned as one of the denizens of Paradise before the Throne. Blessed is the handmaiden who hath attained unto steadfastness and hath drunk the choice wine from the hands of the bounty of her Lord, the Almighty.</p>
<p>O Murta?a! There hath turned towards thee from this Most Exalted Horizon He Whom all have denied save those whom God, thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, hath willed. Behold and remember when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came, all people denied Him save a few souls, and when the Spirit (Jesus) came, the Jews denied Him and perpetrated that which caused the dwellers of the Kingdom to lament. He Who possesseth the Perspicuous Book beareth witness unto this. Take thou the chalice of detachment in the name of thy Lord and drink therefrom, despite those who have denied this Mighty Announcement. Arise to make mention of God and His praise, and give thanks unto thy Lord, the Generous. We beseech Him to cause to appear from thee that which shall diffuse the fragrance of sincerity throughout the eternal kingdom. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>He hath also made mention of the loved ones in the surrounding villages. Each one’s name hath attained unto the hearing of the Lord of all beings and his mention hath been recorded. That honored one should give them all the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness and His infinite outpourings. By night and by day the Supreme Pen maketh mention of the friends, and We beseech God to aid them all to preserve that which hath been bestowed. Today, whosoever hath attained unto the recognition of God must regard this station as great and act according to that which God hath revealed in the Book. Beseech thou God that the veils of these transient days may not deprive His servants from everlasting bounties.</p>
<p>O Samandar! We have mentioned him who attained unto the meeting and ascended the pathway to the Supreme Companion with a mention whose fragrance shall not cease throughout the duration of the Kingdom of Names. Blessed is he, for he is among the triumphant ones. A Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath been revealed especially for his family. Convey to them the greetings from God and gladden them with His bestowals. Until now, numerous letters have repeatedly reached the servant present before the Throne from the name of Jamal, upon him be the Glory of God. They are walking in the way of God and moving in His path. They have turned to certain cities and regions and have succeeded in delivering the Word. We beseech God to aid him through wisdom, for in certain instances, due to eagerness and enthusiasm, the reins of discretion slip from his hands. We have counseled him to wisdom both in the past and present. We testify that he hath arisen to serve the Cause, and We beseech God to strengthen him to hold fast unto wisdom. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>And likewise mention has been made of Ibn-i-Abhar. Blessed is he, for he hath remembered the loved ones of God and described them in such wise as hath made the countenance of the Wronged One beam with smiles in this impregnable fortress. He hath remembered each and all with sublime and glorious mention, and hath sought bounty for each one. Were thou to meet him, glorify him on My behalf and give him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and mercy. Verily the sun of permission hath dawned upon him from the horizon of his Lord’s Will, the Commander, the All-Wise. I beseech God to honor him with this most great favor, to draw him nigh unto Him and to cause him to enter within the precincts of His mercy that hath encompassed all in the heavens and on earth. He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Mention hath been made of Mulla Aqa Baba. We make mention of him from this Spot and give him the glad-tidings of his Lord’s tender mercy. His remembrance hath ever been and will continue to be, God willing, in the Most Holy Court. He and all the people of that village have been honored with the mention of God. Convey My greetings unto him and make him glad with the outpourings of these days.</p>
<p>And We make mention at the end of these pages of ’Abdu’r-Razzaq, son of him who turned toward My horizon, soared in My atmosphere, uttered My praise and glorification amongst My servants, and drank the choice wine of steadfastness from the hands of My bounty in such wise that neither the opposition of the oppressors, nor the clamor of the pharaohs, nor the derision of any polytheist, nor the rancor of any malevolent one could deter him. Upon him and his son rest My glory, My peace, My mercy and My loving-kindness. We beseech God to assist him and those with him in that which shall cause his mention to endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>We make mention of My servants and handmaidens who have found the sweetness of My utterance and have attained unto My days. I am, verily, the Kind, the Bountiful. The splendor shining from the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those whose names thou hast mentioned from My Most Exalted Pen, and upon all who are steadfast and firm.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention once again of the sister of the Most Generous Name, that she may rejoice in God’s loving-kindness, the Mighty, the Loving. Blessed art thou, O My handmaiden, for having turned unto God and attained unto His mention when He came with manifest sovereignty. We counsel thee and those handmaidens who have believed in God to act in a manner befitting this Cause, by reason of which the polytheists have lamented while the faces of those who have turned unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, have been illumined.</p>
<p>We make mention of the wife of the Noble One, who believed on a day when every heedless one turned away rejected. Glorify thy Lord with praise, then remember Him at all times. Verily He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
<p>O Samandar! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. Remember on My behalf those who are with thee and give all the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and mercy that have encompassed all existence. Blessed are they and happy are they and those who have loved thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the seen and unseen. Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have quaffed My sealed choice wine. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.</p>

<p>The Most Holy, Most Impregnable, Most Mighty, Most Glorious He Is</p>
<p>His honor, the esteemed and respected Aqa Mirza Muhammad-’Ali-i-Qa’in, upon him be the Glory of God, may take note:</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath shone forth from His most exalted horizon with the Sun of His Most Glorious Name, by less than a needle’s eye; whereupon the peoples were thunderstruck, the heavens were rolled up, the sun of names was darkened, and the moon of fancy was eclipsed in the kingdom of creation. Exalted be God, Creator of the heavens and Originator of all things, through Whom the Most Great Trump was sounded and the Balance was set up among mankind, and through Whose decreed destiny the letter Kaf was renewed, whereby the new creation appeared and that which was recorded in the Tablets and Books was made manifest. Then did He reveal Himself according to a measured degree, whereupon all created things were set in motion, all contingent beings were attracted, another heaven was raised up, and the intoxication of the wine of yearning seized all existence. How great His Cause and His sovereignty! How mighty His penetrating influence and His power, through Whose most sweet call the names hastened to their named ones, words to their meanings, lights to their dawning-point, verses to their source, utterances to their Book, and knowledge to its ocean! We testify that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been sanctified above whatsoever is mentioned in creation and will ever be holy beyond the praise of all within the kingdom of names. The essence of understanding hath been bewildered in comprehending His Being, and the reality of utterance hath fallen short of attaining the heaven of His praise. He is the Almighty, before the waves of Whose ocean of power might itself hath confessed its weakness, and before Whose manifestation of grandeur and sovereignty all names have acknowledged their impotence. There is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, the Most Glorious, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And afterwards, there hath reached the servant thy letter from which emanated the fragrance of thy love for Our Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth. Blessed is the pen that moveth in His remembrance and praise, and blessed the eye that turneth toward the horizon of His Cause, and the heart that turneth to the heaven of His Revelation, and the breast that is dilated through His love, and the temple that is adorned with the raiment of steadfastness in His days, and the foot that standeth firm in His Cause in such wise that neither the oppression of the tyrannical nor the hints of the world can cause it to slip, and the spirit that soareth on the wings of love in the atmosphere wherein moveth naught save the breezes of the morn of His Revelation. Exalted is this most mighty, most glorious station and this most sublime, most transcendent rank! When I read it and learned what was therein contained, I turned toward the Throne and laid it before the Beloved. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which the tongues of creation and the pens of the worlds are powerless to describe. We praise Him and say in all conditions: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Goal of them that know!”</p>
<p>This evanescent servant hath at all times beseeched and continueth to beseech God - exalted be His glory - that He may strengthen those who drink the choice wine of the All-Glorious and gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon to serve His Cause in the manner that hath been sent down from the heaven of His Will and enjoined upon all. Today it is incumbent and binding upon this servant and all other friends to fix their gaze upon the horizon of the Cause and to act in accordance with whatsoever hath been revealed in the divine Tablets from the Supreme Pen. For if anyone today should act upon all good deeds but fail to attain the good-pleasure of God, those deeds will yield no fruit whatsoever. For example, all have been commanded to teach the Cause, yet this momentous matter hath been made conditional upon wisdom, lest the clamor of the people be raised and become a cause of distress to the weak among the servants. Now if someone should speak among the people such words as would cause an immediate uproar, this would not be acceptable in the sight of God. His mercy hath preceded His servants and His bounty encompasseth the worlds. One must educate the immature through wisdom and utterance and according to their capacity until they reach maturity. Before the martyrdom of Badi’ - upon him be the Glory of God - a number were commanded to speak openly and without concealment among the people. Thus did certain souls become so enkindled with the fire of God’s commanding Word that they spoke of Him with the utmost power, might and steadfastness until they quaffed the cup of martyrdom - upon them be the Glory of God and the glory of all who are in the heavens and the earth. And some were so taken by the sweetness of the Word that they sacrificed their lives by their own hand. However, after the martyrdom of Badi’ - upon him be the Glory of God - the decree of wisdom was sent down from the heaven of God’s Will. Now all are commanded to observe it. We beseech God to aid the loved ones to accomplish that which He loveth and with which He is well-pleased.</p>
<p>As regards what was written concerning Mulla Muhammad-Taqi, upon him be the Glory of God, mention of him was made in the presence of the Throne. These are the words that shone forth from the horizon of the utterance of our Lord, the All-Merciful: Grieve not for him who hath ascended unto God. He is, verily, in the Most Exalted Companion. We have indeed sanctified him, exalted him, and caused him to enter the pavilion of the grace of his Lord, the Holy, the Mighty, the Generous. By the life of God! He who hath believed in God in this Most Great Revelation shall not be lost through death; verily he liveth, abiding in the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Blessed is he who hath ascended unto God and from whom the Concourse on High perceived the fragrance of this Raiment through which the sweet savors of God have been wafted amongst the worlds. We console him who is named ’Abbas and those who are with him through these verses whereby all things have been attracted and the hearts of them that are nigh unto God have taken wing. This is not a day of mourning. Rejoice in that wherewith the All-Merciful maketh mention of thee in this glorious and gracious station.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning the people of Jadhba and which indicated the steadfastness of God’s loved ones, it is known that whosoever today hath drunk of the wine of divine knowledge hath not and will not pay attention to the world and its peoples, much less to the vain imaginings of men and the clamor of those who have denied God, the Lord of all worlds. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to set ablaze all the friends in that land with the fire of His love in such wise that souls that lie dead, buried in the graves of heedlessness and desire, may arise through their burning love and its sweet savors and arise to serve the Cause of God. O my beloved, O my master! Observe how, although the gates of the outpourings of the mercy of the All-Merciful are opened before the face of all, and the world-illumining Sun of His Revelation is manifest and visible above the horizon of grace, yet the people remain heedless, occupied with their own vain imaginings, and deprived and forbidden from this supreme bounty and these infinite favors. This servant marvels at what intoxication hath seized the servants, that even after the Great Cry and the Most Great Trump and the Most Mighty Blast and the melodies of the leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree, they still remain unaware and have not awakened from the slumber of heedlessness. One is bewildered as to what the souls who today forbid themselves from hearing the divine call and this Most Great, divine Revelation could be holding fast to or clinging unto. All atoms testify that the like of this Most Great Revelation hath never appeared in the world; nevertheless, most people cling to the imaginings of the doubtful ones and hold fast to the hem of the suspicious. We beseech God to make all to recognize His Self that pervadeth the worlds.</p>
<p>As to your mention that His Honor Q.A. arrived from the land of Kh. and related that the people there are aflame with the fire of divine love and joyous from the fragrances of the heavenly Tablets - blessed are they, for they are among those who have attained a goodly end. Upon them be the glory of God, His favors, grace and mercy. The world will soon perish and vanish, and what endures for the friends of God is the service that today manifests from them purely for His sake. Blessed are the tongues that speak His praise and remembrance, and the souls who arise to teach His Cause with the wisdom which the All-Merciful has revealed in the Sacred Books and Tablets. However, His Honor should beseech God to make all who circle the divine House of His Cause steadfast and firm, for in the blessed Tablets revealed before, when the Seat of the Throne was in Iraq and the Land of Mystery, He foretold that the croaking of the falsifiers, fabricators and satans would be raised. Likewise, from the first arrival in this Prison until now, these matters have been continuously revealed from the Supreme Pen. We beseech God to protect His loved ones from the spears of the liars, the arrows of the deceivers, and the doubts of the suspicious ones. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>As commanded, I should convey to Your Honor not to forget the counsels given in person. You must conduct yourself with the utmost kindness and compassion, and call the people with wisdom, lest anyone act unwisely and cause disturbance among the weak ones. This matter is most essential. In the previous year, many acted unwisely and caused an uproar among the polytheists. By the life of God, had the friends acted according to what God ordained, you would surely have witnessed the earth transformed. Your Honor especially must be very careful lest any word emerge from you without wisdom and cause tumult. We must all, God willing, in all conditions fix our gaze on the horizon of His good-pleasure and speak that which He has commanded. I hope that through the grace and favor of the Beloved of all possibility, Your Honor will be assisted in carrying out that which He loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p>Regarding those souls who have ascended to the Supreme Companion - this was mentioned in the Divine Presence, and from the Tongue of Grandeur, the seas of bounty and forgiveness flowed forth concerning them. Blessed are they for having attained the recognition of God in their lives, and their mention was revealed from the Supreme Pen after their passing. Every soul shall taste of death - now what station could be greater than for one to attain the love and recognition of God and ascend to Him in His love? Soon the worth of such souls and their stations shall become manifest. Verily He recompenses those who fulfilled His Covenant and remained steadfast in His Cause after the denial of those who disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>What they wrote concerning the Tablets of God that were given to some - this is acceptable, and excellent is what you have done with them. And regarding the other gentlemen who were mentioned in Your Honor’s letter - mention of each of them was made in the Most Holy Court, and the Sun of Favors shone upon all, and He mentioned them all in such wise that it shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. Blessed are they, again blessed are they.</p>
<p>Regarding what they had written that his honor Sahibkar, upon him be the Glory of God, had requested that I kiss the blessed feet on his behalf - a detailed visitation was performed, and He Himself suffices as witness to that. This evanescent one’s entreaty is that you convey greetings to all the gentlemen and friends of that region on behalf of this servant, and say on behalf of this servant: By God, the Truth, this is the Day of remembrance and praise, and this is the Day of joy and gladness, and this is the Day of deeds and unity, and this is the Day of wisdom and utterance, for today whatever one loses, he shall never be able to make up for it. I hope that all will be engaged in service to the Cause with perfect fellowship and unity. Verily, glory be upon those who hold fast to wisdom and utterance, and follow that which they have been commanded in His Holy, Most Holy, Mighty, Wondrous Book. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is God! Praise be to God, the Single, the One, the Unique, Who created man and inspired him with that which manifests the attributes of the All-Merciful, and created Satan, thereby distinguishing between those who have turned to the Supreme Horizon and those who follow their passions. Glorified, glorified be He beyond my mention or the mention of all who are in the heavens and earth. His is the creation and the command. He gives life and causes death, and He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>It is submitted that this servant previously sent a detailed letter in response to your esteemed missive, which was adorned with divine words and verses. As commanded, its dispatch was delayed until two other missives arrived. Praise be to God that all indicated and demonstrated your humility, submissiveness and your arising to serve God’s Cause. Likewise, the missive that you had sent to him who bears the Name of Bounty (upon him be 669 [Baha’u’llah’s] Most Glorious Beauty) reached him, and all were presented before His presence. This is what shone forth from the horizon of utterance: “O ’Ali! We have heard your call, your mention, your prayers, and what the tongue of your heart uttered time after time. It behooves you to hear that which God calls you to, again and again. We have remembered you and remember you that you may arise to serve your Lord in such wise that you may raise the banner of unity upon the highest standards.”</p>
<p>That which you sent, this servant presented before His countenance, and the response descended from the Kingdom of Utterance. God willing, you will arise with utmost endeavor in a manner befitting the days of your Lord. All that hath appeared from you in God’s path and all that you have borne in His love is remembered and witnessed. God willing, you will in all conditions keep your gaze fixed upon and hold fast to that which flowed from the Supreme Pen in the first letter of this servant in attendance.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Face! Look at the earthworms, what they say and what they do. By the life of the Beloved! They have not inhaled the fragrance of the blessed word “Verily, there is no God but Him” in the days of God, nor have they comprehended this station. They walk in the wilderness of idle fancies and wander confused in the valley of vain imaginings. The people of the Bayan are seen to be exactly like the people of the Furqan (Qur’an), nay even more veiled. People of insight consider such souls to be lower than animals. One must at all times strive to educate people purely for the sake of the All-Merciful, that they may become wholly freed and detached from vain imaginings and idle fancies.</p>
<p>It is submitted that your numerous prayers were presented before His countenance, and He showed great kindness, especially in these days when the odor of discord has been lifted and the lights of the sun of unity have shone forth from the horizons of hearts. And concerning what you wrote about Satan and his manifestations, it is quite clear and evident that at all times they cling to the cord of falsehood and speak according to their desires. Praise be to God, all matters have been clear and nothing has remained concealed. The Ancient Beauty outwardly proceeded toward Iraq with a government official, and after that illusory figure, who had been hiding in Kermanshah and its surroundings for some time, arrived and later joined in Hudaybah after departure from Iraq. All the companions who were in attendance witnessed and saw this event. Likewise, all observed that he was unable to speak in His presence. Consider how if the hand of grace had not revealed this matter, how many souls would have been seen drowning in the seas of their own delusions. And afterwards in the Land of Mystery, the Ancient Beauty separated Himself from all and dwelt in a house, and for some time the door was closed day and night - these are matters that seventy people witnessed. Nevertheless, he wrote that he had seen certain things that he could not bear to witness. The curse of God be upon the people who fabricate lies. By this statement he wished to suggest that He had withdrawn, even though all know that the Ancient Beauty had disassociated Himself from him and his like. For a time in Adrianople, He resided in the house of Rida Bey and associated with no one. And after the details became known and the polytheist was distinguished from the monotheist, the matter returned to what it had been. By God, besides Whom there is no other God, the hearts of the pure ones are burning because of his unseemly deeds. This servant has submitted that the first weakness that appeared was in the absence of the Ancient Beauty, when that faithless oppressor took possession of the household of the Primal Point, and when it did not suit his evil nature, he gave it to another vile one. We seek refuge in God from this heinous act. And when the Ancient Beauty arrived, He said that no heedless one had ever committed such an act - in this case what can one say to the people? As even the mother of His Holiness the Exalted One - may our souls be sacrificed for His sake - mentioned to one of the believing women that if they considered him the proof, why did they violate the sanctity? This matter and his other repugnant deeds this servant has mentioned in detail in certain places which should all be before your honor and should be conveyed to the heedless ones so they may become informed. Today, whatever has been revealed either allusively or explicitly regarding the breaking of the idols of suppositions and imaginings, or what this servant has submitted, should be gathered so that all may become aware through its consideration of the evil deeds of that lying infidel. Yes, a few people emerged, including Siyyid Muhammad Isfahani and Mirza Husayn Qumi, and became occupied with promoting delusions. Your honor knows that those souls were never aware of the essence of the Cause and […]</p>
<p>Both persons have claimed before all people that they were aware from the beginning of the Cause - ‘Lost indeed are they who denied and disbelieved in the signs of God.’ For twelve years this servant was with him by command of the Ancient Beauty. He issued a decree for the death of the third believer in Him Whom God shall make manifest. Yet despite this he says what he says. The curse of God be upon the wrongdoers! Would that someone were aware of his recent deeds that appeared in Cyprus. This servant is ashamed to mention them. Now consider: what do the deluded souls who dwell in those lands, who never had any awareness of this Cause, do and say? God willing, through the power and might of the assured souls, the stronghold of the Cause has been and will be protected from the wickedness of malicious deluded souls. Verily He guides whom He wishes to His straight path. Would that people of insight would examine his writings and become aware of his station. He is in manifest error. This day is sanctified from the mention of names and from what has been and is being said. This is the Day of God wherein the Tree exclaims: ‘There is none other God but Him, and He is the Truth.’ His writings appear as dust, and are agreeable to bat-like natures, as they have been and are the cause of darkness and gloom. God willing, that beloved one may in all conditions be, through the assistance of the Self-Sufficient, a promoter, propagator and expounder of God’s Cause. Convey greetings from this evanescent one to all the friends in that land and mention them. Today is a fresh and wondrous day. God willing, may holy and pure souls be adorned with the ornament of supreme steadfastness. Say: O masters, whatever I submit is for God’s sake. Hold fast to the cord of unity in such wise that all the swords of the world would be powerless to sever it. Step one pace higher in the name of Truth until ye behold all the peoples of the world as children playing with clay, and the deniers of the Bayan as earthworms. God willing, may ye be detached from all save God at all times and be focused on the horizon of the favors of the Peerless Friend. Verily He speaks the truth and shows the way. Sovereignty belongs to God, the One, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote concerning Tahmasquli Kh-A, it was submitted to the Most Holy Court, and this is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke:</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most High […]</p>
<p>A remembrance from Him Who was wronged to the one who heard the call and turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon, that he may rejoice and be among those firmly established in this Cause, whereby every edifice hath been shaken, every mountain scattered, and every foot hath slipped save those whom God, the Lord of all worlds, hath willed. All things have been set in motion by the creaking of My Most Exalted Pen, yet the idolaters remain behind a mighty veil. They behold the sun yet deny its radiance, they witness the light yet question its existence. Thus have their souls deluded them. By the life of God! They are among the losers. Blessed art thou for having attained unto My remembrance before and at this time, wherein the tongue of the Prisoner proclaimeth: There is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Take hold of the Book of God with the strength that proceedeth from Him, then read it with joy and fragrance. Then shalt thou find thyself in manifest gladness. We have seen thy turning towards Us, We have turned towards thee, and We have heard thy call and answered thee through this mighty Book. Blessed are the fingers that have written My verses, the tongue that hath uttered My praise, the eye that hath turned toward My horizon, the heart that hath won My love, and the breast that hath been illumined by My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. The glory be upon thee and upon him who hath attained unto this Cause, whereby the back of every distant transgressor hath been broken.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst write concerning the loved ones in the lands of S, Sh and M, it was presented before the Throne. He said: The gaze of divine favor hath been and will continue to be upon all. God willing, may they attain unto the Kawthar of the utterance of the All-Merciful in such wise that the hands of discord shall be powerless to take it from them. At all times remind the loved ones of the All-Merciful lest they be caused to fall by the autumn winds. Their remembrance hath ever been and will ever be before God. We, from this station, send Our greetings upon their faces and upon all who stand firm and steadfast. Gladden them all with divine favors. Verily, He is the best Rememberer and the best Helper. The glory be upon thee and upon them and upon whosoever hath attained unto this mighty station.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all of your letters that have thus far reached this evanescent servant have been presented, and the two petitions from the handmaidens of God in that land which were addressed to the Sacred Household have been received and submitted. They showed the utmost kindness and God willing will send replies. Regarding what thou didst write about the beloved Mirza Haydar-’Ali, upon him be the glory of God, I testify that your honor hath fulfilled thy covenant and pledge. In these days a letter arrived from him requesting tablets for certain individuals. All have been revealed and God willing will be sent either this time or the next. However, they must observe the place and bestow the tablet accordingly. In truth, several interpreters with steadfastness, detachment and eloquence must be found who, with writings suitable to the condition of the people, should proceed to different regions and engage in teaching. The tablet hath encompassed and surrounded the world. Thus have I heard from the tongue of my Lord, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. This servant hath repeatedly heard such content from the blessed tongue. And regarding Jinab-i-Javad who hath ascended unto God, God willing it shall be revealed as befitteth. Blessed is he in his life and blessed is he after his death.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>In truth, it hath never been, nor shall it ever be, fitting to offer praise and mention unto the Truth–glorified be His majesty and abundant be His favors–for the way to that privacy is barred, and the path to that mystery and mystery of mysteries is forbidden. How far removed is this visible assembly from that hidden sanctuary! Where is the path, and where is the way? To make mention with the Pen of that Ancient Being is like an ant making mention of the Desired One, and for the tongue to offer praise unto the Beloved of all possibility is as a mere atom directing one to the Sun, or a drop pointing to the Ocean. Glory be unto God! Even thou knowest that the Unseen is sanctified, exalted, and free from the description of them that witness. And when this matter became clear and evident to them that possess insight and the people of the Most Great Vision, there remained no choice but to turn unto His chosen ones.</p>
<p>A hundred thousand praises and thanks befit and beseem the loved ones and the chosen ones of the Friend, who are detached from themselves and from the world, alive and steadfast through the name of the Desired One. Through tongue and utterance, through pen and deeds and actions, they summon the servants to the Dawning-Place of Revelation and the Dayspring of Inspiration. They speak with their tongues and gesture with their hands, and through movements of brow and head they draw the heedless to the realm of awareness and bestow wakefulness upon them that slumber. These are the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree who have attained unto the most great favor. The hand of bounty hath taken hold of all and established them in the most exalted station. Should “well done” and “well pleased” be uttered throughout the duration of the kingdom and the heavenly realm, they of understanding would not deem it befitting or worthy. Yea, by God! This hath been the will of the Truth–glorified be His majesty. Who can turn Him aside? The banner “He doeth what He pleaseth” hath been raised aloft, and the light of “He ordaineth what He willeth” hath dawned.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose command the Sun of Unity hath shone forth from the horizon of power and the Book hath revealed what lay hidden within it! Exalted art Thou, O our Chosen Lord! Thou art He Who hath manifested unto us Thy Cause, taught us Thy remembrance, made known unto us Thy path, and caused us to hear Thy call and guided us to Thy way. I beseech Thee by Thy pure bounty and Thine absolute generosity to aid Thy loved ones to remain steadfast in Thy love and to act according to what Thou hast sent down in Thy Book. O Lord! The servant, despite his poverty and faltering tongue, desired to make mention of Thy branch who hath attained unto the traces of Thy Most Exalted Pen and whom the tongue of Thy grandeur hath mentioned in the kingdom of Thy utterance. I beseech Thee, O God of the kingdom of earth and heaven, to protect him and ordain for him the good of both this world and the next. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all names and the Creator of the heavens. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O thou whose spirit is a sacrifice unto his holiness! The exalted letter arrived like a spiritual fragrance, perfuming the servant’s gathering, the servant’s station, and the servant’s home. With this withered sapling it did what the breezes of spring do with saplings and trees. After reading it with joy and delight, I approached the Presence where it was presented. This is what the Tongue of Will spoke, exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>“O My Afnan! Upon thee be My Glory! The oppressors sought victory over Us through their might, but We sought victory over them through God, the Strong, the Prevailing, the Powerful. The Pharaohs desired to extinguish the light of God with their armies, the tyrants to shed His blood with their swords and ranks, and the Caesars to erase His traces with their strength, power and might. Thus did their souls entice them to a course of which they were unaware.</p>
<p>“Glory be to God! The Supreme Pen commanded the loved ones day and night to observe what is good and forbade what is wrong. In some Tablets this exalted word was revealed: Blessed is he who heareth and speaketh not. Should they witness good from anyone, they should reciprocate; should they witness harm, they should be patient and leave it to God. Beating, fighting, strife, contention, murder and plunder are the works of the beasts of the jungle of oppression and ignorance. The people of truth must be sanctified and pure from all these. All must strive for the betterment of the world. The world is but one country and mankind its citizens, if they but knew it. All must endeavor with perfect unity and agreement to rebuild it. He is the Counselor, the All-Knowing, and He is the Expositor, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>“Through the mention of the tongue and pen, the world of utterance has been adorned with order and arrangement. Nevertheless, each day they rise up with new utterances and calumnies to perpetrate oppression, and they attribute corruption–God forbid–to holy souls, as you have seen and heard. The blow of the deserters and atheists has struck the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree. The nature of that people is clear and evident to the Afnan. We beseech God to guide all and deprive them not of the waves of the ocean of utterance. The source and origin of the world’s corruption are the divines of the age. Sedition appears through those souls and returns to them. Each party looks to its leaders; if they turn away, the followers turn away. In all matters they follow those people. May God abandon them and slay them!</p>
<p>“Had the Wolf, or Raqsha, or their like been in apparent authority, they would certainly have martyred the prisoners. Yet His Majesty the Sultan, although he suffered harm from the ignorant, nevertheless of his own accord granted freedom to the confined and released the imprisoned. He giveth sovereignty to whomsoever He willeth. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the Powerful, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>“We make mention in this station of thy children and those with thee, and We give them the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon those who love thee and upon those who hearken to thy word in this manifest Cause.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The effulgences of the Sun of divine loving-kindness have ever been and continue to be directed toward your honor. This servant, on some occasions when present before the Face, heard from the Tongue of Grandeur that which caused the spirit to grow and the heart to rejoice and quiver. Assuredly, at some time its effects will appear from the horizon of the world. The bounty and grace are of such magnitude that this servant is incapable of describing them.</p>
<p>As to what was written concerning the destruction of writings - yes, this occurred in Iraq, not here. In those days, by divine command, the sacred writings were consigned to the river of bounty. He said their effects would become manifest throughout all lands. In this land certain discussions arose, and consequently some correspondence, petitions and such were destroyed. The verses of God are preserved - the servant gives you these glad tidings and by your tongue says: “Praise be to Thee, O Thou Desire of the worlds!” Although this people, meaning the people of this age, were not and are not worthy to behold and read these verses, it is a bounty that has become the source of assurance for the servants, and a mercy that bestows spirit and fragrance upon the soul. Otherwise, considering what we deserve, despair would encompass the soul. The servant beseeches his Lord saying:</p>
<p>O God, my Goal, my Beloved! Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful. The power of the world is utter weakness before Thy power, and its riches absolute poverty before Thy wealth. If Thou shouldst deal with justice, woe betide us, and in truth we deserve it. But if Thou lookest with favor, how excellent is our state! One gleam from Thy Name, the All-Bountiful, would sanctify the world from the defilement of transgression, and one drop from the ocean of Thy generosity would purify all peoples. All souls gaze longingly toward Thee and all hearts are under Thy command. Whatever Thou doest is good - Thy love bestows eternal sustenance and Thy wrath confers the blessing of education. O Generous One! Bounty is Thy attribute and impurity is ours. Purify this dust and grant it true repose. Besides Thee there is no refuge, and except Thy path there is no path.</p>
<p>In any case, where am I and where are these utterances? Where was I and where have I gone? What was I saying and what do I now say? The reins have slipped from my hands and the thread is broken. Perchance Thy grace will take a few steps forward and mend these broken and severed things.</p>
<p>As for the letter of Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Husayn, upon him be the glory of God, which you sent - it was presented before the countenance of the Ancient King. This is what was revealed from the heaven of bounty and favor. His word, exalted and mighty is He:</p>
<p>“O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. The servant present here has received what Husayn, upon him be the glory of God, sent to him.” Ask God to make the servants worthy of understanding these days and what hath appeared therein. Today one must act according to this exalted word: “Say: God; then leave them to their vain disputes.” For this is the Day of God wherein none is mentioned save Him. We have not fallen short in anything. The horizons have been filled with the signs and evidences of thy Lord, yet the people neither understand nor perceive. Eyes and ears were created for this Day, but the former were prevented from witnessing and the latter from hearing. Exalted is the Lord of Names, Whom neither the world’s rejection can diminish nor the acceptance of nations can exalt. He is sanctified above all that was and shall be. The glory shining from the horizon of My utterance be upon thee and upon thy mother and upon thy children and upon those who love thee.</p>
<p>Astonishment hath seized all, nay, the very essence of astonishment is astounded, for they have hesitated concerning that Station which is equivalent to all the Books revealed unto the Prophets and Messengers of the past and future, and some have even risen in opposition. Although these things must needs come to pass, for they have been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in God’s Book, yet strange it is that they have rejected this Cause and seek to establish another. O God! If a Cause of such magnitude be rejected, what other cause in the world could be proven? The servant speaketh that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “Leave them to plunge in vain discourse and play.”</p>
<p>Concerning the news, should their honors the Afnan and the most exalted ladies - upon them and upon them all be the Most Glorious Glory - wish to know, they have intended to attain the presence in these days, and this is the third time. We praise God for this, for He hath granted success and confirmation until they attained unto that which is mentioned and recorded in the Books. This evanescent servant ever beseecheth and imploreth the Self-Subsisting Lord that He may cause you to attain unto all good and manifest the means through His all-encompassing and prevailing power. He is the All-Conquering, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Unto their honors the Afnan - upon them be the Most Glorious Glory - who are present in that land, I convey greetings, salutations, and utter nothingness and evanescence, and I beseech and implore them all that in their moments of commemoration and praise of the Lord of Names, they forget not this evanescent one, that perchance I may fulfill this mighty service. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you, upon those with you, upon those who have attained your presence, and upon all who are steadfast and firm. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>It would be appreciated if you would send a copy of this writing, along with my letter, to his honor Aqa Siyyid Husayn - upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah] - as it might cause some to become aware or awaken one who slumbers. There was one item mentioned at the end of your letter regarding a sum and a draft, but no draft was found between the letters. This matter is mentioned solely for your information and nothing else.</p>

<p>He is the Hearing, the Answering One! He is the All-Powerful, the All-Wise!</p>
<p>The Tablet hath been revealed, and from its horizon the Sun of grace and bounty hath shone forth, a favor from God, the Lord of all mankind. The Kawthar of utterance hath flowed from the Pen of the Most Merciful–among the people are those who hastened, took, and drank thereof, and among them are those who turned away and were numbered with the idolaters. The verses have been sent down and the clear proofs have appeared, yet most of the people are in manifest error.</p>
<p>O Zayn! Observe, then mention those who have denied in the land of Sad, having followed the source of vain imaginings instead of God, the Lord of all worlds. They have taken the misleader as their guide–verily they are among the abased ones. They clung to their own desires, turning away from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. These are they who secluded themselves with names and committed that which caused the dwellers of the Most Great House to lament. Verily, they are recorded among the deniers in the Book of God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. Say: By God! Neither the misleader nor any besides him, nor what the people possess will profit you, except through this Book which speaketh before the faces of the world and showeth them the straight and manifest path of God.</p>
<p>O people of Sad! Be fair for God’s sake! If ye deny this Most Great Cause and the Mighty Announcement, by what proof do ye establish your faith in God, the One, the All-Informed? By what evidence did ye believe in the Primal Point, and before Him in Muhammad the Messenger of God, and before Him in the Spirit, and before Him in Him Who spoke with God? Beware lest vain imaginings keep you from the Lord of all beings. Cast away the whisperings of those who have denied God, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Zayn! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness! Observe, then mention him who uttereth that which melteth the hearts of those near unto God. He said that He hath stolen the verses of the Bayan and revealed them in His Name–whereby the tears of the sincere ones were shed. Say: O heedless one! Present thyself before the Wronged One in His Most Great Prison, that thou mayest witness the light of utterance dawning from this luminous horizon. Come into the presence of His countenance, then ask whatsoever thou desirest, that thou mayest behold what thou hast neglected in following the conjectures of the heedless ones, and be assured that the ocean surgeth by itself and for itself, that the light shineth by its own essence unto its own essence, and that the verses are revealed by God’s leave, the Most High, the Most Great. I adjure you by God to present yourselves before the Wronged One with pure intention for the sake of God, your Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. By God’s life! When the verses are revealed, the angels and the Spirit descend to hearken unto the call of God, the Goal of the mystics. This is He Whom God hath made the point of adoration for all who dwell in the highest Paradise, were ye of the fair-minded.</p>
<p>O Zayn! Say: O Hadi! Present thyself for God’s sake that thou mayest witness with thine own eyes the waves of the divine ocean of utterance and observe with thine own sight the effulgences of the Sun of Truth. In these days one can distinguish between truth and falsehood, but after the ascension the helpless people will be afflicted like the previous party. Say: O people of Sad! I speak for the sake of God and beseech you to present yourselves before the one whom ye have taken as the Truth, and likewise before the face of the Wronged One, that the truth may be made manifest unto you and that ye may not be of those who proclaimed “God is our Lord!” yet when He appeared from the dawning-place of His Revelation and the dayspring of His verses, they slew Him with such injustice as caused every Prophet and every trusted Messenger to cry out.</p>
<p>O people of Sad! The pearls of wisdom and utterance that have appeared from the treasury of the Supreme Pen are distinguished like the sun from all else. Beware lest ye veil them with the clouds of your imaginations. Fear God and be not of the wrongdoers. By God’s life! He who hath prevented you from drawing nigh unto the Most Great Ocean stood indeed before the Face and served his Lord. To this testifieth that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of your Lord, the All-Uttering, the All-Knowing. One among the people led him astray until he desired to slay Me. When that which was hidden in his breast was made manifest, he cried out within himself. To this bear witness those servants who were with Us when We migrated from Iraq in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O Zayn! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. Beseech God to assist His servants that they may recognize the truth from all else and attain unto that for which they were created. With utmost humility and supplication We make mention and beseech God to manifest His Cause through souls that are assured, content, well-pleased and fair-minded, and to purify hearts from doubt and uncertainty with the Kawthar of utterance. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. There is none other God but Him, the Lord of the Throne and earth.</p>
<p>O Zayn! We make mention at this time of him who was named Hasan, brother of him who migrated and attained. O Hasan! When thou hearest the call from the direction of Akka and drinkest the choice wine of revelation from the cup of bounty, say: “My God, my God! Unto Thee be glory and praise, and within Thy grasp lies the kingdom of eternity. I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. Thou hast given me to drink of the choice wine of recognition and guided me to the Dayspring of proof. I beseech Thee by the signs of Thy greatness in the heaven of Thy might and the lights of Thy countenance in the kingdom of Thy grace, to make me in all conditions content, praising and thankful for the wonders of Thy generosity and bounty. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali! The Mother Book hath appeared yet the people perceive not, and the Kawthar of inner meanings and utterance hath flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful, yet most of the people understand not. Their desires have prevented them from the horizon of God, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal. Blessed art thou for having acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken from His inaccessible station.</p>
<p>O Asadu’llah! Hear the call raised from the Supreme Horizon and say: “Here am I, O Lord of Names! Here am I, O Creator of Heaven! I beseech Thee by Thy Manifestation and Thy power, and by Thy Mount and Thy Call, to make me content with what Thou hast ordained for me by the Pen of Thy decree. Then write down for me what Thou hast written for those of Thy servants who are nigh unto Thee. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty.”</p>
<p>O Rida! Through the heedlessness of the negligent and the wickedness of the aggressors, the place of the Wronged One has become the prison of Akka. How far is the land of Ta from Akka! Divine love hath attracted and continueth to attract, and He preferreth exile to homeland. How excellent is this most exalted station and this most glorious rank! Blessed are they that attain.</p>
<p>O Mahmud! We have been with thee in all conditions. The Supreme Pen hath testified that thou hast believed in God and His verses, and remembered Him when creation was silent in His remembrance, and turned to Him when the people were turning away from Him. We beseech God to assist thee in preserving His Cause and in protecting what is in thy heart from every thief and every obstinate traitor.</p>
<p>O Ali! The divine call is raised at every moment, yet the people are heedless of it. The world is adorned with the lights of the Sun of Manifestation, yet the servants are heedless and veiled. Blessed art thou and thy brother and whosoever hath held fast to the cord of God, the Strong.</p>
<p>O Rida! The misleader Dawlat-Abadi has again become a Shi’ih and, like the ignorant ones of Iran, has exerted and continues to exert mighty efforts to lead people astray. Say: Present thyself and ask what thou desirest, that thou mayest hear the verses of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Love of leadership hath seized him and debarred him from the path of God, the Lord of all existence.</p>
<p>O Abdullah! Remember the days when thou wert present before the Wronged One, when thou didst behold His horizon and hear His call. Blessed art thou for having turned in His days to His prison and heard that for which most of mankind died in regret. To this testifieth this sealed Book which hath been sent down from the Pen of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! They called the Seal of the Prophets a liar, Moses a sorcerer, and the Spirit (Christ) an infidel. And they have reviled and continue to revile the Primal Point from all pulpits and mosques of Iran. Dawlat-Abadi hath newly raised the standard of hypocrisy, busying himself with the building of Jabulqa and Jabulsa. Say: Shame upon thee, O thou rejected one! Blessed art thou for having cast away the people and taken the choice wine and drunk thereof in the name of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>O Haydar! The polytheists have said that the Lord of mankind hath taken from the verses of the Primal Point and sent them abroad. Say: O people! For the sake of God, reflect! That which hath streamed forth and been revealed from the treasury of the Most Exalted Pen is like the sun, distinct from all else. Be fair, O people, and be not of the wrongdoers. The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon thy wife. Give her glad tidings from the Wronged One and remind her of thy Lord’s verses.</p>
<p>O Hasan-Ali! Say: O Dawlat-Abadi, fear God! The waves of the ocean are His own, and the effulgences of the sun are from His very Self. The Tree hath appeared with countless fruits and the Light shineth with manifest splendor. Present thyself before the Face that thou mayest hear the verses of God, the Lord of the worlds. Verily they descend in truth from the heaven of God’s Will, the Mighty, the Wise. O Hasan-Ali! Spring is a time of lamentation. By God’s life! The hearts of those near unto God have melted from the oppression of the polytheists. A few transgressors who betrayed the chastity of the Point have become leaders and feel no shame. And this Wronged One, Who with conquering power and manifest might arose before all faces and with the hand of might raised high the Cause - Him they count not among the faithful. By God’s life! Noah lamenteth, the Spirit crieth out, and the Primal Point exclaimeth “Woe is me!” Thus have We revealed unto thee that which causeth the most exalted Paradise and the supreme Heaven to weep, that thou mayest know those who have violated God’s covenant and His testament, and mayest be of those possessed of clear certainty.</p>
<p>O Rahim! Divine mercy descendeth at all times. Indeed, were true mercy, upon which the existence of contingent things dependeth, to be withheld for a moment, all would perish and be reduced to nothingness. Today the gate of bounty is opened wide, the ocean of loving-kindness is surging, and the light of grace is shining bright. Blessed is the one who, detached from the world, hath held fast to the cord of love for the Most Great Name. Such a one is the horseman in the arena of sanctity and detachment. Upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of creation. Praise be to God! He hath aided thee to turn and draw nigh, and hath adorned thee with the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>O Nurullah! Praise the Lord of Eternity Who hath enabled thee to attain unto His days and guided thee to the straight path from which most of the world’s people are debarred. His bounty took thy hand, and His grace delivered thee from the clay of idle fancies. Say: […]</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having illumined me with the lights of the Orb of Thy bounty and for having sent down unto me that which hath drawn me nigh unto the shore of the ocean of Thy nearness. O Lord! Adorn my temple with the robe of righteousness and my head with the crown of detachment. Thou, verily, art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of My handmaiden who hath been named Shahrbanu in the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. O My handmaiden! Thou hast attained unto the most great favor, which is the knowledge of God, glorified be His majesty. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this supreme bounty and this great mercy. Then make mention of My handmaiden, the wife of Rida, who hath ascended unto the Most Exalted Companion. Blessed art thou, O My leaf! We bear witness that thou hast attained unto that which most of the women of the world have been denied. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O Hasan! The Lord of the worlds maketh mention of thee from His Most Great Prison. Thou art he who hath attained unto tribulation in the path of God, the Lord of all mankind, and I am the All-Knowing Witness. We have mentioned thee before in such wise as caused the Concourse on High to be attracted, and at this manifest time.</p>
<p>O daughter of Rida! Hearken unto the call of God. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Single One, the All-Informed. He maketh mention of every servant who hath believed in Him and His verses, and every handmaiden who hath turned towards God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>O wife of Isma’il! We have dispatched the hosts of Divine lovers to the place of sacrifice. They hastened until they offered up their spirits in the path of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Thus have We manifested power between the righteous and the wicked. Blessed are they that have attained, and woe unto them that have turned away.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted is His glory in wisdom and utterance!</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down by the Wronged One to him who hath attained unto the days of God and hath quaffed the choice wine of utterance from the hands of the mercy of his Lord, the All-Merciful, that the Call may draw him to the Supreme Horizon and bring him nigh unto a station wherein he shall witness and behold the mighty signs of his Lord. And I am, verily, the True Counsellor.</p>
<p>The ears have been prevented from hearkening and the eyes from beholding the horizon of the Manifestation of the Lord of Names by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought–they who claim knowledge yet oppose Him through Whom the ocean of divine knowledge hath surged within creation. Thus hath the Pen of the All-Merciful spoken in this station which hath been named with the Most Beautiful Names in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>We have heard thy mention and have remembered thee, and have seen thy turning unto Us and have turned unto thee out of Our grace, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>We make mention of Muhammad-i-Baqir and counsel him with that whereby the Cause of God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, may be exalted. Blessed is the soul that hath today attained unto My knowledge and the propagation of My Cause–such a one is assuredly among the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise, as every discerning one doth testify. O people of God! Remember My loved ones and remind them of My verses which have been sent down from the heaven of My Will, for I am the Ancient Sender.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-Husayn! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and say: “My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the oceans of Thy mercy and the showers of Thy bounty and the effulgences of the lights of the Orb of Thy grace, to make me so detached from all else save Thee that I may move only through the breezes of Thy will and speak only through Thy bidding. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.”</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Muhammad that he may rejoice and be of them that render thanks. We have manifested from the treasuries of utterance that which none can reckon save God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Among the people are those who have turned towards Us and those who have turned away, those who have pronounced sentence upon the shedding of My blood and those who have soared in My atmosphere and acknowledged that which My tongue hath spoken–such a one is of the people of Baha in My perspicuous Book. Arise to serve the Cause. He, verily, will aid whomsoever He willeth, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Hear the Call from the precincts of the Prison. It will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgement. The appointed time hath come, and the Revealer of verses hath appeared with the standards of wisdom and utterance, yet most of the people are among the heedless. They have cast behind them that which they were bidden and have taken up that which they were forbidden in the Book of God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of My utterance and hear the creaking of My Pen, arise and say: “Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me while I was in the hands of the oppressors.”</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who is named ’Ali-Akbar that he may inhale the sweet fragrances of his Lord, the All-Merciful, and be of them that have attained. Cast aside what the people possess. The Self-Subsisting hath appeared with a sovereignty before which all who are in the heavens and on earth shall bow down. Beware lest the might of the wicked deter thee from turning toward the Supreme Horizon, or the veils of them that have turned away prevent thee. O ’Ali-Akbar! When thou hearest the Call from the precincts of My Most Great Prison, say: “He hath come Who was recorded by the Supreme Pen and was hidden in the hearts of the Messengers.”</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who is named ’Ali-Asghar and counsel him to manifest the Greater Steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of the mystics have slipped save those whom the hand of divine power hath preserved, from God, the Strong, the Mighty. Hearken unto the Call from the precincts of My Prison and say […]</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Wronged One of the world, for having aided me to turn towards Thee! I beseech Thee to assist me in that which befitteth Thy days and Thy Revelation. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Lutf-’Ali! The Wronged One desireth to make mention of thee from the precincts of the Prison. Knowest thou Who maketh mention of thee? Say: Yea, by my Lord! He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We have desired to make mention of those who have sought to draw nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds, that the rapture of their Lord’s verses may seize them in such wise that neither the hosts of the world nor the might of the deniers - they who have denied God’s testimony and His signs and have led His servants to a miserable destination - shall deter them. Thus hath the Pen spoken, as the Lord of Eternity occupied this exalted station.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Muhammad-Husayn, that he may discover the fragrance of utterance and, turning away from that which the people possess, may turn unto Him Who created him and provided for him, and be of the thankful. Blessed is the servant who hath turned and attained, and woe unto the idolators! Say: In the name of God and by God! Take the chalice of success from the hands of the loving-kindness of the Cleaver of Dawn, then drink in remembrance of the All-Wise. Thus hath the decree come from God, the Commander, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Husayn with verses that have enraptured the hearts of the Concourse on High and those who circle round the mighty Throne. We counsel all with that whereby this Cause may be exalted among the servants. Blessed is every knowing one, and woe unto every heedless and remote one. We have mentioned everyone who hath turned unto God and counseled him with that whereby his station may be elevated. He Who speaketh in every condition beareth witness to this, that there is none other God but I, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Whoso hath attained unto the mention of My Most Exalted Pen hath attained unto all good. Thus have We sent down the verses and manifested the Cause as a grace from Our presence, and I am verily the Bountiful, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>O Habibullah! Hear the call of Him Who hath been imprisoned in God’s path, that it may draw thee to a station that is sublime. He mentioneth him who hath mentioned Him, and His mercy hath preceded all who are in earth and heaven. Verily, He encompasseth all things. The doubts of creation do not hinder Him, nor do the allusions of those who have disbelieved in the All-Merciful when He came with an authority that was mighty indeed. Hold fast unto the cord of the Cause and cling to the hem of thy Lord’s grace. Verily, He aideth whom He willeth with an authority that hath been mighty in truth from all eternity.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Muhammad-Hashim, that mention may draw him nigh unto a station illumined with the lights of the Cause. O Hashim! Remember thy Lord in the night season and in the days. Verily, He heareth and seeth, and He is God, the All-Wise over all things. O people of God! Take hold of trustworthiness by Our command. We enjoin upon you that which shall profit you in all the worlds of your Lord, and God sufficeth as a witness.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabl-Ja’far! Say: My God, my God! Aid me to be steadfast in Thy Cause and to arise to serve Thy loved ones. Thou art He Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate, nor can the tyranny of rulers hinder Thee. Thou doest what Thou willest by Thy power. Verily, Thou hast ever been mighty over the Cause. Blessed is he who hath clung to God’s loving-kindness and His remembrance. He is assuredly among those who are nigh, as hath been recorded in the Book.</p>
<p>O Ali-Murad! The Desired One hath come, yet they who desired to meet Him throughout the nights and days recognized Him not. Thus doth the Mother Book recount unto thee that which hath befallen Him, that thou mayest be endowed with insight concerning the Cause.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who has been named Muhammad-Baqir and remind him of the verses of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Verily, We have remembered those whose names were present before the Throne and have revealed for each one that which will draw him nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Loving. Say: The Word of God will benefit you before your ascension and after it. Of this beareth witness this preserved Tablet through which the sealed wine hath flowed from the Pen of God, the Lord of what hath been and what shall be. Blessed is he who hath turned and partaken thereof, and woe unto every heedless and forbidden one.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Kazim! Thou art in thy home while the Wronged One remembereth thee from the prison. Be thankful and say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Throne, and the manifestations of Thy sovereignty and power, to aid me to serve Thy loved ones who have hastened to the place of sacrifice. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Protector of what hath been and what shall be.</p>
<p>In this moment We make mention of My handmaidens there, that they may give thanks to their Lord in the evening and at dawn, at sunset and in the morning. O handmaidens of God! We speak in the Persian tongue that all may comprehend, in the hope that the fragrance of the All-Merciful’s utterance may enable all to attain to the Kawthar of steadfastness. The clamorous ones lie in wait, and the treacherous watch from their ambush. I beseech God to protect all and to guard them beneath the shadow of His power from the evil of heedless and oppressive souls. He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty. For twelve hundred years and more, the Shi’ih sect were slaves to vain imaginings. Without understanding, they deemed themselves the most excellent of all peoples, yet on the Day of Reckoning they were found to be the most lost among the nations. The people of God, both men and women, must be so firm in the Cause that the deniers of the Bayan and the infidels of the Qur’an will be rendered speechless. Reflect upon the events of the past. Whosoever gains understanding will be preserved from the doubts and vain imaginings of the people of the Bayan - those souls who have turned away from God and set about reviving former delusions. ’Ali-Akbar appeared in the Most Great Presence before the Face and made mention of the loved ones, and there was revealed for each one that which no earthly thing can equal. Were you to reflect even briefly and discover a ray from the Day-Star of God’s grace - exalted be His glory - you would attain to such joy as no sorrow could overtake and no change diminish. For the men have been designated as the people of God and the women as the handmaidens of God. O people of God! Justice is spent, the Sun of equity lies hidden behind clouds due to the oppression of the transgressors. The Truth hath not complained of the oppressors, but rather of those who claimed friendship yet acted in such wise as caused the Supreme Pen to lament. We counsel all to that which befitteth the Day of God. Know ye the worth and station of the divine verses. They have been and will ever be with you, living or dead, and at the time of their revelation all are present before the Face and attain unto them. None knoweth this save God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We beseech God to aid all to preserve that which hath been bestowed, for the fire of denial will consume the tree of what is known. O people of God! From the beginning of the Cause until now, We have stood, without veil or covering, before the faces of all people - kings and subjects, princes and divines - and have invited all to that which was the source of preservation and the cause of eternal life. But when the Day-Star of the Cause shed its radiance, a faction from among the people of the Bayan emerged from behind the veil and rose up against the Wronged One of the horizons. Thus did their souls entice them, and today they are among the most lost in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O Ali! We made mention of thee at the beginning and now mention thee at the end, that thou mayest gather together the party of God in that land beneath the shadow of the Word of God, that they may engage in unity and harmony in the remembrance of the Beloved of all worlds. The saplings that are planted must needs be nurtured until they become balanced and reach maturity. The skilled physician is like the clouds of spring and like the sun: the former bestoweth in measure, and the latter shineth according to its degree. We beseech God to assist thee in serving His Cause, that thou mayest cause all to remember that which hath been sent down in the Tablets. Make mention, on behalf of this Wronged One, of all the loved ones in that region. Some are mentioned by name and others are well-known before His countenance. The purpose is that all have been blessed with the bounty of the utterance of the Beloved of the worlds. Let them know the worth of this supreme bounty and this most great gift. Mirza Baqir - mention of him hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen. God willing, may they attain unto the outpourings of the True Outpourer and arise to serve the Cause. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those whom neither veils nor clouds have hindered from God, the Revealer of verses and the Manifestor of clear proofs.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I make mention of Thee in this moment when the Sun of Thy Divinity hath dawned from the horizon of the heaven of the radiant Sinai of Thy Oneness, and the lights of Thy Lordship have shone forth from the morn of the cloud of the presence of the might of Thy Self-Subsistence, and the darkness of the kingdom hath been illumined by the gleaming splendor of the appearance of the dominion of Thy Cause, whereby the Garden of Paradise was established above the celestial realms of Thy Identity, and wherein Thou didst plant the trees of Thine Essence, and they all bore the fruits of Thy Being, and wherein the breezes of Thy Spirit and the fragrances of Thy holiness wafted, and wherein Thou didst ordain the gems of Thy bounties and the essence of Thy favors, and wherein Thou didst unveil the treasuries of Thy knowledge and the repositories of Thy mystery, and wherein flowed, through its terraces, the rivers of the glory of Thy Life and the seas of the might of Thy eternity and the fountains of the wine of Thy grace.</p>
<p>When Thou didst desire, O my God, to manifest it, Thou didst raise it to the throne of grandeur and majesty, and adorned it with the lights of power and might, and revealed Thyself unto it through Thine eternal Essence, and caused the Sun of Oneness to shine upon it through the lights of Thy ancient Countenance. Thereupon Thy most exalted decree came to pass in the empire of destiny, ordaining the emergence of a Countenance therefrom, that the lights of Thy beauty might be made manifest unto all who are on Thy earth, and the splendor of Thy face unto all who are in the empire of Thy Cause. Then came forth the Maiden who, from time immemorial, had been concealed in the pavilion of sanctity and protection and glory, and in the tabernacle of purity and might and majesty. And there was inscribed upon her luminous brow, with crimson ink by the Most Exalted Pen: “By God! This is a Maiden whom none but God, the Most Exalted, the Most High, hath ever known, and God hath purified the hem of her sanctity from the knowledge of the Concourse of Names in the empire of eternity, and her beauty from the eyes of all who dwell in the kingdom of creation.” And when she emerged from her palace, adorned with the ornament of God, and glanced with one of her eyes toward the heaven, the dwellers of the heavens were thunderstruck by the lights of her countenance and the sweet fragrances thereof, and when she turned her other eye toward the earth, it became illumined with the lights of her beauty and the excellence of her splendor.</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having revealed unto me the wondrous tokens of Thy handiwork therein and the comprehensive signs of Thy power in its creation! Whereupon it soared and ascended, gliding through the firmament as though treading upon a straight line in the axis of the air. And methought the chain of existence was set in motion by the movement of its path beneath its feet. Then did it descend and draw nigh, approaching until it stood before me. I was bewildered by the subtle mysteries of its creation and the wondrous tokens of its fashioning. I found within myself an ecstasy from its attraction and a rapture from its love. I raised my hand toward it and drew aside the veil from its shoulder, whereupon I beheld its tresses, curled and twisted, cascading down its back, suspended and flowing until they reached nigh unto its feet. When the winds stirred them toward the right side of its shoulder, they perfumed the heavens and earth with their fragrance, and when moved toward the left, they diffused a holy, musk-laden scent from their emanations. It was as though by the movement of its hair the spirit of life stirred in the inmost reality of contingent beings and the springs of divine knowledge flowed through the realities of creation. Exalted then be God, its Creator, in what He hath shown me therein! Blessed be God, its Fashioner, in what I have witnessed of the manifestations of power in its beauty and the expressions of might in its majesty! At one time I beheld it as though it were sweet, life-giving, flowing water, coursing through the realities of beings and the depths of contingent things. And I became certain that all existence endured through its endurance and persisted through its persistence. At another time I found it as a fire kindled in the Divine Tree, as though the element of fire were created from a brand of its flames, and the hearts of existence, both seen and unseen, were consumed by its heat and blaze. When it stirred from the subtle mysteries of its yearning and the wondrous tokens of its rapture, it was as though the fragrance of the All-Merciful wafted from the very pores of its garment. Glorified be God, its Originator, its Creator, and its Fashioner! Then it drew nearer until it stood before my face and spoke with a melody like unto the song of the dove in the realm of eternity - as though it spoke with a wondrous melody without word, letter or sound, as though all books appeared in explanation of the song of its wonderful strains. And I understood all meanings in the point of its mouth. When I turned toward it with my entire being, I heard the mention of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious from its melodies, and the name of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted from its songs. Thereupon I became enraptured, bewildered, intoxicated by the wonderful nature of its tune. I raised my hand once again and uncovered one of its breasts which had been concealed behind its garment. Then did the heavens shine with the gleaming of its light, and all contingent things were illumined by its appearance and effulgence. And by its light countless suns shone forth, as though they were coursing through heavens that had neither beginning nor end. Then was I bewildered by the Pen of Creation in what it had inscribed upon its form, as though it had appeared in a form of light in the likeness of spirit, moving upon the ground of the Divine Essence in the substance of manifestation. And I observed that the Maids of Heaven had put forth their heads from the chambers and were suspended in the air above its head, bewildered by its appearance and beauty, and enraptured by the attraction of its melody. Glorified be He Who is its Creator, its Fashioner, its Originator, and its Manifestor! Then was I nearly thunderstruck by what I inhaled of the holy fragrances and found of its wondrous ornaments. It turned to me completely and opened its lips. Lights shone forth from the gleaming of its teeth, as though the pearls of the Divine Command had appeared from their […]</p>
<p>By the ornaments and shells! And she said: “Who art thou?” I said: “A servant of God and the son of His handmaiden.” She said: “I perceive in thee traces of a sorrow the like of which I have witnessed in none other. It is as though I see that all creation grieveth with thy grief, such that I find the lamp of joy extinguished in the niche of thy heart and the lights of gladness cut off from the lamp of thy inner being. I adjure thee by God, besides Whom there is no god, conceal not from me what hath befallen thee. Inform me that I may learn of the truth of thy matter, even if it be but a drop from the overflow.” I said to her: “Ask me not of this, for thou canst not bear to hear from me of my sorrow, even if it be but a letter’s mention.” Then I adjure thee by God, the All-Powerful, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, to withdraw thy hand from me and leave me alone. Return thou to thy place in Paradise and ask not of that which I cannot mention to thee, even if it be but a letter’s hint.”</p>
<p>When she recognized the trembling of my inner being, the yearning of my heart, the cry of my essence, the burning of my bones, the quivering of my skin, the agitation of my soul, and the perturbation of my body, she called out to me saying: “Hast thou a mother who would lament for thee in thy tribulation?” I said: “I know not.” Then she said: “Hast thou a sister who would weep for thee in thy ordeal, or a helper who would assist thee in thy distress and accompany thee in thy solitude?” I said to her: “By my sorrow, which no joy hath approached, ask me not of anything. Look thou upon my heart that what thou seekest may be made manifest to thee.”</p>
<p>She then bowed her head toward my heart and began examining all my limbs, joints, bones, and innards, as though she had lost something and was searching for it everywhere. She searched for a long time and raised her head until it reached my chest. I saw her condition change as she moved her head once to the right and once to the left, at times casting her glance toward heaven with grief and sorrow, and at times observing the earth with bewilderment and regret. I saw her lips move as though she were speaking words beneath her tongue. I inclined my ear toward her and heard a faint moan, as though it emerged from the essence of her being in the depths of her heart. When I brought my head close to her mouth, I heard words that I cannot mention, and were I to mention them, by God, nothing would remain in the kingdom from the burning of their mystery and the scorching of their import.</p>
<p>Thereupon she addressed me, saying: “May thy mother die for thee, O youth! I have witnessed none like thee and seen no soul resembling thee. My bewilderment and sorrow concerning thee have lengthened, and my perturbation regarding thy matter hath increased. Would that I had not been created in the heaven of eternity, nor been born of God’s breath in the holy precincts of the most exalted chambers, nor drunk the water of life from the fountains of glory! Alas for what I have known and witnessed! Alas for what I have perceived and learned! For however much I searched, I found no heart within thee whereby I might learn of thy matter.” When I heard this, she raised her head, and I found her eyes overflowing with blood, as though oceans had appeared from a drop of her tears. When her eyes fell upon mine, weeping seized the reins of patience from her, and she cried out with a cry that I can neither mention nor describe, until I wept with her weeping, and she raised her hands to my shoulders and I placed my hands upon her shoulders and […]</p>
<p>We wept immeasurably, beyond the reckoning of time, eternity past or future, ages or epochs. When she ceased her weeping, she said: “O youth, I adjure thee by Him Who hath subjected the Pens to the grasp of Thy power and established through them whatsoever He hath willed and desired, to tell me what hath befallen thee, that I may be a companion in thy tribulations and one who remembereth thy afflictions in the most exalted Concourse and the most sublime Dominion.” I said to her: “O my beloved, by my life and thine, I am unable to explain to thee what hath touched me, but look thou upon my liver; perchance thou wilt find therein what will suffice thee concerning the most hidden mysteries of my heart.” Thereupon she bowed her head and brought it near to my liver, examining it for a time that cannot be mentioned in the Dominion of Glory nor bounded by the tongue of those who discourse, yet found no trace thereof. Then I saw the earth quake from the trembling of its inner reality and convulse from the palpitation of its heart. She remained thus before time, after time, and above all time. Then she raised her head and cried out with such a cry that the heaven was rent asunder, the earth was cleft, the countries were shaken, and the mountains crumbled. Then she called to me saying: “May thy mother mourn thee, O youth! Thou hast bewildered me by thy matter and destroyed me by thy deed. Never have I found one without heart or liver; how then dost thou remain existing upon the earth and continue to exist in the kingdom?” Thereupon she gazed upon me as a lover gazes upon the beauty of the beloved, and as the loved one beholds the countenance of the lover. Then I found her stirred within herself, as though the breeze of God from this Garment had wafted over her. She turned to me with her outward and inner being and said: “By thy life, I perceive from thee the fragrance of the Beloved! Art Thou the Beloved of the worlds? If Thou art He, why hast Thou changed Thy beauteous countenance? Art Thou from the Concourse of Recognition or from the people of the Bayan? Alas for all created things!” When I perceived her recognition and saw her drawing near, I guided her to my Self. When she recognized me, she cried out, trembled, lamented, was agitated, and fell prostrate in the dust at my feet. When I turned toward her, I found her cast upon the earth, her spirit having departed from her as though it had never been created therein. Thereupon the Maids of Heaven suspended in the air cried out, and the purified Essences in the clouds of the unseen lamented, and they all returned to their mansions and pavilions, abandoning what had been ordained for them and created for their beings. And I remained standing over her body, grieved by her grief and bewildered by her condition and her love. I took her and washed her with the tears of mine eyes and shrouded her in my garments. Then I brought my mouth close to her right ear and gave her glad tidings such as none can hear from me concerning her. When I cast these words upon her, she was stirred by the Word of God. Then she gave me glad tidings which it behooveth me not to mention or even breathe. Thereafter, I laid her to rest in the vessels of holiness and returned her to the place of intimacy, the station which We had ordained for her. Thus do We cast upon you, O people of Paradise, from the vision of eternity. Interpret it for Me, if ye be interpreters of the Spirit’s vision.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Impregnable, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>The ambrosial fragrance emanating from the pen of thy love, O beloved of my heart and soul, hath, in this most auspicious hour, perfumed the garden of my heart. Blessed be thy hand and arm, for thou hast brought joy to this wanderer through the influence of thy gem-scattering pen, and hast bestowed complete delight through the glad tidings of thy well-being. Happy art thou for having given the heart to drink from the cup of thy remembrance and bestowed upon it the bounty of thy connection, for correspondence, in the estimation of them that have recognized the truth, is the perfection of communion.</p>
<p>That which thou didst submit to the Most Holy Court was presented by this evanescent servant in detail before the presence of the Self-Sufficing Lord on one of the nights when a group of them that circle round the Throne were present. The breezes of grace and the winds of divine mercy are wafting with such intensity that neither can my motionless pen describe it, nor my weary tongue express it, nor can anyone comprehend it save His exalted Self. Exalted, immeasurably exalted, is His grace that hath encompassed all possibility and His beneficence that is witnessed at all times.</p>
<p>Since at the time of the return of thy brother - upon him be the everlasting glory of God - a most mighty Tablet was specifically revealed for thee from the Most Holy Heaven and dispatched, the response to the supplication thou didst submit shall, according to His command, be sent subsequently.</p>
<p>Regarding thy brother, while he was in Alexandria, on one of the days, suddenly a Tablet was revealed from the heaven of oneness explicitly confirming the command for his return, and likewise he had been previously commanded to return. However, according to what he had written, his affairs were not yet concluded. He will present the details thereof to thee in person. Blessed is he for having attained the presence of God, for having drunk the wine of reunion from the hands of His mercy, and for having heard the call of God with his own ears.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is much that this servant has continually wished to submit to your honor, but due to the multitude of occupations and writing, there has not been opportunity to properly explain and mention the matters concealed in the heart. Some time ago this servant was present before the Throne and a Tablet was revealed to one of the beloved ones. Among its contents was a command that someone should proceed to Gilan for the purpose of reminding the people. This servant perceived that within this decree was concealed a wisdom and hidden a mystery, but did not dare to inquire about its wisdom from the Most Holy Presence. However, I remained thoughtful about what would appear, until Jinab-i-Aqa Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God, arrived. This servant specifically asked him what news he had from Gilan. He did not mention anything at first, but after insistence briefly mentioned something, though nothing was understood from it, until Jinab-i-Aqa Jamal, upon him be the Glory of God, arrived and he himself, before being asked, detailed the events occurring in that land. This evanescent servant was greatly amazed and astonished at how much delusion had overtaken the world and how much the suppositions of heedless souls had encompassed the people. Despite the fact that in most Tablets revealed from the heaven of Will, the people were informed that in most lands the birds of darkness and manifestations of the calf would appear, and all were explicitly commanded to avoid them, nevertheless when someone who was the most wicked of people and observably and inwardly among the basest of servants merely uttered a croak, a group followed him. And likewise another evil one said what he said and did what he did, such that the pen is unable to move in describing his words and deeds. O beloved of my soul, reflect a little on what is the cause of these matters and what is the reason. This servant submits that the cause of such matters has been illusory investigations and interpretations that neither nourish nor satisfy, with which some occupy themselves day and night. Such investigations and detestable, unclean mysticisms have been and continue to be the cause and reason for the emergence of such false claims. Jinab-i-Aqa Jamal mentioned two statements that truly melted the heart. Among them he said that he met Aqa Siyyid Javad-i-Qazvini who stated that “I have no issue with the original Cause, but what can I do when I observe that these people have established such an apparatus that each day they prostrate themselves before someone and worship a calf.” He also mentioned that there were several Shaykhis in Rasht who showed complete acceptance, but after the events that occurred in that land became extinguished and veiled. And they mentioned that “We observe that they speak of and remember someone with complete praise, glorification and exaltation, and then they say that this filthy, unclean person is him, and for this reason they have become extinguished.” In any case, we beseech God to grant some of the people of that land a draught from the cup of justice. Whatever was revealed from the heaven of divine Will and […]</p>
<p>With perfect counsel, mercy, providence and kindness did they admonish those souls, yet thus far no effect hath been observed, for they remain occupied with vain investigations. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Observe ye, had those souls been engaged in educating people according to that which God hath willed, ye would now behold the entire earth as a piece of paradise. Reflect ye somewhat on these incidents that occurred in Rasht - observe how much they have caused the Cause of God to be wasted among the people. And it is strange that no one arose through the power of God like unto a flame of fire to confront those two wicked pretenders. We beseech God to raise up against them one who will show them no mercy.</p>
<p>When the letter reached this point, I turned toward the Most Holy Court, and after gaining entry, He bid me stand and asked, “With what matter art thou occupied?” I submitted that I was writing a petition to Samandar. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur and Glory spoke, addressing this evanescent servant:</p>
<p>Write unto him: O Samandar, O Samandar! It behooveth thee to manifest that which is worthy of this name We have given thee. Be as fire unto the vain imaginings and idle fancies of those who are lost in delusion. Beware lest thou be veiled by the schemes of every schemer, the craftiness of every crafty one, and the arguments of every sinful doubter. O Samandar! This is the Day wherein the very stone proclaimeth “The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of Destiny,” wherein the very clod crieth out “The Most Great Vision hath appeared,” wherein the plains declare “Power belongeth to the Cleaver of Dawn,” and the hills proclaim “Sovereignty belongeth to the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.” The rapture of the All-Merciful’s utterance hath seized all created things. Leave the people of delusion to their vain desires and the people of doubt to their veils. Then speak in My Name amongst My servants and bring them forth from conjecture unto certitude, and from fancy unto this manifest horizon.</p>
<p>O Samandar! The Cause is mightier than can be mentioned. Stand firm therein in a manner befitting thy relationship unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Be not heedless of thy station and that which hath been ordained for thee in the Tablets of thy Lord. This is My counsel unto thee. Verily thy Lord chose thee before, and in this exalted Tablet. Protect the household of the Cause with all thy strength, lest it be undermined by any cunning rodent. Hearken unto God’s counsel with thy inner ear and stand with such steadfastness as will cause the people of passion to tremble and the pillars of the idolaters to quake - they who speak other than what God hath revealed in the Book and who cause people to slip after the Sun of Independence hath shone forth at its zenith.</p>
<p>Say: Open your eyes! By God, it cannot be known through similitudes nor concealed by the conjectures of the ignorant. Beware lest hopes prevent you from attaining this destiny whereby all in the worlds have been illumined. By God, soon shall ye find yourselves in such abasement as no might on earth can profit you. Thus doth the All-Merciful testify with a power that the might of creation cannot weaken, were ye of them that know. Say: By God, what profiteth you is your steadfastness in this Cause and your arising to serve it and to aid it. Abandon oppression, then look with the eye of fairness that ye may recognize that which your Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous, commandeth you.</p>
<p>O Samandar! By God the Truth, We desired naught but the triumph of God’s Cause, and We bore hardships to manifest His sovereignty. Would they be content to see that which would waste the Cause of God in all else after it hath been exalted to such heights that all in the kingdom of names acknowledged its power, all in the realm of might confessed its sovereignty, the very essence of divinity was moved by its appearance, and the very pebbles of the mountains, fruits of the trees, waves of the seas, and all that was created by God’s Word, the Powerful, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, spoke forth its praise?</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned! The verses descend from the heaven of thy Lord’s will, the Manifestor of clear proofs, and the tongue speaketh in the kingdom of utterance in His name, the All-Merciful. Yet tears fall like scattered pearls by reason of what hath befallen the Cause of God at the hands of the heedless hosts. Say: Have mercy, O people, upon yourselves and then upon Him Who hath borne hardships for your ease. Fear God and be not of the wrongdoers. Free yourselves from the darkness of idle fancies and turn with your hearts toward the horizon whereunto the Chosen One pointeth with the finger of power. By God! This is My manifest horizon, My certain truth, My shining light, My straight path, My mighty revelation, and My beauty dawning upon all who dwell in the world. O Samandar! Knowest thou what tongue addresseth thee and from what heaven these verses descend? By God! Wert thou to know, thou wouldst fall unconscious for a thousand years, then rise up and say: “Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me in the court of Thy might and for having turned toward me with Thy grace and favor. Thou art He Who cannot be known save through Thyself and cannot be described by aught except Thyself. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.” Thus hath shone forth upon thee from the horizon of utterance the Sun of explanation, that thy self and spirit may be illumined thereby and the hearts of the sincere may rejoice therein.</p>
<p>Would that the servants would ponder deeply that which hath been revealed in this Tablet. Blessed is he who findeth therein the fragrance of his Lord’s grandeur and who is detached from all the worlds. O My beloved! Most people are unaware and heedless, for they have not been and are not informed of the true station of the Cause. They have walked according to their desires and wasted their days, moving about in their vain imaginings. We beseech God to assist all to serve His Cause. Your honor observeth that if a soul in that land had arisen to serve the Cause, he would surely have educated the weak souls in such wise that they would soar in the heaven of certitude and walk upon the earth of steadfastness, paying no heed to such malevolent souls and a hundred thousand like them. O My beloved! The heart is consumed by this, that the loved ones of God, despite their claim of love, accept not that which is for the benefit, good, and salvation of all. Your honor must be very attentive and vigilant in all matters.</p>
<p>Convey infinite greetings from this evanescent servant to all the honored ones, the beloved ones, and the friends in that land, one and all, and counsel them all with the divine counsels that are in the verses revealed unto your honor. Convey infinite expressions of sincerity and most exalted, wondrous, and sublime greetings to the great and honored master, his honor the Name of Razzaq, after ’Abdu’l-Baha. God willing, hereafter a sublime Tablet specifically for him will be revealed and sent. May the spirit, glory and splendor be upon your honor and those with you.</p>
<p>The Servant of God</p>

<p>In My Name, through which the fragrance of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling, has been wafted!</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down in truth from the heaven of God’s Will, the Lord of all worlds. When it appeared, the mysteries of all the Books were revealed and that which had been hidden from the eyes of those near unto God was made manifest. O thou who art present before the Divine Countenance and who gazest upon the Throne, rejoice in that the Ancient Beauty hath turned toward thee from the direction of His Most Great Name and hath revealed for thee that which hath caused the breezes of revelation to waft throughout the world, whereby all who dwell in the heavens and on earth have been perfumed.</p>
<p>O spiritual youth! Hearken unto the eternal call of God. He hath sent down for thee from the heaven of utterance that which shall never be exhausted throughout the endurance of His glorious and wondrous kingdom. When the Day of Return appeared and the All-Bountiful came riding upon the clouds, there arose from behind the veil the buzzing of flies. Thus hath the Tongue of God spoken in this exalted station. He hath informed thee of what befell Him at the hands of those who cast the Covenant and Testament of God behind their backs and denied the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>Say: O peoples of the earth! Fear God and follow not those who have denied God’s grace and mercy and have perpetrated that which hath caused every Prophet and every trustworthy Messenger to lament. We desired for them all the good that the All-Merciful had revealed in the Furqan and in the Bayan, yet they rose in opposition and objected to God, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the earth! By God, the Most Exalted Word which the Lord of Names hath revealed in His perspicuous Book hath been fulfilled. Blessed is he who hath heard, recognized, turned unto God and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou Beloved of the hearts of the sincere ones!”</p>
<p>Say: Beware, O people of the Bayan, lest ye reject the truth by virtue of that which ye possess. Cast away idle fancies and vain imaginings, and take hold of that which ye have been commanded by God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The Most Great Sign hath been joined with the Most Exalted Word on the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds. Say: O people! The Sun of God’s Will hath dawned from the supreme horizon and hath manifested that which He desired. He is, verily, the Single One, the All-Knowing, the Mighty, the All-Wise, the All-Informed. Cast aside your imaginings; the Self-Subsisting hath come with a light that neither the veils of the world nor the clouds of the nations can withhold. Thus hath the matter been decreed, if ye be of them that know.</p>
<p>O spiritual youth! For a time, the Most Exalted Pen was restrained due to the unworthiness of the servants. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness unto this at this Daybreak, by whose light the earth and heaven were illumined and the hearts of the unitarians were attracted. There hath befallen the Wronged One that which hath no likeness or parallel. The hosts of self and passion and the legions of iniquity and corruption have united, uttering calumnies of which none but God is aware, and their purpose hath been to subvert the Cause of God. Whosoever hath turned his face towards this region for the sake of God from the Great City, they have accused of theft and irreligion. Yet God, friendless and unaided, relying upon Him alone, remaineth established in His place and seated upon His Most Great Throne. Neither the might of princes nor the clamor of divines who have denied God’s right, His sovereignty, His proof and His testimony, have deterred Him. Beseech ye God that He may aid all to that which beseemeth His Day. Say: O servants! Fear ye God, then recognize the station of this holy and luminous Day. This is the Day which God’s Messengers foretold aforetime, and which the Seal heralded in His words “The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.” In all conditions the Most Exalted Pen hath been occupied with counsels and exhortations, that perchance the servants may turn from the direction of aversion to the direction of acceptance, and cling to what is with God rather than what is with the people. The oppression of the transgressors hath reached such a pass that they have forbidden people from reciting the dawn prayer. The Sheikh of the Land of Sad is aflame with the fire of denial, and likewise some of those associated in the Land of Ta. One of the handmaidens of God, known as the Sister, hath raised the standard of hypocrisy. She was not with Us in the beginning and knew not of the Cause. The colors and ornaments of the world seized her to such extent that she gave to the enemy what belonged to the Friend. Nevertheless, We concealed it and held fast to the cord of patience. But that heedless one became fearful of her own deed and openly arose in opposition, to such degree that she incited certain souls to endeavor to subvert God’s Cause among His servants. These matters were and are not worthy of mention, but in view of some being informed, a drop from the ocean of hatred and enmity hath been mentioned. We beseech God to make all aware of that which leadeth to the exaltation and elevation of being, and to make them so steadfast that neither the cawing of the cawers nor the clamor of the doubters shall prevent or withhold them from the ocean of utterance of the Purpose of the worlds. Sixty years of her life have passed, and until now she hath not been able to read a single tablet. God shall soon reveal what her breast concealeth and what her soul hath betrayed. There hath befallen Us that which hath befallen no one aforetime. All things bear witness unto this. Verily thy Lord is the True Witness, the Speaker, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>Verily My Most Exalted Pen desireth at this moment to make mention of one of His loved ones who hath turned unto the Dayspring of His light, hath acknowledged His Manifestation in His days, and hath confessed that which the tongue of His grandeur hath uttered. We testify that he hath quaffed the choice wine of revelation from the hand of His bounty, and hath believed in Him and in His Book and in His proof and His evidence. Blessed art thou, O Sadr, inasmuch as the Ancient Beauty hath testified to thy faith from His Most Great Prison, and hath made mention of thee in such wise as to cause the fragrance of the All-Merciful to be diffused throughout all creation and the sweet perfume of faithfulness to be wafted amongst all religions. I testify that thou didst believe in God when every sinful doubter and every remote scholar denied Him. The first light that shone forth and gleamed from the horizon of God’s will, the Lord of Lords, and the first fragrance that was wafted amongst the servants by this Name through which the horizons were illumined. Upon thee, O thou who hast turned unto the horizon of Revelation and who speaketh in praise of Him Who conversed upon Sinai. Thou art he who hath attained unto the call of God and His mention and hast acknowledged that which was revealed in His days. Thou art he whom neither the might of Pharaohs nor the power of tyrants could deter. Thou didst turn unto the Kaaba of God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, and didst answer Him with thy tongue both outwardly and inwardly when His sweetest call was raised from His most exalted horizon in the prison of Akka. We testify that thou didst drink the wine of steadfastness from the hand of thy Lord’s bounty, the Lord of all creation, and didst attain unto His verses and His signs. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who turneth unto thy resting place and visiteth thee, even as the tongue of thy Lord hath spoken. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to adorn thy station in the Most Exalted Paradise with the light of His Manifestation and His appearance, and to send down upon thee at all times from the heaven of bounty a mercy from His presence and a blessing from His court and a table spread from His side. O my Lord! Ordain for him that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have attained unto all the good Thou hast sent down in Thy Books and Thy Scrolls and Thy Tablets. I beseech Thee, O God of Names, by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance and the splendors of the Sun of Thy grace, to forgive him who hath turned unto him, then to answer his needs through Thy bounty and generosity, then to fulfill for him what he desireth from the heaven of Thy generosity and the sun of Thy bounty. Verily Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp is the reins of bounty. Thou takest and givest, Thou forgivest whom Thou willest through Thy great mercy, and Thou exaltest whom Thou willest through Thy Most Great, Most Holy, Most Glorious Name. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Bountiful, the Powerful, the Compassionate, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Verily We have made mention of those who have ascended unto the Supreme Companion and have sent down for them that which hath caused the ocean of forgiveness to surge in creation and the fragrance of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of the worlds, to be diffused. By My life! There hath been sent down from My Most Exalted Pen for them that which hath caused the sweet perfume of God’s utterance to be wafted throughout all else than Him, and all things have spoken forth glory and splendor and light and bounty unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed is the stranger who hath sought his most exalted homeland, and the poor one who hath laid hold on the cord of wealth, and the ignorant one who hath quaffed the choice wine of knowledge from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Generous. This is a Day wherein the rapture of the Call hath seized all who are in earth and heaven. Blessed is he who hath heard and is endowed with hearing, and blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen what hath shone forth from the horizon of God’s grace in this manifest station and exalted spot.</p>
<p>In truth I say, the vain imaginings of the former people have to some extent seized the people of God. They have forsaken the manifest and evident Truth and are secretly engaged in promoting vain imaginings. Verily thy Lord is with them, He heareth and seeth and concealeth. He, verily, is the Concealer, the All-Knowing. Say: O people! By God, there hath appeared what hath never appeared in the world, and there hath come what no eye among the nations hath ever seen. Fear God and be not of the heedless. Say: Take ye hold of the hem of God and say […]</p>
<p>O our God and our Lord! We turn unto Thee in repentance, for verily Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. O my Lord! Keep us not from the light of Thy unity, and remove us not from the precincts of Thy nearness and the court of Thy glory. Verily Thou art the All-Kind, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Today all must fix their gaze upon the Supreme Horizon, detached from all else. Thus hath flowed the command from My Most Exalted Pen in this Palace wherein the Ancient Beauty walketh with manifest sovereignty. O Ruhani! Say: O people! Today the Book speaketh through “The All-Bestowing hath come” and all things proclaim “The Lord of all beings hath come.” Glory be to God! The verses are revealed, the evidences are manifest, yet most of the people are in clear error, save those whom God hath purified as a mercy and grace from His presence. Verily He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth through His binding and wise command. Say: O people! Beware lest ye cast the call of God behind you, and beware lest ye follow any ignorant remote one. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the martyrs of the Land of Ya, through whom Thou didst manifest Thy sovereignty and power by Thy leave and might, and Thy patience and forbearance, to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for those of Thy servants who are near unto Thee and those of Thy creation who are sincere. O my Lord! Assist Thy servants to steadfastness and detachment. Verily Thou art the Lord of creation and the Possessor of invention. There is no God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! Through the penetrating power of steadfastness and detachment in these days, We have illumined the preface of certain Tablets with the light of Khalil’s detachment. Indeed there appeared from that Dawning-Place of detachment that which amazed the Concourse on High. When Nimrod’s fire was ablaze and that noble one was suspended in the air, Gabriel came and asked: “Hast thou any need?” He replied: “Not from thee.” May the spirit of all who dwell in the Kingdom be a sacrifice unto his detachment. O spiritual youth! The attraction of this call hath seized this Wronged One, and repeatedly in these days hath this passage flowed from the tongue of grandeur. Beseech the True One that He may aid all to discover and attain unto the sweetness of detachment. One ray of its effulgence shone upon certain kings; barefooted they sought the wilderness and traversed the deserts. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the outpourings of these days, heard My call, and turned unto My horizon. He is assuredly among the people of Baha in My wondrous Book, before which, when it was revealed, all the books of the world and whatsoever is with the nations have bowed down. He Who speaketh before all faces beareth witness unto this. The dominion and the kingdom belong unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Make mention of the loved ones in every land and give them the glad-tidings of that which hath been revealed and ordained, that perchance the Word of God may attract them all and free them from the happenings of the world and its people.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Mighty, the Most Impregnable, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>This is a Tablet that hath been sent down from the Preserved Tablet, that it may serve as guidance and mercy unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. Therein is made mention of him that remaineth of the kindred of Him Who endured in the path of his Lord that which caused the Concourse of the Near Ones to be thunderstruck. Blessed art thou, O My Name, inasmuch as the breezes of the garment from Joseph the Exalted, Who was named Muhammad-before-’Ali, have wafted over thee. He, verily, was named by Our Most Holy Name in the Concourse on High, and by the All-Glorious in the cities of eternity, and by all names in the Kingdom of Names. Through Him was manifested My sovereignty and My power, then My grandeur and My majesty, were ye of them that know.</p>
<p>We sprinkled upon him from this Ocean that which detached him from all else but Me and transformed him from the west of tranquility to the east of rapture, until he offered up his life in My path, whereat his being rejoiced while the eyes of the near ones wept. Blessed art thou for having been honored by his presence, for having heard his melodies, and for having found solace in his oppressed and lonely being. He is now present before the Throne, weeping for what hath befallen Me at the hands of the hosts of Satan.</p>
<p>By God, O My loved one! No day hath passed except that there hath befallen Me that which all created things are powerless to recount. On one day the idolaters say: “This is he who hath fabricated a lie against God,” even as thou heardst the like on the day when He Who came with manifest sovereignty appeared. And on another day they say: “He hath appeared contrary to what was ordained in the Book.” And on yet another day they say: “Through him the Concourse of the Bayan hath been veiled from the mention of God, the Exalted, the Great.”</p>
<p>Consider then their lack of understanding: they speak that whereby every reality in all things doth curse them, yet they perceive it not. He Who uttereth God’s verses among them they reject through their vain imaginings, even while they recite that which was revealed aforetime by My mighty and wondrous Pen. Behold the power of thy Lord, how He hath deprived them of understanding and left them wandering in the wilderness of idle fancy.</p>
<p>By God, O My Name! He whom the people have taken as a beloved one instead of God is powerless to speak before the Face, yet the people are in grievous drunkenness. By My life! Were thou to become aware of him and his deeds, thou wouldst weep for Me and find no rest in thy dwelling until thy spirit ascendeth to the All-Highest Companion, that station wherein shine forth the lights of the countenance of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious. God is sufficient witness to this.</p>
<p>Hearken unto Me, then cast behind thee every name and take fast hold of the Cord of God. Fear not the hosts of the idolaters. They and all they possess shall never be mentioned before God, even should they bring forth the books of the ancients. Say: O loved ones of God! Fear not for your bodies. By God, ye are the kings in the realms of the spirits. How excellent is this exalted, mighty and glorious station! Verily, from every drop of blood that is shed in My path, God shall raise up souls of them that are nigh unto Him and are sincere. Were I to reveal the mysteries of that station, people would offer up their lives in the path of their Lord, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>O My Name! Hear My call with the ear of thine innate nature. By God, through it shall all the world be attracted, were they to turn thereunto.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Recount to thy name the story of this city, that he may be of them that are informed. When Muhammad came to thee from the company of the idolaters, saying that they desired to meet with thee in another place, We heard this and left the house with manifest sovereignty, and We said: “O Muhammad! The Spirit hath left His place, and with Him have gone forth the spirits of the chosen ones and the realities of the Messengers. Behold thou then the denizens of the most exalted Paradise above My head and within My grasp the proofs of the Prophets. Open thine eyes! Here is Ali, and here Muhammad, the Messenger of God, Who hath risen from the horizon of the House with manifest sovereignty, bringing you all the signs from God, the Mighty, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>Say: “Were all the divines and mystics on earth to assemble, and with them all the kings and rulers, verily I would present Myself before their faces and would proclaim the verses of God, the Sovereign, the Almighty, the All-Wise. I am He Who feareth no one, though all who are in the heavens and on earth should combine against Me. The verses have bowed before My countenance and all voices have become humble before My most wondrous and matchless melodies. This is My hand which God hath made white for all the worlds, and this is My staff which, were We to cast it down, would swallow up all created things. All that hath been created between the heavens and the earth is but as a handful of clay in thy Lord’s sight.”</p>
<p>“O Muhammad! Go thou unto the company of the idolaters and say: ‘The Youth hath come unto you, and with Him are the hosts of divine revelation and inspiration. Before Him marcheth the Kingdom of the Cause, and behind Him the tribes of the Concourse on High, then the dwellers of the cities of eternity, then the angels brought near.’ Say: ‘Fear ye God, and oppose not Him by Whose command every wise matter hath been ordained.’ Then present yourselves before God with your ropes and your staves and whatsoever ye possess, if ye be of them that have power.</p>
<p>“We shall proceed to the House of God which one of the kings hath built and named Salim. I alone have come to you from the Dayspring of eternity with God’s most great and mighty tidings. I shall tarry until the sun setteth in its west, that perchance the objectors may feel ashamed within themselves and be numbered among the penitent.”</p>
<p>Know thou that God hath forbidden His loved ones to meet with the idolaters and the hypocrites. Yet We have left the house, putting Our trust in God and turning Our gaze toward the direction of His Cause, that perchance God’s heedless servants might thereby be awakened. They that have disbelieved and associated partners with God will never believe in God though there should come to them the holy scrolls or the hosts of the unseen or the proofs of the Messengers. The meeting with God increaseth them in naught save in rebellion and unbelief. Thus hath it been sent down in the Tablets, and this is a mighty and exalted Tablet.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Know thou that every name, through its connection with My Self, hath been exalted in the kingdom of names, if thou be of them that comprehend. On this Day, every relationship hath been severed save for those who have entered beneath the shadow of this luminous and radiant Countenance. Whosoever holdeth fast to a name among names while remaining heedless of its Creator - such a one is not of Me and God is quit of him. We have created all names even as We created all things, if ye be of them that know. Say: “I have appeared for God’s sake and have come forth for God’s sake, and I speak before all who are on earth even as I speak before thy face. I fear no one, and My deeds bear witness to what I say, if thou be of them that perceive.” Say: “Verily, the signs of Truth are as manifest as the radiance of the sun, and its lights[…]”</p>
<p>Say: Through the movement of the Youth move the realities of all things, and through His stillness are stilled Our steadfast servants. Be thou detached from names, then suffice with thy Lord and be not of the ignorant. Those who have cleaved to names, they are worshippers of idols, wert thou of those who know. Say: The Prophet is he who informed the people of this Most Upright, Most Ancient, and Eternal Message. The Messenger is he who conveyed My messages to those who had strayed from the path. The Imam is he who stood before My face with clear submission and humility. The Guardian is he who sought protection in the impregnable fortress of My guardianship. And the Successor is he who counseled the people in that which We commanded them in a preserved tablet. He whom the idolaters took as lord for themselves and through whom they opposed God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Beautiful - verily he was but one among My servants, and would present himself before the Countenance every morn and eve. The winds of passion blew upon him from the direction of his own self through that which his hands had wrought, until they moved him from his station and left him among the lowest of the low. We had made his name renowned among the servants for a wisdom from Us, and verily thy Lord is the Ruler over what He willeth. When We completed Our utterance, he went to the idolaters while the Youth repaired to the station We had ordained. Thus was the matter decreed, and We were witnesses. When Muhammad returned alone after a time, We said: Where are they who desired the face of the Youth, and where are they who disbelieved in God, the Exalted, the Great? Say: When the Sun shineth from the horizon of the Cause, the birds of night flee from it and cannot draw nigh unto it. Thus was the decree, were ye of those who know. Thus have We recounted unto thee the matter of him who appeared in those days, as a grace from Us unto thee and unto Our assured servants. Would that thou hadst been with Us on that day and witnessed God’s ascendancy over the worlds, His power over all created things, and His sovereignty between the heavens and the earths. But grieve not over this, for We have written for thee in the Tablet the reward of that day, and We are powerful over all things. Arise thou to the Cause, then gather the people and be not of the inactive ones. Unite the hearts of My loved ones, then remind them at all times of My beautiful remembrance. Expend thy soul and spirit in propagating the Cause of God - this is the nature of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. Should harm befall thee, be patient as thy Lord was patient, and He will surely recompense the patient ones. Grieve not over what hath befallen thee. Verily thy Lord is with thee in all conditions and will aid thee through the truth with the hosts of His invisible realm. Convey My greetings unto her who hath believed in her Lord and attained the presence of God and arrived at the shore of a mighty sea, whose every wave proclaimeth that there is none other God but Me, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Blessed is she in that she hath heard the melodies of her Lord and the lights of holiness have shone upon her from God’s manifestation, the Lord of the worlds. And the mercy that descendeth from the clouds of My will and the heaven of My purpose be upon her and her daughter. This verily is a great bounty. Upon thee be My remembrance and praise, then My glory and the glory of the worlds.</p>
<p>Then remind all Our loved ones from Our presence. Say: O chosen ones of God, be steadfast in the Cause of your Lord, the All-Merciful, in such wise that the winds of trials shall not move you, and be ye of those who are firmly rooted in God’s Cause. Gather ye in the assemblies of fellowship and remember this Prisoner Who hath been afflicted amidst the hypocrites. Gather ye around that Name. Beware lest ye be scattered, for the wolves lurk behind you with great cunning. Trust ye in God in all matters and shun the wayward. Should ye find one through whose heart the breezes of the All-Merciful have wafted, associate with him and remind him of this mighty Remembrance. Beware lest ye sorrow over anything or be troubled in adversity and tribulation. By God! We have ordained for you in Our most exalted Kingdom a station of glorious and lofty rank. Be ye united amongst yourselves, for through unity shall the Cause of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing, be made manifest, if ye be of those who are endowed with insight. Those who read the Bayan yet deny the verses of the All-Merciful - these are they against whom the word of punishment hath been fulfilled, and they shall soon enter the fire. Be ye My trusted ones among My creation, My chosen ones among My creatures, and the dawning-places of My light among the worlds. Thus have We imparted unto you the word of truth and revealed unto you that whereby your hearts and souls may find tranquility, and ye may be of those who are steadfast. The copy of the revelation that was written before the Face hath been sent. Copies of God’s Tablets should be sent to all cities, and copies of all should be preserved in your presence. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the lights of the countenance of thy Lord. Upon thee be the glory of God and His splendor, then His remembrance and the remembrance of all the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>Fat?-Abad – Jinab-i-Mahdi Khan, upon him be the Glory of God</p>
<p>In these days when the fire of tyranny is ablaze and the light of justice is concealed, the Most Exalted Pen makes mention of thee and declares: Reflect upon the rebellious souls and that which proceedeth from them. With their tongues they make mention of the All-Merciful and occupy themselves with praise of the Best-Beloved of all worlds, and yet they perpetrate that which causeth the Divine Lote-Tree to lament and bewail. Woe unto them and unto those who follow them! For the sake of this base and transient world they have forsaken the eternal realms of God. And strange it is that, despite such deeds and actions, they count themselves among the faithful. By the life of God! The Apostle lamenteth their actions and the Holy Maiden weepeth at that which their hands have wrought. They slay the sons of the Apostle while praying unto Him and weep for those martyred in former times. We testify that they are among the losers.</p>
<p>Observe how greatly hath heedlessness encompassed these souls. They themselves quote that the Apostle–may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake–hath said: “The righteous belong to God and the wicked belong to me.” Yet they have done what they have done and committed what they have committed. By the life of God! The Concourse on High and the denizens of the Kingdom of Names have lamented, but the people remain wrapt in heedlessness and veils. He hath indeed seized the spotted snake through His sovereignty and might–she who was the source, origin and essence of tyranny–and soon will He seize the wolf that followed her. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Those people formerly martyred the Prince of Martyrs, and when asked why they had put to such a humiliating death this holy soul whom all acknowledged and confessed to be the son of the Apostle and the Prince of the Youth of Paradise, they replied that he had risen against the Imam of the Age. And now they have martyred this Husayn, who is the Imam of the land of ?ad and His very essence. Behold, the curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people! Take heed, O ye who have eyes to see! Take heed, O ye who have insight!</p>
<p>Blessed art thou for having believed in God, the Self-Subsisting, the Supreme, on a day wherein men have turned away and objected, save those whom God, the Lord of the seen and unseen, hath willed. Praise be to God that through divine grace thou hast drunk from the ocean of faith and attained recognition of the Best-Beloved of the worlds. Reflect upon the heedlessness of those who style themselves learned ones of the age. They have failed to ponder even a single word of the words of old or to comprehend its meaning. This is that word of old which was spoken: The chiefs of the earth shall present themselves before the Qa’im, and then that Dawning-Place of the Light of Divine Unity shall speak a word whereupon all shall flee. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of utterance, had the people of the world–namely those who claim adherence to the Qur’an–reflected with fairness and insight upon even this blessed word, they would not have risen in tyranny. Were any clear-sighted one today to gaze with penetrating vision upon the Divine Lote-Tree, he would behold upon all its leaves, branches and twigs the marks of the swords of the rebellious, the arrows of the deniers, and the stones cast by the doubts of the heedless. Nevertheless, that blessed Tree at all times calleth out with its most exalted voice, summoning the people of the world to the most sublime horizon. Strange it is that the people are deluded by this world, which is but a fleeting shadow, and remain heedless of the Truth. It behooveth everyone who hath believed in God to ponder the words and deeds of those who have disbelieved and […]</p>
<p>He praiseth His Lord, the Giving, the Bountiful, Who enabled him to recognize the Manifestation of His Self, the Dawning-Place of His Revelation, the Dayspring of His signs, and the Source of His knowledge, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Woe unto the people who cast aside their God and followed their vain imaginations. God will soon seize them with His wrath and His authority, for He is verily the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thy letter reached the Most Great Prison and attained the presence of the Wronged One of the horizons. The fragrance of love wafted therefrom, and for each soul mentioned therein, blessed verses were sent down from the heaven of oneness. God willing, all shall attain unto the fruits thereof in this world and in all the divine worlds. He is verily the Ordainer, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>We make mention of Siyyid-’Ali and beseech God to forgive him and draw him nigh unto Him. He is verily the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. This is a Day wherein the ocean of bounty hath surged, the heaven of generosity hath been upraised, and the sun of grace hath shone forth, inasmuch as the temple of the All-Merciful hath been established upon the throne of His blessed Name, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Blessed is the soul that hath heard the call of its Lord and turned with its heart unto God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Mahmud, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of the Wronged One Who calleth all to God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen. O Mahmud! This is a Day that hath adorned the Books of God, the Mighty, the Loving. Arise to remember and praise God, and beseech Him to make thee steadfast in this irrevocable Cause. By God! The Sun of Revelation hath shone forth, whereat the feet of the learned have slipped, the hearts of the mystics have been perturbed, and the faces of the peoples have been darkened, save those whom God, the Lord of existence, hath willed. Hold fast unto the firm cord of this Most Great Name and say:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of existence, for having caused me to turn unto Thee and unto Thy horizon. I testify that Thou hast appeared with the truth and that which was hidden hath been manifested. Thou art verily the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
<p>We make mention from this Most Great Prison of him who is named Muhammad-Rida, that he may hear the call of the Lord of Names in all the worlds of his Lord, the All-Knowing Director. The ears were created to hearken unto My call, the eyes to behold the lights of My horizon, the faces to turn unto My Kingdom, the hearts for My love, and the tongue for My beauteous praise. When thou hast attained unto My verses and found the fragrance of My remembrance, render thanks unto God for this. He is verily the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Muhammad-Sadiq, that the fragrances of My verses may attract him and draw him nigh unto My Kingdom and My Dominion. I am verily the Forgiving, the Bountiful. We have heard the cry of those who have been intoxicated with the wine of My verses, and We have mentioned them as a grace from Us in this perspicuous Book. Hold fast unto the hem of thy Lord’s mercy and place thy trust in Him. He is verily the Bestower, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. How many a monarch hath heard and turned away, and how many a servant hath turned toward the river of his Lord’s mercy. Blessed is the tree that hath inclined toward Him, the fragrance that hath been wafted from His direction, and the breeze that hath passed over His luminous raiment.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Hasan [Bey] in this station which hath been named by all names from the Supreme Pen. He is verily the Powerful, the All-Choosing. O Hasan! Husayn was martyred in the land of Sad for the sake of God, the Lord of mankind. He is the one for whose calamity lamented the dwellers of the sanctuary of grandeur and the inhabitants of the Most Glorious Pavilion. The Lord of creation beareth witness unto this. He is verily the Truthful, the Mighty, the Bestower. God hath seized those who transgressed and rebelled, with an authority from His presence. He is verily the Powerful, the All-Compelling. And He shall soon purify the earth from the defilement of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Final End.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Hasan! Hearken unto the call of Him Who is the Lord of the seen and the unseen from this most exalted Station, then render thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Bountiful. It behooveth everyone to beseech his Lord to enable him in His days to accomplish that which shall endure as long as His most excellent names endure. He, verily, is the Expositor, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Say: O Lord of hearts and Sovereign of all beings! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the All-Subduing, to assist me in making mention of Thee and in extolling Thy virtues, and to ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Thou, verily, art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the All-Beauteous.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Qasim! Rejoice that the countenance of the Ancient of Days hath turned toward thee from His Most Great Prison, and calleth thee unto God, Who causeth the winds to blow. Hearken unto the call from the Supreme Horizon. By My life! It will draw thee to a station before which pens fall powerless to describe. Blessed is he who hath sought the Desired One, and the mystic who hath recognized the One Who is known, and the wayfarer who hath hastened with his heart unto God, the Cleaver of the dawn. We have, at all times, summoned all men unto the All-Merciful. Among them are such as have hearkened and turned toward Him, and such as have turned away, following every heedless doubter. The glory of God rest upon the people of Baha who have cast the world behind their backs and are engaged in the service of God, the Lord of all mankind.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named after the Desired One (Husayn-’Ali), that Thy call may draw him near and Thy fragrances may bring him closer unto God, the Almighty, the All-Praised. Blessed art thou for having been mentioned in the days of thy Lord by this Pen through which the Trump was sounded and all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck, except such as thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, pleased to spare. We have made mention of every one who hath turned toward the Countenance and every tongue that hath uttered the praise of its Lord, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Blessed is he who, being athirst, hath quaffed from My sealed wine, and he who, being endowed with strength, hath set his face toward My straight path. From this Station do We send Our greetings to the faces of My servants and My handmaidens who have not cast aside My Covenant and have fulfilled My testament which We took from them in the primordial atoms of the Torah and the Gospel. By God! This is a covenant that Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and the Revealer of the Bayan took from all who are in heaven and on earth. To this testifieth every fair-minded, clear-sighted one.</p>
<p>O My servants! Rejoice in My remembrance, then make mention of Me. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Expositor, the All-Wise. He hath made Himself known unto you and hath taught you His remembrance and praise. He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Bountiful. O My handmaidens! Rejoice in My days. By the life of God! All the treasures of earth cannot equal My remembrance. He, verily, is the Reckoner, the All-Knowing. Render thanks unto your Lord by night and by day. He heareth and seeth. There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Praise the Lord of the world that for each of the souls mentioned in thy book, sublime and glorious verses were revealed. It behooveth thee to thank God throughout the duration of the dominion of earth and heaven. Thou shouldst, with perfect wisdom, summon the people to the ocean of divine knowledge and wisdom. The promotion of the Faith is among the most momentous of all endeavors. The friends of God must, through the assistance of the Primal Word, awaken those who slumber and bestow new life upon the dead. The Word of Truth hath ever been, and will continue to be, the quickener of bones and bodies. Within it lie concealed the seas of life and of knowledge and wisdom. Blessed is he who hath clung thereunto, attained unto its fragrances, and drunk from its oceans. We beseech God to make that servant fragrant with the sweet savors of His days and to aid all to perform good deeds and to acquire praiseworthy qualities and attributes, and to achieve whatsoever will cause the exaltation of His Cause and the elevation of the station of those souls. The friends of God, both living and dead, have ever been remembered at His threshold, and He hath made mention of them all in His sublime Tablets. He, verily, is the Recompenser. He, verily, is the Giver. He, verily, is the Generous One. He, verily, is the Revealer, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>We make mention, at the end of this Book, of thy wife who hath heard and believed in God, the Single, the All-Informed. O My handmaiden! Hearken unto My call and say: I testify, O my God, that Thou hast created me and created the world, that Thou hast provided for me and for all who are in the world. Thou art He Who brought the contingent things into being through a word from Thee, and quickened those who lay in the graves through the breezes of Thy days. I beseech Thee, O Educator of the world and Sovereign of nations, by Thy Name through which, when uttered, all things proclaimed Thy praise and glory, and through which, when moved, all created things were stirred with longing for Thy presence, to ordain for me that which will profit me in this world and the next, and in every world of Thy worlds. O Lord! Thou knowest what profiteth me. Decree for me, through Thy bounty, that which beseemeth Thy grace. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Loving.</p>

<p>O Mir Taj’d-Din, upon him be the Glory of God!</p>
<p>The Tablet of God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>He is the One Who speaks with grace and commands with justice.</p>
<p>The Word of God hath appeared from the horizon of the Kingdom of Utterance, and the Light of Revelation hath shone forth from the Horizon of Sinai. That Word is the blessed word “He doeth whatsoever He willeth,” and that Light is the light of the appearance of the Desire of all worlds. O Taj! Blessed is he whose heart is adorned with the crown of the Most Great Name and whose temple is adorned with the ornament of detachment. We have ever remembered and will continue to remember the chosen ones. The calumnies of the calumniators and the opposition of the polytheists have not prevented the Supreme Pen from remembering, during the nights and days, the true loved ones and spiritual friends. The denial of the Day Star of affirmation hath not deprived it of sincerity and purity, nor hath its darkness prevented the light of justice from shining forth and being manifest. Exalted be His determination, His power, and His utterance!</p>
<p>O Taj’d-Din! This Wronged One dwelleth imprisoned among the heedless, without helper or defender. Therefore hath every oppressor risen up in opposition and objection. The oppressors of the world have found an arena and have attacked Him Who is without helper or defender. However, the opposition and objection of all have been, in the sight of God, and continue to be, as the buzzing of a fly. Quite apart from truth, the people of Persia have throughout their lives been occupied with the descriptions of worthless souls and have remained heedless of and veiled from the Manifestations of power and the Dawning-places of might. Beseech ye God to transform oppression into justice and to sanctify and purify the eyes from the ophthalmia of idle fancies. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! The rain of divine mercy is, at all times, pouring down from the clouds of the grace of the Lord of the Day of Judgment, and the effulgences of the rays of the Sun of Truth are manifest and visible. Nevertheless, all remain attached to and occupied with the dawning-places of idle fancies and the rising-points of vain imaginings.</p>
<p>Today the Kingdom of Utterance proclaimeth before the faces of all religions, without any concealment or disguise, saying: “O people! Fear God, then turn unto the horizon wherefrom the Sun hath shone forth and the Light hath appeared, and wherein was inscribed by the Supreme Pen that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of existence. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the Lamp of Salvation, which calleth out with the most exalted call and summoneth all unto God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. Say: O party of God! Aid your Lord through the hosts of verses which have been sent down from the heaven of the will of your Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>O Taj’d-Din! When thou hast drunk the choice wine of revelation from this perspicuous cup, say: “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and glory be unto Thee, O my Aim, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Beloved, for having enabled me to turn toward Thy most exalted horizon and helped me to enter Thy court through the means of earth and heaven. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the world and Desire of the nations, by Thy Name through which the ocean of bounty surged before the faces of all beings and the sun of faithfulness shone forth from Thy most exalted horizon, to strengthen Thy loved ones to be steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the hosts of the heedless nor the armies of the polytheists may frighten them, nor may the might of the oppressors who have denied Thy proof and turned away from Thy countenance weaken them. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. Thou hast made me to attain unto Thy presence, to hear Thy call, and to behold Thy horizon. I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which will profit me, preserve me, and draw me nigh unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>Verily We have desired to make mention of Abu’l-Qasim who attained the presence when the Temple of the Manifestation was established upon the Throne of Utterance and summoned all to that which would exalt them and draw them nigh unto God, the Lord of all worlds. O Abu’l-Qasim, blessed art thou for having turned thyself toward and heard the call of the Wronged One whilst He was imprisoned in the hands of the heedless. He hath mentioned thee time and again in such wise that thy remembrance shall endure throughout the kingdom of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. I bear witness that thou didst hear My call and attain unto My presence and didst speak in My beauteous praise. When the choice wine of utterance seized thee, say: Praise be unto Thee, O my Lord, the All-Merciful, for having guided me unto Thy path and acquainted me with Thy Cause whereby the hearts of Thy creatures were stirred. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through Whose manifestation all names bowed down, and by Thy Command whereby Thou didst subdue earth and heaven, to ordain for me by Thy Most Exalted Pen that which Thou hast ordained for them that have aided Thy Cause through wisdom and utterance. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>And at this moment We make mention of him who was named ’Ali before Muhammad, who drank the choice wine of utterance from the cup of My bounty and turned toward My direction until he attained My presence and heard My call and beheld My horizon. Blessed is he and blessed is he who hath acted in accordance with that which was enjoined in the Book of God, the Lord of this glorious and wondrous station. O thou who speaketh My praise, say: My God, my God! Thou seest the hands of my hope upraised toward the heaven of Thy bounty and mine eyes fixed upon the horizon of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne and by that which lay hidden in Thy knowledge to aid me to serve Thy Cause amongst Thy servants. O Lord! I testify to Thy unity and Thy singleness, and to Thy power and might and grandeur and sovereignty. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom and the Realm and the One Who holdeth dominion over all existence, to make me in all conditions turned toward the heaven of Thy grace and withdrawn from Thine enemies who have violated Thy Covenant and Thy Testament and have disbelieved in Thy signs. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>And at the end of the Book We have desired to make mention of him who was named Zaynu’l-’Abidin, to whose orientation and devotion the Tongue of Grandeur hath testified, when most of My servants whom We created for My recognition and to stand before My gate and to serve My Cause, the Mighty, turned away from Me. O Zaynu’l-’Abidin! The Lord of all worlds calleth thee and counseleth thee with that which will elevate thy station among His servants, and concerning trustworthiness which He hath made a mercy and wealth and blessing for all in the land. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my Goal, and glory be unto Thee, O my Object of Worship! I testify that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all existence, both seen and unseen. I beseech Thee by the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Source of Thy clear tokens, and by Thy sovereignty whereby the limbs of the heedless among Thy servants and the doubters among Thy creatures trembled, to open before the faces of Thy loved ones the doors of Thy mercy with the keys of Thy grace. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest and within Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>Verily We have desired to turn from the direction of the Prison toward him who was named ’Ali before ’Askar and make mention of him with such mention as shall comfort the eyes of them that are nigh. O ’Ali-’Askar, We bear witness that thou didst turn toward God on a day wherein most of the servants turned away from Him, and didst hear His sweetest call in the prison of ’Akka when He was imprisoned in the hands of those who cast the command of God behind their backs, following the manifestations of idle fancies. We bear witness that thou didst acknowledge that which the Tongue of Grandeur did utter and that which was revealed in His wondrous Book. When thou didst drink the choice wine of utterance from the cup of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, say: […]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! My heart hath been set aflame by the fire of Thy love, and my breast illumined by the light of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds, by Thy command whereby Thou hast subdued the nations, by the pearls that lay concealed in the ocean of Thy knowledge, and by the mysteries that were veiled from the eyes of Thy creation, to aid me in all circumstances to act as befitteth Thy days. Then ordain for me, O my God, that which shall make me steadfast in Thy love. Verily, Thou art the Commander, the Almighty, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Ahmad-’Ali! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Thy name was mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One, Who hath remembered thee in such wise as no remembrance of the peoples can equal, nor all that existeth in the world. The Mother Book in the Final End beareth witness to this. We have remembered thee time and again, and have sent down for thee that which hath diffused amongst the servants the fragrance of bounty and favor. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having remembered me and revealed unto me that which the passage of ages shall not alter. I beseech Thee by Thy most excellent names and Thy most exalted attributes, and by Thy sovereignty that hath encompassed all things, to ordain for me the good of this world and the world to come. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below. There is none other God but Thee, the Compassionate, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>We make mention of Our loved ones in Shin who were not deterred by the whisperings of the doubters - those who hear the verses and deny them, who witness the clear proofs yet turn away from them. These are indeed among the most lost. They have taken their vain imaginings as lords besides God. Thus have their souls enticed them, and today they are in manifest error. We beseech God, the Lord of the Throne and of earth, the Master of the world to come and of this world, to assist His loved ones there to aid His Cause with wisdom and utterance. Verily, He is the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Powerful. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He heareth and seeth, and He is the Commander, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>We make mention at this time of him who hath turned to My countenance, won My call, stood at My door, drunk the choice wine of reunion from the hand of My bounty, and who hath been named with Shin and Kaf in this wondrous and glorious Tablet. The polytheists seized and imprisoned him without any proof from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We beseech God to aid the oppressors to justice and to adorn them with the ornament of equity. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. O Shukri, hear My call from the precincts of My prison. It consoleth thee in what hath befallen thee from the hosts of the deniers. Behold the grace of God and His mercy, that He remembereth thee in prison after seeing thee in another manifest prison. We have made thee Our partner in affliction and tribulation, in captivity and ordainment. Verily, thy Lord loveth whatsoever befalleth Him in the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. Grief and distress have seized some of My loved ones there. Nothing is hidden from Our knowledge. Every person of insight beareth witness to this.</p>
<p>We desire at this time to make mention of one of My Afnan who hath been named with Ba before Qaf, and to bring him glad tidings of God’s grace, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. His letter came before the Wronged One, and We have revealed for him that which hath caused the hearts of the sincere to soar. We beseech God to send down upon him a blessing from His presence and a mercy from His own Self. Verily, He is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed. Glory and remembrance and praise be from Us upon Our loved ones who were not frightened by the clamor of the oppressors nor the doubts of the suspicious away from God, the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earth. The gate of knowledge hath been opened with the key of utterance, and that which was hidden in God’s knowledge, the Master of this wondrous Day, hath appeared. We have sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs, yet the people remain in grievous blindness.</p>
<p>O Murta?a! Hear the call from this most exalted horizon. Verily, He remembereth thee in the prison, as a token of His mercy and loving-kindness. Blessed art thou, and joy be unto thee, for thou hast drunk from the chalice of tribulation in the name of the Lord of all names, and hast partaken thereof for the love of His sanctified, mighty and inaccessible Name. There hath befallen thee what befell Us at the hands of the oppressors. We have heard thy cry and thy lamentation, and have witnessed what hath come upon thee in the path of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the All-Praised. We testify that tribulation hath not deterred thee from turning unto Him, nor have the veils of the heedless obscured thee from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and glory be unto Thee, O my Beloved, and bounty be unto Thee, O my Lord, for having remembered me in Thy days and for having sent down unto me that which hath diffused the fragrances of Thy utterance throughout the world. I testify that Thou hast appeared and manifested Thy Cause through a sovereignty that hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. I beseech Thee, O Creator of heaven, by Thy Most Exalted Word, through which Thy signs and ordinances have been spread abroad, to make me content with whatsoever hath befallen me in Thy love and steadfast in Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, majesty and grandeur!</p>
<p>Praise be to God! Through the grace of the Lord of Destiny, some days ago Mulla ‘Ali-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God, was moved by the divine verses to journey in that direction, and now Aba Badi’, upon him be the glory of God, is preparing to depart. Therefore, this evanescent servant is once again troubling you with this petition. The previous travelers have not yet departed. Mulla Muhammad-’Ali has arrived with several souls. We beseech God to assist these messengers and emigrants in that which will today cause the exaltation of the Word of God, that in every city and land they enter they may become the cause of the awakening of souls and the unity and fellowship of hearts, and that people may truly find from them the fragrance of divine attributes. Each must be a breath of life unto the bodies of men and drops from the ocean of God’s love for the inhabitants of all lands. Verily such souls have always been and are few, as hath been aforetime declared - they are like the red elixir, and the red elixir is rare to find. The former tradition which states “the sincere are in grave danger” bears witness to this statement. However, since the grace of this day is without peer or likeness, this servant hopes that all the loved ones and friends of God may attain to that which is intended and neither act nor speak contrary to that which God desires. May all be enkindled with the fire of His remembrance and gaze toward the horizon of His Cause. Although this servant submitted a detailed letter with Mulla ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God, yet whenever anyone prepares to depart, the heart’s longing compels one to intrude again and again. The petitions that were sent with Mulla Muhammad-’Ali arrived. God willing, the reply will be sent with him personally. One day it was stated that the Observer, upon him be the glory of God, must make amends for the damages caused by his companion, for he had been at the Sacred Threshold for several years and We had never sent him anywhere to teach God’s Cause. You were the cause of taking him specifically for development and cultivation, and apparently destruction and ruin resulted. It is most strange that certain souls, despite divine counsels, heavenly exhortations and manifest loving-kindness and favor, should conduct themselves in such a manner as to cause grief to devoted hearts or the extinction of enkindled souls. However, the loved ones of God must fix their gaze upon the horizon of His Cause and what appears from Him, not upon what appears from others, for infallibility is an ornament reserved for God alone, while error, mistake and forgetfulness have been and are the lot of all others. The friends must overlook one another’s faults, be mindful of God’s forgiveness, and pray for each other. Verily He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Convey greetings from this evanescent one to all the friends and masters in those parts. God willing, may all be set ablaze with the fire of divine love, adorned with the garment of steadfastness, and illumined by the lights of the countenance of the All-Merciful. The letter of the spiritual friend Mulla Mustafa written in reply to this evanescent one’s letter was received and caused joy and delight. We beseech God to assist him to arise to serve Him, to aid His Cause, and to mention Him among His creatures, and to make him among those who said “God is our Lord” and then remained steadfast. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Multiple missives from his honor A-B-N, upon whom be the Glory of God, reached this evanescent servant. Praise be to God, like Abraham they have shattered the idols of vain imaginings and turned towards the horizon of certitude. Blessed be his honor in having attained the pure wine of meanings and utterance in the days of the All-Merciful, and having witnessed the rays of the Dawning-Place of Revelation and turned towards Him. I beseech God to assist him in all conditions and ordain for him that which brings solace to the eyes of the knowing ones. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>His letters were all presented before the Most Holy Court. However, after the passage about the mare, the Beloved of the World smiled and spoke, and His word is truth: “Verily he has spoken truthfully.” And after ten minutes the Countenance of the Intended One turned to the servant and said: “It should be returned to its owner.” Give him the glad tidings that his letter caused the Ancient Beauty to smile. Blessed is he, again blessed is he.</p>
<p>The multiple letters which you wrote from your first arrival in that land until the end all reached this servant. Praise be to God that in all conditions you are occupied with the remembrance and praise of the Truth. Regarding those souls who in these days have turned towards the Most Holy Court, exalted Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of mighty oneness and sent - deliver them, but in all conditions, as commanded, be mindful of wisdom. For in accordance with divine grace and what was revealed at the beginning of this Revelation, mention of every soul that has been or will be made before His presence causes a Tablet to be revealed from the heaven of Will. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant submits that if some friends have not outwardly been blessed with a Tablet, they should not be saddened by this, for the entire world was created so that they might be mentioned in the Most Holy Court. As the Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - has said: all exist so that they might be mentioned once in His presence. And now, praise be to God, through God’s infinite grace all the loved ones are mentioned in His presence. Were they to become aware of the fruits of this matter alone, such joy and delight would seize them all that they would transcend all who are in the kingdom and with a hundred thousand tongues give thanks to the Exalted Truth.</p>
<p>Every deed in this Day is mighty, for this is the Day of which God gave tidings aforetime in His exalted Word: “The Kingdom on that Day shall be God’s” and likewise in another place: “Whose is the Kingdom this Day? God’s, the One, the All-Compelling.” For today is the Day of God’s manifestation and the Day wherein “the earth shall be shaken with a terrible shaking, and thy Lord shall come and the angels rank on rank,” and this is the Day of which He says: “The Day of Sorting Out! And what will explain to thee what is the Day of Sorting Out? Woe on that Day to the rejecters!” And in ten places the Supreme Pen repeatedly declares: “Woe on that Day to the rejecters!” […]</p>
<p>Present to the beloved, that is Mulla Mu??afa, upon him be the Glory of God, on behalf of this servant, that despite the greatness of this Day and despite its being mentioned explicitly and without interpretation in all the divine Books from time immemorial until the Qur’an, this most impregnable, most holy, most great Day, yet none has perceived it. The people of the Qur’an, who in truth are nourished at the breast of ignorance, have not attained maturity - nay, would that in their infancy they had been nourished with the milk of fairness. But strange it is that the people of the Bayan, despite their claims of knowledge and certitude, have turned away from the words “Verily I am God” and have chosen to dwell in the lowest depths of hellfire. I know not how they interpret the words of Truth which say “The Day mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds,” and then He says “Woe on that Day to the deniers who deny the Day of Judgment! And none denies it except every sinful transgressor.” Likewise He says in the well-known sermon “Await ye the speaking of Moses from the Tree upon the Mount.” Were the verses of previous Books to be mentioned, this letter would become a voluminous tome. In brief, this evanescent servant bears witness that none has inhaled the fragrance of the paradise of inner meanings which lies concealed in the Qur’an by the command of the All-Merciful, save those who in this Day have detached themselves from all else but God and have responded to all they heard from the Tree which hath encompassed the worlds. God willing, they and you and the other friends must endeavor with complete determination to educate the immature through wisdom and utterance. At this moment this servant is bewildered at what he was mentioning and where it led, for such mentions were not intended in this letter, yet the sun of the word “I have known God through the changing of determined resolves” thus shed its rays. The Command is in God’s hands - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the petition of Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God, and his wife and son attained the Most Holy Court, and from the heaven of the Divine Will a most mighty Tablet was specifically revealed and sent for each one. And in the Tablet to his wife, mention was made by the Supreme Pen of pure progeny. God willing, they have and will attain unto this. Likewise they have written to this servant. I beseech and hope from the Truth that He may assist them in matters that will cause their mention in the infinite divine worlds.</p>
<p>And regarding what you wrote about Haji Mirza Shafi’ and his son - what was done is acceptable, but it increaseth naught save loss for the wrongdoers. And since in this Day mercy hath encompassed all and it is the Day when “the earth shall be changed into another earth,” perchance the earth of heedless souls may, through the rains of divine mercy, yield the ears of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p>And regarding the passage of the Tablet of His Holiness the Most Great Branch - may my spirit be a sacrifice for the dust of His most precious footsteps - you wrote that it would be desirable to have it in Persian. After that Tablet, He wrote a special treatise in the Persian tongue for the people of Iran who have not yet attained to the Kawthar of recognition. It is most beneficial, and His purpose in that treatise was to prevent people from following the ignorant and to observe matters with their own eyes and ears. And in truth, if properly considered, that blessed treatise has been and is beneficial for all humanity, even though outwardly no mention is made therein of the wondrous, radiant, and resplendent new matters. Yet every person of discernment can inhale from its inner meaning the fragrance of the Divine days, and every person of insight can observe the lights of the spiritual Sun. That treatise is in the possession of the emigrants. God willing, it will reach your attention. The intention was that a copy should first be sent to your presence, but due to the press of duties and the absence of scribes, it was delayed.</p>
<p>And regarding what you wrote about a house being purchased - God willing it is blessed. We beseech God to exalt His remembrance therein in truth. Verily, He is the Guardian of those who remember Him. It is most desirable that in every land a place be designated so that it may become a means of comfort for visitors. God willing, may the pen of that spiritual beloved one always remember the friends and the sincere ones. The Glory be upon you and upon those who are there, from God, our Lord and your Lord.</p>

<p>He is the All-Knowing Speaker!</p>
<p>O thou who gazest toward My horizon and soarest in Mine atmosphere! Hear My call which hath been raised at this time and which addresseth before the faces of the world a resonant sermon and a decisive word. Say: O people of the world! The Wronged One from the precinct of the prison calleth you unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and biddeth you to be present that ye may hear that which hath been sent down from the heaven of His Will and the atmosphere of His All-Compelling Purpose which dominateth the unseen and the seen.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Say to those who turn away: Fear God and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who guideth you to His extended and manifest path and draweth you nigh unto Him. Verily He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
<p>Today it is imperative for those who turn away to come and be present that they may with their own ears and eyes behold and hearken unto the waves of the ocean of knowledge and the revealed verses. Say: O people! Fear God and be not the cause of going astray. The divine verses have been revealed in such wise that none hath been or is capable of reckoning them, and now numerous books exist. Glory be to God! The Primal Point declared “I am the foremost of worshippers,” yet they have become heedless of the Creator and Revealer of that Name and know not Who bestowed and Who created the Name. Say: While time remaineth, strive that perchance ye may pass beyond that which ye possess and your vain imaginings and fix your gaze upon that which is with God.</p>
<p>Thy letter was received and was granted a hearing. Whatsoever hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning Hadi-i-Dawlatabadi, both before and after, ye should write and send to all regions that all may discover that which is the cause of protection and salvation for all. There is a certain Shaykh Muhammad in Constantinople who is among Mirza Yahya’s followers. Through his and his master’s decree, the horizon of treachery hath appeared and the dawning-place of falsehood and calumny hath become manifest. Among other things he hath said that someone went to ’Akka and returned saying “Praise be to God, I am relieved.” He said “I asked what this enigmatic statement meant.” The man related “I went to ’Akka and attained the presence. For four hours they attempted to write two lines but could not.” In short, the field of falsehood hath become vast. Surely ye have heard the details thereof. Beseech ye God to grant justice, and let some of the deniers be present while ye guarantee that they shall observe the equivalent of the previous heavenly Books, nay rather more, and likewise be present at the time of revelation. Say: O Hadi! Forsake not justice. By the life of God! The verses cry out in His Kingdom and weep because of the oppression of the polytheists. They cling to a drop that neither nourishes nor satisfies, while remaining heedless of the ocean. The Most Great Talisman hath appeared, yet it hath blinded their eyes and prevented their ears from hearing.</p>
<p>Ye mentioned Siyyid Mu??afa, upon him be the glory of God. Praise be to God, he hath attained to the mention of the Wronged One. Regarding the question of Huquq, whenever any amount is available with ’Ali-Haydar, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, let them send a portion to him (Aqa ’Ali-Haydar) and mention him on behalf of the Wronged One and convey greetings to him. By the life of God! We found him worthy of acceptance and steadfastness. We beseech God to raise through him the standards of His Cause among His servants and the banners of His remembrance in His lands. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The glory from Us be upon him and upon those who are with him. Some time ago, Tablets specifically for the people of Kirman were requested by your honor and were sent, but no news of their receipt hath come.</p>
<p>O Haydar Qabli-’Ali! Some of the friends are serving with their whole being and are ready with life and possessions. Well is it with them and blessed are they! God will soon make manifest their stations among His servants. Verily, He does not suffer to be lost the reward of those who are steadfast.</p>
<p>For Kerman, His Holiness Abu’l-Fadl, upon him be My Baha and loving-kindness, would be excellent, but at present his presence there must be delayed. If another soul can be found and you deem it advisable, mention this before the Wronged One and send him forth. However, he must hold fast to wisdom and be adorned with goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon My countenance! Endless complaints have arrived from various quarters about certain ones, causing boundless grief. My grief is not from My enemies, but from those who attribute themselves to My Cause. O what sorrow for the servants who follow their desires while claiming to follow My ways and commandments! Had they been fair-minded and held fast to that which God commanded them, all of Iran would now be adorned with the ornament of faith. We beseech God to assist all to return and make good what hath escaped them in My days.</p>
<p>Mention was made of His Holiness Siyyid A. and L., upon him be My Baha and loving-kindness. Praise be to God, he is illumined with the light of recognition and enkindled with the fire of love. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to attract through his mention those who have turned unto Him and to raise through him the standards of the Faith amongst the polytheists and the monotheists. His mention and deeds are witnessed and heard. Remember him from Me and give him the glad-tidings of what hath been revealed for him from My Pen.</p>
<p>Say: O Safar Qabli-’Ali Kh. A., thy name was present before the Wronged One. We have mentioned thee before and at this time. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Some time ago the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of Will especially for thee and was sent. God willing, thou shalt drink from the Kawthar of the utterance of the Goal of all the worlds and be illumined at all times with the lights of the Luminary of Truth.</p>
<p>O Siyyid Qabli-Muhammad! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Lord of the worlds. We have remembered those who have turned toward the Countenance with verses that have entranced the hearts of those near unto God. We beseech God to assist thee to be steadfast in His Cause in such wise that names shall not keep thee back from their Creator nor created things from their Maker. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Hear the call from the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, which calleth before the faces of all who are in the heavens and the earth. Nothing whatsoever hath prevented it from the remembrance of God, the Lord of all beings. Thus hath spoken the tongue of the Wronged One at this manifest time. Give thanks unto God for having assisted thee on a day wherein the Caller called from a near place, and made thee recognize the Dawning-Place of His Cause and guided thee to His straight path.</p>
<p>O Abul-Qasim! The Supreme Pen moveth at morn and at eventide in remembrance of the friends. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto the remembrance of God. The first commandment is to believe in God and to act in accordance with that which He hath revealed in His Book. We counsel Our loved ones to perform goodly deeds and to manifest praiseworthy conduct. O friends! The hosts that can render this Cause victorious have ever been and are goodly character and virtuous deeds. Strive ye that ye may be enabled to achieve victory. He, verily, is the Protector of the doers of good and of them that act aright.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qablih-Hashim! Reflect upon the Shi’ih sect and their deeds, and beseech God, exalted be His glory, to protect His servants from the evil of such souls. By night and by day they besought the appearance of the Truth, yet when He was made manifest they pronounced His death-warrant. The deniers of the Bayan follow in their footsteps. Glory be to God! It is not known why they departed from the Shi’ih sect and turned towards the Point, only to abandon the Truth at the word of Hadi-i-Dawlat-Abadi and his followers and guides, remaining occupied with the same vain imaginings as before. Say: Purify your hearts from that which profiteth you not, then turn with pure hearts unto God, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. This is the Day of God, glorified be His grandeur. Believe in Him and be not of the heedless.</p>
<p>O Haqq-Nazar! Thy mention hath been made in the Most Great Scene and thou hast attained unto the grace of God, exalted be His glory. Say: O people of the Torah and the Gospel! He Who revealeth the verses hath come with manifest sovereignty. Today the Mount of Sinai circleth round the Manifestation, and the Blessed Tree hath attained to the fragrance of reunion, and all atoms in those regions cry out “He Who revealeth the verses hath come!” Rapture and mighty ecstasy have seized all. Heaven saith unto earth: “Blessed art thou in that God hath made thee the seat of His mighty throne, honored thee with His presence and adorned thee with His signs.” Trees embrace one another, and rivers flow in utmost joy and delight. The rapture of His Revelation hath overtaken all the worlds of the seen and the unseen, yet most of the people are heedless, asleep and as ones dead.</p>
<p>O Yehudah! Blessed art thou for having turned unto God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O people of the Torah! By God! The Ten Words have been revealed in a single Word, and all things do speak forth this day: “Blessed be the Lord of Names Who hath revealed Himself among His people and in His realm, and honored Moses with His presence and appearance before His countenance.” Blessed be the city wherein the call of the Beloved was raised, and the synagogue wherein His glorious Name was mentioned. Verily, Zion crieth out and announceth unto all things the meeting with the Lord. Jerusalem hath stirred from its place and giveth the glad-tidings of God, its Lord and the Lord of the exalted Throne. O Yehudah! Take hold of the Book with the strength that proceedeth from Him. He, verily, will aid thee, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Isaac! Praise be to God that the horizons are illumined with the light of His Manifestation. We beseech God for the unity and harmony of hearts and souls, that all may unite and arise to aid His Cause. By the life of God! Its victory is dependent upon goodly utterance and righteous deeds. Should anyone speak otherwise, know ye that he is a lying impostor. We are God’s and unto Him shall we return. We have made mention of thee with that which shall endure as long as the kingdom of God, the Lord of the worlds, shall endure.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-Qablih-’Ali! Thy mention hath ever been made and thou hast attained unto His grace. We beseech God to strengthen thee with the hosts of the unseen and enable thee to spread His signs, even as He aided thee before. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Helper.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! The souls mentioned from Shah-Abad and elsewhere have each attained the grace of God. In these days, verses are being revealed without limitation or cessation, and evidences are being manifested without delay. Nevertheless, mention of many matters remains in abeyance. Repeatedly convey the remembrances of the Wronged One to the friends of Shah-Abad and those regions, and extend greetings to them. Say: O friends of God in His lands and His chosen ones in His realms! He hath remembered you and ordained for you in the most exalted Paradise and the supreme Heaven that which shall bring delight to all eyes and vision. Give thanks unto your Lord, the Most Merciful, for He hath manifested Himself, caused you to hear His call, shown you His signs, and sent down unto you that whereby your names shall endure throughout the eternity of His mighty and wondrous Kingdom. Counsel all to perform goodly deeds and guide them to praiseworthy character, that they may attain to that which shall cause the exaltation of His Word and the turning of the servants unto Him. Deeds that are not pleasing are the cause of the dissipation of God’s Cause amongst His creation. To this beareth witness every fair-minded one, every just one, every hearing one, every seeing one, and every informed one. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon them, and upon those who love thee and will love thee, and who hearken unto thy words concerning this mighty Cause and momentous News.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath made the Revelation a magnet to draw unto itself the followers of all religions throughout creation, and through it hath caused all things to proclaim that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been sanctified beyond the remembrance of all created things and exalted above the description of all beings. Every sovereign hath acknowledged his powerlessness before the manifestations of His might, and every possessor of dominion hath confessed his servitude before the revelations of His command. Glory be unto Him, glory be unto Him, above the mention of aught else but Him or the praise of any besides Him. He hath appeared and made manifest whatsoever He hath willed, whereby all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck, save those whom the hand of grace did seize and deliver from the darkness of ignorance. He is the One Who cannot be known through oneness, and the Beloved Who cannot be described by what the creatures possess. He hath established Himself upon the throne and raised His most exalted call throughout the kingdom of creation, whereupon the Spirit did speak at the dawning of the lights of Revelation.</p>
<p>Here am I, O Thou through Whose light of countenance Thy dwellings have been adorned, and by Whose fragrant vesture every possessor of smell hath been refreshed. I testify that through Thee the Path was raised up, the Balance was set, those in the graves were stirred to life, and the Speaker of the Mount did speak. Exalted, exalted is Thy remembrance above the mention of this non-existent, forgotten one. Exalted, exalted is Thy praise above the praise of this remote and veiled one. I beseech Thee by that Name through which every distant one drew nigh, every sick one was healed, every abased one was glorified, every hungry one was fed, every poor one was enriched, every sinful one was forgiven, every ignorant one gained knowledge, every seated one arose, and every tonguetied one spoke forth - to send down from the heaven of Thy mercy upon Thy loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto the precincts of Thy grace and bounty, will aid them to remember and praise Thee, and will enable them to serve Thy Cause. O my Lord! Thou art the All-Bountiful, possessed of great favor. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>And now, O my beloved, what hath flowed from thy pen in praise of God, our Lord and your Lord, our Beloved and your Beloved, hath brought Me joy. This servant beseecheth his Lord to preserve you and enable you to do that which beseemeth the days of God, our Goal and your Goal and the Goal of all the worlds. When I read and became aware of what was contained in thy luminous letter, I approached the Most Exalted Station and the Supreme Horizon, until I attained the presence of the Face and presented what was therein before the Throne. Thereupon the Tongue of the All-Merciful spoke in the Kingdom of Utterance, saying, exalted be His grandeur: […]</p>
<p>O servant! Make mention of him on My behalf and give him the glad tidings of My remembrance, My loving-kindness, My bounty and My mercy which have preceded all created things. We have mentioned him before and make mention of him at this moment wherein the Wronged One proclaims that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Blessed is he who hath inhaled the fragrance of the All-Merciful in His days and hath arisen to serve the Cause with spirit and joy. This is the Day of Utterance. Blessed is he who hath held fast unto it, and woe betide every denying infidel. O thou who art mentioned at the Throne! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He maketh mention of thee from this spot which hath been named the Most Great Prison in the Scriptures and Tablets. We send Our salutations from this Spot unto thee and unto My loved ones who have cast behind them idle fancies and vain imaginings. Say: O loved ones of God! Hold fast unto the wisdom which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Book, then make peace among yourselves. This behooveth him who hath believed in God, the Lord of Lords. Say: Take ye the Book of God as a command from Him, then observe what hath been sent down therein of laws. O people of the earth! Cast behind you the principles of your own selves and take the principles of your Lord, the Possessor of the Final End. Cling ye to the hem of steadfastness in all conditions in such wise that the veils of the parties may not withhold you. Thus hath the horizon of the heaven of proof been illumined with the light of utterance. Blessed is he who hath turned unto it, and woe unto every heedless doubter.</p>
<p>Your honor hath, by God’s grace, attained His presence and been mentioned with that Most Great Remembrance, one letter of which the entire world cannot equal. God willing, may this supreme bounty and mighty gift not fade from your sight and may you preserve it through God’s grace and favor. For this evanescent servant hath repeatedly heard from the tongue of Grandeur concerning the world’s upheavals and changes that which, were it to be mentioned, would cause grief. Therefore at all times I beseech the true Source and spiritual Protector to establish all beneath the shade of the Ultimate Tree and the Most Exalted Word. He is verily the Powerful, the Helper, the Bestower, the Generous.</p>
<p>Your honor should, by day and night, remind the heedless people with wisdom and utterance, that perchance a soul might attain to the goal and awaken from the intoxication of the wine of pride to consciousness. For this is the Day of sobriety, and this sobriety shall appear after obliteration. God willing, may the opposers be illumined by the light of acceptance and may those who have turned to Him observe the divine Will and Purpose. This evanescent one makes mention of all and begs of all not to forget this evanescent one in gatherings where God’s loved ones are occupied with His remembrance, that perchance the hand of power may establish this servant and His friends firmly in this Most Great, Most Mighty Cause. He is verily the Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Another matter: This evanescent one is greatly ashamed at the delay in responding, but God is witness that this was not due to negligence nor from any lack of sincerity. All bear witness that this servant is occupied with writing day and night. In any case, I have hoped and continue to hope for forgiveness from your honor and the other gentlemen.</p>
<p>Another matter: I convey greetings and salutations to his honor Aqa Shahvirdi, upon him be the Glory of God. Some time ago a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed for him from the heaven of favor and was sent.</p>
<p>Likewise, specially for Jinab-i-Aqa Khodadad and Aqa Azizu’llah, upon them be the Glory of God, and some of the loved ones of the land of Kha, upon them be the Glory of God, some of it was sent and some was delayed in sending due to wisdom, and then some obstacles arose. In any case, it has arrived and continues to arrive. God willing, they will attain unto it. They are mentioned in the Most Holy Court and are recipients of divine favors. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid them and assist them in what He loves and is pleased with. Verily He is the Possessor of Names and Creator of Heaven. There is no God but Him, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>News has arrived from the land of Kha, both from before and after. Praise be to God, all are occupied with mention, praise, glorification and thanksgiving to the Truth. While this evanescent servant was occupied with mentioning you and Jinab-i-Aqa Shahvirdi, the command to appear was issued from the Most Holy Court. When I ascended and attained the presence, the Beloved spoke:</p>
<p>“We love to mention him who is named Shahvirdi, that the attraction of his Lord’s utterance may seize him in this Day wherein most of the tribes of the earth have turned away. Verily He is the Reckoner, the All-Knowing. We have sent down for thee a Tablet before, and in these days, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great. Blessed art thou for having turned to the face of thy Lord, attained His presence, and heard the call of the Wronged One from this manifest station. Beware lest anything prevent thee from God, the Lord of the worlds. Pay no attention to the people and what issues from their mouths. Leave them to themselves and trust in God, the Powerful, the Mighty. Soon will God erase the traces of those who turned away and will establish through His Most Exalted Pen the traces of those who have turned to Him, who have cast away what is with the people and taken what they were commanded by the Ancient Ordainer. We make mention of Our loved ones there and give them glad tidings through this mighty remembrance. Proclaim the greatness of God before the faces of My loved ones in Kha and remind them with this beautiful remembrance. The Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have said: ‘Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.’”</p>
<p>God willing, you have ever been and will ever be the recipient of God’s favors and adorned with the ornament of His mention. The two packages of leaves that were sent, one by your brother and the other by Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Ibrahim, upon them be the Glory of God, arrived. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid them and grant them the good of this world and the next. He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>And regarding what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Khodadad, upon him be the Glory of God, it was presented in the Most Holy Court, and he became the recipient of the effulgent lights of the Sun of divine favor. Praise be to God, he was aided to serve the Cause. In these days, mention of him flowed several times from the Tongue of God. Blessed is he and blessed is he who has attained unto this wise remembrance.</p>
<p>And regarding what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Asadu’llah, it was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what the Tongue of the Beloved spoke in reply. He is the Expositor, the All-Knowing […]</p>
<p>O Asadu’llah! God willing, mayest thou be favored with divine grace and be turned toward Him from Whom the people have turned away. This is a most mighty and wondrous day, for He hath appeared in the garment of ‘He’ and speaketh in the station of the manifest ‘I’. Those souls who for one thousand two hundred years and more awaited the Sun of Manifestation, spending their days and nights in lamentation, all were bewildered and dumbfounded at the time of its dawning, and became opposers and deniers, save whom God willed. During this period they would inquire of those whom they deemed to be in authority, asking “What is that blessed Word which shall proceed from the mouth of the Qa’im, causing all the holy ones to flee from Him? What is this Word?” They expressed great bewilderment regarding this matter, and even now remain unaware, still waiting to witness it. Glory be to God! Some fled like frightened wild asses before even attaining the presence of the Dawning-Place of Divine Revelation and the Speaker of Divine utterance, or hearing His Word. They drink from the pool of vain imaginings while remaining deprived of the choice wine of certitude. The Water of Life hath appeared and the Sun of Manifestation hath risen, while they move about behind green and white turbans, bowing down before and worshipping their idols. Beseech ye God that He may rend asunder the veils and guide all to the ocean of knowledge. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O Asad! God’s loving-kindness required it and He made mention of thee. Know thou the value of this precious pearl and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of all worlds!” I counsel thee and the friends of God to manifest supreme steadfastness, for the Cause is mighty great and the Day most momentous.</p>
<p>Say: “Glory be to Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou didst subdue the world and distinguish between the nations, to ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit me in this world and the next. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, clinging to the cord of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee not to deny me that which lieth with Thee, then decree for me through Thy generosity that which beseemeth Thy grace and favors. Verily Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>As for what was written regarding Mirza Jalal and Mirza ’Ata’u’llah, upon them be the glory of God, that they are present - mention was made of them and they were favored with God’s grace. God willing, may they act in accordance with that which He loveth and is pleased with. This evanescent servant conveyeth his greetings to them and to all the friends in that land. The glory be upon you from thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>

<p>O Distinguished Lady Khadijih Bigum, upon her be the Glory of God, take note:</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified from all limitations and the recognition of any soul, befitteth the Lord of Mercy, Who hath raised the standard of “Verily I am God” to such heights that all hands fall short of reaching it and all tongues are powerless, nay mute, in its mention. Through it are all the peoples of the world known, while it is known through its own self. This is unique to this Most Exalted Revelation, whose Day is unlike all other days and whose light is unlike all other lights. In days when all were veiled, He spoke before the faces of the world in such wise that all bear witness. He summoned the entire world to unity and concord, and to that which adorneth the world of being and humanity. He hath, through the burnishing power of His Most Holy Name, purified and sanctified the hearts of His loved ones, and through His All-Powerful Name hath removed from the realm of Baha all rancor and hatred which are characteristics of the divines of Persia. By “realm” is not meant the known realms of earth; within this realm lie concealed a hundred thousand worlds, though all remain heedless and veiled therefrom. A single leaf of its divine Tree speaketh and warbleth its praise in such wise as to draw to it heedless handmaidens and refresh them with the living waters of the love of the Peerless Friend. A hundred thousand blessings be upon the one who hath today attained unto true unity and hath turned his vision, heart and attention solely toward the Most Exalted Horizon. Such a soul hath, by the testimony of God Himself, attained true unity and is illumined by its light. Glory, praise and exaltation be upon the loved ones of God, His chosen ones, and upon the leaves of God and His handmaidens, whom neither the riches of the world deterred nor the ascendancy of the nations frightened, who have held fast to the cord of His grace and clung to the hem of His bounty. Upon them, both men and women, be the mercy of God and His favors, and the compassion of God and His gifts, which have encompassed all existence, both seen and unseen.</p>
<p>And after, the letter of that honored leaf which was sent to the Most Great Name, upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God, was submitted to the Most Holy Court, and this evanescent servant presented it at a special time before the countenance of the Beloved of the worlds. After its presentation, these supreme words flowed from the tongue of the majesty of the Lord of creation - blessed and exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>O Leaf! The Lord of Eternity hath desired the reformation of the world. All bear witness that We have forbidden all from harboring rancor, hatred and enmity which cause division and disunity. The Truth is, in and of itself, sanctified and distinguished above all else. No person of insight would deny this. Beseech the Truth that He may grant eyes the power of vision. However, the ophthalmia of vain imaginings hath prevented eyes from beholding the Most Exalted Horizon. O My handmaiden! By the life of God, that which thou hast heard and seen cannot be equaled by a single verse. The people are heedless and veiled. We have breathed the spirit of life into the bodies of utterance, and the spirit of inner meanings into the bodies of words. Blessed is the soul that findeth and becometh aware - such a one is mentioned as the most exalted of creatures before the Truth. Thou hast ever been mentioned in the Most Holy Court. Strive that thou mayest attain unto that which beseemeth the bounty of the Truth, exalted be His glory. Convey My greetings to the handmaidens of that land, especially those who are engaged in serving the Cause.</p>
<p>The leaf who is the wife of Abu-Talib - upon her and him be the glory and favor of God - had some time ago sent to the Most Holy Court news of recent events in that land. It was seen. Blessed is she, for she hath attained unto serving My loved ones and hath borne hardships in My love and their love, seeking My good-pleasure. We beseech God to assist her, grant her success, and ordain for her the good of the hereafter and of this world. End.</p>
<p>God willing, the Most Holy, Most Great Tablet will also be revealed and sent specifically for the mentioned leaf - upon her be the glory of God. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, He is the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>And as for the mention they made of the honored beloved, Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Abu’l-Fadl - upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God - his mention has ever been and continues to be in the Most Holy, Most Great Court. And this time, after presentation before the Face, these exalted words were revealed from the Dawning-Place of verses - exalted be His utterance and glorified be His proof:</p>
<p>He is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed […]</p>
<p>O Abul-Fadl! Thou hast attained unto tribulation time and again in the path of God, the Lord of all names, even as the Wronged One did experience in most of His days. To this testifieth every fair-minded and discerning soul. Thou wert in the prison of Ta beneath chains and fetters. We have heard from the heedless what no ear hath ever heard, and We have witnessed what no eye in all the world hath seen, and I am the True One, the Trustworthy. Grieve not because of imprisonment, for it is characteristic of God’s loved ones and a practice of God that hath preceded. Thy Lord is verily the All-Wise Expositor. Thank God, thy Lord, for having aided thee to turn unto Him on a day wherein most of the servants turned away and the hearts of those who claimed knowledge without proof from God, the Lord of all worlds, were perturbed. We have remembered thee and do remember thee with such remembrance as diffuseth the sweet fragrance of thy Lord’s tender mercy. He shall deliver thee even as He delivered His loved ones before thee. He hath power over all things. Hold fast unto wisdom in all conditions. We have enjoined this upon thee in numerous Tablets and in My Perspicuous Book. Take the chalice of utterance in the name of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, then drink therefrom despite every heedless and remote one. Remind the servants with wisdom and speak according to their capacity and station lest the clamor of the transgressors be raised.</p>
<p>O Fadl! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. In all conditions hold fast unto wisdom. From the inception of this Cause until now We have forbidden all people and the friends of God from oppression, transgression, conflict, disputation and treachery, for this Revelation hath come for the unity of nations and the betterment of the world. Its benefit returneth unto all, both to government and people. Nevertheless, until now they have not comprehended this evident and manifest truth. This decree hath been and remaineth firm. The Command of God is established and steadfast. Were heedless souls to reflect and ponder even briefly, they would behave toward the friends of God with utmost love, fellowship, harmony and unity. Beseech God, glorified be His majesty, to make the heedless aware and guide them. The heedlessness of some people hath reached such a state that the Supreme Pen is bewildered. For twelve hundred years they claimed to love and beseeched God, glorified be His majesty, for the meeting with the Promised One by night and day. Yet when the clouds were rent asunder by the finger of divine will and the Day-Star of Revelation shone forth from the horizon of the world, all turned away. And now again the heedless walk the same path, that is, the deniers among the people of Bayan. Lo! They are accounted among the wrongdoers in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O Fadl! Repeatedly have thy letters arrived and the servant present before the Countenance hath presented them. The glances of favor have been and are directed toward thee. We beseech God to grant thee divine confirmation and success, to bestow patience and forbearance upon thee. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Verily He shall deliver thee, save thee and draw thee nigh through His grace. He is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant hath ever besought and continues to beseech God, exalted be His glory, for your success. Although the frequency of writing hath prevented this servant from expressing love and affection, yet the heart hath not been and is not prevented. The remembrance of that beloved one hath been preserved and flows from the tongue most often. I beseech God, glorified be His majesty, to make that beloved one’s imprisonment blessed, that is, to make it the cause of the turning of denied souls. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Powerful, the Mighty. I offer greetings and salutations, and I seek help from God.</p>
<p>Concerning what that leaf mentioned about some handmaidens newly turning to the Divine Law, this detail was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. His blessed and exalted Word: “O leaf! The mention of the handmaidens has been heard, and each has received her portion from the waves of the ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance. We beseech God that they may be assisted to preserve what has been bestowed. Great is this Day, and mighty is its station with God. Blessed is the countenance that hath turned to the light of His countenance, and the heart that hath turned toward His horizon. Convey to all the greetings of the Wronged One and give them the glad-tidings of His favors, that perchance the Divine remembrance and mention may detach all from aught else but Him and enable them to achieve that which beseemeth His days.” The lights of the Sun of Grace have, praise be to God, encompassed all, given water to the thirsty, strength to the weary, and blessed the seekers with the lights of His remembrance. Who is the lost one whom His grace hath not sought? Indeed, this evanescent one, together with all the cherubim, the chosen ones and the pure ones, is incapable and falls short of mentioning even a drop from the ocean of His grace.</p>
<p>Regarding your mention of that heedless soul who spoke certain words five years ago - indeed, he spoke truthfully, for the source of vain imaginings had specifically announced that the Truth would appear after two or three years. Now six years have passed, and it is not known what became of that promise. Would that the deluded souls had understood and had not, through such lies, remained deprived of the Dawning-Place. Fie upon them and upon what their mouths have uttered! Truthfulness, fairness and justice have disappeared; they have taken fancy for certainty and fire for light. Such is the condition of the worthless masses. I beseech God to confirm that leaf and make her steadfast in His Cause with such steadfastness that all may testify to it. Until now, naught but goodness, kindness, love, and praise and glorification of God have been mentioned regarding that leaf. To this bear witness the fair-minded and those who hold fast to the cord of our Lord’s gracious favors.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about being unable to free yourself from this anxiety, grief and sorrow except through His all-encompassing grace, this matter was presented. His blessed and exalted Word: “O My handmaiden! Be thou glad through God’s favor. His mercy hath preceded and His grace hath encompassed all. The ocean of His generosity is surging and the effulgences of the Sun of His bounty are manifest and evident. With utmost joy, expansion, spirit and fragrance, occupy thyself with the remembrance of the Goal of all the worlds. Verily, He is with whosoever remembereth Him, turneth unto Him and placeth his trust in Him. He is the Helper in all conditions. There is no God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.”</p>
<p>May God grant that you may ever be joyous and enkindled with the fire of love in such wise that its effects may become manifest and evident. Verily, my Lord and your Lord, my Beloved and your Beloved, is the Compassionate, the Generous, the Oft-Forgiving, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>The honored matron, the Mother of the Sacred House, upon her be the Glory of God, arrived and mentioned that leaf in the Most Holy Presence. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid thee through a power from His presence. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer prayers. Praise be to God, the One, the Single, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. The Glory be upon thee and upon those handmaidens who have turned, heard, and responded on a Day wherein the Herald proclaimed: “The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.”</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Glory and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise and glory be to the Lord of all horizons and the absolutely Worshipped One, Who ordained death as a gateway to attainment and meeting. Outwardly it brings forth agitation and produces sorrow, anxiety and grief. However, by God’s knowledge, it is the greatest means for reunion and the supreme cause for attainment - that is, the attainment of the lights of the revelations of His Will and Purpose. Otherwise, “No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision; He is the Most Subtle, the All-Aware.”</p>
<p>At one time the Lord uttered this supreme word: If the stations of the unitarians, the sincere ones, and those endowed with certitude were to be revealed to the people of the world, even to the extent of a needle’s eye, all would prefer death to life and hasten to the Supreme Companion. Glory be to God! Death in His love becomes the cause of eternal life and everlasting existence. Where are the lovers, that they might hear from the tongue of the Lord that which would cause bodies, let alone spirits, to take flight? In the hardship of death are ordained comforts, and in its torment is concealed an enduring paradise. Blessed is he who attains to a rest that neither centuries can alter nor ages change. For those possessed of certitude, this transfer is the cause of entry into the supreme paradise and the reason for blessings which none but God can enumerate.</p>
<p>My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the cry of the lovers and the yearning of the longing ones to aid Thy loved ones in the stations of affliction and separation to exercise beautiful patience and noble forbearance. O Lord! Make known to them that which was hidden from sight and concealed from the vision of the righteous. Then I beseech Thee, O Ordainer of death and life, to unveil for Thy loved ones what Thou hast concealed from others, and open before their faces the gates of revelation and presence. Verily, Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy spiritual letter arrived at a most propitious moment, when the Sacred Being was about to ascend to His final station. It brought boundless joy, and likewise boundless sorrow, for it bore tidings of the ascension of that Bird of Divine Knowledge to the nest of the Divine Word. God is My witness and the Knower of all things, that this lowly one was outwardly grieved to such an extent that none but God is aware, and likewise was filled with such joy that neither pen nor utterance can describe it. For I heard from my Lord and Master - and sweet indeed are His words - at the time of His ascension: “He was adorned with the love of God and illumined with the lights of His oneness, and the Concourse on High perceived from him the fragrance of the love of God, the Lord of all beings.”</p>
<p>After reading and reflecting upon this, and yearning for ascension in these days, it was presented before His countenance, whereupon He said: “O Abdullah! Upon thee be the Glory of God and His peace. There hath come upon you what came upon this Exile upon first entering the prison. Yet the firm decree of God and His irrevocable judgment ordaineth fire for the wicked and light for the righteous. Were all the world to become pens, and all the heavens and earth a tablet, and all the seas ink, they could not describe the station of them that have recognized His unity, nor the blessings specially ordained for them. Exalted be His glory and magnificent His favors! Yet separation and parting bring sorrow to man. It is clear and evident that after the companionship of months and years, separation and banishment become the cause of grief and anguish.</p>
<p>“O Abdullah! Thy sorrow hath grieved Me, as hath the sorrow of one of My handmaidens and one of My leaves. Verily, he who hath ascended hath taken shelter beneath the canopies of the mercy of his Lord, and dwelleth in communion with God’s chosen ones and trusted ones in an exalted Paradise. We beseech God, the Lord of the mighty throne and the elevated seat, by the hosts of revelation and inspiration, by the waves of the ocean of His utterance and the effulgences of the orb of His bounty, to send down upon him at every moment a mercy from His presence, a gift from His own Self, and a table spread from His side, to adorn him with the ornament of forgiveness and generosity, to accept what he hath wrought in His path, to record for him the reward of attaining His verses and manifestations, and to give him to drink of the Kawthar and Salsabil. He, verily, is the Guide of the Way and the Revealer of the Proof. There is no God but He, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.”</p>
<p>How blessed and pleasing it is for him, for he hath attained unto that for which the world was brought into being and emerged from nothingness into existence. After the news arrived, all the dwellers of the pavilion of glory and chastity were overcome with grief. However, after the manifestation of the Master’s favors and the unveiling of that which was hidden, all became joyful and besought from God, exalted be His glory, bounty, mercy, generosity, grace and kindness for the deceased, forgiven, and righteous one. Especially for the elevated leaf, his mother, each one showed extraordinary kindness. These are signs and proofs of the loftiness of station of that elevated one, upon him be God’s peace, mercy and loving-kindness. At this moment, for some reason, being admitted to His presence, He said: “O servant present! We wish to mention My handmaiden and […]</p>
<p>When the mother of one who has ascended unto God–a companion who arose to serve Me–O leaf, hear thou the call of the Wronged One and be not sorrowful. We love patience and enjoin upon thee gracious patience. The world hath ever been and shall remain the abode of separation, and this separation hath been and is the cause of a mighty reunion. For every parting a meeting is ordained, and for every exile a return is decreed. The world is a realm of tribulation and woe. What nobleman hath it not brought low? Days and nights, and likewise diverse hues and scattered things, all bear witness to its change and transformation. The graves unceasingly proclaim: O dwellers of palaces, forget me not. Strive ye, that through the grace of God, exalted be His glory, ye may bring with you what is required. Death appeareth in every form and calleth out: O possessors of life, let not the colors of the world deceive you and make you heedless of me. Consider the palace of Khosroes, and likewise the Khavarnaq and Sadir of Nu’man. The spider hath made its abode in the place of kings and drawn its curtains, and the owl reigneth supreme. O handmaiden of God, cleave unto the truth and be intimate with Him. One word of His words cannot be equaled by all the riches of the world. Though most deem the world false and deceitful, yet in the sight of God it is true and faithful. At every moment it showeth forth its own annihilation and bringeth its changes to pass before all eyes. The realm of sight and hearing is non-existent and void, that it might hear and see. All testify to its transience, yet they remain occupied with it and heedless of the Truth. The people of truth, with utmost yearning and longing, set out from the transient station to the eternal abode. They live nobly and depart nobly. They behold God as the One Who exists, and all else as non-existent. Reflect upon the favor of the Wronged One, Who hath shared in thy grief and become thy companion in tribulation. By the Day-Star of utterance that shineth from the heaven of the prison, wert thou to taste the sweetness of that which hath flowed from the Pen of wisdom, thou wouldst find patience sweeter, and submission and contentment more glorious and precious than the bounties of the world. Be patient, O handmaiden of God, and say:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having enabled me to acknowledge the unity of Thy Being and Thy attributes, and for having made me know Thy path and Thy balance. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds and Educator of the nations, by Thy Most Great Name, and by Thy Sacred House, and by the ocean of Thy bounty which surgeth in the Sacred Place and Station, and by the Beloved through Whose advent the celestial spheres were honored, to make me content with Thy decree and fixed upon Thy Will and Purpose. O Lord! By Thy might and sovereignty and grandeur and power, were I to become impatient under the manifestations of Thy decree and destiny, I would find myself unfaithful before the faces of Thy chosen ones. I testify, O my God, my Lord, my Quest, and my Object of worship, that Thou didst place in my hands a trust from Thee, and hast taken it back from me by Thy will and purpose. Therefore it behooveth me not to show impatience or distress, or to cry out or lament, or to manifest anything indicating discontent at the return of Thy trust. O Lord! Illumine my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and mine eyes with the vision of Thy signs. Adorn me, O my God, with the ornament of patience and steadfastness. Verily Thou art the One Who chooseth in Thy deeds and Who is obeyed in Thy command. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Praise and gratitude be to God! For every hardship He has ordained comfort, for every abasement honor, for every difficulty ease, and for every tribulation relief. In all conditions His mercy has preceded and His grace has encompassed all. He is the Compassionate, He is the Kind.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseeches the Eternal Truth to grant patience to that spiritual friend, that honored leaf, and other relatives, and to adorn them with the ornament of steadfastness. I send greetings to each of the cherished ones and beseech from the Truth glory and bounty for all. Verily, He is the Generous, the Gracious.</p>
<p>The honored and beloved Ismu’llah, upon him be all the most glorious Glory, yesterday forwarded your letter, and likewise previously forwarded the letter of one of the cherished ones, and has repeatedly mentioned you and your relatives, for whatever is sent to them is forwarded to His presence. Praise be to God, they are confirmed in mention, praise, writing and service. The grace of God has encompassed them. From their deeds and words, the degrees of grace are clear and evident.</p>
<p>Some time ago, this servant sent a letter to the beloved of hearts, the honored physician, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and likewise to that spiritual friend. Now again letters have been sent both to them and to you. The letters containing the utterances of our Master, may our spirits be sacrificed for Him, God willing, have arrived and will arrive.</p>
<p>Convey greetings from this evanescent servant to the loved ones of that land. I beseech God to set them ablaze with the fire of His love, illuminate them with the light of His knowledge, and confirm them in acting according to what has been revealed in His Book. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>As to their question regarding the inheritance of one who has ascended, to whom it should be delivered, and whether the guardian should be from the father’s side or the mother’s side - after this matter was presented before His presence, He stated that it should remain with a trustworthy, reliable person, and this decree is clear and evident in the Most Holy Book.</p>
<p>And regarding divorce, after the completion of the waiting period, divorce is effected, but witnesses are required at the beginning and end who can testify when needed.</p>
<p>Peace, praise, remembrance and glory be upon you, upon those with you, and upon those who have believed in God, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And praise be to God, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>

<p>In the name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted!</p>
<p>Wonder upon wonder, and astonishment upon astonishment, that this evanescent one, this lost one, should at the beginning of supplications, letters, epistles and missives make mention of the Sovereign of existence Who, through one blessed Word, hath raised up this mighty Announcement. Where is the lost one and where the Sovereign of existence? This mention itself hath been and is an error. Should all the peoples of the world desire to describe or praise a single letter of the Most Exalted Word which hath issued forth from the Treasury of the Supreme Pen, they would, if they be fair, confess their impotence. At all times have the pearls of wisdom and utterance been made manifest from the Treasury of His Pen, and the sweet-scented breezes of revelation have wafted from His verses. Yet the sight and smell of the world have been deprived and forbidden, save for those souls whom all that existeth and is visible did not prevent from turning toward Him nor hold back from drawing nigh unto Him. They have drunk from the ocean of utterance and been illumined by the lights of the Sun of Truth. These are the dawning-places of God’s names and the daysprings of His infinite attributes. In truth, mention and praise at this station pertaineth and beseemeth them. The Books, Scrolls and Tablets at this station do testify and bear witness.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O God, Who causeth the rivers to flow, Who sendeth the winds, Who revealeth the verses and manifesteth the clear proofs! I beseech Thee by the revelations of Thy power and the evidences of Thy might and authority, to aid Thy party in a manner befitting Thy days and worthy of their relationship unto Thee. O my Lord! Thou beholdest them known by Thy Name. Adorn them with that which befitteth this supreme kinship and most exalted station. Thou, verily, art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. O my Lord! Thou seest this servant desiring to make mention of Thy Afnan and to describe him with that which Thou hast taught him through Thy bounty and favor, even though he perceiveth his tongue to fall short in making mention of him whom Thou hast related unto Thyself and made to be of the twigs of Thy Lote-Tree. I beseech Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, by Thy Name through which Thou hast adorned Thy loved ones with the ornament of service to Thee, kinship with Thee and aid to Thy Cause, to send down from the clouds of Thy generosity and the heaven of Thy grace upon Thy Afnan that which shall endure throughout the eternity of Thy dominion and Thy celestial realm. When I beheld my powerlessness, poverty and need, I raised the hands of hope to the atmosphere of Thy mercy and the heaven of Thy favors, that Thou mayest remember them as a bounty unto this feeble servant and a favor unto this poor and lowly one. Thou art He to Whose bounty all created things have testified, and to Whose loving-kindness all beings have borne witness. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice unto your service and your steadfastness! The handwriting of your honor, which was the dawning-place of divine love, illumined like light the dwelling place, the spirit and the heart. If I say it was pure and delicate water, I speak truly, for it refreshed the limbs; and if I submit it was the fire of divine love, this is right and correct, for the warmth of love was manifest and visible from all members. Blessed be ye, and blessed be your pen, and blessed be this servant who is mindful and present. God, exalted be His glory, doth witness and testify that at every moment the manifestation of favor from the divine realm of grace toward the Afnan of the Lote-Tree becometh apparent. This servant, as though with every tongue, doth offer praise: “Thine is the praise, O God of the worlds!” In brief, after reading and becoming informed, I sought the station of the Throne, and after attaining the presence of that which was inscribed, was honored to hear the Word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified:</p>
<p>In My Name, the One Who gazeth from Mine all-highest horizon […]</p>
<p>The past year there appeared from the horizon of destiny that which was the measure of God’s good-pleasure. An ignorant one occupied the seat of government in this city, forsaking what is good and practicing what is wrong, manifesting such wickedness that all things secretly engaged in lamentation and moaning. Yet the Wronged One was seen in joy and gladness. Night and day that one uttered base and unworthy words. Glory be to God! Through slight means he was observed to be so heedless as though he possessed not an atom of consciousness nor had been vouchsafed a drop from the ocean of knowledge. O Afnan! Upon thee be My Baha and loving-kindness. Beseech God to guide His servants and grant them awareness, that they may perchance discover their Source and Return and become cognizant of Him. Say: O my God, my God! I beseech Thee by the station wherein Thy most sweet call was raised, and by the horizon from which the Sun of Thy Cause, O Lord of all beings, did shine forth, and by the ears that were blessed to hearken unto Thy call, and by the lands that were honored by Thy footsteps, and by the trees that attained unto the glances of the eyes of Thy loving-kindness, to aid Thy servants to turn unto Thee, to face the lights of Thy countenance, and to draw nigh unto the court of Thy glory. O Lord! Debar them not from the ocean of Thy mercy and from the heaven of Thy bounty and grace. Thou art He Whose loving-kindness hath encompassed all, Whose mercy hath preceded all, and the Sun of Whose grace hath shone forth. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>After being presented before Him there appeared that which is the cause of the life of the world and the reason for the dawning of the Sun of generosity. A hundred thousand pities that the heedless and ignorant servants are unaware and veiled from this most great bounty and supreme favor! What is the cause of awareness and what is the reason for mindfulness? The signs have encompassed the world and the evidences have filled the realm of existence. Power and might have appeared manifest and resplendent before all faces, such that from the first day, despite the opposition and denial of the divines, jurists and princes, the Truth, exalted be His glory, alone and without any veil or covering, summoned kings and subjects to the horizon of His Cause and guided them. Not for a moment did the Tongue of Grandeur pause. How can this evanescent servant be capable of mentioning what he hath seen and heard? Praise be to God! That which hath appeared hath been before all eyes. No fair-minded one, no just one, and no truthful one hath denied or will deny it. Nevertheless, the deeds of the people have become a barrier and deprived them of their Creator. A Kurdish individual in this city was appointed to authority by the government and sat upon the seat of rule. We take refuge in God from his deeds, words and actions! Each day he manifested some injustice and was aflame with the fire of hatred. When he exceeded all bounds, divine justice seized him and the other officials who were his partners and confederates - the seizure of One mighty and powerful. In brief, through two days of authority he prepared for himself eternal retribution. Such is the condition of the people who are as beasts.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Jinab-i-Mirza `Ali Khan, upon him be the Glory of God. His petition was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Threshold. Praise be to God, he had previously been honored with mention by the Supreme Pen, and at this time too, a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed and sent especially for him from the heaven of God’s will. God willing, he will attain unto it and drink from the ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance. Your second letter, which was adorned with the date of the second of Muharram al-Haram, arrived. Its fragrance was the cause of joy and its perfume the dawning-place of gladness. Every letter thereof testified to your steadfastness. This evanescent one beseecheth and imploreth the Eternal Truth to grant success at every moment and to enable him to make mention and offer praise of the Afnan of the Blessed Tree. After being presented again at the Most Holy Court, it attained the honor of being heard. It is evident what the ocean of utterance manifested at this station and what bounties the sun of grace bestowed. Well is it with you and blessed are you! And mention of that blessed day which you made brought joy to all the world and refreshed both spirit and heart. Whatever I might say at this point would not be fitting. Praise be to God, you yourself have tasted its sweetness and become aware of its effects. Through its power the day of sorrow was transformed into supreme gladness. It is hoped that the darkened hearts of the people of the contingent world may be illumined by the light of faith. The heedless people have become veils unto themselves and remained deprived of a hundred thousand outward and inward bounties. Alas! Alas! These two faithless and ephemeral days have held back the servants from all else, keeping them occupied with hell and heedless of heaven. Soon will they behold their recompense when sight is prevented from beholding, the tongue from speaking, the ears from hearing, and the temple from moving. In any case, this second was the first, nay rather was the first and the last, nay rather was the first and the last and the outward and the inward. What a subtle mystery it held within! What a covenant accompanied it! A hundred thousand pities that veils have deprived the people from witnessing, hearing and perceiving the fragrance of these days, and they remain engaged in their vain imaginings, all unaware.</p>
<p>Your other letter, written on the sixteenth of Muharram al-Haram, bestowed fresh splendor and boundless illumination upon the gathering of the friends. After being read and reviewed, it was taken to the Presence and attained the honor of being heard. Thus saith the Lord, exalted and sanctified be He: “O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Thy mention hath ever been made in the divine Kingdom and the gaze of My favor hath been directed towards thee. The Supreme Pen hath testified to thy acceptance and devotion, and this testimony is, in the sight of God, greater than the treasures of the world and whatsoever hath appeared therein. Know thou this and be of the thankful. The servant present here made mention of thy letter in Our presence. From the Dawning-Place of divine favors and the Day-Spring of the Sun of celestial mercy there appeared that before which the ancient boweth down in worship when compared to its newness. Blessed art thou and well is it with thee. And that which testified to My Afnan from thy mother and thy wife, upon both of whom be the Glory of God, was presented before Us. We have answered them with that from which the light of My loving-kindness and the sun of My grace and the moon of My mercy have shone forth. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous. The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon them and upon those who love thee and hearken to thy words concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God that at all times, every moment and every instant you have been and are the recipient of His special favors. This is that bounty which description cannot attain and praise cannot reach. To this beareth witness our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and earths. As to the mention made of Mashhadi Husayn and Khan, upon them be the Glory of God, praise be to God they are adorned with the ornament of faith and are blessed with acceptance. The servant beseecheth his Lord to assist His loved ones in all conditions in whatsoever He loveth and is pleased with, and to ordain for them that which will bring joy to their eyes and gladness to their hearts. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Some time ago two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets were revealed specifically for them and sent. God willing, they will attain unto them and be illumined by the light of the divine words. And one Tablet was also revealed and sent specifically for Aqa Mirza Jalal, upon him be the Glory of God. Let them forward it that he may inhale the fragrance of the utterance and be among the thankful ones. Glory and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you and who have attained your presence and recognized your station before God, the Lord of the worlds. The Servant. On the 24th of the month of Safar 1304. Your remittance of twenty-nine (29) English pounds through his honor the Afnan, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, was received.</p>

<p>O Haji Siyyid Javad-i-Karbala’i, upon him be the Glory of God!</p>
<p>In the name of the All-Knowing Interpreter!</p>
<p>The dewdrops of revelation have trickled from the leaves of the Divine Lote Tree, through the aid of the breeze of the Will of the Lord of Names, taking the form of these words: O My Name! O My Bounty! The Sun of generosity has risen from the horizon of the world. God willing, the intervening veils of darkness that have caused the people to turn away and object shall be dispelled by the fragrances of the robe of the All-Merciful, that all nations may turn with perfect love, fellowship, affection and unity toward the Most Great Ocean. Most people have suckled at the breast of heedlessness and been nurtured on the waters of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Therefore, those assured souls who are well-pleased and accepted, who have drunk from the ocean of certitude and attained the exalted station of assurance, must, with perfect wisdom and kindness, refresh and revive these withered servants from the spring of divine mercy. This is the most exalted station with God, the Lord of all beings. Blessed is he who has detached himself in the path of God and guided the people to this clear and straight path.</p>
<p>Let it be known to you that most of what has been and is being discussed among the people stems from their vain imaginings, from which God is sanctified and exalted. With God is a kingdom of utterance that is hallowed above the understanding of all contingent beings. Thus was a drop from the depths of this ocean cast upon you and Shaykh Sul?an, who has ascended unto God, in the land of ?aff. What is necessary today is that the heart must be sanctified from all the phrases and allusions that are mentioned among the people, and be fixed upon the Tree of Revelation and whatsoever appeareth from His presence. Verily, this sufficeth the peoples of the world.</p>
<p>How many divines and philosophers, after years of searching and waiting, failed to attain their goal, while how many heedless souls, upon merely hearing the verses of the Lord of Names, turned to the Most Exalted Horizon! The example of one who has acquired knowledge but not attained unto the Known is like unto one who might gather countless precious stones yet remain unable to recognize true gold - that is, he knows not gold itself whereby he might test those stones. This refers to one who is truly learned - how much more so those who are even deprived of outward knowledge! For centuries they occupied themselves composing fanciful books and speaking of the signs of the Manifestation. Yet when the ocean of meanings appeared, the stream of reunion flowed, and the sun of grace dawned, all remained veiled save whom God, thy Lord, willed. Such is the state and station of the people. Most of the knowledge possessed by men neither nourishes nor profits. The essence and substance of knowledge has been the recognition of the Known One, and without this, that which benefits mankind is naught. Verily thy Lord is the Expositor, the All-Knowing. Would that the divines might become aware of the defects in their deeds and words! Pride hath so veiled them that they have forsaken that which is with God for that which is with them. Were you to reflect carefully upon what they have said and continue to say, you would testify that it hath issued from the source of fancy and idle imagination. For twelve hundred years and more they made mention of the Qa’im and related countless traditions and reports, yet failed to comprehend even a single letter of the signs of His appearance as they truly were. Every learned one who shut himself out from the ocean of knowledge hath lost, while every heedless one who hastened and drank hath said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Quickener of the worlds!” For years these souls were occupied with manifest and subtle polytheism, yet never perceived it. Those who were created by a single word from God’s Messenger they regarded as his peer or even his superior. Though outwardly some would not admit this, yet from their statements and expressions this matter is clear and evident. Through ignorance they attributed the Most Great Infallibility, which belongeth solely to the True One, to His subordinates. They thus set up partners with God unknowingly, for they were among the ignorant. The station of the Most Great Infallibility is the station wherein God doeth what He willeth. In that realm there neither is nor hath been any possibility of error. Whatsoever proceedeth from the Source of the Unseen and the Dawning-Place of Revelation is and shall be the truth, and naught else is mentioned at this station. For were they to deviate even as much as a needle’s point from what He hath commanded, their works would be rendered vain in that very moment. Verily thy Lord is the Speaker, the Faithful One. Likewise consider the other claims held by that people, that ye may become well aware of their vain imaginings. The Most Exalted Pen hath been reluctant to mention these matters, but perchance the people of that land and others who remain veiled from the Divine Manifestation and the Dayspring of His verses by illusory allusions might detach themselves from creation and all that is with them, and turn toward the horizon of truth.</p>
<p>O My Name! The fragrance of revelation hath been diffused in such wise that it hath perfumed even inanimate objects, and yet most of the servants remain deprived thereof. The call of the All-Merciful hath been raised at all times, leaving not a single one among kings and subjects but that He summoned them unto the Lord of all being with His most exalted call. Blessed art thou, O My Name, in that thou hast arisen, turned towards Me, heard the call and responded by saying: “Yea, verily yea, O Beloved of the worlds! Here am I, here am I, O Desire of them that know!” This is that call for which the chosen ones laid down their lives in their longing to hear it. Some heard it but saw not, whereas thou, through God’s infinite grace, didst hear His call at the spiritual dawn and beheld its Dawning Point.</p>
<p>Remember what We revealed unto thee before. O My Name! Thou hast associated with Me and witnessed the ocean of My tranquility and the mountain of My patience. Consider what caused Me to raise the cry between the heavens and the earth. O My Name! The station of this Most Great Revelation hath not been mentioned, nor hath anything flowed from the Most Exalted Pen concerning this most glorious and most holy station. By thy life! That which was mentioned before or will be mentioned hereafter cannot be compared with it. Were the veil to be lifted, the Kingdom of Names would be thrown into commotion. God is sufficient witness to what I say.</p>
<p>O My Name! Tribulations and trials usually extinguish the fire of longing, yet in this Most Great Prison tribulations are observed to be as oil, causing the flame of God to burn more fiercely. Exalted is He Who changeth whatsoever He willeth by His Word that prevaileth over all things. Observe the people of the world: despite this effulgence, this Revelation, and this utterance which hath caused the Kingdom of Utterance to tremble with joy, these earthen clods have sought to veil the lights of the Sun of Truth. Evil is that which they have desired. Soon shall their dominion be rolled up, and they themselves shall perish, while that which hath flowed from My mighty and authoritative Pen shall endure.</p>
<p>O My Name! Today the Sun of bounty is shining, the ocean of grace is surging, and the heaven of providence is adorned with the luminary of loving-kindness and favor. If thou wouldst observe carefully the Most Holy Book, thou wouldst see how God’s grace hath encompassed all creation in such wise that all means of avoidance and withdrawal have been removed, so that all peoples may associate with one another in perfect love and fellowship. Say: May my soul be a sacrifice for Thy generosity, O Thou the Most Generous of the worlds! The purpose of this utterance is that all may attain unto what is with God. Were the decree of avoidance to remain in effect, nearness would in this case be forbidden, and after such prohibition no one would become aware of that which hath been revealed, and all would remain deprived of the divine verses’ fragrances and the diffused perfumes of the Merciful’s garment. We have decreed with wisdom, yet most have not understood God’s purpose in mentioning it. All corruption, conflict and disputation have been forbidden, so that all may, with spiritual qualities, draw heedless souls to the court of oneness.</p>
<p>During these few years, petitions from all regions have been arriving at the Most Holy Court, with inquiries regarding divine ordinances. We withheld the Pen from mentioning them until the appointed time arrived. Then from the horizon of thy Lord’s will, the Sun of Commands and Laws dawned as a grace upon humanity. Verily, He is the All-Forgiving, the Generous. For divine ordinances are as an ocean and the people as fish, would they but know it. Yet these must be implemented with wisdom. For instance, among the ordinances is the permissibility of music and song. However, should a person from among the people of Bayan openly engage in this practice, it would be unwise, as it would cause the servants to withdraw and create turmoil among the people of the land. Most are weak and far from God’s purpose. Wisdom must be observed in all matters, lest something arise that causes clamor and the braying and croaking of heedless souls. His mercy has preceded the world and His grace has encompassed all beings. People must be reminded of the ocean of inner meanings with utmost love and patience.</p>
<p>The Kitab-i-Aqdas itself bears witness to divine mercy. It has been revealed with such expansiveness as cannot be described, and it is the supreme magnet for attracting the hearts of the world. God will soon manifest His dominion on earth. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Those souls who today gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon and are certain of the truth - if they show laxity in certain deeds or deem them inconsistent with revealed wisdom - should not be dealt with harshly. Verily, thy Lord is the Generous, possessed of great bounty. For example, We have forbidden the public baths of those lands, aiming to keep all pure and sanctified from what is unseemly. Yet this is not possible today, as in no city exists a bathhouse that would be acceptable in God’s sight. Therefore, if someone frequents existing bathhouses, no blame attaches to them. Some ordinances cause no harm if implemented today and all must observe them. Others would cause public outcry, and thus their time is deferred. For instance, teaching the Cause of the Rich, the Exalted One is the crown of all deeds. Yet if someone were to arise openly and speak what would cause people to withdraw and servants to turn away and object, they would have departed from wisdom. For when someone who has clung to certain beliefs for years suddenly hears their opposite without understanding the reason, it will surely cause them to withdraw and object. People must be educated with kindness and forbearance and drawn to the eternal realm. Reflect on the mercy and compassion of this Revelation. By thy life! Mercy itself is ashamed to be attributed to Him, and all discerning souls prostrate before His mercy which they are powerless to comprehend.</p>
<p>We remember thee often and recall the days when thou wert present before the Throne. We beseech God to make thee a magnet for His Cause, that minds and souls may be drawn to thee. He is the One Who caused thee to know His Countenance after all things had perished. Be grateful to Him for this peerless favor. Today, what is incumbent upon all, after recognition of the Manifestation, is steadfastness in God’s Cause - such steadfastness that neither the clamor of the world can prevent them nor the assault of hosts can hinder them. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Supreme, the Transcendent, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>

<p>In the name of our God and the God of all who are in the heavens and on earth</p>
<p>T - Let the honored servant, his eminence Aqa Mirza Abu-Talib, upon him be the Glory of God, take note</p>
<p>I was sitting silently when I was commanded to present myself. When I appeared, the Ancient Countenance turned toward me and said: “O servant in attendance! Where is justice and its standards? Where is equity and its banners? Where is truthfulness and its lights? Where is faithfulness and its manifestations? Verily darkness hath encompassed justice, and tyranny hath usurped the place of equity. Is there any possessor of an illumined heart, a truthful tongue, a pure hope, and a steadfast expectation who would beseech deliverance from God, the Lord of the visible and invisible, the Lord of the Throne and earth, and the Master of the hereafter and this world?” Thus did He speak.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God of the world and Desire of the nations! I beseech Thee by the rain-showers of the clouds of Thy mercy and the pearls of the ocean of Thy utterance to ordain for Thy loved ones that which shall protect them from the tyranny of those who have cast what is right behind their backs and have arisen with an oppression at which the dwellers of the highest Paradise and the inhabitants of the most exalted Heaven have lamented. O Lord! Thou seest Thy chosen ones in the hands of Thy creation, and Thy trusted ones under the command of the treacherous among Thy servants. I beseech Thee by the blood of Thy chosen ones, the cries of Thy pure ones, and the yearning of Thy loved ones to aid us to remain steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that what hath befallen us through the oppression of Thy creatures shall not prevent us. Then cause us, O our God, in all conditions to be among those who have cast aside their own wishes and have taken up that which Thou didst desire for them through Thy power and sovereignty. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant attained that which soared on wings of longing until he reached the threshold of the gate that was opened before the face of all in the horizons. When I perceived from him the fragrance of humility and submissiveness before God, our Lord and the Lord of all things, I presented myself before the Presence and, after obtaining permission, presented it. When this was completed, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, and His sweetest utterance was:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One […]</p>
<p>O Abu-Talib! Upon thee be My Glory! Rejoice in that thou hast been mentioned before the Divine Throne and hast recognized that which the people, despite their searching and waiting, remained veiled from. Thou hast borne in My path what My loved ones bore in ages and centuries past. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have been with thee in all conditions - We hear and We see, and I am the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. There hath befallen thee some of what befell Us. Verily thy Lord is the All-Enumerating, the Mighty, the Wise. Thou hast heard for God’s sake what Mine ears heard, and thou hast seen for love of Me what Mine eyes beheld - eyes that neither slumber overtaketh nor are veiled by the coverings of those who denied the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>O Abu-Talib! Be thou joyous through the bounties of God, exalted be His glory, in such wise that the sorrows of trials and their intensity may not prevent thee from the greatest gladness. This is the day of supreme joy and greatest delight, for the breezes of revelation are wafting and He Who conversed on Sinai is manifest and unconcealed. Blessed is the soul whom the might of oppression hath not debarred from the light of justice. Convey My greetings to the friends in that land. I swear by the Most Great Prison that there hath not been and is not any like unto them. The denizens of the Supreme Paradise speak their praise and the companions of the most exalted Garden turn toward them. God willing, may they succeed in preserving their stations. All must engage in the remembrance and praise of God with utmost joy and fragrance, unity and accord. The light of unity will cause the darkness of oppression to vanish and become non-existent.</p>
<p>What is meant by Pharaohs, tyrants, idols, oppressors, transgressors, rebels and the like that have been mentioned in the Divine Books, Tablets and Scriptures are the ignorant ones of the age who are known as divines. They are the foundation of corruption and the essence of rancor and enmity, for they have been and continue to be the cause of the people’s veiling and the fire of tyranny of these heedless souls. Whenever tyranny appeared from the company of rulers, it was due to the whisperings of these souls, and had they completely submitted to ignorant souls, not a single person of justice and fairness would have been found on earth. In the beginning of every Revelation, they arose in opposition and protest to preserve their leadership, and when the banners of the Cause were raised high and the Sun of Revelation shone forth, they counted themselves among the first believers and exerted mighty efforts to gain control over the people. Blessed is the learned one whom the conditions of the world have not deprived from the ocean of grace. He is accounted among those souls whose mention hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Divine Books. Upon them be the glory of God, His mercy, His light and His bounty.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant is bewildered by the deeds of these heedless and ignorant souls. Hath there ever been witnessed a time, period, covenant or age when the divines of the time accepted the Faith at its beginning? Nay, by the Self of God, the One Who dominateth the world! Do these divines not reflect upon the Revelation of Moses, the Revelation of the Spirit (Jesus), and likewise the Seal of the Prophets (Muhammad) - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - as to what was the cause and reason for the opposition of the divines of the age? In any case, this evanescent servant beseecheth God to adorn them with the ornament of fairness. If a soul were to be even slightly fair-minded, he would never […]</p>
<p>From the beginning of creation until now, no Revelation like this Revelation hath appeared and no eye hath beheld its like. All that was made manifest in the past is as a drop compared to this Ocean. Every person possessed of insight and wisdom will testify to the truth of this ephemeral one’s assertion. Glory be to God, our Lord and your Lord, our Goal and your Goal, our Beloved and your Beloved, and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding oppression, imprisonment and tribulation, in truth such afflictions in the path of God have been and ever shall be an imperishable treasure. Reflect upon the tribulations of kings: when first We entered the prison, verses were revealed from the heaven of divine will with these meanings - as His blessed and exalted Word declares, the Glory of God, exalted be His glory, has withdrawn honor from two groups: the rulers and the divines - as most have read. Likewise, when the light of Revelation shone forth from the horizon of the Land of Mystery, these tidings flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Now observe how the one regarded as the foremost person in the earth - namely the Emperor of Russia - departed this world in utter abasement, as you have heard. And all that befell him bore and bears no fruit. And the new Emperor has been so seized with fear that the poor soul cannot leave his residence, even though that unfortunate one has yet harmed no one nor has any reprehensible deed been witnessed from him. Nevertheless he is afflicted with this most grievous tribulation. Likewise reflect upon the other monarchs of the western realms, how they have all become targets for the arrows of tribulation. The whole world is now consumed with various fires, yet none knows the cause and reason thereof. In brief, whatsoever hath come to pass and continues to pass is due to the deeds they have wrought. This evanescent servant beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to adorn those precious souls with the ornament of justice and fairness, and to protect them from the evil of the corrupt ones. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Glad tidings that beyond the wondrous, sublime, revealed and blessed verses in this letter, a Most Holy, Most Great Tablet was also revealed some time ago especially for you from the heaven of the favor of God, glorified be His majesty, and is now being sent. God willing, you will drink from the oceans of meaning that lie concealed within its words and take your seat upon the throne of joy. This is a most blessed day, yet the people of the world are deeply heedless. According to His command, you must hold fast in all conditions to the cord of wisdom, and preserve whatever holy tablets and letters arrive from the Most Holy Court and from this servant. It would be regrettable were the signs of God to fall into the wrong hands. A secure place must be designated for the divine trusts - that is, the verses and words. Likewise the matter of sending petitions to the Most Holy Court and the revelation of replies must be concealed from all save trusted, steadfast and well-assured souls, for the people are unaware of God’s creation, favor and loving-kindness. They imagine that this Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted Revelation is, God forbid, a cause of sedition and corruption, whereas in all that is revealed and sent down from the heaven of divine will, all are enjoined to what is right and forbidden from what is wrong. A human being must be adorned with spiritual qualities and pure and holy deeds and actions. Whoever does not attain to this station is not accounted as human. May God grant justice that they may observe and reflect upon the traces of the Most Exalted Pen with pure vision and illumined hearts, that they may not be deprived and remain without portion from the ocean of meanings. Convey greetings and salutations on my behalf to the friends in that land and mention […]</p>
<p>This is the day of endeavor, the day of action and the day of service. You must strive to sanctify the hearts of the world, through the Kawthar of utterance, from the doubts and allusions of the divines who soar on the wings of self and desire. Blessed is the one who attains to this most great bounty and seeks this most exalted station and loftiest summit. The friends of God must at all times be occupied with fostering love, unity and the reconciliation of hearts. Once these blessed words were heard from the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness - exalted be His glory: “The sun of justice derives its brightness from the light of unity.” May the heads of all the peoples of the world be adorned with this most luminous and holy crown.</p>
<p>Another glad-tiding is that this evanescent servant, in accordance with the command, turned towards the Most Holy Court, and after attaining the presence, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these words: “O servant present, what were you occupied with?” This evanescent servant replied with faltering tongue that I was engaged in transcribing the verses that were specifically revealed for Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Abu-Talib. He said: “God willing, may they be confirmed in the service of the Cause.” And the service of the Cause in most Tablets has been through mention, praise and reconciliation. Blessed is the soul who held fast to wisdom and clung to consultation. Jinab-i-Talib has attained unto the divine Word and has been honored by His grace. God willing, may he act according to that which God loves. We counsel him and all my handmaidens and servants to show forth the Greater Steadfastness and that whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds, may be exalted.</p>
<p>God is witness and testifier that if all the peoples of the world were to attain to fairness even less than the eye of a needle, they would surely testify that the like of this grace has never appeared in the world. What benefit is there when the doubts and idle fancies of the servants have prevented them from beholding the lights of the Sun of certitude? All are seen to be blind save those whom God, the Forgiving, the Generous, has given insight. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. May the Glory that is manifest and shining from the horizon of the heaven of our Lord’s grace be upon you and upon those with you and upon your family and upon those who have attained unto the days of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Mighty, the Great!</p>
<p>This is a noble Book sent down from the presence of the Mighty, the Wise. Therein is that which brings joy to the sincere ones and causes the hearts of the polytheists to tremble. In it hath been sent down that which enricheth the worlds, should they turn towards the sanctuary of their Lord’s throne, the Most High, the Supreme. Hearken unto that which is revealed from the direction of thy Most Glorious Lord in the Kingdom of Names from the crimson Tree: “God! There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Wise! I created thee for My service and manifested thee for Myself. Verily, thy Lord is He Who ruleth over whatsoever He willeth.”</p>
<p>Hearken unto the call and turn with the most pure heart unto the Most Sublime Vision, wherein the Lord of Destiny and the Fashioner of forms proclaimeth: “Verily, I am the Forgiving, the Generous!” Arise to serve Me and praise Me amongst My servants. Come forth from behind the veil of silence in the name of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, with wisdom and utterance. Say: O people! By God, the Sun of Knowledge hath dawned and the Most Glorious One hath come with manifest sovereignty. Nothing shall profit you this Day, even should you cling to all who are in the heavens and on earth. None can protect you this Day from God’s decree. Detach yourselves from your own selves, then turn with your hearts toward the sanctuary of the throne of your Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate.</p>
<p>Purify yourselves with this water which hath flowed from the Kawthar of the mouth of your Lord’s will, the Most Merciful, from the right hand of Paradise, that perchance ye may behold the Beauty of the Divine in the garment of His Most Glorious Name and recognize Him Whom ye have called upon morning and evening. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken from the horizon of His Most Great Name, as a grace from His presence unto all created things.</p>
<p>Say: Were ye to enter the Most Glorious Paradise, ye would hear from the rustling of its trees: “Verily, I am God! There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Wise!” And from the murmuring of its breezes: “Verily, I am God! There is no God but Me, the Omnipotent, the Powerful!” O blessed is he who hath entered therein and witnessed what was created therein from the presence of the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Verily, the decree hath not prevented the Glory from mentioning the Creator of all things, though at every moment He hath been slain by the swords of hatred through that which the hands of the wicked have wrought. To this testifieth every fair-minded one possessed of knowledge. I was imprisoned only because the Spirit of Holiness spoke in My inner being, and the Spirit of Grace called out in My heart, and the Most Great Spirit warbled in My breast, and the Faithful Spirit pointed to My head. This is the Beloved of the worlds. Were thou to behold My shirt with Mine eyes, thou wouldst see it pierced by the arrows of hatred through that which the hands of the polytheists have wrought.</p>
<p>When We entered the prison, We delivered unto the kings the messages of God, the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful, that they might know that He was powerful over whatsoever He willed and that none in the heavens and earth could prevent Him. Were anyone to hearken with the ear of innate nature unto all things, he would hear their outcry at what hath befallen the Beauty of the Divine from the hosts of the oppressors. When the hosts of revelation descended with the standards of signs from the presence of thy Lord, the Lord of Names and Attributes, then the people of allusions rose against My Self and denied God, the Most High, the Wise.</p>
<p>Arise among the servants in the name of the Lord of the Day of Mutual Calling. Say: O people! Have ye not seen the sovereignty of God and His power when He came upon the clouds with His holy and mighty kingdom? Do ye deny what ye have witnessed of His power and His sovereignty? What aileth you that ye have turned away from Him for Whose Cause ye were created? Fear God and be not of the heedless ones. Is that which your fathers left behind greater than that which hath shone forth from the Dayspring of the Cause, or have ye a proof more manifest than the Most Merciful Himself? Nay, by His gracious Self, were ye of them that know! Say: Leave […]</p>
<p>When asked “By what proof have you believed in God?” you find their heads bowed to the earth. Thus did the sun of verses dawn from the horizon of the utterance of the Lord of Names and Attributes. When you attain unto them, prostrate yourself before God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Behold the idolaters and what issues from their mouths. They say “We have believed in God and His verses.” Say: This is His sovereignty which has appeared in truth, yet you turned away and were among the bewildered ones. You have taken the bitter for sweet and glass for ruby. By My life, your trade has yielded no profit. Soon shall you know when you are brought before the All-Seeing. Say: Were you to be asked by what proof you turned away from Him Who called you unto God, what would you say? Then would their faces be blackened from fear of the All-Powerful, and the dust of fire would envelop them. Verily they are companions of the blazing fire. Do they rejoice in what they possess of the world’s ornaments? Soon shall We make it as scattered dust and leave their wealth to another people. Say: Reflect upon the generations that have gone before you. We commanded them to fear God, but they followed their desires. We seized them for their sins and made them a lesson to the worlds. Thus did the servants before them who denied God’s Cause after its appearance. We seized them for their deeds and left them to hellfire. O people! This is God’s Manifestation among you and His sovereignty unto you. Say: The Daystar of the horizons has dawned, and before it have bowed the necks of all who are possessed of might and glory. Say: Has He not sacrificed Himself in the path of God, the Beloved of the knowing ones? God’s verses and His proof have been sent down, and the Beauty of Divine Unity has appeared from the realm of knowledge and wisdom. Blessed be the Self-Subsisting Who has come today with a luminous countenance. By My Self! The Temple of the Ancient of Days has been established upon the throne of His Most Great Name, and by My settlement thereon have the frames of all contingent beings been renewed. To this bear witness the bearers of the Throne and behind them your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Lead forth the people from the darkness of self and desire in the name of your Lord, the Possessor of all names. Then rend asunder the veils in the name of God, the Sovereign of earth and heaven. If you find one extinguished, draw him near to this Blessed Tree wherein burns the crimson fire and which speaks between earth and heaven and proclaims to all things: “Verily, I am God, there is no God but Me. I have created all beings for My Cause and all existing things for My Self. Those who are heedless of My sovereignty and power wander in the wilderness of desire and are forgetful of the mention of their Lord, the Lord of Names. Verily they are among the heedless ones.” Let nothing frighten you in My Cause. Walk in My footsteps such that tribulation prevents you not from remembering your Lord, the Lord of all creation. Thus has the Spirit spoken in this brilliant, luminous Tablet. A single letter thereof equals not what has been created in existence. Verily it is sovereign over all in the kingdom and dominant over all in the heavens and earths. Take the Book of God with power from Our presence and turn to those who have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say: O people! I have come to you from the Dayspring of your Lord’s will, the All-Merciful, with tidings from God, the Mighty, the Wise. Beware lest you follow self and desire. Your Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious, has come. Turn unto Him and be not of the veiled ones. Remind them of what We have cast into your heart, then spread the words of your Lord with wisdom and utterance, that they might find the fragrances of the All-Merciful from the garment of His name, the Bestower, and return to the Pole of Paradise, the seat of your Lord, the Mighty, the Peerless. If the idolaters turn away from you and object […]</p>
<p>O thou! Grieve not, and remember My tribulation amidst My servants and what befell Me from the hands of the polytheists who would invoke Me night and day. When the appointed time was fulfilled and the Face shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord’s will, the Revealer of verses, they disbelieved, turned away, and were among the abased. Beware lest thou be patient in the Cause of thy Lord. Aid Him through utterance, that perchance the people of the world may turn to the Dayspring of grace, though We see them in a far-off place. Be steadfast when one from the party of Satan entereth upon thee to withhold thee from God, thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Then hold fast to My strong cord and seek assistance from My grace and loving-kindness, and say: “I seek refuge with Thee from the evil of the accursed Satan.” Say: O people! Do ye call mankind to that which ye have named of your own accord while ye forbid them from My Beauty? Woe unto you, O heedless ones! Ye write the verses of God and dispute with Him Who hath revealed them in truth. What aileth you, O concourse of polytheists? The Most Glorious Tongue calleth out from the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing: O people of the Bayan! Did We not command you to be submissive before the All-Merciful, and did We not forbid you from following those who tread the paths of tyranny? By what proof did ye disbelieve in Him in Whom ye believed, and by what evidence did ye turn away from My Beauty after I came to you from the Kingdom of might and power with manifest sovereignty? We made the Bayan contingent upon His acceptance and deeds upon His good-pleasure. Ye have acquired for yourselves that which We forbade you and have neglected that which ye were commanded in a preserved Tablet. Arise, O servants, from the couches of heedlessness and forgetfulness, and turn unto God, the Creator of all things, that He may perchance remit your evil deeds and forgive what ye have neglected in regard to God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful. If thou seest one who turneth toward Him, remind him on behalf of thy Lord. Say: Blessed art thou for having turned to God with a sincere heart. And inform him of the tidings of the Youth around Whom the enemies have gathered and Who hath been imprisoned in this remote prison. Those who have turned away are in manifest error. The forbearance of thy Lord hath deluded them. We did not oppose them despite Our power and We delayed the punishment through Our knowledge. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. We have sent down detailed verses that perchance they may sanctify them from all who are on earth and draw them nigh unto the noble scene. Say: O people! Follow what is revealed unto you from the shore of the Most Great Sea in the luminous spot of the uttermost Lote-Tree, and turn not unto anyone besides Me. Verily He was created by My Word, and this is attested by what hath appeared from the horizon of My wondrous Cause. Ponder on that which hath been sent down from the heaven of might and power, that it may attract you to the beauty of your Chosen Lord and that ye may recognize Him in the garment of His Most Glorious Name through which Beauty was unveiled and appeared in the name of your Lord, the Exalted, the Most High. Blessed is he who hasteneth unto Him; woe unto them that hesitate. Say: Beware lest ye be veiled by allusions from the Lord of Names and Attributes. This is He Whose covenant the Point of the Bayan took in the world of the Bayan, and Muhammad the Apostle of God in the world of the Furqan, and the Spirit in the world of the Gospel, and the Interlocutor in the world of the Torah, and the Friend in the world of the Command, if ye be of those who know. Say: O people of the earth! Purify yourselves with this water which We have caused to flow from the right hand of the Throne, and turn to the Face with the sovereignty of My Most Mighty, Most Holy, Greatest, Supreme Name. Verily the Spirit speaketh not of His own desire, but rather by that which the Spirit of Holiness warbleth in His most pure and elevated breast, as attested by that which hath been sent down from the domain […]</p>
<p>The Most Glorious One calls from the Divine Lote Tree: Hearken, and be not of them that are far removed. Blessed art thou, O thou who hast turned to God! I bear witness that thou hast attained unto that which thy Lord desired. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. With Him is the knowledge of the heavens and of the earth. Give thanks unto God that the Most Pure Vision hath returned unto thee from this glorious scene. Remind the people and gather them, through My might and power, unto My Cause. Thus wert thou commanded before, and now once again. Verily thy Lord is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. Command the servants to fear God, that perchance the fragrances of sanctity may be wafted from their deeds throughout all regions. Thus have We commanded them and do command them from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Say: All Revelations have ended with this Most Great Revelation. Beware lest ye follow any ignorant doubter. Soon shall ye hear a cry from the lands, even as We foretold aforetime. Then shun them and hold fast to this luminous hem. Blessed art thou and those who are with thee from among the loved ones of God. We have written for you in the Tablet that which shall solace the eyes of them that possess true knowledge. Verily, We behold thee in all conditions and are with thee. He is assuredly with His sincere servants. And the light that hath shone forth from the horizon of glory be upon thee, O servant who hath turned unto God, and upon those who hearken to thy word concerning the Cause of thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>He is the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O Fadl! The Wronged One makes mention of thee and gives thee glad tidings of that which hath been revealed for thee from the Supreme Pen in this perspicuous Book, and counsels thee to remember Him, to praise Him and to teach His mighty Cause. This is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down unto all who dwell within the realm of possibility, that He might give them the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds. Say: Verily He hath appeared with the truth and hath manifested what He desired, and hath summoned both kings and subjects unto God, the Single, the All-Informed. Say: This is the Day whereof mention hath been made in God’s Books aforetime, and it hath been named the Day of God, were ye of them that know. Say: Verily He hath appeared with the truth, and He Who conversed upon Sinai hath established Himself upon the Most Great Throne, calling out to the peoples and summoning them unto His Straight Path. Among the people are those who have denied God’s proof and evidence, and have pronounced against Him with manifest tyranny, and among them are those who have perceived the fragrance of the Beloved and have hastened unto the Most Sublime Horizon with a speed that hath outstripped the swift-moving, gleaming, darting lightning. Blessed are they whom the promptings of passion have not kept back from the Lord of all creation, who have cast the world behind their backs and have held fast unto the wisdom wherewith they were bidden by the presence of One mighty and wise. Blessed art thou for having spoken with wisdom when the questioner asked of thee what he desired. Verily thy Lord is the Teacher, the Reckoner, the All-Informed. Say: O people of Baha! Take heed lest the might of names frighten you. Hold ye fast unto that which is good and put your trust in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O Fadl! That which thou didst send to this servant was presented at the Most Holy Court. Praise be to God that He hath enabled thee to observe the wisdom revealed in the Tablets. Excellent is what thou didst utter when thou wast asked concerning that which was asked. All the friends must look unto and hold fast unto that which hath been revealed from the Pen of the All-Merciful. We have commanded all to show forth the utmost love. Blessed is he who hath discovered the fragrance of My utterance and hath apprehended that which hath been revealed in My perspicuous Book. All must conduct themselves with the utmost kindness and mercy towards the servants of God. In such case, should any oppression befall those sanctified souls, this hath been and shall ever be the ultimate desire of them that are nigh unto God and of the sincere ones. Say: O friends! The world hath never had, nor doth it now possess, any significance. Man must inevitably pass through it. Now if this passage be made in the name of Truth, it shall endure throughout the eternity of God’s dominion and kingdom. Convey greetings unto all and give them the glad-tidings of God’s bounties that they may all rejoice and act in accordance with that which God hath willed. From certain souls glory hath been taken away, and this matter hath been recorded by the Supreme Pen in God’s Book. Every fair-minded and discerning person testifieth that whatsoever hath come to pass on earth had been mentioned aforetime. Blessed be the eye that seeth and the ear that heareth. Woe unto the heedless ones! The people of God must, God willing, stand firm in His Cause with penetrating vision, steadfast hearts and unwavering feet, and must conduct themselves with their fellow-men with spiritual qualities. Today virtuous character and praiseworthy deeds have been and shall ever be the supporters of God’s Cause, and this matter hath been repeatedly revealed by the Supreme Pen. We beseech God that all may discover this truth and act in accordance therewith.</p>
<p>O Fazl! Verily the Lord of creation maketh mention of thee, that thou mayest render thanks unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. The servant who was present came before Us and presented that which thou didst supplicate before God, the Lord of all men. We heard and have answered thee through this Tablet, which God hath made the Dawning-Place of life for all who are in the heavens and on earth. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of the utterance of the All-Merciful and hearest that which the Speaker of Sinai hath spoken from the most exalted station, arise and say:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord, my Master, my Provider and my Helper, for having caused me to speak Thy praise and for having made known unto me Thine horizon, from which most of mankind have turned away. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Signs and by Thy Most Sweet Call which hath been raised betwixt earth and heaven, to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty and the clouds of Thy mercy that which will tranquilize the hearts of Thy loved ones in such wise that neither the happenings of the world nor the might of nations will frighten them. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write regarding one of the friends of God expressing sorrow at the believers’ involvement with the art of alchemy - verily he hath spoken the truth. Indeed, right is with him in forbidding this practice. Numerous tablets have been sent down from the heaven of God’s Will and dispatched to all regions concerning this prohibition. It is most strange that despite the explicit prohibition, they should occupy themselves with this futile pursuit that neither nourishes nor enriches. Some souls in Iraq and the Land of Mystery inquired about the known hidden craft. In response, there was revealed from the heaven of the All-Merciful’s Will that which was revealed. This servant heard repeatedly from the Blessed Tongue saying that had the questioners not attributed it to powerlessness and worse, surely no word would have been revealed concerning it, and repeatedly did He forbid the servants from practicing it - a mighty prohibition in the Book. As commanded, thou and the trustees of the Cause should wisely and with utterance prevent the friends of Truth from engaging in this pursuit which is in truth a waste of life.</p>
<p>In most Tablets He saith: Make ye the people of earth aware and guide them to that which profiteth them. Today the heaven of insight is upraised and the sun of knowledge is shining. Let not the opportunity pass, and count time as precious. This is a Day wherein man can attain that which could not be attained by all the treasures of earth in any other day. Today ye hear that which was impossible to hear in other times. Strive ye that ye may attain everlasting remembrance. Such are the compassionate counsels and goodly admonitions of the Beloved of all possibility.</p>
<p>Regarding those souls about whom thou didst write, who were subjected to arrest and imprisonment in the aforementioned incident, it was presented at the Most Exalted, Most Holy Station. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke:</p>
<p>He is the Remembering One, the Compassionate, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Abul-Fadl! The Tongue of Glory calls thee from the prison of Akka and gives thee glad tidings of the favors of thy Lord, the Lord of all names. When thou hearest this, and attainest, give thanks and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds.” We wish to make mention of the friends of God who have been seized and imprisoned without any evidence or decree from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O loved ones of the All-Merciful! Rejoice in that the Wronged One remembers you with this remembrance, from which the fragrance of the garment hath been wafted between the heavens and the earth. Ye have borne for My love what no servants have borne before you - to this testifieth the Pen of God, the Speaking, the All-Knowing. Grieve not for what hath befallen you. That which hath come upon Us hath caused the dwellers of the all-highest Paradise and the exalted Garden to weep, while most of the people remain heedless. They have seized Us time and again, and imprisoned Us repeatedly, and verily He, from the Most Great Prison, before the faces of all the world, proclaimeth and saith: “By God! The Day of God hath appeared, and in it the Hidden Secret and the Treasured Mystery have spoken. Verily there is no God but I, the Single, the All-Informed.”</p>
<p>O friends! There hath befallen you what hath befallen the Very Truth Himself. Praise be to God that ye have not oppressed but have been oppressed. Ye sought not to harm anyone, yet were afflicted with utmost harm. With perfect kindness ye beseeched mercy from God for mankind, yet ye witnessed the force of wrath. Ye desired freedom, yet were led into captivity. All the trees of Paradise cry out “Blessed are ye!” and all the fruits thereof proclaim “Glad tidings be unto you!” If no injustice appeareth from someone and he acteth not contrary to what God hath decreed, then whatever befalleth him in the path of God - the effects thereof shall become evident in the earth like a banner upon the heights.</p>
<p>O loved ones of the All-Merciful! Blessed are ye for your patience, and yours is a goodly beginning and end. How beloved are tribulations in the path of the Lord of Names, and how fruitful are hardships in the way of the Peerless Friend! By the life of God! The sovereignty of the world cannot compare with this station, nor can the glory and riches of princes equal it. How many were the nights when beasts, birds, and predators were at rest in their lairs, thickets, and forests, while ye were in the hands of enemies!</p>
<p>The counsel of this Wronged One is that ye should not let go of this most exalted station. Never depart from the bounds of human nature in any circumstance. Leave the conduct and behavior of beasts and wild creatures to those who are suited to them. Hear and speak not; give, and seek not to receive. God willing, may the standard of justice and the banner of wisdom be witnessed before the faces of each of you, and assuredly through these pure deeds and holy, sanctified characteristics, the lights of justice which have been veiled and concealed by the oppression of the oppressors shall shine forth through the divine name. Then shall ye see the earth transformed into another earth, and the atoms shall cry out with the most exalted call: “The horizon of justice hath been illumined by the sun of the remembrance of our Lord, the Mighty, the Manifest, the Hearing, the All-Seeing!”</p>
<p>O people of ?ad! O emigrants in the land of ?ad! O strangers in the land of ?ad! O captives in the land of ?ad! The Most Exalted Pen hath not been heedless of you. Concerning you there hath flowed from It that which is adorned with life everlasting. That which was due unto truth hath been uttered. That which behooveth you is to preserve this station. God willing, ye shall appear amongst men with utmost sanctity, detachment, compassion, grace and kindliness. No deed hath ever been, nor ever shall be, lost in the sight of God. Those souls from among you who have ascended unto the All-Highest Horizon have attained unto such glory and bounty as all the world is powerless and incapable of reckoning.</p>
<p>O people of ?ad! Hearken unto that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken aforetime and speaketh at this moment that which shall solace your eyes and gladden your hearts. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Your names have been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in numerous Tablets. To this beareth witness the Lord of Names, seated upon the throne of His Name, the Chosen One. There hath befallen you in the path of God that which caused the rocks to cry out and the mountains and hills to lament. Sorrows have overtaken you in this Cause. Erelong shall ye find yourselves in joy from your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Rejoice ye in that the Wronged One maketh mention of you and gladdeneth you with that which hath been ordained for you by God, the Lord of all mankind.</p>
<p>We make mention of everyone who hath ascended in foreign lands while an emigrant in the path of God, the Lord of spirits. The light shining from the horizon of the Will of the Lord of Names be upon you and upon those who have arisen to aid the Cause of their Lord through wisdom and utterance. I bear witness that ye believed in God when every idolater and doubter denied Him. Ye have turned towards the Most Sublime Horizon and hearkened unto the call of your Lord, the Lord of Names, and ye were afflicted with tribulation when the call of God, the Lord of Lords, was raised. Blessed are ye and blessed is he who maketh mention of you after your ascension unto a station beyond the remembrance of all servants. Thus hath crowed the Cock of the Throne and cooed the Dove of Justice when darkness encompassed all the regions.</p>

<p>Praise and glory befitteth the loved ones of the Lord of Names, whom neither the oppression of the oppressors nor the prevention of the preventers hath withheld from mention, praise, service, turning unto God and obedience. He hath confirmed His Amin through His manifest Name and made him the point of reference for befitting affairs. Success hath been and is with him, and divine bounty hath been and is with him. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to increase at every moment his sincerity, confirmation, success and service. Verily He is the Generous, the Kind, Who heareth and answereth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>And then, O beloved of my heart, a letter was sent when you were in the great city, and likewise another letter after that, and this is the third letter. God willing, they have reached and will reach you. Praise be to God, you are mentioned as though you were present before the Countenance. At this moment these exalted words have been revealed from the Sovereign of Names and Attributes - blessed and exalted be His utterance: “O Amin! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Verily We have been well-pleased with thee.” This is that Word which hath been the desire of those near unto God and the sincere ones. Blessed is the ear that hath been privileged to hear this Word from the Supreme Pen. Know thou its worth and station, O Amin.</p>
<p>Hearken unto My call. Thou shouldst appear before the loved ones of God with the utmost humility and submissiveness. Convey to each one greetings from the Wronged One. In the divine Tablets, mention of all hath flowed from the Supreme Pen. Say: O people of God! Know ye the value of these days and arise to reform the world. Praise be to God, ye have attained unto that which hath been recorded and inscribed from the Supreme Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets. His Eminence Amin hath mentioned each one in the Most Holy Court and hath sought for each that which cannot be limited by descriptions and mentions.</p>
<p>O people of God! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and fix your gaze upon the horizon of this word which hath shone forth from the highest horizon of the heaven of the Supreme Pen. He saith, and His word is the truth: He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Whosoever is enabled to acknowledge this blessed and exalted word shall find himself confident, detached and free, and shall confirm whatsoever floweth from the Supreme Pen, even were He to pronounce light to be darkness, or above that or below that. He is the All-Knowing and the All-Encompassing. None knoweth what He possesseth, but He knoweth what the people possess. This is that ornament that waxeth not old and perisheth not. The Son of Mary saith: “Thou knowest what is in me and I know not what is in Thee.” Whatsoever appeareth from the Dayspring of Revelation is the truth wherein there is no doubt, whether it be understood in accordance with outward reality or whether it appear, in the view and imagination of the servants, not to conform to reality - assuredly transcendent wisdom is concealed therein.</p>
<p>O people of God! The Most Exalted Pen has ever been moved to make mention of you. Beseech ye God that there may appear from you that which befitteth His days. Today the mightiest sword in the world hath been and remaineth the fear of God. O My loved ones! Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, through deeds and goodly character. Blessed is the soul that retireth to its bed at night with a heart purified from rancor and hatred, and that seeketh from God the good of all who dwell on earth. Such a one is of the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark. All the atoms of the world bear witness that this Wronged One hath desired the manifestation of this station, yet the people, heedless, have brought about through their imaginings that which hath caused the dawn to darken and the eve to lament. Had the helpless servants been free from the vain imaginings of the ignorant divines, they would have perceived the fragrance of the All-Merciful’s utterance and would have circled round the blessed Word.</p>
<p>O Amin! Beseech God that He may aid His servants, that it may become clear and evident to all that the people of Baha have desired and will continue to desire naught save the betterment of the world. Thou didst make mention of the friends in various cities and regions. All have attained unto divine favors and been adorned with the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. Convey My greetings to those of the letter Ta. If thou shouldst see the Leaf, upon her be My glory and loving-kindness, say: Upon thee be the glory of thy Lord, the Most High, the All-Glorious, and give her the glad-tidings of My grace and mercy. Verily We have made mention of her in such wise as to attract the hearts. And convey My greetings and salutations to all other loved ones. Blessed is the soul that hath arisen to serve the Cause and hath honored, for the sake of God, those who have come. Happy is he and joy be unto him.</p>
<p>In the Tablet of Qaf mention was made of the souls referred to, and likewise of the various feasts held in that land for the sake of God. Illumine them all with the splendors of the light of the Day-Star of the All-Merciful’s utterance. Verily He is with His loved ones, He seeth and witnesseth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Blessed is the soul that hath arisen to serve My loved ones.</p>
<p>Concerning the friends of the land of Kaf whom thou didst mention in the presence of the Countenance, all have attained that which is befitting. Praise be to God, the splendors of the Sun of Truth have encompassed them all. We beseech God to aid them all to preserve that which hath been bestowed. O My loved ones there! Verily Amin hath appeared before the Countenance and made mention of you. We have remembered you in a perspicuous Tablet and have sent down for you that which will draw you nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed is the ear that hath heard My verses, and the tongue that hath uttered My praise, and the hand that hath taken hold of My wondrous Book. Convey My greetings to the loved ones of God wherever they may be found in any town or city. By the life of God! Every heart that hath turned to the Most Sublime Horizon hath been and will ever be mentioned in the presence of the Throne. O people of the cities and regions! Give thanks unto your Lord for this most great favor. Verily He created you and aided you to turn towards Him on a Day whereon every heedless one who was far removed and every learned one who harbored doubts turned away.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, your traces are manifest and visible in this land. Your morning trips to the garden and your evening returns are mentioned by all. They tell of how you were occupied with labor during the nights and days, evenings and dawns, twilights and early mornings. The grace of God has transformed these labors into mercy. The purpose is that these traces have not forgotten and will not forget you. Rather, at every moment they mention the devotion, sincerity and steadfastness of that beloved one. These are heirs who have surpassed all other heirs. Today, whoever has attained unto a single word of the words of God, exalted be His glory, is a true heir. This heir has ever been and will ever be a righteous and pure successor, and throughout the duration of the kingdom of earth and heaven will speak in remembrance of the Father. How excellent is this lofty station and this transcendent bounty! Would that the servants were adorned with the ornament of justice and fairness and would not deprive themselves of this precedent mercy and this enduring, eternal blessing.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the Greatest Hill which was discussed between this servant and you, make no mention of it until such time as it may come to pass or God may bring about another matter. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Another matter: As commanded, obtain a very fine, desirable and distinguished cloak, either from the superior cloaks of Nain or Ahsa, and give it in the name of God to the children’s teacher, Jinab-i-Samandar, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God. For some time ago he sent to the Most Holy Court the handwriting of the children who were studying with him, and he was promised a robe of honor. Repeatedly it was stated that the cloak must be distinguished. Some tablets and papers that had arrived were sent previously, and this time they will also be sent. God willing, they will arrive and be delivered.</p>
<p>At this moment, these supreme words were revealed from the tongue of the Lord of mankind, exalted be His glory: “O servant in attendance! Write to Amin that in all conditions you must be mindful of the exaltation of the Cause of God and move according to His will.” And likewise They said: “To Jinab-i-Afnan, that is Haji Mirza Aqa, upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness, make no mention of any matter and reveal no affair. Whatever he himself may say and do of his own accord, accept it; otherwise, no. O Amin! The Cause is mighty, mighty. Know its station and in all conditions observe its sanctity. The ornaments of the world and what is with the people have been and will be transient. Ask God to grant His servants that which is worthy of His days and befitting His Cause. The Afnan have ever been and will be mentioned. We beseech God to assist them and grant them success in what He loves and is pleased with.” End quote.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant ever beseeches God to grant success to all in what has flowed from the Pen of His Command. The mention of today is different from other mentions, and the deed of today is different from other deeds. Verily our Lord is the Commander, the All-Informed, and the Wise Helper. Glory and praise and honor be upon you and upon those who are with you and who hear your words concerning the Cause of our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and earths. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>Another petition: A barker from Kazimayn named Shaykh Muhammad, residing in Kirmanshah - that wretched one, according to some souls who were heedless and unaware of the Cause and had not even seen the chief manifestation of vain imaginings - has strayed from the straight path and is striving to lead the helpless people astray. Muhammad Ibrahim Qazvini, despite claiming steadfastness for years, harbored between himself and his son the fire of hatred and malice. The late Aqa Mirza Habibullah, upon him be the Glory of God and His mercy, supported the son, and this support became the cause of the father’s withdrawal. Now he is occupied with deception, trickery, and schemes. At present, a knowledgeable person of dignity and composure should proceed to that land, and it would be well if at first he were to associate with some of the notable people of that place, so that gradually he may become aware of the truth of the matter - that is, recognize both the sincere believers and the hypocrites. Thereafter, with wisdom and eloquence, he should invite people to the Law of the All-Merciful. He must conduct himself with great wisdom so that nothing may be obtained from him, such as a letter or writing. Whatever he has with him should be kept in a secure and safe place. It is not necessary for all the believers to know the location of the trust; one trustworthy person is sufficient, for guarding the tongue is most difficult. As soon as multiple people become aware, it will inevitably become known. As commanded, five tumans monthly should reach him while he resides in that land. His Holiness the Name 66, J.M., upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory, and His Holiness the Beloved of Hearts, Jinab-i-Aqa Mulla Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, should consult with that beloved one in the land of Ta. Whomever they designate should be sent. Glory and remembrance and praise once again upon you and upon those with you.</p>

He has attained and taken the choice wine of utterance from the generous hand of his Lord, the All-Merciful, and drank thereof in His name, the Powerful, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>O Hussein! Thank thy Lord and say: “Praise be unto Thee for having guided me to Thy Announcement, made me know Thee, and taught me Thy straight and manifest path.”</p>
<p>We have desired at this time to make mention of God’s friends and loved ones as a bounty from Us, and verily I am the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Hassan! The Ancient Countenance has turned toward thee from the direction of His Most Great Prison and mentioned thee in such wise as hath enraptured the hearts of the knowing ones. The Trusted One mentioned thee before, and We have revealed for thee that which caused the ocean of knowledge to surge in the contingent world. Blessed is the Most Merciful Who mentions His friends and will mention them as a bounty from Him. He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>

<p>And blessed is My other leaf whom We mentioned before through that which the trees proclaimed: “The Kingdom belongs to God, the Powerful, the Compelling.” We beseech God to ordain for you both what He has ordained for His handmaidens who circle the Most Great Throne at morn and eventide.</p>
<p>And We make mention of the son-in-law who was named Hussein with a mention around which all mentions revolve. O Hussein! Thank God for having made thee recognize the Dawning-Place of His verses and caused thee to speak His praise. He is verily the Compassionate, the Mighty, the All-Bounteous.</p>
<p>O Ali Agha! We have mentioned thee time and again, and We revealed for thee before that which brought joy to the eyes of the righteous. The Glory be upon thee and upon those with thee in the evening and at dawn.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Remember when Muhammad, the Messenger of God, came, the learned ones turned away from Him and every idolatrous unbeliever opposed Him. Blessed is the servant who heard His call, attained His traces, and spoke His praise throughout the lands. The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon those with thee, and upon those who have drunk the choice wine of revelation from the bounteous hand of their Lord, the Creator of existence.</p>
<p>O Rida! Your Lord bears witness that you hearkened unto the Call and turned unto Him when most of the servants turned away. I bear witness that you set your face toward the most exalted and ultimate Goal until you attained the precincts circled by the Concourse on High, and heard My most sweet call, and beheld My most glorious horizon. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who loves thee and heeds thy word in this Cause whereby the mountains were moved. Time and again have your letters reached the Wronged One, and We found therein your ardor in the love of God and your steadfastness in His Cause whereby the idols were struck down. Know you who has turned toward you and recognize you who has set his face in your direction? Say: […]</p>

<p>There has come before the Wronged One a letter from one of the divines who have turned to God, and have heard and answered their compassionate and gracious Lord. All are mentioned before the Most Great Scene, and we beseech God to aid them all to achieve that which leads to everlasting remembrance.</p>
<p>As to his question concerning unity, unity in its primary degree is unity in religion. This unity has ever been the cause of the triumph of the Cause of God throughout ages and centuries. Unity is the divine spiritual sword. For instance, if at this time a government were to observe that the majority of its subjects have rent asunder the veil and turned to the Most Glorious Horizon, it would remain silent and hearken to whatsoever is said. Whosoever attains to the hearing of the Word attains to the recognition of God, glorified be His majesty, except such souls as are altogether remote from God’s mercy and are fully deserving of His wrath and punishment. Such souls are in every case debarred and deprived.</p>
<p>Unity in one station is unity in speech, and this is highly essential. Consider, for example, if two of God’s loved ones were to enter a land and speak differently about a matter, this would cause dissension, and they themselves and others would be deprived of the blessing of unity which hath been revealed from the Pen of the Lord of all creation. Among the helpers of God is utterance, both in this Most Great Revelation and formerly. Deeds and goodly character are the hosts of God and are engaged in rendering assistance. If utterance is made with due measure it is God’s mercy, but if it exceeds bounds it becomes the cause of destruction. In the Tablets We have counseled all to utter such words as possess the potency and effect of milk, that the children of the world may be nurtured thereby and attain maturity. Utterance in every station is manifest with a certain effect, and from it the fragrance of good and evil is wafted.</p>
<p>And in one station, unity of deeds is intended, for their variance causeth variance. When this Wronged One was being banished from Baghdad to Adrianople, He entered a mosque along the way where He observed different forms of prayer being performed in that place. Though the word “prayer” applied to all, yet each was distinguished by certain particulars. Had the people of the Bayan truly acted upon that which was revealed from the Pen of the All-Merciful, all upon the earth would have attained the honor of faith. The variance of deeds caused variance in the Cause, and the Cause was weakened. One prayeth with hands folded, another with hands open; one uttereth “at-tahiyyat” in the testimony, another “as-salam.” Beyond these, some dance saying this is the remembrance of God. God forbid! The Truth is sanctified, holy and pure from such remembrances. Consider the Law of the Apostle of God - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - as an ocean from which countless gulfs have been derived, and this hath caused the weakening of God’s Law among His servants. To this day, neither kings nor subjects nor paupers have recognized the cause and reason, nor have they known how that which was lost in glory might be regained and the fallen standard might be raised again. In any case, one gulf is Shi’ih, one gulf Sunni, one gulf Shaykhi, one gulf Shah Ni’matu’llahi, one gulf Naqshbandi, one gulf Malamiti, one gulf Jalali, one gulf Rifa’i, one gulf Kharabati - were ye to count the paths to hell, ye could not number them. Now doth the stone lament, the Supreme Pen waileth. Consider what hath befallen a Law whose light illumined the world and whose fire guided the nations - that is, the fire of His love. Blessed are they that ponder, blessed are they that perceive, blessed are they that are fair-minded. In brief, this variance of deeds hath shaken the foundation of God’s Cause. O people of the Bayan! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. Afflict not yourselves as did the sects of old. Verily He hath sent down the proof and made manifest the way. Beware lest ye differ in that which hath been revealed from the heaven of the Will of your Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. By God! Had there been observed one who could speak or one who could arise, this servant would not have uttered a word. The purpose is that the True One, exalted be His glory, would not have delivered Him into the hands of these people, that is, the people of the Bayan. Therefore take heed, O ye who are endowed with insight! Purify and sanctify heart and breast with the living waters that flow from the Pen of the All-Merciful, and arise to render assistance through the hosts of goodly deeds, pleasing conduct, and divine words. This is the counsel of the True One, exalted be His glory, which hath been revealed and sent down in the Tablets from the Supreme Pen.</p>
<p>Among the forms of unity is unity of station, and it is the cause of the establishment of the Cause and its exaltation among the servants. When superiority and preference appeared, the world became ruined and desolate. Those souls who have drunk from the ocean of the utterance of the All-Merciful and are gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon should see themselves on one plane and in one station. If this matter becomes established and is realized through divine might and power, the world will be seen as the Most Glorious Paradise. Indeed, man is noble, for within all things the sign of God exists, but to regard oneself as more learned, superior, more excellent, more God-fearing and more exalted is a grievous error. Blessed are those souls who are adorned with the ornament of this unity and have been assisted by God. Consider the divines of Persia - had they not regarded themselves as the most exalted and excellent of all creation, their unfortunate followers would not have engaged in cursing and denouncing the Object of all the worlds. Man is bewildered, nay the world is bewildered, by those heedless, artificial souls. The fire of pride and vainglory hath consumed them all, yet they are unaware and have not come to their senses. They have not attained even a drop from the ocean of knowledge and wisdom. Woe unto them and unto that which their tongues have uttered and their hands have wrought on the Day of Retribution and on this Day whereon mankind hath stood before the Lord of the worlds. Should the Most Exalted Pen choose to expound fully the degrees of unity in every thing and every matter, it would need to be occupied for years.</p>
<p>Among the forms of unity is the unity of souls and possessions, and with this station We conclude Our mention of unity, as a command from Us, and verily I am the Mighty, the All-Choosing. This unity is a unity which is the source of joy, gladness and delight, were they but to understand and know. Let not the heedless divines say “To what does this refer?” This refers to all souls, and from this unity emerges fellowship, and this fellowship hath been and remains beloved in the divine Books of the past and present. This fellowship pertains to wealth, not to what is below or above it. “They prefer others above themselves, though poverty be their portion. And they who are preserved from their own covetousness shall prosper.” This station is above fellowship. Fellowship is when man does not deprive the servants of God from that which God, exalted be His glory, has bestowed upon him. He himself enjoys and enables others like himself to enjoy as well. This station is greatly beloved, for all partake of bounty and receive their portion from the ocean of grace. And those who prefer others above themselves - in truth this station is above all stations, as mentioned, and that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an bears witness to this.</p>
<p>O people of God! Shall the Most Exalted Pen lament over itself or over that which hath occurred in the world? Matters have reached such a pass that a mere pond claimeth to be an ocean, and a lizard assumeth the station of an eagle. What hath happened? What smoke hath enveloped the world? Is not the fragrance of the Revelation diffused and distinct from all else? Is not the straight path distinguished from the paths of satanic fancy? Nay, by My Self! The Truth hath ever been, and will continue to be, distinguished from all else through all its attributes and deeds, and hath never been, nor will ever be, confused in the eyes of them that possess insight. The purpose of the unity of souls is the love of God and the Word of God, that all may gather around it and hold fast unto it. Every possessor of insight and wisdom testifieth to that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>The aforementioned unities are each an army among the armies of God, a party among the parties of God, and a cause among the causes of God. The unity of souls from the beginning of creation until now has been and will continue to be the helper and supporter of truth–that is, unity that occurs through God’s command and law. In this station, unity does not exceed this rank. Therefore take heed, O ye who are endowed with insight! The Supreme Pen at this moment counsels all His loved ones to unity and concord, that through it God’s Cause, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, may be made manifest. Likewise regarding wisdom–some of the friends of God have not observed wisdom and have been heedless of its station, and have caused clamor to be raised in certain lands. Hearken unto the Voice of the Wronged One and act in accordance with what hath been revealed in the Tablets. Until ye find an ear, open not your lips, and until ye behold a pure and blessed land, deposit not the seed of wisdom. The utterance of the Divine Word is for the time when hearing and sight are ready, and likewise the earth. Some have at times spoken that which hath injured the very root of the Tree. Say: O people, fear God and be not of the wrongdoers. Fear God and be not of the ignorant ones. Barren soil is not suited to growth, and the ear of polytheism is not worthy to hear the word of Divine Unity. O people of God! That which is the cause and means of the life of the world hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen. Each one must reflect for the sake of God, especially concerning Divine Unity, lest they be like the people of the past who uttered the words but were deprived of their meaning. They were worshippers of names and idols, yet counted themselves among the people of unity and certitude. However, God made manifest that which was hidden concerning the deeds and recompense of those people. On the Day of Reckoning, their exaltation, loftiness, station, rank and unity became clear and evident to all the worlds. O My Name! Convey My greetings to the friends of God on behalf of the Wronged One and counsel them with that which God hath counseled them in the Scriptures and Tablets. Blessed are the emigrants who have emigrated in the path of God until they arrived at this mighty Prison. They have turned their faces toward God and directed themselves unto God. Their reward is with Him Who created them, fashioned them, sustained them, helped them, caused them to know Him, and made them speak His praise and mention. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The splendor shining from the heaven of My mercy be upon those whom God hath enabled to act in accordance with what hath been revealed in His mighty and impregnable Book. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech Him, exalted be He, at the end of this Tablet, to assist them, to grant them success, to aid them with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, and to help them in His Cause. Verily, He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth, and in His grasp are the reins of all things. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>All things bear witness that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath come with the truth in the Kingdom of utterance is verily the Dawning-Place of God’s revelation, the Manifestation of His Cause, the Dayspring of His proof, the Source of His laws, and the Beginning of His signs. He is the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Secret. Through His remembrance the countenance of the world hath smiled, and through His appearance those servants have attained who were not hindered by the affairs of men nor by the clamor of the divines who cast the truth behind their backs and clung to fancy and idle imaginings. There is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O people of Baha in the kingdom of creation! By the life of the Beloved, this is your Day. The Morn of utterance hath dawned, and the All-Merciful is seated upon the throne of proof. Blessed is he whose sight the veils of possibility have not obscured, and whose hearing the veils of knowledge have not prevented. Woe unto him who hath turned away from the Day of God and clung to the hem of those who have denied the right of God, disputed His signs, rejected His proof, and risen in opposition in such wise as to cause the dwellers of the Kingdom to lament.</p>
<p>O friends! Light upon light, favor upon favor, mercy upon mercy, glory upon glory, and blessing upon blessing is this! God willing, may ye not be deprived or forbidden, and may ye preserve your stations through the name of the Lord of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and unseen. Let not the oppression of oppressors, the turning away of those who have turned aside, nor the clamor of the ungodly cause you sorrow. By the Sovereign of existence, ere long all these trappings shall be rolled up, and no trace of these souls shall remain on earth. In the arena of existence and the gathering-place of the world, your mention and your stations, and whatsoever hath appeared from you or befallen you in the path of truth, shall be made manifest letter by letter and be spread throughout the world.</p>
<p>One day a word was heard from the tongue of the Goal of the world indicating that some of the people of those parts had, on account of the clamor of certain unknown persons, withdrawn to the corner of silence. Glory be to God! These fleeting days were not and are not worthy of this. Wisdom hath ever been and still is greatly beloved, but not to such degree as would extinguish and darken the lamps of hearts. In all cases, sanctified and assured souls must bestow new life upon heedless and lifeless souls through the breaths of divine days. Under all conditions hold fast unto wisdom and occupy yourselves secretly with teaching God’s Cause, that perchance the people may not remain deprived. It is most clear and evident that belief and its absence cause no harm or benefit to the Truth. However, should corruption appear or a reprehensible deed be committed by a doer, its harm would affect the root of the Tree.</p>
<p>O people of Baha! God willing, be ye as the sun in radiance, as the mountain in steadfastness, as the ocean in utterance, and as the earth in wisdom, for all bounties appear from it without any movement being observed therefrom. And God willing, may ye dwell and walk with one face in the land of love and the realm of friendship. Whithersoever ye turn, He is with you. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>Honored and kind friend! Your letters have arrived several times by sea and land like refined sugar, and though repetition is not always beloved, truly your repeated letters brought to mind the realm of reunion and recalled the days of meeting - blessed be you! However, this servant, due to numerous occupations of which you yourself are witness, was not enabled to reply until now. But this new letter which you sent from Yazd became the cause of expressing hidden love. After its perusal it was directed to the Most Exalted Horizon and was honored to be presented in the Most Holy and Most Glorious Presence. He said: “O Tahir! Your sighs and lamentations at the time of separation have not been forgotten. Be thankful for this. Strive to act in accordance with what is befitting today, and preserve in the treasury of your heart, in the Name of the True One, exalted be His glory, whatsoever you heard from the tongue of the Wronged One in His presence. Give the glad-tidings of His grace and favor to the friends. Today all must associate with people with perfect wisdom, steadfastness and kindness. If they find attentive ears, they should share the Word; if not, patience is preferable. Outwardly they should be engaged with utmost tranquility and dignity, and secretly occupied in spreading the divine verses, preserving them lest they fall into the hands of the treacherous or be touched by the impure. Say: O friends of the True One, exalted be His glory! With utmost manifestation, appearance, favor and bounty, He commands you to perform deeds whose fragrance will endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. God willing, may you be assisted in achieving what has been revealed in the Divine Book. Verily He will aid you through His grace, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.”</p>
<p>This evanescent servant and other friends must beseech with utmost humility and supplication from the True One, exalted be His glory, that perchance in His days we might drink a drop from the ocean of His good-pleasure. Blessed a hundred thousand times is the soul that has attained to this station. This station is most great, as attested by the Pen of God before and after, and every seeing one possessed of insight and every knowing one possessed of wisdom bears witness to this.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about meeting Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Ahmad, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, in Sarvistan, and likewise the troubles that arose between them - these matters were presented before the face of the Lord of Names. His blessed and exalted Word states: God willing, may all conduct themselves with one another in the utmost spirit and fragrance. Today the horizons must be illumined with the light of unity. That which is beloved at the Divine Threshold, and which in truth has been the champion of the Cause, is the unity of the friends of God. The True One, exalted be His glory, has forgiven all. Therefore, they too must occupy themselves with reconciliation and forgive one another. Henceforth they must fix their gaze upon that which the All-Bountiful has revealed in the Book and act accordingly. This is the most exalted station - blessed is the one who attains unto it and remains steadfast therein. The glory shining forth from the tongue of My grandeur rest upon My loved ones there and there, whom the world could not prevent from the Most Great Name, who cast aside vain imaginings, hastening to the ocean of certitude which appeared in the days of their Lord, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant conveys greetings and salutations to all, and with utmost sincerity has mentioned and continues to mention that which is the greatest means for the exaltation, elevation and perpetuation of the remembrance of all. Verily the servant is the supplicant and God is the Answerer, and He is the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>On one occasion the Tongue of Grandeur uttered these words - His glory be exalted: “O servant present! Jinab-i-Mulla Ahmad is among those souls who attained the presence and witnessed the waves of the ocean of utterance. Ask God to aid him to do that which is pleasing to Him. Indeed certain unworthy words issued from his tongue. We have veiled them through Our grace, for verily We are the Concealer, the All-Knowing. The True One, exalted be His glory, loves His loved ones, and if a fault appears from someone, He shows patience until an appointed time and conceals it. Jinab-i-Ahmad must arise to serve the Cause, detached from his self and from that which his tongue utters, and speak not except what God has permitted him. Verily We desire for him the good of this world and the next, if he acts according to what We have commanded him in My perspicuous Book.”</p>
<p>O my brother! Observe the loving-kindness and favor of the True One - despite His all-encompassing knowledge and witness, He bestows perfect bounty. On my behalf, convey greetings to Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Ahmad and mention: Know your station, for in limited years you attained the presence before the Countenance of the One. It would be a pity for this station to be lost. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, hears and sees, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Henceforth his honor must occupy himself with the remembrance of the immortal King with perfect humility, submissiveness and unity, and speak that which causes the fire of divine love to blaze. In any case, reconciliation is beloved before God. God willing, his honor will act according to what has been mentioned in this letter, and the friends of God who are present in the land of N and Y will arise to effect reconciliation and illumine the hearts of the friends in that land with the light of unity. This is the binding command of the True One, exalted be His glory. Well is it with them that act accordingly.</p>
<p>As to what was written regarding the Huququ’llah, thus far in that land no one has been appointed to receive the Rights of God. For several years the matter of Huquq was suspended, as permission for its collection had not been issued from the Source of the Cause. In recent years this blessed word shone forth from the tongue of the Divine Unity - exalted be His utterance: “Whosoever desires to pay the Rights of God, let the Trustees receive it.” The Trustees have been mentioned in the Book of God, and this decree was revealed and sent down from the heaven of the Cause purely as a bounty, in consideration of certain benefits, and its advantage returns to the servants themselves. Verily He speaks the truth, there is no God but He, the Strong, the Mighty. In the Land of Ya, Trustees are present. Whosoever wishes to act according to what is commanded in the Book, let him turn to them. Whatever reaches them, they will deliver. Blessed are they who attain.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding the loved ones of Manshad, mention of them and the oppression of those devoted souls has flowed from the Supreme Pen. God, exalted be His glory, has mentioned them all with most excellent praise, and likewise mentioned their tribulations and ordeals. However, in the beginning of the Cause, unwisdom was manifest. God willing, henceforth they will be assisted to achieve what is acceptable in the sight of God, exalted be His glory. I swear by the Most Great Name that all the world cannot equal one word of what has been revealed concerning them this year. All the affairs of the world, whether of joy and delight or of sorrow and grief, all pass away more swiftly than that. However, that which has been ordained for the friends of the Desired One is adorned with the ornament of permanence. Blessed is he who has borne tribulations in the love of God, the Lord of all beings. He is indeed among those who are near unto God, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant conveys greetings to all the friends in that land, and this love and sincerity of this evanescent one seeks no recognition, for it has been and is for the sake of God. However, I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist them to achieve what befits the stations of love. The glory that is manifest and resplendent from the horizon of the heaven of the bounty of our Lord, the Possessor of Names and Creator of the heavens, be upon you and upon those who have attained to His firm and wise Command.</p>

<p>Port Said. Let the honored and distinguished Afnan, his eminence Aqa Aqa Mirza Aqa, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah], behold with his illumined gaze.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power.</p>
<p>Praise befitteth the most holy and exalted Court of the Desired One, Who hath created infinite worlds, and all of these have appeared according to the requirements of His consummate wisdom. For each He hath ordained effects, manifestations, signs and laws. For instance, He established the world of grief, and likewise revealed the world of joy, the world of love and longing, of rapture and attraction. And His world of separation which is in truth a consuming fire for lovers, and the world of union and meeting which giveth life to the temples of His servants in both beginning and return. The worlds of death and life, though outwardly opposed and contrary to one another, are inwardly connected by a mighty bond. Thus it hath been said that until a delicate, sound seed changeth and loseth its outward beauty, no verdant fresh ear of corn will spring therefrom. Assuredly, in the destruction of these temples lieth concealed a mighty edifice, and infinite prosperities are made manifest and visible thereby. None knoweth this save the All-Wise One Who hath encompassed all things through His all-encompassing knowledge and His all-pervading and penetrating wisdom. Every utterance and every mention requireth confirmation and proof, save one matter which is in truth the sovereign of all commands and prohibitions, whose truth is as manifest as the sun, nay more manifest, and whereby the hearts of the chosen ones, the pure ones, they that are nigh unto God, and the sincere ones are assured and gladdened - and that is that there hath never been and never shall be any doubt that the Absolutely Wise One would not, without cause or reason, extend the hand of will toward destruction, nor would He turn His attention to construction and edification without proof. Exalted be His wisdom and sublime be His effects, His mention and His sovereignty.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! This evanescent one desireth to make mention of Thy Afnan and console him in what hath come upon him through Thine irrevocable decree, though he seeth this as above his station. Yet, when he beholdeth his being as naught before the revelations of the Orb of Thy Manifestation and its pillars, and whatsoever he possesseth as non-existent before Thy Will and Purpose, he maketh mention of Thee in such wise as would establish Thy favors toward Thy Afnan and manifest Thy grace and bounty toward them through Thy bestowals, and their ascension to the heaven of Thy acceptance and the horizon of Thy good-pleasure. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the kingdoms of knowledge and understanding, and Mover of the ships of grandeur and majesty upon the ocean of utterance, to illumine his presence with the light of joy and gladness. Transform, O my God, his constraint into expansion and his sorrow into delight. Though I acknowledge his patience and steadfastness, his acceptance and contentment with whatsoever hath come and will come from Thee, yet since Thou hast commanded me to make mention and to hold fast to the means, I therefore make mention and hold fast to the cord of Thy bounty, that Thou mayest send down from the heaven of Thy mercy and the clouds of Thy grace upon Thy Afnan, whom Thou hast related unto Thyself and made him the Afnan of Thy Lote-Tree at all times, as a mercy from Thee and a resplendent light from Thy presence. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous, and Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful. O Lord! Thou seest his humility and submissiveness, his supplication and his attachment to the Tree of Thy Cause, and his clinging to the hem of Thy mercy and might. I beseech Thee, O God, O my God, by the river of Thy mercy and the ocean of Thy knowledge and the sea of Thy wisdom, and the mysteries concealed in Thy Book, and the lights shining from the horizon of Thy Will by Thy Command, to ordain for him whom Thou hast related unto Thyself that which will make him a guardian of Thy Cause and a protector of Thy loved ones through Thy power and might. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>May my spirit be a sacrifice for your love, your sorrow and your steadfastness! Your letter was like a wondrous lamp and a brilliant, radiant light, for each word therein was a mirror reflecting devotion, steadfastness and love for the Lord of all worlds - may my spirit and all in the kingdoms of command and creation be a sacrifice for Him. After receiving the sweet fragrance of love and affection from pen and ink, I proceeded to the Most Holy Court where it was presented. Thereupon the ocean of utterance surged and the fragrance of our Lord the All-Merciful’s favor wafted, and two Most Holy Tablets were revealed - one specifically for your honor and the other for the Leaf of the Divine Lote-Tree and those with her, upon her be the Glory of God the Most Glorious. In each, the Pen of Grace made mention of tribulations, visitation, and that which befitteth His bounty and generosity. The gifts and favors are of such magnitude as cannot be limited or come to an end. This servant beseeches his Lord and Beloved to assist your honor with the hosts of grace and bounty and with that which befitteth His generosity that hath encompassed existence and His mercy that hath preceded both the unseen and the visible. God willing, you will attain unto the presence of the two blessed Tablets and, as commanded, after reading them will send them to the land of Shin. In truth, the presence of that exalted Leaf - upon her be the Glory of God - was a sign for those left behind and a comfort to them. From the time that the Most Exalted Leaf, the sacred consort - upon her be the Glory of God, His mercy, His light, His grace, His remembrance and His praise - ascended, repeated mention was made until now of these two exalted Leaves in the Most Holy Court. In these days this fresh news became the cause of grief to the circling men and women, such that it affected the people of the pavilion of chastity and each one besought a fresh bestowal. It is hoped that the remaining kindred who reside in the land of Shin may, through God’s grace - exalted be His glory - be adorned with the garment of beautiful patience and be content with that which hath been ordained by the Desired One. I beseech and implore God - exalted be His glory - to transform the grief of all in this great calamity into the dawning-place of joy and delight. He is verily the Powerful, the Answerer of what is asked. He is the One Who hath named Himself the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Most Munificent, the Most Merciful. His generosity and grace have encompassed all, how much more the branches who have appeared from Him, who return unto Him, who are related to Him and who are mentioned by Him. I mention the honored Star - upon him be God’s most luminous light - both outwardly and inwardly, convey greetings to him and seek for him that which is the cause of nearness and eternal remembrance. And to the other loved ones who are in that land serving your honor, I convey greetings to each one and beseech God - exalted be His glory - for their glory and blessing. Verily our Lord is the Forgiving, the Kind. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Mention was made through your honor’s pen of his honor Ali-Akbar - upon him be the Glory of God - and of his steadfastness, love, [enthusiasm] and occupation. Praise be to God, he is confirmed and surely in the service of your honor he will also acquire that from which true profit appears and is witnessed. On the day of farewell when he attained the Most Holy Court and […]</p>
<p>They have enjoined that which conduceth to the exaltation of station and the elevation of trustworthiness and godliness in that land. They have preserved these words in the treasury of the heart. All this is from God’s confirmations to His loved ones. Should He so desire, He would assist whomsoever hath turned unto Him to reform the entire world, and would seize, through His all-pervading sovereignty, from whomsoever He willeth, all that hath been and shall be. It behooveth the servant to commit all affairs unto Him and place his trust in Him. These are two mighty portals leading to the bounty and mercy of God, glorified be His majesty. We hope they shall be opened before the faces of His loved ones and chosen ones through the key of love and fellowship. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>The letter from the spiritual friend, His Honour Aqa ’Ali-Muhammad, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah], likewise reached this servant and was presented before Him. He said: Let him hold fast unto what We counselled him in Our presence and what We sent with Siyyid Javad, upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of creation. Then shall the gates of blessing from God, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful, be opened before his face. We beseech Him to protect him and assist him in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Counsellor, the Compassionate, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>This servant ever beseecheth and imploreth God to ordain for him that which causeth expansion, joy and gladness. Verily God is the All-Powerful, the Almighty, and worthy to answer prayers. His greetings reached all, and each one returneth greetings and beseecheth God, glorified be His majesty, for might and exaltation. God willing, may they be confirmed and assisted in all conditions. The missive from His Honour Aqa Muhammad, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah], also arrived. As the deed was performed purely for His love, it is beloved. In truth, His Honour Aqa Muhammad is adorned with the ornament of love and sincerity. This servant beseecheth his Lord to increase what he possesseth of affection and attachment at all times. Verily, He is the Giver, the Bestower, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Henceforth, good [cheese] is also found here. God’s bounties are innumerable, encompassing from every direction, and His grace is evident at all times. We beseech God to assist His loved ones, friends and servants to praise and thank Him. Who is able to thank Him as He deserveth to be thanked? Therefore He thanketh Himself with His own tongue, saying “Be thankful unto Me and I shall be thankful unto you.” His is the praise and the glory, and His is the thanksgiving and the splendor at all times.</p>
<p>Another submission: the missive from the honored Mr.&nbsp;Afnan of the land of China, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], has arrived. The tea sent was good and excellent. Glory be to God! The full nature of tea has not yet been revealed - many teas appear desirable but prove otherwise in brewing, and vice versa. However, this shipment has proven acceptable. Praise be to God Who revealed him, established him, caused him to speak, and made his presence a means for His servants to hold fast to his connection to the Tree of His Cause. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist him and reveal to him whatsoever He desires of the wonders of His generosity, munificence, grace and bestowal. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. It is hoped that this prayer will be answered. Since these submissions are for the sake of God, and service to the Afnan is likewise for the sake of God, it will surely be accompanied by acceptance. The lychee also arrived, and it too was superior to last year’s. The Command is in God’s hands - He changes as He pleases and reveals as He wills, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those with you who love you and hear your words concerning the Cause of God, Lord of the earthly realm and the heavenly kingdom.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>2 Jamadiyu’th-Thani 1307</p>
<p>The cherished gift from his honor Haji Niyaz Effendi, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], has arrived. This is very clear and evident - whatever comes from a friend [is good], especially from friends who have drunk from the flowing Euphrates beneath the divine Throne. Their homeland is the shadow of God, their goal the meeting with God, their hope drawing near unto God, their trust in God, and their affairs are committed to God. They began from Him and return to Him, and this is the seal of discourse.</p>

<p>In the name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise be sanctified above tongue and utterance, befitting the Sovereign of all sovereigns, Who through the key of utterance hath opened the doors of hearts and made manifest the mystery of the words “He maketh your highest to be the lowest, and your lowest to be the highest.” The Hand of His bounty hath revealed the hidden pearls of the ocean of knowledge, and His complete power hath bestowed from the heaven of certitude the rains of wisdom and knowledge upon minds and hearts. Soon will its effects be made manifest in the kingdom, and He hath entrusted its watering and nurturing to the hands of His chosen ones. His grace is mighty and His bounty is most great.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God and the God of all existence, of the unseen and the seen! Thou beholdest one of Thy chosen ones soaring on the wings of wisdom in the atmosphere of divine knowledge, and clinging to the cord of Thy love in days wherein most of Thy servants have turned away from Thee. O Lord! Aid him to conduct affairs in service to Thy Cause and in remembrance of Thy praise and glory. O Lord! Thou seest him turning to Thee and drinking the wine of Thy knowledge from the cup of Thy utterance. I beseech Thee to make him, in all conditions, a champion of Thy Cause, a promoter of Thy commandments and ordinances, and one who speaketh that whereby Thy Word may be exalted amongst Thy creation. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. O God! Send Thy blessings upon him and upon Thy chosen ones there, and assist them to triumph in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant, while confined in the Most Great Prison in a certain place, was approached by one of the loved ones bearing thy letter. The servant took it with submission and contentment, and read it time and again. Then I turned toward the horizon of grandeur before the Lord of the Kingdom of Names and, after His permission, presented it before His presence. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which caused the fragrances of revelation to waft and the horizons to become perfumed. His word–exalted be His utterance, exalted be His proof, and glorified be His majesty and power–is:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One, the Stranger […]</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the countenance and standeth before the door! Hear the call from the precincts of ’Akka: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. My proof hath appeared, My testimony hath encompassed all things, and the fragrance of My utterance hath been diffused throughout all cities and lands. As I was walking, the servant in attendance appeared with thy letter and made mention of it before the Wronged One. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which caused the trees to be stirred and to cry out with their loudest voice: O people of creation! The ocean of your Lord’s loving-kindness hath surged. Fear ye God and follow not the sources of idle fancies and vain imaginings. We have found in thy letter the fragrance of thy love. We have made mention of thee with that which causeth all mention to bow down in humility. Behold what hath been revealed in truth, then remind the people of the verses of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Make mention of Him with a mention whereby the mention of all things is raised up at eventide and at dawn, and arise to serve with such arising as shall cause all created things to arise. This beseemeth thy kinship with God, the Lord of the Day of Return. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Countenance when every heedless doubter turned away. Take thou the chalice of eternity in My Name amongst the servants, then drink therefrom in spite of those who have disbelieved in God and disputed His signs without clear proof or Book. Say: O people of the Bayan! Hide not the face of the Sun with your veils. Ye pant after your vain imaginings and perceive not. Fear God and be not of the people of error. Behold, behold how the Sun shineth from the horizon of the heaven of grace! Hearken, hearken how the Call hath been raised to a station wherein the atoms proclaim: The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of Lords! Say: O people, cast aside what ye possess. By God, the Mother Book speaketh from the most exalted station. Say: Do ye sport with what ye possess? Fear Him Who hath come unto you from the horizon of might with a power that the forces of the wicked cannot frustrate. Thus have We adorned the heaven with the stars of wisdom and knowledge, as a bounty from Us unto thee and unto those who have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken when seated upon the throne with power and sovereignty. Convey My greetings unto the faces of My loved ones. We counsel them with that which God hath counseled His servants in the Books, Psalms and Tablets. We have made deeds and character to be as hosts in this Revelation. He unto Whom the Mother Book belongeth beareth witness unto this. Glory be from Us unto thee and unto everyone who hath remained steadfast, whom the doubts of those who disbelieved in God, the Lord of all mankind, have not caused to slip.</p>
<p>The Most Exalted Pen hath turned from the eloquent tongue to the illumined tongue. O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of nearness! Hear with thy inner ear the call of the Wronged One and impart it to the servants, that perchance from this call, which is in truth the water of the mercy of the All-Merciful and the pure crystal stream of the All-Glorious, there might spring forth from hearts the seedlings of wisdom, utterance, knowledge and certitude. The intention is that the tablet of man’s true reality might be cleansed of all traces by this pure and holy water, that it may be adorned with the seal of the blessed word “Verily, I am God’s.” Should they attain unto this station, the fire of rancor and hatred that blazeth in the hearts of the peoples of the world would be stilled, and the horizons would be illumined with the light of unity. Let them fix their gaze upon this station, detached from all else. That which today beseemeth that honored one is to become intoxicated with the choice wine of “Am I not?” and to arise in the arena of the world to guide the servants.</p>
<p>O thou who drinkest the choice wine of My utterance! Today is the day of mention and praise and service to the Cause. Make a supreme effort that perchance the people of Iran may be sanctified from vain imaginings and attain unto the effulgent splendors of the sun of certitude. In truth and in all sincerity I say that today is not the day of questioning. In the Tablet of Wisdom, which was revealed from the Supreme Pen of heaven to one of the friends, these verses are recorded: “It behooveth thee not to turn thy gaze unto the past or future. Make mention of this Day and of that which hath appeared therein. It, verily, is sufficient unto all mankind. The utterances and tokens in mention of these stations quench the fire of being. It beseemeth thee to speak forth this day with that which will kindle the hearts and cause the bodies of the assured ones to soar. He who today is blessed with the new creation and beholdeth the exalted Truth as the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting–he is indeed among those possessed of vision in this Most Sublime Vision. Every seeing believer beareth witness unto this. Walk above the world through the power of the Most Great Name that thou mayest witness the mysteries of pre-existence and discover that which no one hath discovered. Thy Lord is verily the Helper, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>“Be thou as the throbbing artery in the body of creation, that through the heat generated by this motion there may appear that which shall quicken the hearts of those who hesitate. Thou hast indeed associated with Me and beheld the suns of the heaven of My wisdom and the waves of the ocean of Mine utterance when We were behind seventy thousand veils of light. Thy Lord is verily the True One, the Faithful. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the outpourings of this Ocean in the days of his Lord, the Munificent, the All-Wise. We have indeed expounded unto thee, when We were in Iraq in the house of one named Majid, the mysteries of creation, its origin, its end and its cause. But when We departed, We limited Our utterance to this: There is none other God but Me, the Ever-Forgiving, the Bountiful. Be thou a proclaimer of the Cause of God with an utterance which will cause fire to burn in the trees and to proclaim: There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Unconstrained.” Thus hath the river of mercy flowed to one of Our friends who attained Our presence and heard Our wondrous call.</p>
<p>O Rafi’, O Badi’! Upon thee be My glory and My mercy. From the earliest days there hath appeared from this Wronged One that which hath had no peer or likeness. At the beginning of Our imprisonment, purely for the sake of God and for love of His servants, a Tablet was specially sent on behalf of this Wronged One to His Majesty the Sultan, wherein We sought that which would bring deliverance to all and rend asunder the veils. And had His Majesty the Sultan accepted it, all would have turned to the Most Sublime Horizon. However, he did not accept it, and certain heedless ones of the world caused the messenger to be eliminated. Thus was the word of union changed to separation, and a mighty barrier intervened. The Command is in God’s hands. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>O Rafi’, hear My call! Leave behind the world and all that is therein and take what thou hast been given from God. He verily loveth thee and hath ordained for thee that which, wert thou to become aware of it, would fill thee with joy through the perpetuity of God’s Kingdom, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forebears. With all thy faculties arise to aid the Cause. Make a sign with thy brow and eye, speak with thy tongue, grasp with thy hand, and stand firm upon thy feet with such steadfastness that all the forces of the world shall be powerless to move thee or cause thee to stumble. Thus doth thy Lord, the Ancient One, teach thee, and the All-Knowing Commander enjoin thee. Within His grasp is the Kingdom of power and might. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Glorify My loved ones on My behalf and illumine them with the lights of My utterance, whereby every seeker hath sought the ultimate goal and every tongue hath spoken that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken: “Sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed.”</p>
<p>God, exalted be His glory, is My witness that this evanescent One hath ever besought the Self-Sufficient for that which shall cause thy mention to endure among all mentions. And I beseech the Sovereign of existence and the Lord of the seen and unseen to assist thee in dispelling the vain imaginings of the people and in rending the veils of these days. This is possible now, but shall later become most difficult, for the people of Persia, one and all, are attached to vain imaginings, such that even their divines have until now failed to recognize what hath appeared and what hath come to pass. Every person of understanding is astounded by this matter and bewildered. Though all know that from the beginning of the Cause this servant hath stood in service to the Qayyum and is aware of all that hath transpired, yet they seek not his counsel, while accepting whatever may be said by one who hath not been with the Truth. Heedlessness hath encompassed them such that they deny the light of the sun shining in the visible horizon. In this Most Great Revelation there hath been revealed the equivalent of all the books of the past and future, nay more, and the distinction is evident as the sun. I beseech God to bestow justice upon His servants and to free the sun of equity from the darkness of the clouds. He is indeed the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou seest Thy servant clinging to the cord of Thy grace and holding fast to the hem of Thy mercy, seeking from Thee naught save that which shall adorn Thy servants with the light of justice and fairness. O Lord! Thou seest me agitated like a fish upon the sand by what hath befallen Thee from the one whom Thou didst rear with the hands of Thy loving-kindness. I beseech Thee by the breezes of the morn of Thy Revelation, the signs of Thy grandeur, and the sweet savors of Thy inspiration wherewith Thou didst subdue the hearts of Thy creation, to assist him whom Thou hast named Rafi’ to exalt Thy Cause amongst Thy servants through Thy power, Thy might and Thy sovereignty. Verily Thou art the Strong, the Triumphant, the Powerful. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>I convey greetings and glorification to the loved ones of that land, and for each I seek that which leadeth to the exaltation of their being and the elevation of their souls. Verily our Lord and your Lord is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful, and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving. There is no God but He, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. Glory and praise and honor be upon thee and upon those who love thee and hearken to thy word concerning the Cause of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the heavens and earths. And praise be to Him, for He is the Goal of all who know.</p>
<p>=== END BH00475 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00476 ===</p>
<p>The Point of praise and the essence of praise belong exclusively to the sacred and near threshold of that Beloved One Who raised up the heavens of existence through His perfect power and adorned them with visible stars through His eternal sovereignty, so that all things from the kingdom of knowledge and the realm of possibilities might, in their own station and by their own essence, bear witness to that which the King of existence has, in His own Self and by His own Self, testified before all things: that there is no God but He, the All-Protecting, the Best-Beloved. No thing has truly known Him as He deserves to be known, and no one has truly described Him as He deserves to be described, for all that is visible is but a single letter from the Word of His Command which has encompassed the essences of contingent being, and all that is known is but a point of His power which has surrounded the realities of creation. How then can that which was created by but one of His melodies ascend to the heavens of His eternity or climb to the glories of His oneness? Sanctified is His holy Essence from every abstract essence, and exalted is His pure Countenance above every praise and tribute. Then, through the requirements of the establishment of the Sovereign of justice upon the throne of mercy and grace, He created, through pure origination and sheer invention, the Point of existence and the Praiseworthy Countenance, which has been expressed through various terms such as the Eternal Countenance, the Divine Reed, the Primal Point, the Warbling of the Dove, the Perfect Word of Manifestation, the Divine Identity of the Cloud of Unknowing, and the Countenance of Ahmad and Muhammad.</p>
<p>Each one in his own tongue utters praise of Thee</p>
<p>The nightingale through song and the musician through melody</p>
<p>And this is the meaning of “There is nothing like unto Him,” for all have confessed their powerlessness before the manifestation of His knowledge and have gloried in receiving some portion of His grace. Then He created all things through Him, and this is that Same Self of which He says: “Whoso knoweth it hath known his Lord, and whoso witnesseth it hath attained unto his Master.” By the Sovereign of existence and the King of the visible realm! So long as one is veiled from any degree of his own self, he is in the fire - and what fire is greater than this fire, and what remoteness more remote than this remoteness? “Thou art with the Beloved yet knowest not love’s game.” How excellent is what the poet has said: “I left the love of Layla and Su’da behind […]”</p>
<p>And thou hast attained unto the Beloved, the first station. And this very breath is that same divine and universal primordial nature with which all are created, yet from which all are veiled, and toward which all are turned, yet from which all are averted.</p>
<p>O Lord! To whom can one tell this subtle truth in the world,</p>
<p>That wandering Beauty hath shown His face to none.</p>
<p>He is the One Whom ye seek yet find not, Whom ye behold yet know not. This is the purpose of creation, as He saith: “So set thy face to the Faith, being upright, the nature of God in which He hath created mankind. There is no altering God’s creation. That is the right religion.”</p>
<p>Otherwise, His Presence cannot be described by any mention nor characterized by any attribute. That which is mentioned in traditions and writings is but a sweeping for the servants and a word for mankind. Otherwise, “they measured not God with His true measure” and “the whole earth shall be His handful on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens shall be rolled in His right hand. Glory be to Him! High be He exalted above that which they associate!”</p>
<p>Likewise He saith in the tradition: “All that ye distinguish through your most subtle imaginings is but a creation like unto you, returning unto you.”</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no proof of Him save His holy Essence, and no path unto Him save His sanctified Identity. He hath ever been a proof unto His own Self, and shall ever be known through His own Being, even as the Point of Splendor and the Countenance of Glory - may my spirit and the spirit of all who dwell in the kingdom of command and creation be a sacrifice unto Him - hath said in a prayer taught to Ali the Chosen: “O Thou Who hath proved Thy Own Self by Thy Own Self, Who art sanctified above any likeness to Thy creatures, and Who art exalted above any similarity to Thy qualities.”</p>
<p>And again in another station He saith: “Through Thee have I known Thee, and Thou hast guided me unto Thyself. Were it not for Thee, I would not have known what Thou art.”</p>
<p>What the reed-flute uttereth in this strain,</p>
<p>Should I speak it, the world would be undone.</p>
<p>Were I joined with the lip of my heart’s desire[…]</p>
<p>Like unto a reed, I would tell what must be told. This is the collyrium for the eyes of the ardent ones and the light of the pupils of the beloved ones. Should but an atom of these ingredients - which have been drawn from the pure spring of grace, and ground and refined with the pestle of love in the mortar of affection - touch the eye of possibility, it would exclaim and cry out and proclaim: “What is this save a wondrous collyrium!” All that I desire is to spare further labor and to veil and preserve the bride of meaning behind the curtain of words. Yet she remains not still, but raises her head like a banner saying “Here am I!” and declares “Speak, for this is the time for speech, not for sealing the lips, as the listener is one of understanding, not of mere words. Speak whatsoever thy straitened heart desires.” Speak openly and nakedly, for I sleep not with the idol while clothed.</p>
<p>Therefore, be it known that in the realms of unity and the sovereign realm of detachment, there remains neither separation nor union, nor any branch that might return to its root. I shall mention one melody from the melodies of the Eternal Dove, and one note from the notes of the Eternal Chalice, that thou mayest gain a portion of life and recognize the value of this bounty of remembrance. This is that passage: “Glorified art Thou, O my God! All servants detach Thee from aught else save Thee, and all beings sanctify Thee from whatsoever is beside Thee. But I, in my impotence and poverty, have found none other than Thee from whom to detach Thee, and have witnessed naught besides Thee by which to sanctify Thee. By Thy might! Whenever I sought other than Thee, I found it to be nothing, and whenever I desired aught beside Thee, I witnessed it to be utterly non-existent.” And in another place He says: “Can there be for anyone other than Thee a manifest power that is not possessed by Thee, so that it might become the revealer of Thee? Blind is the eye that seeth Thee not! When wert Thou ever hidden that Thou shouldst need an evidence to lead to Thee?”</p>
<p>What can I say when not a single vein of mine is sober?</p>
<p>How can I describe that Beloved Who hath no peer?</p>
<p>In this moment, without lips, I tell to thee</p>
<p>Ancient mysteries anew, now hear from me</p>
<p>Open now thy earless ear at this time</p>
<p>For the mystery of “God doth what He will divine”</p>
<p>Three stations from this matter manifest be:</p>
<p>First separation, then union, and return makes three</p>
<p>This is far removed from the ranks of unity divine</p>
<p>Though such mention from that Being sublime</p>
<p>Is as virtues of the righteous compared to the sins of the near ones</p>
<p>Yet those immersed in the depths of oneness</p>
<p>Find none but Him to mention or describe</p>
<p>Thus doth He say: “Lord, immerse me</p>
<p>In the depths of Thy unity’s sea”</p>
<p>This station hath no shore</p>
<p>And this utterance no bound</p>
<p>How can this non-existent atom</p>
<p>This missing point that hath no name</p>
<p>In any gathering, no mention in any ring</p>
<p>Fulfill this task or express this theme?</p>
<p>This is a rank where His firstness</p>
<p>Is identical with His lastness</p>
<p>His outwardness the same as His inwardness</p>
<p>All words in this station are one reality</p>
<p>All differences but one name</p>
<p>And none knoweth how this can be</p>
<p>Save him whom God hath shown the creation of His Self</p>
<p>The shadows that seek after light</p>
<p>Vanish when His light doth shine bright</p>
<p>In this presence minds are lost aright</p>
<p>When the Pen reached this point it broke; therefore it is best that we seek from Him a share of this melody of grace and a portion of this draught of mercy, that we may become detached from all else and close the door of existence to all but Him, that we may become established in the dominion of glory and partake of the fruits of the tree of bounty and drink from the crystal springs of loving-kindness. As He says: “O my God! Grant me complete severance from all else save Thee, and enlighten the eyes of our hearts with the light of beholding Thee, that the eyes of the heart may burn away the veils of light and attain to the source of grandeur and joy, and that our spirits may become suspended in the glory of Thy holy splendor.”</p>
<p>Therefore, seeking Him is better than all stations, and mentioning His love is more beloved than all remembrances. O Thou Dawning-Place of Knowledge and Countenance of Forbearance!</p>
<p>Listen now, for the lover approaches,</p>
<p>Bound by His love with a rope of palm fiber.</p>
<p>This is the call of the enraptured lover that was raised in the thickets of the Psalms. I make mention of this that the manner in which His honored servants have clung to Him and kindled the fire of love may become known, that perchance the holy fragrances may attract thee and bring thee to the station of intimacy. But look with the eye of purpose, not with the eye of that which is abrogated, for He says: “Our command is but one.”</p>
<p>In the prayer of Kumayl ibn Ziyad an-Nakha’i, He mentions this passage: “Until all my deeds and my devotions become one devotion, and my condition in Thy service becomes eternal.” By His glory, O Point of Praise, if thou wouldst taste the sweetness of that station, thou wouldst never neglect it, even wert thou to be cut to pieces.</p>
<p>These are the passages that have been translated into Arabic: How excellent, O my God, is that which the nightingale of David sang in the garden of the Psalms, from the warbling of the dove of attraction upon visiting Thy countenance! O joy that Thy fire of oneness was kindled in the essence of Thine eternity!</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Remove me not far from Thee, for tribulations have encompassed me entirely. O my God, my God! Leave me not to myself, for calamities have wholly seized me. Give me to drink from the pure milk of Thy bounty, for thirsts have utterly consumed me. Shelter me beneath the wings of Thy mercy, for poverty has severely touched me. Feed me from the fruits of the tree of Thine eternity, for weakness has fully drawn near to me. Immerse me in the seas of forgiveness before the surging whale of majesty, for sins like mountains have caused my death.</p>
<p>O Ayaz, through Thy pain I have become as hair […]</p>
<p>I remained grief-stricken - tell my tale</p>
<p>Many a love story of Thine I have read with my soul</p>
<p>As I have become a tale, now read me</p>
<p>Thou readest, not I, O Guide</p>
<p>I am the Mount and Thou art Moses - this call</p>
<p>In confirmation of “beauty belongs to the beautiful,” whatever unique mention there is belongs to that Being, for Thou art the beginning and end of goodness, its source and its mine, since none is witnessed but Thee and none is mentioned but You. They tell of the mystic Nuri that one day he was earnestly searching and examining by a grave. They asked what he was doing. He replied: “Other than what people do.” The questioner grew more perplexed and pressed further. Then he said: “O brother, people seek God and find Him not, while I seek other than Him and find not what I seek.”</p>
<p>This breath of life has lifted my garment’s hem</p>
<p>Having caught the fragrance of Joseph’s raiment</p>
<p>At this point my pen was struck down, and I say: “Glory be unto Thee! I am of those who repent and seek forgiveness.” And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>In the name of Him Who is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Impregnable, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath decreed separation for the lovers, and through their yearning hath drawn unto Him all who dwell in the horizons. Exalted is He Who hath appeared with this effulgence, whereby was made manifest the station of him who fulfilled the Covenant on the day of separation. He is the One Whose praise cannot be recorded by pens nor completed through pages.</p>
<p>O My loved one! By the life of God, the fire of thy love hath ignited My limbs and joints, and its flames play in every vein of My being even as the rays of the sun play amidst the trees. Glorified be He Who kindled the fire of His love in thy heart, and exalted be He Who cast upon thee that which took thee from thyself and made thee attracted by His fragrances, trembling from His sweet savours, and intoxicated with the wine of His love.</p>
<p>By thy life! Thy letter hath taken complete possession of My heart, through it My soul was gladdened and My breast was dilated, and the bird of My love took wing, for it was redolent with the fragrance of the love of our Beloved, your Beloved, and the Beloved of all the worlds. The Servant beareth witness that He found in thy letter naught but pure love and affection, and dedication to the service of the Cause of God, the Lord of creation. I beseech God, My Lord, to give you to drink, at all times, from the ocean of His wondrous favors and the gems of His grace. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Answerer of prayers.</p>
<p>When the cup of your love, which lay concealed in the depths of your words, seized Me, I set aside what I had written and took what you had sent to the Most Exalted Station and the Ultimate Goal. When I appeared before His presence, I stood before His countenance, whereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke: “What is that in thy right hand?” I submitted: “This is a petition from one who hath arisen to serve Thy Cause and hath voiced Thy praise among Thy servants, who hath appeared before the Throne by Thy command and departed with Thy leave.” And I presented before His presence that wherewith thou didst praise God, the Lord of the worlds, and that wherewith thou didst call upon the Beloved of the mystics, and that wherewith thou didst commune with the Desired One of all seekers. When this was completed, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke once again, and from the heaven of grace shone forth the suns of loving-kindness, compassion, mercy and bounty. This is what was uttered by the Lord of Eternity:</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great […]</p>
<p>O Warqa! The servant hath appeared before Us and presented what was in thy letter. Verily, We found it a mirror reflecting thy love for the Beloved of the world and thy devotion to Him. Blessed art thou for having drawn nigh, for having drunk, and for having attained. Verily thy Lord is the One Who maketh manifest, the Manifest. We have witnessed the fire that hath encompassed thee in thy love for thy Lord, and We have seen its flames and heard its roaring. Exalted is He Who kindled it, Who set it ablaze, and Who caused it to appear. He is the Omnipotent before Whose power the essence of might itself confesseth its powerlessness. Verily thy Lord is He Who heareth and seeth; He is the All-Informed. Rejoice in that the Wronged One remembereth thee as He remembered thee before, and in this moment wherein He walketh and saith: “I have found the fragrance of thy love and witnessed thy sincerity and humility, for thy heart was mindful of My remembrance and thy tongue was praising Me with beautiful praise.” Thus hath the ocean of life overflowed that thou mayest rejoice in the days of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>O Warqa! Thy call hath been heard and thy letter was presented before the Throne. Praise be to God that from it were witnessed the burning flames of the love of God. God willing, thou shalt forever and always be delighting in the mention of the Friend, drinking in His name, finding rest in His remembrance, and occupied with thoughts of Him, that perchance distant souls may draw near to the ocean of nearness and weary souls may hasten, through the heat of the Word, toward that direction which is sanctified from [all directions]. Some of the faithful are observed to be sorrowful, nay, fearful, due to the occurrence in the Land of ?ad, whereas the hand of God’s power especially raised them up and showered upon them from the heaven of mercy and the clouds of grace the rains of blessing and bounty, and His complete power adorned them with the ornament of glory amidst mankind, such that the tongues of the sincere ones and those drawn nigh spoke in their praise, and they attained to such a station that even enemies bore witness to the loftiness of their rank, and in [their final] days they attained to the most exalted and supreme station, which is the greatest martyrdom - a station which the chosen ones and friends of God have forever yearned for and sought after. Nevertheless, some are seen to be troubled and grieved. God willing, this sorrow hath appeared due to love for them. By the ocean of inner meanings! If the station of but one servant among their servants who are now engaged in service were to be revealed, all the peoples of the earth would be thunderstruck. Blessed is he who reflecteth upon what hath come to pass, that he may become aware of the greatness of the Cause and its sovereignty. This station which they attained was what they themselves had beseeched from God, exalted be His glory, and what they had sought after with the utmost eagerness and longing. Say: O friends! Ye have endured much in the path of love for the Beloved of the worlds. Ye have witnessed what was not fit to be seen, and have heard what was not worthy to be heard, and in the path of the Friend ye have borne matters which were in truth heavier than mountains. Blessed be your appearance, your eyes, and your ears for what they have borne, seen, and heard. Now, know ye the worth of this most exalted and sublime station and waste it not. In every case, this world is transient and all who dwell therein shall fall under the claws of death, and all that is therein shall be afflicted by the talons of change. Beseech ye God, exalted be His glory, at all times to preserve you and keep you steadfast on the path of His Cause. Know ye this much, that whatsoever is in His path […]</p>
<p>That which ye have endured, and have witnessed and heard, hath been through His grace and favor, wherewith ye have been specially endowed. His mention of you in the Tablets hath been and shall continue to be yet another token of His grace. Ye have drunk the cup of tribulation in His path; drink ye now the choice wine from the cups of His remembrance and bounty. God willing, may ye be enabled to serve His Cause. We counsel all to manifest praiseworthy character, goodly deeds, and befitting and commendable actions. In this day it behooveth each one to hold fast unto that which will promote the Cause of God and to cleave thereunto. Say: Thus much do we declare, and leave the rest to your fairness to judge what beseemeth such a Day. Be not grieved by outward weakness, abasement and distraction. I swear by the Sun in the heaven of independence that glory, wealth and riches circle round about you, making mention of you and inclining toward you. Though by divine wisdom their manifestation may remain concealed for a time, days shall come when each one shall shine forth even as the sun in splendor and brilliance. We beseech God that the people may attain unto the sweetness of divine utterances and truly discover it. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon thy brother and upon My name who gave up his spirit in My path and dwelleth in the precincts of My mercy.</p>
<p>We make mention, at the end of this epistle, of thy brother who turned his face toward My countenance and stood before the gate of My grandeur and heard My wondrous and glorious call. God willing, may that which hath been mentioned not fade from their sight. May they rest assured of divine favors and drink at all times from the choice wine of remembrance and keep their gaze fixed upon His direction. God willing, may the mention of love and unity not depart from sight.</p>
<p>In this place We make mention of him who was named Kazim, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of God, the Most High, the Most Great. Blessed art thou and blessed is thy brother who was martyred in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. Behold, then call to mind Our servant Kazim who was martyred in the land of ?ad - a martyrdom at whose tragedy the atoms of creation wept, and beyond them the Concourse on High and the dwellers in the cities of Names. Thy Lord, the All-Seeing, the All-Informed, beareth witness to this.</p>
<p>O Kazim! Reflect upon God’s loving-kindness and observe His mercy that hath preceded all creation. Ponder the blessed word that was revealed in the Book of ?a and Sin. He saith, and His word is the truth: “Whoso is for God, God is for him.” And since those holy souls forsook the world and all who dwell therein for the sake of the Lord of Oneness, and attained unto the chalice of martyrdom which is in truth the most exalted cup, the Supreme Pen is seen to be engaged in their remembrance morn and eve. I swear by the Sun of the Kingdom of Utterance that were the scratching of the Supreme Pen truly heard by hearing ears, all people would rush forth from their homes, crying “Here am I, O my God, here am I!” Blessed is the ear that hath heard, and the heart that hath understood what hath transpired, and the taste that hath savored what hath appeared from the ocean of thy Lord’s grace, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>O Kazim! Act according to what thou hast been commanded and thou shalt behold thy Lord’s all-encompassing grace upon the worlds. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the most great steadfastness in this Cause whereby the mountains were scattered, the heaven was cleft asunder, the earth was split, and the people were shaken, save those whom God wished, the Powerful, the Preserver, the Mighty.</p>
<p>The degrees of divine favors and grace are manifest and evident from these heavenly utterances. What else can this servant mention or submit? Were the entire world to become utterance, it would be as nothing compared to a single word from His Tablets, and were all creation to become tongues and cry out, it would be seen as non-existent before the call of a single bird of the Divine Throne. However, since mention of God’s loved ones is beloved, while acknowledging my powerlessness and confessing my shortcomings, I burden you with these unworthy words. I convey greetings to his honor Aqa Mirza Husayn, and likewise to his honor Haji Kazim, upon him be the glory of God. All that was mentioned in your letter was submitted before the Most Holy Court. He said: “Act according to what We have commanded thee in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds.” God willing, detached from the world, they shall speak in remembrance of the Ancient King and Lord of nations. Glory be upon thee and upon every discerning soul who hath turned unto Him. When you meet the divine friends, express the powerlessness and nothingness of this evanescent servant. God the One is witness that those accepted souls who have drunk from the Kawthar of inner meanings have been and will remain remembered in heart and tongue. Glory be upon them, praise be upon them, exaltation be upon them.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, for the Sun of Grace hath dawned upon thee time and again, again and yet again. By God! A single word that proceedeth from the Tongue of Grandeur in praise of His loved ones cannot be equaled by all that existeth in the seen and unseen realms. Praise be unto this Desired One, and glory be unto this Beloved One. The Tablets which thou hadst requested are being sent in concert with his honor Aqa Muhammad-’Ali.</p>
<p>[Note: The opening section in brackets appears to provide context about a letter written to Mirza Mustafa, who was not present to receive a response as he had gone to ’Akka. Since this appears to be contextual framing rather than part of the actual message, it is not included in the translation of the divine utterance itself.]</p>

<p>This is the Visitation Prayer that was named after Maryam, who was ignited with the fire of her Lord’s love before being touched by it. We veiled her station during her life, but when she ascended to the Supreme Companion, God removed the veil and made her known to His servants. Whoever wishes to visit the handmaiden who was martyred, let them recite this Visitation Prayer:</p>
<p>In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most High</p>
<p>O Supreme Pen! Joy did not overtake thee in the days of thy Lord, the Most High, that thou mightest warble upon the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree with the melodies of Baha. Rather, thou wert touched by the supreme calamity whereupon the earth and heaven wailed. Then mention what befell thee from the decrees of fate, that tears may flow from those in the depths of the names at this calamity whereby Paradise trembled, the worlds were shaken, the realities of contingent beings were disturbed, and the Eye of Grandeur wept upon the throne of His Name, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>Say: May the first mercy that descended from the clouds of thy Lord’s will, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, and the first light that shone from the horizon of eternity, and the first peace that appeared from the tongue of grandeur in the Kingdom of divine decree, be upon thee, O Most Great Sign, Most Exalted Word, Luminous Pearl, and Divine Countenance in the heaven of destiny.</p>
<p>How can I mention thy trials, O Crimson Leaf! By God, through thy fall from the Tree of the Cause, the leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree fell, the branches of the Tree of Eternity were broken, the boughs of the Tree of Blessedness dried up, the hearts of the near ones bled, the faces of the chosen ones turned pale, and the hearts of the pious in the Highest Paradise became entangled. The Faithful Spirit lamented in the presence of the All-Glorious, and the dwellers of earth and heaven cried out.</p>
<p>Thou wert the beauty mark of guidance on the countenance of handmaidens, and the brilliant star on the brow of piety. Through thee the clouds of idle fancies were rent asunder from the face of women, and through thee their temples were adorned with the ornament of the remembrance of the Lord of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Thou art she who, upon hearing God’s call, tarried not for an instant but hastened unto Him, detached from all else. Thou didst believe in Him and His mighty signs, and recognized the Manifestation of His Self in His days, after those in the heavens and earth were terrified, save those whom the hand of thy Lord’s will, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, had upheld, and whom He had delivered from the depths of self and passion.</p>
<p>Thou wert a stranger in thine own land, a captive in thine own house, distant from the holy court despite thy longing, and barred from the seat of nearness despite thy yearning and thy turning unto Him. Thou art she whom the winds of thy Lord the All-Merciful’s will moved as He pleased and desired, and thou hadst no motion nor rest save by His command and leave. Blessed art thou for having made thy will extinct in the will of thy Lord and thy desire nonexistent in what thy Master desired.</p>
<p>Thou art she whom neither the hints of the hypocrites deterred from the Luminary of the horizons, nor the turning away of the covenant-breakers from the Lord of the Day of Meeting. Thou didst fulfill the Covenant on a day when eyes were fixed in terror and the wicked dispersed from around the Manifestation of thy Lord, the Chosen One, save a few of the righteous.</p>
<p>Alas, alas! At thy calamity the Pen was prevented from flowing, the breezes of sorrow passed over the dwellers of Paradise, whereby the pillars of the all-embracing Word were sundered, and the forms of the disconnected letters appeared at the beginning of the Surihs of the Book, and thereby minds were fettered in the world of might, and prime matter donned the garment of form in the kingdom of decree.</p>
<p>I swear by Thy glory, O Most Sublime Leaf! It is hard for Me to behold the world and not see Thee, and to hear the cooing of the dove yet not hear Thy melodies raised in praise of Thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious. By God! Through Thy sorrow all things have been saddened, even all that was created in the kingdom of existence, and the Daysprings of the Names have donned garments of black. How can I recall, O Beloved of Baha, those days wherein Thou didst warble upon the twigs with diverse melodies in remembrance of Thy Lord, the All-Merciful? Through Thy songs in praise of Thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, were raised the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree, the cooing of the Mystic Dove, the flowing of the Water of Life, the whispering of the breezes of Paradise, and the crowing of the Celestial Bird in remembrance of Thy Lord, the Almighty, the Help in Peril.</p>
<p>Thou art the One through Whose praise all existence praised its Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. After Thee the Dove was silenced, the winds stilled, the lamps of prosperity extinguished, and the waters of success frozen. Blind is the eye that saw not in Thy countenance the freshness of the All-Merciful, that wept not for the sorrows that befell Thee, and mute is the tongue that remembereth Thee not among the concourse of creation.</p>
<p>Blessed be those days wherein Thou didst stir upon the Tree and sing upon it the verses of divine unity, whereby was attracted the heart of every humble and submissive soul who sought its Lord with radiant, joyous, and beaming countenance. But alas for those days wherein Thy face was veiled, Thy presence concealed, and Thy meeting forbidden.</p>
<p>O woe, woe unto Thee, O Primal Leaf, Ancient Word, Primordial Essence, Divine Fruit, Celestial Countenance, Heavenly Sign, and Kingdom’s Spirit! Through Thy calamity the seas were stilled of their waves, the trees of their fruits, the verses of their revelation, the words of their meanings, the heaven of its adornment, the earth of its vegetation, the waters of their flow, and the winds of their blowing. Were I to mention Thy tribulations as they truly were, existence would return to nothingness and the Pen of the Most High would cry out in anguish.</p>
<p>I know not which of Thy tribulations to recount before the Concourse on High - shall I mention what befell Thee from Thy loved ones, or what was visited upon Thee by the enemies of God, Lord of the first and last? Thou art the One Who bore in Thy Lord’s path what no other devoted maid hath borne, whereby flowed the tears of the secluded ones in their chambers, and the maidens of Paradise fell prostrate upon the dust and the beauties of the highest Paradise rent their hair.</p>
<p>O Crimson Leaf! Through Thy calamity was transformed the face of Revelation, joy was changed to sorrow, the pillars of the Frequented Fane were shaken, and the scroll was rolled up. Alas, alas! Through Thy tribulation all existence, both seen and unseen, accepted the decree of death after life, and the Primal Will donned the cloak of names and attributes[…]</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O Word of Baha and martyr in the path of Baha! How many nights I wept upon my couch in longing for the presence of Baha, and how many days I burned with the fire of yearning, seeking reunion with Baha and turning toward the countenance of Baha wherein naught can be seen save God, the Most High, the Most Exalted. Verily, thou didst desire from His face naught save the face of thy Lord, as beareth witness to this the Concourse on High and then the denizens of the immortal realm. Blind be the eye that perceiveth not in thee the sign of divine unity and the manifestation of oneness. O thou who art mentioned by the tongue of Baha! By God, the feminine gender is ashamed to be attributed to thee, O pride of men! Blessed art thou, O manifestation of beauty! Blessed art thou in that God hath purified thee from eternity from the doubts of the misguided ones and preserved thee from commotion. Verily He is the Mighty, the Exalted, and unto Him returneth the decree of the beginning and the end. I testify that thou wert a leaf continually stirred by the winds of God’s will, and thou wert not seized by the intimations of the people of hypocrisy who broke the Covenant and denied God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Blessed is the maidservant who found solace in thee, who heard thy mention, who held fast to the cord of thy love, and who through thee drew nigh unto God, thy Creator and Fashioner. She who tasted not thy love purely for thy Lord’s sake is deprived of the grace wherewith God distinguished thee, and Paradise belongeth to the one who turned toward thee, wept for thee, and visited thee after thy death. O thou who art concealed within the layers of earth! Verily thy body is a trust from God, the Mighty, the Bestower, in the bosom of the earth, and thy spirit hath ascended to the Most Glorious Horizon and the Supreme Companion. O God, my God! Befriend the one who befriendeth her, oppose the one who opposeth her, aid the one who aideth her, and grant to the one who visiteth her the best of this world and the next, and that which Thou hast ordained for those near unto Thee and for the sincere ones among Thy creatures. Verily Thou art the King of Kings and the Merciful to the servants. Within Thy grasp is the kingdom of earth and heaven. Thou doest what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Lord of the throne and the dust, and the Lord of the last and the first. Glorified art Thou, O God, my God! I beseech Thee by the Manifestation of Thy Most Exalted Self, and by Thy greatest appearances, and by Thy signs that have encompassed earth and heaven, then by this grave which Thou hast made a receptacle of Thy love and the resting place of a leaf from the leaves of the Tree of Thy Revelation, that Thou wilt not drive me from Thy door nor deprive me of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thyself and by her and by all the Manifestations of Thy names, that Thou wilt not leave me to myself and my desires, nor make me one of those who opposed Thee and turned away from Thee on the Day whereon Thou didst establish Thyself upon the throne of Thy mercy and didst manifest Thyself unto all things through all Thy names. Therefore, O my God, give me to drink from the spring of Thy knowledge and the fountain of Thy grace, that thereby I may become detached from all else save Thee and turn toward the sanctuary of Thy reunion and Thy presence. Verily Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>O Lord! I beseech Thee by the fire which Thou didst kindle in the breast of this Leaf who was stirred by the winds of Thy Will and spoke in praise of Thy Self, to ignite the hearts of Thy servants with the fire of Thy love that they may detach themselves from those who have disbelieved and turn their faces toward Thee. Then send down, O my God, upon me and upon Thy detached servants and steadfast loved ones the good of this world and the world to come. Then forgive us and our fathers and our mothers and our brothers and our sisters and our offspring and our kindred from among those who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs, and who have acknowledged Thy oneness and confessed Thy singleness and submitted to Thy Cause and spoken in Thy praise. Verily Thou art He Who hath ever been powerful and will ever remain sovereign. No name preventeth Thee from another name, nor any attribute from another attribute. All names are servants unto Thy Self, and circle around Thee, and are submissive to Thy sovereignty, and are humble before the manifestation of the signs of Thy power, and are lowly before the dawning rays of the lights of Thy countenance. Verily Thou hast ever been and wilt ever be sanctified from Thy creation and Thy creatures. To this do testify my soul and all atoms, and my being and the beings of all who have been created between the earth and the heavens. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>

<p>In the name of God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>Let truth bear witness and every fair-minded soul testify that this evanescent servant, having attained the blessing of His presence, has been occupied day and night with the remembrance of His chosen ones and loved ones. Letters were repeatedly written to each one, from which wafted the fragrance of humility, submissiveness, love and affection. To the extent possible, effort and striving were made to rectify the affairs of each one. Despite my powerlessness and lowliness, no negligence occurred in offering counsels and exhortations. Whatever was heard in these stations was disclosed, with the purpose that hearts and souls might attain what is befitting and turn away from what is unworthy, and that unity might become manifest among the servants. Indeed, the ultimate purpose and universal aim was that the hidden rancor and hatred in the breasts of the various parties might be transformed into affection and unity. You yourself bear witness to what has been mentioned. However, regarding your affairs at the beginning, one day one of the Afnan was present before the Master, Who said that some arrangement should be made for Aqa Muhammad-’Ali so that he would not remain idle in the great city and would maintain respect and honor among the people of that land. Finally they acquiesced and mentioned what was later carried out. Then it was reported that each one had designated or would designate a sum, and that merchandise would be sent to him from wherever he requested. If you reflect carefully on this matter, you will testify to the favors that were bestowed upon you, and the friends referred their business dealings to you, both in this land and abroad. Repeatedly some complained that Aqa Muhammad-’Ali was not sending merchandise according to requests - that he was sending items contrary to what was ordered. By God, besides Whom there is no other God, this servant was repeatedly present when they said to the departed and blessed Aqa Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be God’s favor and mercy: “Do not complain, for praise be to God, you have suffered no loss from what has been sent.” It is hoped that intentions will become pure and deeds will be manifested for the sake of God. In such case, profit is present and loss is absent. The days continued until these days when one day your letter arrived mentioning a theft, saying “They broke my safe and took three hundred and fifty liras,” and after some time you attributed this to the Overseer, stating that if permission were granted you would prove it. That letter in your handwriting is still at hand. Another day the honored beloved, Haji Siyyid ’Ali-Akbar, may God strengthen him, the Lord of Power, sent a letter from you and also mentioned it verbally. In that letter too it was stated that if permission were granted you would prove it. After these matters were presented, both the servant and they said to write to you to definitely prove it and make the claim and receive it. We both wrote and sent it. No response came. And the honored Afnan, upon him be God’s peace and favor, wrote that the letter was delivered to Aqa Muhammad-’Ali in the presence of Haji Mirza Abu’l-Hasan, may God strengthen him […]</p>
<p>We too greatly insisted that you act according to your own writing, prove it and obtain it, but we heard no proper response. Then one day His Holiness Haji Siyyid Ali Akbar, may God strengthen him, arrived with a letter in your handwriting stating that “They have taken my property” - how little it is that now you say “Come and prove it.” You yourself be fair - what relation does this statement have with the previous one? You yourself repeatedly sought permission to prove it. What was and is the duty of this servant in this regard? In any case, the contradiction between these two statements caused bewilderment. What matter in the world has ever been settled by mere claim without proof, that this matter should be so? Every claim requires proof, and without proof whatever is said is not acceptable to any rational person. Hence there was no choice but silence. After the second letter they said “Glory be to God! This matter has nothing to do with us. The honored Nazir and Aqa Muhammad Ali both claimed love. If something occurs between them they should, like other people, resort to whatever will establish the right.” Then news and letters arrived from the Holy Land, that is, news of the meetings and discussions, and it was observed that finally they had resorted to things that caused harm, loss and dishonor. Nevertheless, we remained silent and bewildered. The news about the honored Nazir came after the news about the honored Siyyid and his imprisonment. If Nazir took it, why did they imprison the Siyyid before Nazir? And if the Siyyid took it, what do they want from Nazir? In any case, the statements are contradictory and the actions are contradictory. Now be fair - what is the duty? This servant and others did not understand your purpose in these matters and their mention, as that aspect had nothing to do with here. In the previous year His Holiness the Afnan, the honored Haji Mirza Aqa, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah] the Most Glorious, transferred to His Holiness the Master, may my spirit be sacrificed for Him, half of what they had given to you, and this small amount was returned here. The rest of what was with you and what was with the honored Haji Shaykh Muhammad Ali, upon him be God’s favor, had and has nothing to do with here. By the truth of Truth, I say truthfully that not one dinar of it was returned to this place and absolutely nothing was said about these matters. Glory be to God! All your letters contradicted each other. Here you wrote that out of respect for the Cause you had not mentioned it to anyone, but then the honored Aqa Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be God’s favor, mentioned that you had written to them also and entrusted it to them, and likewise news came from other places, and in that land was said that which is not proper to mention. I complain of my distress and grief to God. They said “Write to Muhammad Ali that the utmost love was shown towards him, and in return for that you did what was not befitting of the faithful.” […]</p>
<p>As you have written that the actions of the Nazir and Haji Sheikh Muhammad-’Ali caused no harm while my actions caused harm - glory be to God! Why do you deviate from established principles and deny what has existed among people from the beginning of the world until now? O my brother, hear the call of this evanescent one - which claim has ever been accepted without proof, or ever will be? Where, before whom, in which religious law or civil code did you make the proof of this assertion contingent upon the daily expenses of the Nazir? What this servant knows and has been informed of is that he had a property in ’Ishqabad which Ustad ’Ali-Akbar sold, and when the Nazir was staying in this land, news arrived that it was sold for four hundred tumans. Additionally, during this journey he had some funds entrusted to him by others, and also an amount of turquoise given to him by one of the friends which, as some who are still present in the Holy Land know, he sold and took the proceeds. Each of these instances is specified here and can be sent if necessary. Apart from these, ask any wise and fair person whether such matters can prove theft by anyone. Glory be to God! By what proof or evidence can these servants make such accusations against anyone? I swear by the one God that the intention was not and is not to defend him. However, because during his previous time in this land, the friends who came to him from Iran were shown the utmost kindness - some stayed with him for two years. In any case, mention of his service to the servants of God spread widely, and after the upheaval in those regions during the sedition of Sheikh Ubeydullah, he came to this land and resided here for seven years. I testify by God that nothing contrary was seen from him in this land. Is it possible for someone to arrive and not be treated with kindness? You yourself know that in all cases it is fitting to act with kindness, not unkindness. And if someone has a dispute with one of the affiliates and makes a claim, surely judgment should be issued without discrimination - and God suffices as witness. After returning from that direction, the aforementioned one did not even come to this land. Great injustice has been done to him, as before proving all these false accusations it is not necessary and is not permitted in any religious law. And as for the affairs of Haji Sheikh Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be God’s care, after the conflicts and disputes of that land they summoned him and ordered him to return to his homeland. No betrayal or fault can be attributed to him. The amount of seven hundred liras, as he himself had written previously, he had lost in certain matters. Now he has given a valid promissory note to return it to the owners of the funds, and his brother, his eminence Samandar, upon him be God’s care and favors, has also agreed to pay and deliver it to the rightful owners. Beyond this, outwardly no contrary matter was heard or seen from him. In any case, your letters have caused much astonishment […]</p>
<p>You wrote that some have written from certain places that harm has been brought upon the Cause. Now, what should I write in reply to them? Our stories and our counsels have not been accepted until now. In this case, write whatever you wish. And if I knew you had adopted fairness and would act with justice, I would write to tell you what to write so that it might remedy what has occurred. But it is evident that until now you have not had a hearing ear, therefore whatever I mention is but wind. O my brother! Trustworthiness, religious devotion, truthfulness and sincerity - each of these, from whomever they have appeared, have not remained hidden. I hope that after reading this letter you will adopt fairness and henceforth speak as befits, and grasp the hem of justice. I beseech God to assist you in that which is good for you and make you successful in that which contains His good-pleasure. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. And peace be upon him who follows guidance.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise befitteth the Sovereign of existence and the King of the seen and unseen, Who illumined the hearts of them who are nigh and sincere with the light of His blessed Word, and kindled them with the fire of His blessed Tree - a kindling such that neither the clamor of the servants, nor the tumult of the people, nor the might of the divines, nor the turning away of the mystics could deter them; nay rather, it increased their ardor. Exalted be their stations, lofty their ranks, and mighty their steadfastness! Glory be unto Thee, O Thou through Whom the eyes are illumined and the tongues of the righteous are loosed! I beseech Thee to aid Thy servants to gaze toward Thy Most Exalted Horizon - the Station which hath been illumined by the lights of Thy countenance, O Lord of all being! Then send down upon those who have arisen to serve Thy Cause the rain of Thy mercy, and protect them from those who have turned away from Thy Beauty and have arisen to extinguish Thy light. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the kingdoms of creation. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thereafter, that beloved one sent to this evanescent one the letter which he had dispatched to His Honor the Name of Bounty, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and all of it was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. His word, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar! We have made mention of thee once in the evening and again in the morning, and yet again at this moment when the servant present hath brought another letter which thou didst send to the Name of Bounty, who circumambulateth the House and the Most Great Throne of God at eventide and at dawn. Ponder that which hath been sent down from the heaven of God’s Will and that which every sinful doubter hath uttered. Blessed is the soul that hath cast away what the people possess and taken what it hath been commanded by God, the Lord of Lords. Say: O people of the earth! Fear God and follow not those who follow fancy and vain imaginings. Arise to redeem what hath passed you by, then turn unto Him. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving. We remind you for the sake of God - to this testify the atoms of creation and beyond them those who possess the secrets of the Book. Thus hath shone forth the Sun of Knowledge from the horizon of the heaven of thy Lord’s utterance, the Master of all mankind.</p>
<p>Thus ended. Praise be to God, that beloved one hath repeatedly been honored with mention by the True One, exalted be His glory, at this time. Though there was delay in responding to the letters, yet by God’s grace each word received its answer.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote concerning His Honor Aqa Siyyid Muhammad-i-Sahhaf, upon him be the Glory of God, it was presented in the Most Holy Court. His word, exalted be His station:</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing […]</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Thou hast been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. By the life of God, thy sighs and lamentations in separation from the Wronged One have been heard. God, exalted be His glory, beareth witness to thy sighs and tears. Thy cry is moving and thy purpose well-pleasing, but due to the darkness of the oppressors, restrain thyself, being content with My good-pleasure, patient under My decree, and vocal in My beautiful praise. We have been with thee and have witnessed thy state in thy love for thy Wronged Lord, Who hath been imprisoned in the most desolate of lands for having summoned all unto God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O thou who art enkindled with the fire of My love! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison. Verily, it calleth thee and maketh mention of thee in such wise that thou mayest find therefrom the fragrance of My love and My grace. Beware, and I am the Forgiving, the Merciful. We behold thee standing at the door. Be thou assured and be of the thankful. He exalteth whom He willeth through a word from His presence and abaseth whom He desireth. He is, in truth, the Almighty, the Powerful. Consider the leaders of the earth and reflect on what the Most Exalted Pen hath moved against them. Know thou this, then conceal it from every remote oppressor.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Whatsoever hath appeared and will appear in the world hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen aforetime. Should anyone read the divine verses and ponder with insight, he would testify with absolute certainty that His knowledge encompasseth all things, His power prevaileth over all, and His Cause penetrateth all things. These words flow from the tongue of grandeur that thou mayest be assured that He hath not been and is not heedless of thee. Verily, He is with those who love Him and desire Him, and He is the Truthful, the All-Informed. The Glory be upon thee and upon every discerning believer.</p>
<p>His is the grace, His is the bounty, and His is the bestowal. Were the glances of His favor to be withheld for a moment, these servants would be seen as decayed bones. We have believed in Him, have placed our trust in Him, and we beseech from Him that which will draw us nigh unto Him, for He is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>And concerning what thou didst write about Master Muhammad-Quli, the Tailor, upon him be the glory of God, mention of him too was made in the Most Great Presence and was submitted before the countenance of the Lord of existence. This is what the Desired One hath spoken in reply, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Quli! The Wronged One of the horizons hath turned toward thee and maketh mention of thee with verses from whose fragrance the people of the graves have arisen. God, exalted be His glory, hath regarded and continueth to regard His loved ones, but the veils of heedless souls and thick coverings have become an obstacle. Verily, He desireth whomsoever hath desired Him and turneth unto whomsoever hath turned unto Him. He, verily, is the Compassionate, the Generous. Be thou not grieved, and lament not at separation. The Cause is in His hands. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! Deliver that which hath been specifically sent down from the heaven of divine will for these two souls, and give them the glad-tidings of God’s grace and favor. God willing, may they drink from the ocean of joy and be vocal in the remembrance of the Friend. This land is observed to be somewhat disturbed. The populace hath exceeded the bounds of moderation and, beyond all else, no dwelling, residence or locality is to be found.</p>
<p>From the lamentations of these two friends it was observed that their effect reached, in some measure, the hem of the garment of the Beloved of the worlds. His compassion and loving-kindness are of such magnitude as to leave man bewildered at their mention, for whatever might be said falls short. This evanescent one beseeches the ocean of His generosity to grant solace through the light of attainment unto the enkindled souls. In these days, due to a gathering that took place in this land, certain matters were discussed. Notwithstanding all this, it is hoped that the prayers of the friends may be answered. God willing, may some soul be assisted to establish a Mashriqu’l-Adhkar in this land, and beside it a place for the righteous, for no suitable location can be found in this land. From all directions people of every description have turned to this land specifically for commerce.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about Aqa Muhammad and Aqa ’Ali-Asghar, upon them be the glory of God, it was presented before His presence. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>O Muhammad! He Who maketh mention of thee hath made mention of thee. We have mentioned thee through verses that have set the world ablaze. Verily thy Lord maketh mention of him who hath loved Him, and He is the Mighty, the Bountiful. The Truth hath come and the Balance hath appeared, yet most of the people are in doubt and discord. Rejoice thou in that thou hast been mentioned before the Wronged One, and there hath been revealed for thee that before which verses bow down. The servant in attendance brought thy likeness. Blessed is he for having attained the presence of the Countenance and for having been the object of God’s glance from the most exalted station. O Muhammad! Dost thou know Who mentioneth thee - He through Whose mention the Books of God, the Lord of lords, have been adorned? Give thanks unto God for this most great favor and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Master of all necks! I beseech Thee not to disappoint me in Thy days, but to send down upon me from the heaven of Thy bounty that which befitteth Thy generosity, O Lord of all mankind.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who was named ’Ali-Asghar from this Most Great Scene and give him the glad-tidings of My mercy that hath preceded all created things. Thy likeness was presented before the Wronged One, Whom God hath made sanctified from all likenesses. We have beheld thee and have revealed for thee that whereby thy mention shall endure throughout the kingdom’s duration. He with Whom is the Mother Book beareth witness to this. Grieve not because of the people and their doings. Rather, rejoice in My mention, which cannot be equaled by all created things. When thou didst discover the fragrance of My utterance and didst attain unto My verses, turn thy face toward the Prison and say: Unto Thee be praise, O Lord of all names! I testify that through Thee the Lote-Tree of the Extremity spoke, the Most Exalted Paradise was stirred, and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke forth in the Most High Paradise that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that both were blessed with His supreme bounty, for after this servant had perused the letter of His Holiness the Name of Bounty, upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God, and presented the likenesses of both names before the Throne, these decisive verses were revealed especially for them from the heaven of bounty. God willing, may they attain to their reading and become cognizant of that which is befitting. There is no power nor strength save in God. This evanescent one conveys his greetings unto them and begs from God their success.</p>
<p>O My handmaiden! The recompense of no soul hath ever been, nor shall ever be, lost in the sight of God. Thy love and devotion are two mighty causes for the manifestation of thy remembrance from the horizon of the Divine Will, even as He now maketh mention of thee from within the Most Great Prison. Rejoice thou in the bounty of thy Lord and say: May my spirit be a sacrifice unto Thy remembrance, O Thou Who art not mentioned by names! We make mention of thy daughter, who turned unto God and believed when she heard of this Revelation which hath appeared with mighty sovereignty. We make mention, too, of thy sons and give them the glad-tidings of My mercy and My loving-kindness. Verily thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. Blessed is he who hath, on this Day, set his face towards the Ultimate Goal, and blessed is the handmaiden who hath believed in God, the One, the All-Informed. The glory which proceedeth from Us rest upon thee and upon them, and upon everyone who is steadfast and firm.</p>
<p>On this occasion that handmaiden and her kindred have been honored with the remembrance of the Best-Beloved of the worlds. I beseech God that all may be enabled to hearken with true hearing. The women who have today attained unto recognition and confession and service of the friends of God are, in the sight of God, accounted among men, nay rather among the heroes, inasmuch as neither the censure of the critic, nor the scorn of the scorner, nor the clamor of the heedless hath deterred them or shall ever deter them. Their hearts are strong and their feet are firm. I swear by the Day-Star of the horizon of utterance that the mere nail-paring of one of the believing handmaidens of today is, in the sight of God, more preferred than the divines of Persia who, after thirteen hundred years of expectation, have perpetrated what the Jews had not perpetrated at the appearance of the Spirit [Christ]. I beseech God to bestow justice and to guide unto the straight path. Although those hapless ones are unaware and consider what they hear of the Revelation of God and His signs and evidences to be baseless, yet I swear by the life of God that were they to be present for but an hour at the time of revelation before the Throne, the utterance of the All-Merciful would of a certainty so attract them that they would prostrate themselves involuntarily. The colors of the world and its ornaments, and the delusion of vain learning, have debarred them from the straight path of the One True God. One must pray - the grace of God, exalted be His glory, is abundant - that perchance at some time His loving-kindness may be directed towards those heedless souls and may make them aware. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer prayers.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Ancient, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>Praise be to Him Who hath spoken after His sanctification beyond utterance, and taught after His transcendence beyond expression. He is the One Who hath made the Most Exalted Pen the interpreter among all peoples, and through it revealed whatsoever He desired through His Name which He made the Sovereign of all names in the kingdom of creation. Glorified be He Who is singular in majesty and greatness and unique in might and power. His sovereignty hath encompassed the kingdom of earth and heaven, and His mercy hath preceded the realms of divine and earthly dominion. He is the One Who cannot be described by names nor mentioned by attributes. Every near one hath acknowledged his remoteness, every knower confessed his ignorance, and every wise one testified to his heedlessness. He hath subdued all things through the Word that hath shone forth and radiated from the horizon of His Will, and guided humanity unto His Path wherewith none have attained save honored servants. Praise be unto Him, for He is the Possessor of the seen and unseen.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant received thy letter which thou hadst previously sent. I took it, opened it, read it, and found therein the fragrance of thy love for our Lord, the Lord of the visible and invisible, the Lord of all humanity, and the Sovereign of the hereafter and the former times. When appropriate, it was presented before the Throne. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Teacher, the Revealer, the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned before the Countenance! Grieve not for what hath befallen thee. Greater trials than what have befallen the sincere and near servants of God have befallen thy Lord. By the life of Baha! He glorieth in tribulation in God’s path, the Lord of Names, yet people flee from it in evident fear. We have adorned the body with tribulation and embellished the spirit with a joy that no earthly joy can equal. Thus hath spoken He Who was sanctified above all that the worlds have comprehended. Hold fast to the cord of patience by the command of thy Chosen Lord and say:</p>
<p>O my God and Master of my destiny and Beloved of my heart! Thou seest what hath befallen me in Thy days and knowest my condition in Thy Cause. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which rivers of Thy mercy flowed from rock, signs of Thy grandeur appeared from the seas, and manifestations of Thy power from the branches, to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy Cause and holding fast to the cord of Thy love. I testify that this is the Day wherein the great terror hath appeared and every hidden matter hath been revealed. Forgive, O my God, every movement that hath appeared from me contrary to Thy will, then enable me to do what befitteth Thy days, then write down for me through Thy grace that which will preserve me from all else but Thee. O Lord! Make me among those who have fled from desire to the Ultimate Tree and who have detached themselves from all else through Thy Most Mighty, Most Holy, Most Glorious Name. Verily Thou art the Lord of the Throne and earth, and in Thy grasp is the kingdom of all things, and Thou art the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Until now numerous letters have arrived from thee. Praise be to God, all indicated thy degrees of love, affection, sincerity and steadfastness in God’s Cause. Be not grieved by what hath befallen thee, for verily today whoever is adorned with the ornament of the love of God hath in truth attained unto all good. The entire world cannot equal a single word that issueth from the mouth of Divine Will concerning His loved ones, and these stations are today hidden from eyes. For were they to be revealed and were the people of the world to discover the mystery of the Cause, surely none would hesitate, let alone deny and reject.</p>
<p>That which you mentioned concerning the non-receipt of a reply - God, exalted be His station and His grandeur, is witness and testament that this delay has not been and will never be due to any lack of love, but rather due to the multitude of occupations and correspondence of this evanescent servant. From all directions, like rain, petitions and letters arrive, and this servant is, most of the time, engaged before the Throne in writing that which descends from the heaven of our Lord the Most Merciful’s will. Whenever opportunity arises, he turns to the mention of the friends. None of you have been erased from heart and sight. Praise be to God, you are remembered before His presence and have attained His favors. However, strive to attain that which befits these days. All must today circle round the Most Great Ocean and speak with perfect unity. You and the friends of God should not be saddened by the delay in replies from this evanescent one, for all know and have known the reason for the delay.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the Most Great Holy Leaf, the honored sister - may our spirits be sacrificed for her sake - it was presented, and what you did was acceptable. We thank Him for His wondrous grace and favor.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about your sister, it was presented before His presence. He said that since it was not in accordance with the Book’s decree, it became a cause of difficulty and tribulation. However, God willing, His grace will bestow reward for this difficulty and tribulation. “O My loved ones! Avoid that which ye have been forbidden in the Book and hold fast unto that which ye have been commanded. Verily your Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Helper, the All-Seeing.” You should not be distressed by what occurred, for it has been adorned with the ornament of forgiveness. Verily He is the Commander, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the daughter of Asdaq - upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah] - and mentioned that she said these afflictions befalling you and your household are because her wishes are not being followed, these matters were presented before His presence. He said: “O Karim! Verily My servant Asdaq has a great station with thy Lord. He is among those who attained recognition of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, in the beginning of the Cause. We have mentioned him in the Books and Psalms and remember him in My days. Thy Lord is verily the Kind, the Forgiving. Blessed is he who found companionship with him in his lifetime and visited him after his passing. My Most Exalted Pen testifies that he perceived My fragrance, hastened to My Cause in My direction, and arose to serve this Cause whereby every firm edifice was shaken. He presented himself before the Throne with a radiant countenance and would stand at the gate most days, hearing the call of God, the Lord of the exalted Throne. Glory be upon him and upon those who visit him, from God, the Lord of the seen and unseen.”</p>
<p>O Karim! What befell you was not because of what she mentioned. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing; with Him is the knowledge of all things in a glorious Book. Convey My greetings to her face and say: “O My handmaiden! Walk in the footsteps of thy father. Thus doth My wise Pen counsel thee.” O Karim! The late Attar was among the early believers and attained the presence of God. The True One, glorified and mighty be He, has regarded and continues to regard his honor. Had what he intended been carried out, these vexations would not have occurred. Thus doth He inform thee, with Whom is the knowledge of what was and what will be. God willing, may you dwell with utmost joy and fragrance and complete love under the shadow of divine favor. Verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>The Ismu’l-Jamal, upon him be Baha’u’llah, had mentioned the exalted Fath’u’llah. By My life! We were with him when he was ascending the ladder of grace and soaring in the atmosphere of his Lord’s mercy, the Mighty, the Generous. We make mention of him in this station as a token of Our favor, that thou mayest be of the thankful. He ascended on the wings of love and certitude to the horizon of the All-Merciful and attained a station that brought joy to his eyes and to the eyes of all beholders. O Fath’u’llah! Thou art the one who was mentioned during thy life before the Throne, and after thy ascension My Most Exalted Pen, from which every wise command hath been detailed, maketh mention of thee. This is a mention that nothing can equal. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Generous. Thus have We adorned thy head with the crown of forgiveness from thy Lord, the All-Merciful. He mentioneth whomsoever He willeth through His command. He is verily the Rememberer, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Indeed, grief and sorrow encompassed Our heart at his ascension, but this is only in the outward sense, for inwardly he has been freed from the troubles of this mortal world and has attained unto divine mercy. Blessed is he and those like him. What bounty could be greater than that the Tongue of Grandeur should utter such exalted words concerning a soul? A hundred thousand blessings upon him who attained to this station.</p>
<p>Convey condolences on behalf of this evanescent servant to his brother, upon him be Baha’u’llah, and to his mother, upon her be Baha’u’llah, and console them. God willing, this servant and all the friends are content and thankful with whatsoever proceedeth from the Peerless Beloved. The Primal Point, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake, hath said that the entire world exists so that a single soul might attain unto the word of contentment from His ocean of generosity.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the dream, it is among the disturbing dreams whose effect in the outer world is for gathering. According to His command, if one sees a disturbing dream and anxiety and grief arise therefrom, one should recite this blessed verse: “O Thou through Whose name the ocean of joy surgeth and the fragrance of gladness is wafted! I beseech Thee to show me from the wonders of Thy grace that which shall gladden my eye and rejoice my heart. Thou art verily the Bestower, the Generous.” And even for dreams that are not disturbing, it is beloved to recite it.</p>
<p>This servant beseeches God to protect you and your loved ones from the mischief of those who utter calumnies - this is among the greatest of prayers, by the Lord of the throne and earth! This servant was engaged in writing this letter when the call “Come thou!” was manifested from the Source of Grandeur, and after attaining His presence, He said: “O thou who art present! We desire to make mention of Our servant Rahim, who hath attained unto My days, My love and My knowledge. Blessed is he for having fulfilled his covenant and pledge, and for having drunk the choice wine of revelation from the cup of his Lord’s bountiful bestowal. O Rahim! God willing, mayest thou be blessed with His special favors. The fragrance of thy love hath been inhaled from times past and present. God willing, mayest thou attain the protection of this Most Great Station, for verily the evil ones lie in wait - thus doth the Tongue of Revelation inform you. Stand firm in the remembrance of God and His service in such wise that neither the vain imaginings nor the doubts of those who have denied God, the Exalted, the Great, shall deter thee. Hold fast to the cord of His grace and cling to the hem of His bounty. The world hath ever been and shall ever be in transition. Grieve not over what hath passed thee by. Rather, rejoice in My beauteous remembrance and say: ‘Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast remembered me in Thy prison and sent unto me that which hath brought joy to the eyes of them that know.’ Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.” End. On behalf of this evanescent servant, convey sublime and glorious greetings unto him, and likewise unto all the friends in that land. The Glory be upon you and upon them and upon God’s assured, steadfast and firm servants.</p>

<p>O honored sir, respected Afnan, his eminence Aqa Siyyid Ahmad - upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious - may he observe with radiant gaze.</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.</p>
<p>The oceans of praise and gratitude, and the heaven of remembrance and glorification, befit and beseem the people of God, whom neither clamor nor barking nor bleating deterred from the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven. They arose with supreme steadfastness to serve the Cause of the Lord of creation - an uprising that neither the might of the sword nor the pen could prevent. They are the manifestations of the power of God, exalted be His glory, whose mention hath been and continues to be recorded in the heavenly Books of former and latter times. In the Qayyumu’l-Asma He saith - exalted and glorious be His Word: “And upon it are vessels of moist red ruby, wherein none shall embark save the people of Baha.”</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou Who through Thy most exalted Word didst create earth and heaven, and through Thy Most Great Name didst illumine the horizon of the world - whereby existence was thunderstruck and feet did slip, save those whom the hand of Thy grace did protect. I beseech Thee, O my God and the God of all contingent beings, my Purpose and the Purpose of all created things, by the Dawning-Place of Signs and the Manifestation of clear evidences, to assist Thy Afnans, whom Thou hast related to Thyself and preferred above all other servants in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets, to serve Thy Cause and to stand firm in that which Thou hast commanded them in Thy Book. Then send down upon them from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will draw them nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice for your steadfastness, your remembrance and your service! The honored letter dated the ninth of Muharram arrived and gave life to the body, for from each letter emanated and diffused the fragrance of the love of the Desired One of the worlds. After reading and reviewing it, I sought permission to present it at the Most Exalted Presence, and after receiving leave, it was presented before His face and was honored to be heard. His blessed and exalted Word states: “O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness! Thy letter arrived and the servant present before My face made mention of it, and at this moment the effulgent rays of the Sun of inner meanings are directed towards thee. Well is it with thee! Today the world is in need of the Word of God. The sacred Being of God has ever been and will ever be self-sufficient and independent. As He said before and at this time: ‘O people! Ye are the poor in your relation to God, and God is the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy.’ Say: He hath come with the truth and was radiant with His lights, triumphant in His sovereignty, manifest in His signs, and sanctified in His exaltation and power. Nothing can frustrate Him and no matter can weaken Him. Say: O people of the Bayan! Die in your wrath! By God, He hath come before Whom the verses bow down and voices are hushed. Fear God and be not of the transgressors. In this Revelation there hath appeared what hath never appeared before nor will appear hereafter. My Most Exalted Pen beareth witness to this, as doth that which hath appeared through My firm and mighty Command. Convey My greetings to the faces of My loved ones who have not been held back by the doubts of the heedless nor the insinuations of the opposers. The Glory shining and gleaming from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.”</p>
<p>Glory be to God! What do the heedless people imagine? They deny the station from which, from the beginning of the Cause until now, the signs of grandeur and power have been manifest and evident before the faces of the world. What do they affirm? This servant’s very being trembles and his limbs quake with the fear of God at the mention of these stations. In all conditions, this evanescent one of no worth clings to the cord of grace and with the utmost lowliness and supplication implores and seeks bounty and mercy for the servants. Though mercy has preceded and grace has encompassed all, yet the words and deeds and actions of the transgressors have exceeded all bounds. In any case, we have never been and are not now in despair of the ocean of generosity and the sun of His bounty. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the Generous One. He heareth and answereth, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about the funds, some time ago this servant, as commanded, wrote to Jinab-i-Haji Mirza Abu’l-Hassan (upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God) and emphasized that if they had any of the Right of God with them and if sending it would be accomplished with joy and fragrance, they should send it, otherwise not. Later Jinab-i-Amin forwarded some funds, and they were repeatedly written to, asking them to consult with him in all matters and act according to his judgment. In any case, God, exalted be His glory, was and is Self-Sufficient. They should, like Jinab-i-Amin (upon him be the Glory of God), hold fast to what is beneficial for the Cause and act accordingly. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to assist this servant and them and all to do what He loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p>Regarding Mr.&nbsp;F.Sh., upon him be the Glory of God, who requested a passage - four pages were sent, and God willing they will reach him and he will attain unto them. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to assist him at all times to serve the Cause. Today it is incumbent upon all to strive, that perchance former vain imaginings may not intervene and the helpless people may dwell in perfect tranquility beneath the canopy of grandeur. The command is in His grasp, and He is the Commander, the Wise, and the All-Knowing Doer.</p>
<p>They mentioned Haji Muhammad-Rida, upon him be the Glory of God. Whatever was given before and after, Jinab-i-Amin himself, upon him be the Glory of God, has written about. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to assist him to make mention and give praise, that perchance the sleeping ones may become aware and the dead may be adorned with the ornament of life. Mention of him was made in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and these exalted words were revealed from the Kingdom of utterance. His words, blessed and exalted be He: “O Muhammad-Qabil-Rida! Praise the Beloved of the world Who enabled thee to recognize Him Whom all have been created to know, yet from Whom they remain veiled and debarred. This station is great - know thou its value and preserve it in the name of the True One, exalted be His glory. The people are heedless. By the life of God, were they adorned with the ornament of awareness, they would sacrifice their lives to obtain but one word of the divine words. Whosoever today attaineth unto the Word of God hath attained unto all good, and is more precious in the sight of God than all that lieth hidden and visible in the earth. Reflect upon the deeds and words of the former people and their fruits on the Day of Resurrection. Should anyone become aware and witness the fruits of those souls’ deeds, he would be adorned with the ornament of supreme steadfastness, would pass beyond the river of names, and would turn toward the ocean of inner meanings - a turning that neither ranks and multitudes could prevent nor the clamor of nations could hinder. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto the heedless, and woe unto the transgressors.” End quote. Praise be to God, once again they drink from the cup of the favor of the Lord of all beings. The essences of existence circle round this bounty, and the people of the Kingdom make mention of this favor.</p>
<p>Regarding the mention they made of Aqa Mulla Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God, as well as the mention of his acceptance, devotion and enthusiasm - praise be to God, he hath attained unto this most great station. Any soul adorned with the ornament of fairness will recognize that of which the people of the world are heedless, and will turn to a horizon from which most of mankind have turned away. This most great Cause hath not appeared in such wise as to leave any soul room for excuse, hesitation, or anything less, save those whom divine wrath and the recompense of their deeds have prevented and deprived. If someone denies the sun, its rays and its light, then to what else can he hold fast and what can he declare? I beseech and implore the True One to purify eyes and ears through His grace, that none may be deprived of hearing and beholding.</p>
<p>Regarding what they wrote about Aqa Mulla Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God - His Holiness Ismu’llah Zayn, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, has also written something in this regard. God willing, may they be assisted and enabled to do that which will cause the exaltation of the Word of God.</p>
<p>Mention was made of His Honour Haji Mulla Muhammad Ibrahim, upon him be the Glory of God. I beseech the True One to confirm him in the remembrance of His Cause with wisdom and utterance, and to ignite within him such a fire that its traces may become manifest and evident in the world, and its warmth may endure throughout the kingdoms of earth and heaven. This lowly one conveys greetings and salutations to him and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, for assistance on his behalf. He must at all times be mindful of wisdom, as this binding commandment hath repeatedly flowed from the Supreme Pen. This lowly one offers greetings, salutations and praise to each of the Afnans of the divine Lote-Tree, and beseecheth for each that which is peerless. The Command is in His grasp; He ordaineth as He pleaseth for whom He pleaseth, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful. Glory, remembrance, praise and peace be upon you, upon those with you, and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Concerning His Honour the Physician, upon him be the Glory of God and His favours, they wrote that according to instructions it was written to him to provide details about the House - how much had been received, how much remained, and likewise what were the costs of repairs. In any case, matters should now proceed with utmost brevity until news arrives. Whenever news from him arrives I shall inform your honour. The honored Afnan, His Honour Haji Mirza Aqa, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, has also written something about repairs to the House. Thus far no reply has been sent to him as news from His Honour the Physician, upon him be the Glory of God, has not arrived.</p>
<p>The funds from His Honour Haji Mirza Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God, arrived through His Honour Haji Seyyed Javad, upon him be the Glory of God, and was accepted and acknowledged. It was written to him in the letter this servant wrote in reply to his letter, and the receipt for the funds sent to Bushruyyih was dispatched - they will observe it and deliver it.</p>
<p>In these days the blessed place of your honour and the great gentlemen, the Afnans, is very empty, as the Greater Afnan, the Afnan of China, and the Afnan of Beirut have attained the presence. Praise be to God, they have repeatedly attained and continue to attain. Praise be to our Lord in all conditions, verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>

<p>Praise be unto the Lord of incomparable sanctity, transcending all mention and utterance! Worthy is He, the Supreme Goal, Who created the world through His Most Exalted Word and adorned it with the ornament of knowledge and understanding. His is all praise and glory, His is all might and majesty. His power was not weakened by the might of princes, nor was His Will impeded by the clamor of divines. From the earliest days, He arose before the faces of all humanity - the learned and the ignorant, the possessors of glory, wealth, power and grandeur - and summoned all with the most exalted call to the supreme horizon. Where were they in those days, these souls who now arise in opposition? By the life of the Desired One! They were secluded and concealed behind the veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings, behind multiple veils and barriers. Yet when the Sun of Proof shone forth from the Dayspring of the All-Merciful’s Will, they emerged from behind their veils with the swords of hatred. No person of insight, reason and understanding can deny what has been mentioned, for the Cause of this Most Great Revelation was never hidden - the hand of the enemies was ever afflicted.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Lord of all possibilities, Who art established upon the throne of grandeur and proof! I beseech Thee by the warbling of the doves of Thy most exalted Paradise to aid me in making mention of Thy loved ones and in praising them. O Lord! Thou seest one who hath turned unto Thee, seeking the ocean of Thy knowledge and the sun of Thy utterance. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him in what he seeketh. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>[…follows with the remainder of the text which appears to be a Tablet addressing ’Abbasquli Khan]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having remembered me by Thy Most Exalted Pen in the prison of ’Akka, when I was in the hands of the enemies who turned away from Thee, disputed Thy signs, and denied what Thou didst reveal in Thy Book. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds, by the lights of Thy dominion, the mysteries of Thy kingdom, the pearls within the shells of the ocean of Thy wisdom, and by the Manifestations of Thy Cause and the Dawning-Places of Thy Revelation, to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy love and firm in Thy Cause, in such wise that neither the veils of glory nor the clash of swords of the people of error may keep me from Thee. O my Lord! Thou seest Thy servant turning unto Thee, detached from all else but Thee, and gazing toward the horizon of Thy grace. Send down upon him from the clouds of the heaven of Thy mercy that which will draw him nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>Hearken in the Persian tongue to the Divine Call. By the life of God! Whosoever hath attained unto hearing it, neither the might of tyrants nor the power of Pharaohs hath kept him from the Dayspring of the Light of Unity and the Dawning-Place of ancient verses. With complete certitude and manifest light hath he dispelled the darkness of vain imaginings. He is the horseman in the arena of utterance. The Pharaohs and tyrants mentioned in the Tablets, past and future, refer to the divines who have prevented the people from the Divine Law and the River of God’s mercy. Consider the Shi’ih divines throughout the ages - how they cursed one another from the pulpits while uttering “O Qa’im” night and day. Yet when the world was illumined by the lights of the dawn of His Manifestation, they all arose with swords of hatred and rancor against the Purpose of the world and the Educator of nations. The fair-minded know what that people did and said. Even now in Iran they are occupied with cursing from all pulpits. Glory be to God! The deniers of the Bayan also cling to the same vain imaginings. It is incumbent and essential for the people of God to exercise the utmost effort in protecting souls, lest they be afflicted by the doubts of the barking ones and the allusions of the transgressors with the vain imaginings of the former party. These utterances have repeatedly shone forth from the Dayspring of Divine knowledge that perchance those who have turned to Him may attain the ornament of awareness and may find themselves, through the Name of God, exalted be His glory, free and detached from the world and all who dwell therein. We beseech God to assist thee and enable thee to do that which He loveth and which pleaseth Him, and that whereby His Cause may be exalted amongst His servants. Verily, He is the Protector of the sincere ones. There is no God but Him, the King, the Single, the One, the True, the Just, the Manifest.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that that honored friend hath been illumined by the lights of the utterance of the Lord of eternity and adorned with the traces of His Most Exalted Pen. The tongues of the world cannot adequately render thanks for this supreme bounty, nor can the pen describe or the mind comprehend this mighty table. This servant beseecheth his Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below to give you to drink of the wine of immortality. Verily, He is the Lord of all names and the Creator of the heavens.</p>
<p>And regarding what was asked about the tradition which states: “Knowledge is twenty-seven letters. All that the Messengers have brought is two letters, and until today people have not known more than these two letters. When our Qa’im arises, He will bring forth the remaining twenty-five letters” - after being presented before the Most Holy Court, these exalted words shone forth from the Dawning-Place of Divine Knowledge - exalted be His glory: “The intended meaning of the remaining letters refers to the station of the Blessed All-Embracing Word. Whosoever attains unto that Word will find himself independent of all the words of the world, and whosoever drinks of the hidden Kawthar contained therein will never be seized by the thirst and yearning of self and desire. This is that Word wherein all sciences and arts are concealed. This is the key to the city of steadfastness and the path of the community. This is that which breaks the might of idols and vain imaginings. Whosoever attains unto it has attained unto all that is befitting this day. This exalted Word has manifested from the world of the Divine Will to the world of Divine Purpose, and from Purpose to the realm of Lahut, and from Lahut to Jabarut, and from Jabarut to Malakut, and its manifestation in the form of the All-Embracing Word was revealed in the Tablet to Haydar-‘Ali and Husayn - upon them be My glory and loving-kindness. It speaks in the garment of ’I am manifest’ and is hidden in ‘I am the One witnessed.’ This is that Word which split asunder the breasts of the wayward ones, and shook the foundation of the sciences and arts of the opposers and transgressors. The original tradition was from the Messenger of God - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - and was mentioned by one of the letters of the Qur’an. Whosoever truly attains unto this blessed Word will see himself as the most exalted of creation and will become firm and steadfast in this Most Great Cause. He will regard the doubts of the divines and the allusions of the sources of vain imaginings as absolute nothingness and utter non-existence. Blessed are they that attain, and blessed are they that understand.” And in one sense, what was intended by it were the sciences and arts. In these days, this Wronged One is not inclined to interpret the words of the past. It was mentioned, due to the loving-kindness shown to that soul, that which diffuses the fragrance of divine utterance. Should anyone reflect upon it and become steadfast, he will be recorded among the companions of the Crimson Ark. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have remained faithful to God’s Covenant, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The bounty of God is manifest and evident from the effulgences of the lights of His words. His grace has encompassed all, His mercy has preceded, and His loving-kindness has surrounded all. Can anyone truly thank Him as He deserves to be thanked, or praise Him as He deserves to be praised? The very act of thanksgiving requires thanksgiving, for the enabling grace of gratitude is from Him, and likewise praise. The seeing soul is truly bewildered by the wonders of the grace of the All-Bountiful and the favors of the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted. I send greetings and peace to the loved ones of that land, and give them the glad-tidings of God’s grace, mercy and kindness, exalted be His glory. I beseech confirmation for each one. Today the people of Baha are mentioned and recorded as the Party of God in the Psalms, Scriptures, Books and Tablets. It is hoped that through His infinite grace they will arise as befits His days and His Cause, so that through their love the world may be illumined with the light of love, and through their burning passion it may be set ablaze. Verily our Lord is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Helper, the All-Knowing. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who have testified to that which God has testified: that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>At this moment, there came to mind of this evanescent servant the honored and esteemed Aqa ’Ali-Haydar, upon him be the Glory of God. It was as if his presence appeared before the face of this servant. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist him and grant him success in that which He loveth and is pleased with - though verily this prayer hath already been answered before its utterance. In any case, I convey greetings and glorification to him and to the honored Bik, upon him be the Glory of God, and to the honored ’A.B., upon him be the Glory of God, and to ’A.T., upon him be the Glory of God, and to those souls mentioned in their letter. I beseech for each one that which hath no peer or likeness. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Powerful, the Forgiving, the Generous. The beloved of the heart, his honor the Trustee (Amin), upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, in every letter maketh mention of them and the friends in that land. He hath said that Amin is a clear book in mentioning the friends of God, the Lord of the worlds. I convey greetings and glorification to all the friends in that land, especially to those gentlemen who have been adorned, honored and distinguished with the ornament of special favor from God. Glory be upon them and upon those who love them.</p>

<p>Praise be unto Him Whom the praise of all created things cannot describe and glory be unto Him Whom the glorification of all beings cannot extol. Remembrance be unto Him before Whose remembrance all remembrances bow down and all voices are hushed before His might and sovereignty. He is indeed the One Who has made unity the garment of His manifestation amongst His servants, and the Almighty Who has made the prison the dawning-place of His light in His dominion. He created creation as a token of His grace and drew them to the Most Exalted Horizon as a sign of His loving-kindness, and guided them to His straight path and commanded them in His Noble Book with that which would benefit them. Exalted is the All-Bountiful Who has appeared and manifested what He willed on the Day of Reckoning. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant attained unto the traces of your pen which called out in remembrance of my Beloved and your Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and the earth. When I heard the melodies of the letters and words in remembrance of God, the Revealer of verses, I ascended to the highest degrees until I attained the presence of the Lord of Names and Attributes and, after permission was granted, presented what was in your letter. Then the gate of utterance was opened with the key of the tongue. He, exalted be His glory, spoke:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Most Mighty, the Most Great</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He remembereth thee and summoneth thee unto God, the Single, the All-Informed. His call hath been raised in the Most Great Prison amidst the nations, yet most of the people are heedless. The breeze of God hath wafted, yet most of the people are turning away. The divine fragrance hath been diffused and the bounty hath appeared and the heavenly table hath been sent down. Blessed is he who hath recognized and attained, and woe unto the proud ones. Blessed art thou for having taken the Book of God by His command and answered thy Lord when He spoke: “Verily, there is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.” We have remembered thee before and at this time wherein the Concourse on High lamenteth by reason of what hath befallen Us at the hands of those who cast the Command of God behind their backs and seized that which they were forbidden in His mighty Book. Behold and then remember when My Name ?a (Haydar-’Ali) came to the place of sacrifice and gave all that he possessed in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed is he and blessed is thine uncle through whom the sighs of the Concourse on High ascended and the tears of the Messengers descended. By the life of God! Through him joy was transformed into the greatest sorrow and My mighty Throne did lament. Through him the thrones of gladness and delight, of joy and felicity were overthrown, whereunto the Mother Book beareth witness in this exalted station.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto the most great bounty and the most great outpouring. Whatever is witnessed in the world will surely change and alter and return to nothingness, save the pearls of divine love. God willing, thou shalt succeed in preserving them. The world and its conditions have had and have no significance. Hold fast unto the cord of divine favor and cling to the hem of His generosity. God willing, thou shalt attain unto that which is the cause of glory and exaltation. In all conditions, be mindful of wisdom. Verily, He commandeth thee that which profiteth thee. Thy Lord is indeed the One Who commandeth, the All-Knowing. The glory be upon thee and upon my household and upon those who have attained unto thy remembrance and thy love and upon those who have acted according to that which they were commanded by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The Sun of Providence hath shone forth with such splendor that this servant and his like are powerless to describe it. Were a soul to expend gold equal to all the mountains of the earth, he could not attain to this most exalted station, except as God willeth. Due to mankind’s lack of capacity, the Truth, exalted be His glory, hath veiled this most great, most exalted station and its like from eyes and vision. His is the command; He doeth what He willeth and decreeth what He desireth, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseecheth the Dayspring of abundant grace to assist that honored one in whatsoever is beloved and acceptable unto Him. That which is accounted among the greatest of deeds at the Divine Throne today hath been and shall ever be wisdom. That spiritual friend hath been and is cognizant of this. This word hath previously been uttered and this servant hath heard it: “Associate with them outwardly but differ from them inwardly.” In truth, from this word the fragrance of wisdom can be perceived. I submit that your mention hath ever been and is present before the Throne. I swear by the effulgences of the light of His countenance that this station is most great. Praise be to God that that family is remembered in the hearts of those who are nigh and sincere. This servant beseecheth God to assist all to preserve this station. Ye have been mentioned in the Book of God with such remembrance as shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Some time ago this evanescent servant addressed a letter to that honored one. God is my witness that you are remembered in my heart and present before mine eyes. I beg you to convey my greetings and Baha to the family. Verily, He doth not suffer the reward of the doers of good to be lost.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the visitation prayer, it was composed at the time of the revelation of verses, according to His will, and was accepted before the Throne. Well is it with you and with me. And concerning what you wrote about turning toward the Most Great Prison and seeking permission, it was submitted, and this most exalted Word was revealed from the Supreme Pen, exalted be His grandeur: “God hath ever loved to meet with His friends in the outward realm, for the divine meeting is mentioned in all heavenly Books, and the true purpose of creation in its primal reality hath been the meeting with God, exalted be His glory. Every Prophet hath testified to My glad-tidings and every Messenger hath been sent with My binding command. However, in most Tablets the decree of wisdom hath been revealed, to which all must turn their gaze. And now your primary occupation is such that you must engage in it with complete effort and trust. He verily recordeth for whomsoever He willeth the reward of attaining His presence. Thy Lord is, in truth, the Almighty, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about your brother, his honor Aqa Mirza Ahmad, upon him be the Glory of God, his petition was presented in the Most Holy Court. An exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the All-Merciful’s will and was sent. God willing, he will attain unto it and drink from the ocean of utterance.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the leaf who is the sister of the son of the Well-Beloved of Martyrs - upon him be all the most glorious Glory and all the most luminous Light - it was presented before the Most Great Countenance in the presence of His face. A most mighty and most holy Tablet was revealed from the heaven of Will specifically for her. God willing, may she be illumined by the lights of the suns of divine utterances and drink from the hidden oceans contained therein. He said: Although her affliction is great, “Verily We give glad tidings to the patient men and patient women of that which hath been ordained for them in My Kingdom, the Inaccessible, the Mighty.” The mention of all the members of the household hath been and is before the Most Holy Court, and for each one specifically the sun of divine favor hath risen and shone forth. God willing, may they all attain to that which He loveth and is pleased with, and be assisted to remember and praise Him. Were all the special mentions of those household members that have been sent down from the heaven of Will and flowed from the Most Exalted Pen to be gathered together, they would constitute a mighty book. May the spirit of all in the earthly and heavenly kingdoms be a sacrifice unto His favor and His grace. This evanescent one’s request is that on his behalf they convey to each member of that household - upon them be the blessings of God, His mercy and His glory - wonderful and sublime greetings befitting the honored ladies of the pavilion of loftiness. After the martyrdom of the Two Luminous Lights, He mentioned them as members of the household - this is a special favor and very great indeed. He doeth what He willeth and decreeth what He desireth, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful. And if God, exalted be His glory, should grant this servant enduring life, and that life be spent in remembrance and praise of the Two Luminous Lights, still I have not known and do not know what would be worthy of their station, for that which hath been revealed concerning them is beyond minds and understanding. And concerning what was written about Jinab-i-Asadu’llah - upon him be the Glory of God - it was presented before the Most Glorious Horizon and the Dawning-Place of the Greatest Signs. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, His word, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>He is the Rememberer, the Witness, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O Lion! Your mention was made in the Most Holy Court, and these exalted words, each of which shineth like the sun from the horizons of the heavens of meaning, have been revealed especially for you. Be thankful for this greatest bounty with both your outer and inner tongue. Praise be to God that thou hast attained to the presence of the King of Martyrs and, in the most excellent of days, hast quaffed the Kawthar of immortality from the hands of the bounty of the Lord of Names. The recognition of His sanctified Being is more excellent than the deeds of the first and the last, and more beloved than the treasures of heaven and earth. Know thou the station of this most impregnable Tablet and keep it hidden from the eyes of the unfaithful. Blessed is he who perceiveth from it the fragrance of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The recompense for thy services is a treasure preserved with the Trustworthy, the All-Knowing. Be thou assured and be of the thankful ones. This treasure hath been and shall ever be preserved from the hands of the treacherous and the thieving. Thus doth the All-Informed apprise thee. Verily, He is the True One, the All-Seeing. He hath, as a bounty from His presence, forgiven thee and those for whom thou didst seek forgiveness. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>God willing, thou shalt remain steadfast in this Most Great Cause in such wise that the idols of fancy shall not hold thee back from the Dayspring of the Light of certitude nor prevent thee from the Supreme Horizon. Thus have We adorned the heaven of the Tablet with the suns of the verses of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. Glory be upon thee and upon him who hath attained unto this exalted station.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, they have attained unto that which hath no peer or equal in this day. This evanescent one conveyeth greetings to them and to the other friends, and beseecheth them not to forget this evanescent servant during their visitation of the two pure and luminous resting-places. This is the plea of this servant unto the friends of God, and this evanescent one hath not been and shall not be remiss in mentioning them. The well-known tradition previously mentioned is specifically for these days: “Whoso visiteth Husayn in his tomb is as one who hath visited God upon His throne.” In former times the Person was not manifest that the truth of this tradition might be made evident. Today all atoms proclaim: “Whoso visiteth the Two Husayns in their tombs is as one who hath visited God upon His throne,” for the Truth is manifest and evident, and the Supreme Pen speaketh that “Verily He is God.” Should anyone reflect even briefly, he would testify that this tradition was specifically for these days. Blessed are the fair-minded! Blessed are they that act! Praise be to God, our Beloved and your Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and the earth. Glory be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of our Lord, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>

<p>=== START BH00490 ===</p>
<p>In the month of Sha’ban in the year 99</p>
<p>O Mirza Muhammad Husayn Khan ibn-i-Kalantar</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>The servant beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who hath come with the truth is He Who cannot be described by attributes nor characterized by mention. Every mention hath bowed down before the manifestations of His mention, and voices have been hushed at the raising of His call, and tongues have been stilled before the waves of the ocean of His utterance, and eyes have been dazzled by the lightning flashes of the light of His countenance. Blessed is he who hath attained unto His day and inhaled the fragrance of His garment, and woe unto him whom vain imaginings have prevented until he denied Him Whom he had called upon in days past.</p>
<p>And then, O my beloved, thy letter reached the servant, and he learned what was therein. When I perceived and found the fragrance of the words, I turned toward the Dawning-Place of verses until I attained a station round which circled the Concourse on High. Then did I behold the Ancient Beauty walking and singing, while I stood watching for the manifestations of His grace and the evidences of His loving-kindness. Then He turned to me with a face by whose light the earth and heaven were illumined, and He said: “What hast thou, O servant?” I submitted: “I have brought a letter from one of the loved ones,” and after permission was granted I presented what was in your letter. When it was completed</p>
<p>He spoke that Purpose by which the fragrance of utterance was diffused throughout all contingent being. I bear witness that with this tongue and this pen I am unable to mention what God revealed in that moment, but I shall mention for you what was impressed upon my heart from the lights of His utterance and what my power of memory hath preserved through His grace. He spoke, and His word is the truth:</p>
<p>“O thou who art present! His honor Thuraya hath been honored with the mention of the Lord of Names. Time and again have We turned toward him from the precincts of the Prison with words that are as the spirit of utterance itself. In every word there is a power which none save God can reckon. Through it hath appeared what hath appeared. I swear by the Sun of Utterance which shineth from the heaven’s horizon of proof that if all who dwell on earth were to discover the fragrance of but one authoritative word that hath shone forth from the Dayspring of divine revelation, they would all testify to that which the Supreme Pen hath pronounced, nay more, would sacrifice their lives and possessions to hear it. The field and space are narrow, and the Divine Steed hath no room to gallop. God willing, may he be illumined with the light of certitude and stand firm on the straight path of truth. This is a station that cannot be limited nor described. We have summoned the whole world to the most exalted horizon and guided them to the water of life, yet we see them heedless, save whom God willeth, the Lord of all worlds. God willing, may he be assisted to mention the Truth, praise the Truth, teach the Cause of Truth, and serve the Truth. Today every thing among all things crieth out and saith: Let not time slip away. The ears and eyes and heart were created for this wondrous Day. Arise in the name of God, glorified be His majesty, and with wisdom and utterance guide the servants of the All-Merciful to their true homeland, that perchance they may be freed from the abasement of self and passion and turn toward the most exalted summit. Blessed are they that attain! Blessed are they that turn unto Him!” End.</p>
<p>This lowly servant is so struck by the Kawthar of utterance that he beholds himself in an ocean of wonderment. What can he say and what can he declare? The Cause is more manifest than the sun and the bounty more exalted than heaven. All pens and papers and earthly pages, nay all the aforementioned planes, are powerless and incapable of mentioning its stations and bearing its ranks. My Lord suffices as witness.</p>
<p>As to what was mentioned regarding the official who ascended unto God, it was submitted. This is what the Tongue of the All-Merciful has spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance: Those souls who have arisen and are occupied in service for the sake of God have been and are remembered in His presence. Not so much as a hair’s worth of the doers’ reward has been or will be lost. If a soul were to become aware of what hath been revealed in the Crimson Scroll, he would testify to that which the Supreme Pen hath spoken. Blessed is he who hath proclaimed My Cause, and the ear that hath heard My call, and the eye that hath beheld My horizon, and the heart that hath turned toward My Kingdom, and the tongue that hath testified to that which My Tongue hath testified.</p>
<p>And likewise mention was made of Mirza ’Inayat which was submitted before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. This is what the Speaker of Sinai hath spoken: He is the Hearer, the Responsive One. O ’Inayat! Repeatedly hath thy mention been made before the Supreme Scene and the glances of favor have been directed toward thee from the direction of the Prison. Ask thou of God, exalted be His glory, that thou mayest be assisted in that which beseemeth the Day of God. Know thou with certainty that all that is on earth cannot equal a word that proceedeth from the Ancient Tongue. Blessed is the soul for whom the word of divine good-pleasure is specially revealed from the heaven of God’s bounty. This is that resplendent robe - whosoever is adorned therewith shall be mentioned, described and known throughout the kingdoms of earth and heaven. At all times have We commanded Our loved ones to that which profiteth them and forbidden what harmeth them. Had the servants acted accordingly, the light of the Cause would assuredly have encompassed the world. May thou be confirmed, God willing, in serving the Cause and in holding fast unto the cord of grace throughout all divine worlds.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for his honor the Mushrif: He is the One established upon the Throne through His Most Great Name. He Who was promised in the Book of God hath appeared and revealed what He desired. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful. He hath borne in God’s path, the Lord of Names, such tribulations as attested by His Clear Book. Among the people are those who turned away from Him, those who disputed His verses, those who denied His proof, and those who pronounced against Him a grievous judgment. We have come from the heaven of grandeur with God’s testimonies, proofs, books, psalms and tablets that are possessed by all peoples and parties. This is witnessed by whoever is adorned with the robe of fairness and speaketh with justice in the days of his Lord, the Hearer, the Responsive. At the dawn of this Day, the divines of Iran turned away, casting the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to the whisperings of the heedless. They are the ones who denied God’s truth throughout all ages and pronounced against the Manifestations of His Cause, the Dawning-Places of His Revelation, and the Rising-Points of His all-encompassing knowledge. Thus have We caused the water of life to flow in the rivers of the garden of utterance. Blessed is he who hath attained and said: “Praise be to Thee, O Thou the Goal of the mystics!”</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for his honor Mirza Isma’il: In the name of the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing […]</p>
<p>You were mentioned before the Wronged One, and these exalted words are revealed for the sake of God, that perchance their fragrance may be diffused and guide those endowed with vision to the Most Great Scene. The whole world hath been created for this Most Great Day, as recorded in most divine Books. How excellent is the state of the fair-minded one who speaketh for the sake of God and ariseth to serve Him. Service to the Cause is the refinement of souls from attachments. God willing, the friends shall, through the hosts of remembrance and utterance, take possession of the hearts of the people of the world. Contention and disputation have ever been and shall continue to be the way of the misguided ones. As to thy question about souls after their ascension, these degrees and stations have repeatedly been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen, and some possess copies thereof. God willing, thou shalt observe them. But the counsel of this Wronged One is that thou shouldst hold fast with the utmost joy and fragrance to serving the Cause of the Beloved of the worlds, for it would be regrettable if these blessed days were to end with such remembrances. Be steadfast in what thou hast been commanded. He will, through the finger of might, open before thee a door wherein thou shalt witness and behold what thou hast desired from the ocean of thy Lord’s utterance, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. God willing, thou shalt be illumined by the lights of His countenance and drink from the Kawthar of certitude.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant conveyeth greetings and praise to all. God is witness that this evanescent one hath been and is occupied in this Prison with the mention of souls who are content, well-pleasing, firm and steadfast, and beseecheth from God, exalted be His glory, confirmation for each one. Supplication, imploring and entreaty are from the servant, and grace, bounty and response are from God, the One, the Powerful.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write regarding the book being written in proof of the Revelation, and likewise another treatise on the nobility of the number of the Most Great Name - these matters were submitted by this evanescent one when the Ancient Beauty was residing in the palace outside the Most Great Prison. His words, exalted be His majesty:</p>
<p>“O Muhammad-Husayn! Time and again hast thou been illumined by the splendors of the Sun of divine remembrance, especially in this instance when numerous Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of Will addressed to thee. Know thou the value of this most exalted, most sublime station. If, through the bounty of the All-Merciful, thou drinkest from the ocean of utterance, the affairs of the world shall no longer grieve thee. Thou shalt attain to such joy and gladness that the troubles of the world shall neither prevent nor change it. Whether one striveth in My path or denieth Me - God willing, thou shalt be assisted in that which thou hast intended. Today, should anyone make mention of this Cause or speak a word in its proof, his name shall never be effaced from the Book of existence. Thus hath testified the Lord, the Lord of the Last and the First.”</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseecheth God to confirm thee in that which thou hast intended. Verily, He hath power over whatsoever He willeth.</p>
<p>And as to the fourth matter thou didst mention, it was submitted and He said: “We named him ‘Bird of Glory’ in the Book of Names. God willing, may he be enabled to preserve this station, for the world is in upheaval and the conditions of heedless souls are manifest while the fruits of the tree of sincerity remain hidden. Thieves lie in wait and devils in ambush, and the Cause is mighty, greater and most exalted above them both.”</p>
<p>This servant has mentioned and continues to mention that honored one at special times in the Most Holy Presence. Whatever you wrote, its answer has been revealed and is recorded in this letter. I seek earnestness for that honored one, and likewise steadfastness - these two are pillars for the edifice of human existence. And concerning your mention of conditions in those regions, in these days those areas are aflame - at times with the fire of war, at times with the instruments of corruption, and at times with the flames of greed. Surely that honored one has heard and continues to hear of these things. This evanescent one beseeches God to ordain means whereby the horizons of those lands may be illumined with the lights of the Sun of unity. Today is the day of service and the day of teaching the Cause. In this land and its surrounding regions, due to wisdom and other considerations, teaching has in these days been strictly forbidden in the Book. Blessed are they who in those lands attain to this most great bounty. May the Glory which shineth resplendent from the horizon of the heaven of mercy be upon you and upon those who are with you in the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, exalted be His glorious station!</p>
<p>Immeasurable praise befitteth that Peerless Being Who caused the Sun of divine unity to dawn from the horizon of detachment and dispelled the darkness of limitation through the manifestation of His light. His is the power and the might, the grandeur and the dominion. His command is effective, His decree is operative, His light is radiant, and His manifestation is evident. Exalted is His station above comparison with fancy and imagination, and transcendent is His Cause above description in words. His signs are so manifest that they defy description, and His tokens are so evident that they surpass explanation. The books of the world and the scrolls of nations are powerless to contain them, and the pens of creation fall short in recording them.</p>
<p>Despite these brilliant signs and manifest evidences, it is observed that a few have clung to a mirage, considering themselves to be followers of truth, and have contented themselves with the croaking of ravens, remaining deprived of the wondrous melodies of the nightingales of eternity, which sing upon the twigs of the supernal Paradise. Woe unto them and perdition be their lot! They have taken their idle fancies for their god. Soon shall they find themselves in manifest loss. On that day they shall find no helper nor protector.</p>
<p>O people of Baha! Pay no heed to their worthless utterances and vain imaginings. Fix your gaze upon the Most Exalted Horizon, the seat of the throne of your Lord, the Master of all mankind. Arise with strength of heart, eloquence of tongue, and steadfastness of spirit to exalt the Cause of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Verily, he who remains veiled from this Most Great Cause is not mentioned among the people of truth, even should he possess the kingdom of the world and rule over all nations. Glory be to God the Great! He hath raised up servants to His Cause who, though weak, fear not the swords of the oppressors, and who, though poor, turn not unto the riches of the world. This is a perfect power and an all-embracing, comprehensive mercy. Were the wise to ponder this manifest Cause, they would surely acknowledge that the steadfastness shown by the people of Baha in times of tribulation and hardship is itself a proof to all creation. Indeed, were they to content themselves with this alone as evidence for establishing the truth, they would be right, by the Lord of earth and heaven!</p>
<p>We beseech God, exalted be He, to open the eyes of His servants and to make known to them that from which they are veiled in His days. Verily, He has power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the All-Subtle, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>O spiritual friend! Your letter, adorned with the pen of love and the ink of unity and concord, was received, and boundless joy was obtained from the perusal of its manifest words. We beseech Him - exalted be His glory and magnificent His bounty - that you may ever abide beneath the shade of His grace, be sustained by the blessings of His nearness and reunion, remain steadfast in service to His Cause, and be occupied with guiding heedless souls. After perusing your letter, it was presented at the Most Exalted, Most Holy Court, and mention was made of you. These radiant words dawned from the horizon of the utterance of the King of Names and Attributes. His word, exalted be His bounty and mighty His proof:</p>
<p>He is God […]</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Upon thee be the Glory of God, His grace and His loving-kindness. The Most Great Branch was present at this moment and made mention of you, and read your letter before Our face. Praise be to God, it all bore witness to your recognition, love, steadfastness and service, and likewise mentioned your journeys to various regions for the sake of God, the Lord of Lords. We beseech God to assist thee and to manifest whatsoever shall lead to the salvation of His servants. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>As to what the heedless one mentioned about why Azal was rejected, say: O heedless one! We have never turned to anyone. We have fixed Our gaze upon that proof whereby all the Prophets and Messengers have proven the truth. Today, the station whose verses have encompassed the world and whose manifestation hath shone forth like the sun from the beginning before the faces of all mankind - this thou hast denied, while making mention of Azal who was ever hidden behind a veil. Thou knowest not who bestowed this name upon him. He called the honorable Dayyan “the Father of Evil” and the Friend of God “the Father of Calamities”. About these matters of which thou art certain, thou sayest nothing. Yet concerning a name of whose bearer thou knowest neither his identity nor nature, thou hast uttered and continueth to utter meaningless words, becoming a cause of misguidance while remaining unaware. Would that thou hadst clung to thine own kind! Say: Thou went and saw, but love of leadership became a barrier and prevented thee from mentioning the truth of what thou witnessed. We speak these blessed words for the sake of God and in His path - create not confusion for thyself and others. Hearken unto the words of Him Who counseleth thee for the sake of God. Speak the truth, then present thyself before the Wronged One, that thou mayest witness what thou hast not seen in thy lifetime and hear what no ear in the world hath heard. Thus hath the Ancient Beauty spoken in His Most Great Prison, purely for the sake of God, the Lord of the mighty throne.</p>
<p>O heedless one! Listen not to certain statements. Observe with thine own eyes and hear with thine own ears. Prevent not people from the straight path and deprive them not of the momentous news. Previously, because of the word of a lying woman, the imaginary Qa’im went to Jabulqa, and all those vain imaginings arose which later appeared in the form of the sword against the Primal Point. Return unto thy Lord and repent before Him. Verily, He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>We have heard that a heedless one hath said that what is revealed from that direction is taken from the verses of the Primal Point. Say: Present thyself before the Wronged One that thou mayest hear what hath been sent down from the heaven of God’s will, the Lord of all worlds. Then ask Him whatsoever thou desirest, that thou mayest be assured that the ocean waveth by itself through itself, and the sun shineth by its own light through its own light. He needeth not others to prove His Cause; rather, every cause dependeth upon His confirmation. By God’s life! The Bayan, by His exalted Word, is but a leaf from the garden of My utterance, and what was revealed before beareth witness to My Self. Were the Primal Point alive in this time, He would transcribe what hath been revealed by the Intended One. And thou, O heedless one, art playing with thy deeds. Soon thou shalt witness what servants before thee witnessed in ages and centuries past. To this beareth witness My Most Exalted Pen, from God, the Knower of the secret and the manifest.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! You made mention of Jinab-i-Amin, upon him be the glory of God and His grace, and Jinab-i-’Ali-Haydar, upon him be the glory of God and His loving-kindness, and the other friends who were present at the gathering. Each one attained the mention of the Wronged One and the verses of the Supreme Pen. Convey to all of them greetings from the Wronged One. Should God will and desire, He will mention their names once again. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who love thee and hearken to thy words concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of creation.</p>
<p>Again these manifest verses have been revealed from the Source of utterance, the King of names and attributes. His word, exalted be His beneficence: O Haydar-Qabli-’Ali! Thou didst write concerning travelling to various regions for the Cause of God, and likewise concerning meeting with the Prisoner. Praise be to God that thou art adorned with the ornament of virtuous conduct, kindness and compassion. We beseech God to guide His servants through thee, to give them to drink of the Kawthar of His recognition, and to assist them with the hosts of revelation and inspiration, such that the doubts of the world, its events and ornaments may not prevent them. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the friends in every land and give them the glad-tidings of the waves of God’s ocean of mercy.</p>
<p>In these days, three letters were sent to this servant from Shiraz from Jinab-i-Hakim, who is named Rafi’, and Jinab-i-Mirza ’Abdu’l-Hamid, and another friend. A reply was revealed but there was delay in sending it. We beseech God to assist them with the hosts of wisdom and utterance and to aid them in the victory of His Cause, for this is not the day of question and answer. They should speak that which the trees speak: “The kingdom belongeth to God, the Omnipotent, the All-Choosing.” God willing, may they be assisted to set aflame hearts and souls with the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree and illuminate them with the light of His Cause. This is what is befitting today.</p>
<p>We have commanded this servant present to make mention of verses from the Tablet of Wisdom. They attract the hearts of those who are near and the sincere ones, and transform the world. And regarding travel to any place, that which is decided through consultation is acceptable before God, and there is no harm in meeting with the Prisoner; perchance he may be reminded and fear. Should he attain to that which hath been mentioned for him, he will attain the good of this world and the next. Otherwise, verily God is independent of all worlds.</p>
<p>And if an ignorant, heedless soul should again request a meeting, this response is beloved: Say: “Verily, the Truth giveth and doth not receive.” This word was uttered in Baghdad by the Lord of all being in the days when association with Shaykh ’Abdu’l-Husayn was intended. Follow thy Lord’s command from His presence, and He is the All-Commanding, the All-Knowing. God willing, may the friends in various regions, through thy arrival at the supreme height, turn their faces toward and attain the most exalted station, which is the station of the most great steadfastness. Blessed are they that attain thereunto.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that that beloved one is, in most times, honored with the utterances of the Lord of names and attributes, and is the recipient of His favors and specially blessed by His grace. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee! We beseech God to aid thee in that which will cause thy name to be exalted throughout the lands and thy mention to be elevated among the servants, and to be for thee an honor and a treasure with thy Lord, and a station and elevation in thy beginning and end - and that is to raise the word of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, through wisdom and utterance among all possibilities. O what joy unto him who hath attained unto this most exalted station and supreme rank! By thy life, there is no bounty in all existence more delightful than this, nor any sovereignty more mighty than this. Joy to those who attain and blessed are those who arrive!</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God, O Lord of existence and Sovereign over the seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by Thy Word through which the suns of Thy commandments have shone forth throughout all ages, and Thy power hath encompassed all cycles and periods, to aid those who have arisen to guide Thy servants to the kingdom of Thy knowledge, O Lord of creation, in such wise that their words may influence hearts and minds and all Thy servants may turn toward Thy direction on the Day of Return. O Lord! Even as Thou hast commanded them to call out between earth and heaven, assist the hearers to rend asunder the veils and draw nigh unto Thee, O Lord of earth and heaven. If Thou forsakest them, who would draw them nigh unto Thee, and if Thou aidest them not, who would guide them to Thee? Thou art He Whose mercy hath preceded all things and Whose loving-kindness hath encompassed all. Look not upon their heedlessness and their veiling, but rather upon Thy widespread mercy and Thy perfect power. Ordain for every seeker that which shall cause him to enter the kingdom of Thy knowledge and partake of the Kawthar of Thy utterance. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest and the Ruler over what Thou desirest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Peerless.</p>
<p>Remember the friends of God who are adorned with the ornament of steadfastness and are turned toward the direction of His Cause with sublime and exalted remembrances from this servant. Spirit and glory be upon thee and upon those who love thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust beneath, the Lord of the Hereafter and of this world.</p>

<p>O beloved Muhammad-Karim! The grace of God, exalted be His glory, has been manifest towards you like unto the radiant rays of the divine Sun of this Day. You have ever been and continue to be beneath the gaze of His favor and mercy. And if at times matters arose that were outside the circle of His good-pleasure, they were veiled and adorned with the ornament of forgiveness. This was among His special favors towards you. Be thankful unto your Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Concealer of faults, the Compassionate, the Generous. Convey greetings to all from God and give them the glad-tidings of His grace, that perchance this greatest glad-tiding may become the cause of remembrance and the source of supreme joy. Say: This is a great Day. Strive that ye may be enabled to make good what hath escaped you.</p>
<p>A hundred thousand praises and thanks befit Him Who is the Ultimate Goal, from Whose blessed Pen flows the living waters of life. His loved ones are forever blessed with His remembrance, honored by His grace, gladdened by His bounty, sustained by His favors, and recipients of His mercy. From the horizon of each of His words shines forth the sun of generosity. God willing, you, this servant, and all the friends shall be enabled to render thanks for His infinite blessings.</p>
<p>Regarding the dream you wrote about, it was truly among truthful visions, as the fragrances of love were wafted from it. This indicates that through divine grace and infinite mercy, bounty and blessing shall be bestowed, and you shall fulfill the rights that were due upon your father’s property - may the glory and mercy of God rest upon him. It is most clear and evident that whatsoever hath been sent down from the heaven of God’s commandments, exalted be His glory, hath been intended for the benefit of His servants. The law of Huquq is most great; it hath ever been and shall continue to be the cause of blessing, bounty, exaltation and glory. Although your departed father - who, as attested by the Supreme Pen, hath ascended to the highest heights - held an exalted station and continues to do so, yet this matter shall add to the brilliance of his station and likewise to the wealth and prosperity of his descendants. Were people truly to become aware of this station, they would arise as befitteth them […]</p>
<p>And whereas it was mentioned that for some time this servant had not sent any missive, letter or communication to you, my excuse is as clear and luminous as the sun, and all the friends of God, His chosen ones and loved ones bear witness to the magnitude of this servant’s occupations. If in the course of a year or two I find the opportunity to express two words of sincere devotion to any one of the friends, it is as though I have accomplished a mighty task, for opportunity is like unto assurance. In these days a great fire has been kindled in the land of Egypt and many honorable souls have been afflicted with utter abasement. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. The friends of that land have turned their attention to this land and great losses have been sustained, but God is verily the Self-Sufficient, the Almighty. Although this servant has mentioned the excuse for not sending letters, nevertheless some time ago in the letter of the beloved of hearts, Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be all the most glorious Glory, a detailed account was conveyed to you. God willing, it has been received and perused. Praise be to God, you and the friends have been and are mentioned in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, especially that household which is among those who have attained the choice wine of certitude in the days of the All-Merciful. And concerning your request for permission to attain His presence, excellent is that which you have asked, for all have been created for this most mighty, most great, most exalted, most excellent Cause. This servant, in accordance with your wish, on one of the nights of the blessed month of Ramadan, made mention of it before the Throne of the All-Merciful, and this answer was revealed from the Dayspring of God’s Command: “O servant present! Write to him who hath turned towards God - upon him be My Glory - that these regions are in turmoil. The fire which the deniers have kindled with their own hands and inflamed by their own deeds hath not yet been extinguished. The world is afflicted with the consequences of its actions, and none hath known or knoweth the cause and reason thereof. Under such circumstances, his movement and journey would not accord with the requirements of wisdom. He remembereth whomsoever He willeth by a command from His presence and recordeth for whomsoever He desireth the reward of attaining His presence. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.” End.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning His honour, the late and lamented, His Holiness Qa’ini, upon him be the Glory of God and His mercy, and your expression of sorrow - in truth there is no cause for sorrow, rather it is cause for gratitude, for he ascended in such a manner that all holy, firm and steadfast souls were filled with longing. In the days when the Ancient Beauty was residing in the palace, the aforementioned departed one took flight to the Supreme Companion at the first light of dawn on the twentieth day of Rabi’u’l-Avval. That very night, the Most Great Branch - may my spirit, my being and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps - visited his home and remained with him for some time. This was one of the special bounties that was bestowed upon him. The next day when news reached the palace, at that very moment the Most Great Branch and the other Branches - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - by command proceeded on foot to accompany the funeral procession. This evanescent servant also wished to accompany the Branches of God, but they said “The weather is cold and you are frail,” and repeatedly uttered these blessed words. Afterwards, this evanescent servant presented himself before the throne with tablet and pen, and at that moment there descended from the heaven of the Lord of all worlds’ bounty that which nothing in the world could equal, to such an extent that this servant became occupied with the word “Would that I…” I swear by the bounty of God, exalted be His glory, that such grace and favor surrounded him that tongue, pen and man are incapable and powerless to describe it. How blessed and fortunate was he! The field of the pen has reached this point and can move no further. The command is in God’s hands, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>And further, concerning what you wrote about Jinab-i-’Abdu’l-Ahad, you have surely heard the details of what transpired, but praise be to God, through the grace and mercy of God, exalted be His glory, his end was blessed, for he was adorned with the ornament of divine forgiveness and pardon. May the spirit of the world be sacrificed for His bounty! Excessive occupation with worldly affairs sometimes makes one heedless, but God’s grace is great. However enormous a sin may be, it can never equal the magnitude of God’s forgiveness. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist all to remain firm with the greatest steadfastness. He is the Sovereign who does what He wills and the King of the Kingdom of Names. He acts and commands, and He is the Powerful, the Commander, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding your intention to visit the Greatest Holy Leaf, the honored Sister - upon her be God’s grace, mercy and bounty - and that you would perform this blessed act as proxy for the Name of God, while he would visit the Most Great Scene and the Court of the Throne as your proxy, this servant has made the pilgrimage as their proxy to the Ultimate Goal, the Most Exalted End and the Supreme Summit. You too, God willing, will succeed in visiting the Greatest Holy Leaf - upon her be the Most Glorious of all Glory - as proxy for this servant and the Name of God.</p>
<p>And regarding what you wrote about visiting His Honor, the Luminous Name - upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God - God willing it will be sent later.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning the departed and blessed Aqa Fat?u’llah, who ascended to the Supreme Companion, an answer was previously revealed and sent. God willing, it has by now reached you. According to His command, his mother, upon her be the Glory of God, should be content and her portion should reach her, and the remainder should be handled according to the previous command. In these days, according to His command, Sheikh Abu’l-Qasim, upon him be the Glory of God, has turned towards that direction. A Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed and sent to you. God willing, your eyes shall be illumined by its lights, your heart assured by its bounty, and the nostrils of your soul perfumed by its fragrance.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding your departed and blessed father, upon him be the Glory of God and His mercy, that you had inferred from the utterances of the Goal of all the worlds that he was not pleased with you - mention of his goodness has always been made in the Most Holy Court, and in the Book of God he is recorded and inscribed among the firm ones and the forerunners. This evanescent servant has never heard from the tongue of the Lord of Eternity any word indicating his displeasure. God willing, he was and is pleased. What is incumbent upon you is to hold fast to the Book of God in your deeds - therein lies all good, and God suffices as a witness.</p>
<p>Convey greetings to the friends in that land who have drunk from the cup of certitude and have attained the station of assurance. The petition of this servant and his counsel to the friends is that they should appreciate the value of these remaining days and count time as precious. By Him at Whose command the Supreme Pen moves, a single moment of these days is more precious than all the mines of the earth and their jewels, and than all that the kings and others in the world possess. One must know the station of such times, epochs, days, hours and minutes, for there has never been and never will be anything comparable to what has been mentioned. God willing, may the True One, exalted be His glory, confirm us all that we may act in accordance with what is befitting and attain to what is acceptable. The command is in His grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>There is no news from the emigrant, upon him be the Glory of God. I send greetings to him. Blessed is he in that he turned and circumambulated the Most Great House of God and attained to what was inscribed in the Books of God, and likewise his brother who drank the choice wine from the hands of his Lord’s bounty, the Generous. The Glory be upon you, upon your mother, your son, those in your household, and upon those men and women who have turned to God, the One, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the All-Dominant, the Self-Subsisting</p>
<p>He is the Dawning-Place from the horizon of the heaven of proof</p>
<p>This is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down unto all who are in the realm of possibility, that the utterance may draw them to the horizon from which the Luminary of Manifestation hath shone forth in this blessed, mighty and wondrous Day. O concourse of the Furqan! Hearken unto the call of the All-Merciful from the Mount of Knowledge. Verily it draweth you nigh unto Him and guideth you unto His straight path. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of this most great favor. Cast away what the people possess and take what hath been given you from God, the Lord of all worlds. Verily He hath appeared and revealed what He willed as a token of His grace, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O people of the earth! Hear the call from the precincts of Akka, from the Divine Lote-Tree raised up in truth: Verily there is none other God but He, the Single One, the One, the Mighty, the Powerful. The Kawthar of immortality hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Approach with radiant faces, then drink therefrom and be not of the heedless. Beware lest the doubts of your own selves withhold you from God, the Lord of all worlds. Take the chalice of salvation in the name of the Cleaver of the Dawn, then drink thereof by the command of One Who is the Ancient Commander. By God! The Day is come and the people are in strange drunkenness. They have forsaken their God in that they have followed their desires. They are indeed among the most lost in the Book of God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. The ocean of utterance hath surged in the realm of possibility and the fragrances of revelation have been wafted among all religions. Blessed is he who hath found and turned unto it, and woe unto them that have turned away.</p>
<p>O My Pen! Turn thy face toward him who hath been named Muhammad and remind him of My verses and illumine him with the lights of My Kingdom and give him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth. O Muhammad! The Most Exalted Pen hath turned toward thee once again that thou mayest inhale the fragrances of revelation and be among the thankful. We have mentioned thee before with a remembrance through which the fragrance of utterance hath been diffused throughout all possibility and the nightingales of proof have warbled upon the branches. Verily there is none other God but He, the Single One, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Say: O My loved ones in Manshad! By the True One, the gate of heaven hath been opened, and the Lord of Names hath come with a power that no earthly might can weaken and with an authority that no clamor of the nations can daunt. He hath stood before all faces and proclaimed in loudest voice: “O concourse of creation! The Self-Subsisting hath come with a sovereignty before which all who are in the heavens and on earth are powerless to stand. Beware lest the tempests of denial or the storms of hesitation move you. This is what ye were commanded aforetime and in this hour. Blessed is he who hath heard and responded, and woe unto every doubting denier. Joy be unto him who hath gone forth from the horizon of the House, speaking of this Most Great Name and bearing glad tidings of this mighty News.”</p>
<p>Say: O people of God! Beware lest ye be like those who fear men as they should fear God, and beware lest the veils of the transgressors, who have cast the covenant of God behind their backs and clung to the promptings of the Evil Ones, prevent you. Say: O concourse of divines! Be fair, by God, and reject not the truth through what ye possess. Read what We have sent down in truth - it will assist you and draw you nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Great. Observe and remember when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came, the people denied Him and spoke concerning Him that which caused the Spirit to lament in His most exalted station and the Faithful Spirit to cry out. Then consider what befell God’s Messengers and His Emissaries aforetime at the hands of the wrongdoers. We mention you for the sake of God and remind you of His signs and give you glad tidings of what hath been ordained in the highest Paradise and the sublime Heaven for those who draw nigh - and I am the All-Knowing Herald.</p>
<p>He hath come for your salvation and hath borne hardships that ye might ascend the ladder of utterance to the summit of knowledge. To this testifieth He with Whom is a wondrous Book. Read what hath been sent down with justice and fairness - it will exalt you in truth and show you what ye were prevented from, and give you to drink of His luminous wine. Thus hath the ocean surged and the fragrance wafted. Blessed is he who hath found and seen, and away with every remote knower. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of utterance be upon thee and upon those who have believed in the All-Merciful and acknowledged what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke before the mention of all created things: Verily there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>We have turned from the eloquent tongue to the luminous tongue that all might understand what hath flowed from the Supreme Pen. O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! The first commandment hath been and is the knowledge of God, and after that steadfastness in His Cause. This steadfastness is not attained except through knowledge. Blessed is the soul that hath drunk from the Kawthar of the Merciful’s utterance and attained unto that which was the purpose of creation. The knowledge of God, in its primary station and first rank, is bound up with and dependent upon the blessed word “He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.” Whosoever attaineth unto the recognition of this exalted word shall find himself seated upon the throne of certitude, and no matter or word shall cause him to slip or be disturbed. It behooveth him to utter these sublime words: “O my Lord, the All-Merciful, the One Who domineth all contingent beings! I testify that Thou art praiseworthy in Thy deeds and obeyed in Thy command.” Blessed are those servants who have held fast to these exalted words and drunk from the ocean of meanings that lie hidden therein.</p>
<p>The honored Siyyid Taqi, upon him be Baha, appeared before the Wronged One with thy letter. We heard thy call and made mention of thee with a mention whose fragrance shall endure as long as the divine Kingdom endures. In all conditions We have counseled the servants to trustworthiness and religious devotion. In truth, the hosts that assist this Most Great Cause have been and are goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. Blessed are they who, through these hosts, open the cities of hearts in the name of the True One, exalted be His glory.</p>
<p>O Muhammad, upon thee be My glory! Verses have been sent down in such wise that none can reckon their number. Ask thou the True One to aid the servants to recite that which hath been revealed and to meditate upon that which hath become manifest. That which was previously sent for the manifestations of justice and fairness is most beneficial, and in the alteration of the party’s verses are signs for the discerning and evidences for the knowing ones. We altered it in wisdom from Our presence. Verily, He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>May God assist Mulla Ali-Akbar in attaining recognition. Should he observe the Book of Certitude, he will surely find his way to the Most Exalted Horizon. We beseech God to attract him through His verses, draw him near through His sovereignty, and aid him through His grace. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Mention hath been made of Mirza Nasru’llah and others. We have remembered him and do remember him that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones. O Nasru’llah! Thy father took hold of the Book of God with power from Him and made mention of Him until he gave up his spirit in His path. By the life of God! A station hath been ordained for him whose description the pens of the chroniclers are powerless to render. We beseech God to assist thee and those who have believed to remain steadfast in this Cause whereby the foundations of the transgressors have been shaken.</p>
<p>O Abdullah! Thy name was present before the Wronged One. We have mentioned thee with a mention from which wafteth the fragrance of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of creation. We counsel thee and those who have believed to wisdom and utterance. Thus hath God ordained in the Scriptures and Tablets. Glorify the name of thy Lord and turn not unto those who have denied My Most Exalted Word and the rustling of My Most Exalted Pen. These, verily, are among the most lost in the Book of God, the Lord of lords. Preserve what hath been sent down from the heaven of My Will, then recite it at eventide and at dawn.</p>
<p>O Abdul-Husayn! The Wronged One remembereth thee in the Most Great Prison when sorrows have surrounded Him from all sides. By God! The happenings of the world do not prevent Him, nor doth the might of nations hinder Him. He speaketh before the faces of princes and divines that which He hath been commanded by God, the Lord of all men. The swords did not frighten Him, nor did the ranks prevent Him. He hath appeared and manifested what He desired, a command from God, Who causeth the rivers to flow. Blessed is the servant who hath held fast to My Book, the eye that hath beheld My traces, and the ear that hath heard My call when it was raised in truth from this station which God hath made the most exalted of stations.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the loved ones in that land on behalf of the Wronged One, and remind them of God’s verses and evidences. Strive that perchance thou mayest open the doors of hearts with the key of the remembrance of the True One, exalted be His glory, and preserve them from previous delusions. Those souls, both men and women, who have drunk of the sealed wine have ever been mentioned before His countenance. We beseech God to keep all steadfast in His Cause. Verily, He is the Powerful over whatsoever He willeth. Within His grasp is the dominion of all who are in the earths and heavens.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the One, the Single. Remember on My behalf him who is named Husayn, who turned to the Most Sublime Horizon, attained the presence of God, and heard the call of the All-Merciful while in the midst of the ignorant. Say: O Husayn! Beware lest the doubts of the world hold thee back. Stand firm in the Cause with such steadfastness that the thorns of those who have turned away from God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forebears, cannot make thee slip. Remember those days when thou wert present before the Wronged One and didst drink the choice wine of reunion from the hand of thy Lord’s bounty, the Generous. Preserve this most exalted station and that which He commanded thee in His presence. Verily thy Lord is He Who speaketh the truth before all faces. Nothing whatsoever hath deterred Him, nor the opposition of the deceivers. When thou findest the fragrance of My utterance from My verses, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! All praise be unto Thee for having guided me in Thy days, honored me with Thy presence, and enabled me to stand before Thy gate. I beseech Thee by the Dawning-Places of Thy verses and the Manifestations of Thy clear tokens, and by the Hands of Thy Cause who have arisen to serve Thee and have voiced Thy praise among Thy servants and have proclaimed Thy Cause and have traversed the lands in remembrance and praise of Thee. Thou art indeed the Almighty Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate. Thou hast manifested whatsoever Thou didst desire through Thy power and might. Verily Thou art the Strong, the Powerful. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken as a token of His grace, that he might praise his Lord and be of the thankful ones. O Muhammad! Convey My glorification unto his face, then recite unto him that which hath flowed forth from the ocean of My all-encompassing knowledge. Glory be upon thee and upon him and upon those whom neither the clamor of the people nor the might of princes hath weakened, and whom the rancor of the divines who have broken God’s covenant and His testament hath not frightened, and who have done that by reason of which every possessor of vision and hearing and knowledge who hath believed in God, the Lord of all worlds, hath lamented.</p>
<p>He is the One Who judgeth with truth.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Upon thee be My Glory! Read thou this blessed tablet that thou mayest drink from the hidden oceans within the divine words and soar with the wings of inner meanings in the holy atmosphere of the Eternal. After reading and becoming aware of it, deliver it to Muhammad - upon him be My Glory - in Manshad, that he may consider it and become informed and hearken unto the call of the Wronged One with the ear of his heart. By the life of God! This call giveth life, nay rather, transformeth the body into spirit. The Command is in His grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. O Muhammad! Verily He is praised in His deed and obeyed in His command, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting</p>
<p>O Aqa Baba! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Most Glorious! Knowest thou Who calleth thee? The Most Exalted Pen of God. And dost thou recognize from which horizon? From this luminous and resplendent horizon. Rejoice in thy Lord’s favor, for the Pen of Utterance hath been moved to make mention of thee by the Most Merciful, that it may draw thee nigh unto a station wherein thou shalt hear from all atoms: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all worlds.” The river of mercy hath flowed from the right hand of the Throne, and the ocean of grace hath surged forth as a bounty from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed is he who hath cast away that which the people possess on the Day of God and hath taken the chalice of eternity in My Most Glorious Name and drunk therefrom, despite every doubting learned one.</p>
<p>Verily, We have heard thy call once in the night, and again in the day, and yet again at dawn. Thy Lord heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Behold, then remember what befell the Wronged One when He was in prison beneath chains and fetters. God aided Him with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, and brought Him forth with such sovereignty as amazed the hearts of them that know. When He departed, He turned toward Baghdad, and when He arrived, that which the All-Merciful had revealed in the Qur’an was manifested. And He blew the second blast, whereupon the denizens of Sinai were struck down, save whom God willed, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. We rent asunder the veils with the finger of might and uncovered that which lay hidden in the treasure of God’s protection, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee that thou mayest find from them the fragrance of thy Lord’s loving providence, the Compassionate, the Bountiful. When thou receivest and readest them, turn thy face toward the Prison and say:</p>
<p>Praise be to Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all nations and by the breaths of Whose revelation the world is perfumed! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue all hearts and illumine both the unseen and the seen, to assist me in that which will diffuse the fragrance of Thy good-pleasure. O my Lord! Thou beholdest me turning toward the heaven of Thy bounty and clinging to the mantle of Thy generosity and benevolence. I beseech Thee by Him through Whom the limbs of the oppressors trembled and the hearts of the aggressors were consumed, through Whom those in the graves were raised and the secrets of all hearts were revealed, to elevate me through Thy Name amongst Thy servants and to establish me in the service of Thy Cause amidst Thy creation. Aid me, then, O my God, through wisdom and utterance. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the Bestower.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Blessed art thou and happy art thou, for thou hast attained unto that which most of the servants have failed to attain. Thou didst hear the Call and wert blessed with uttering the words “Here am I, here am I, O Thou the Desire of the worlds!” The purpose of the worlds of hearing and sight hath been and still is to witness and hearken unto the Divine Call and the Horizon of Revelation. Yet the heedless servants denied God’s mercy and bounty, and disbelieved in the gift of recognition and the feast of certitude. The cause of the prevention of the servants and its reason have been the divines of the age. Glory be to God! Despite their lamenting and wailing with a hundred thousand cries and supplications for the appearance of the Promised One and His meeting, when He was made manifest they did what caused the Primal Point to choose ashes as His resting place. O thou who art attracted by My verses and soarest in the atmosphere of My love! Strive that the servants may not, like the previous party, be afflicted with vain imaginings. Blessed is the soul that hath purified itself from the tales current amongst men, that it may hearken unto the Most Exalted Word. Say: My God, my God! Aid Thy servants unto that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and purify them from that which beseemeth not Thy days, and enable them to act according to that which Thou hast commanded them in Thy Book. O my Lord! Leave them not to themselves, disappoint them not from the gate of Thy grace, and deprive them not of the ocean of Thy utterance. Thou art He Whose atoms have testified to Thy generosity and bounty, and to Thy power and might. Enable them, O my God, to be steadfast in Thy Cause, to return unto the court of Thy glory, and to turn unto Thy presence. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, possessed of great bounty, the Ever-Flowing, possessed of abundant grace.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the friends, that perchance the fragrances of these greetings may intoxicate them and cause them to hold fast unto that which is befitting. The intoxication that proceedeth from the wine of recognition bringeth joy to the world of being and bestoweth gladness. The friends must, in spite of the enemies, guide the ignorant servants to the divine ocean of knowledge and wisdom through wisdom and utterance. Glory be to God! The signs of power exist in all things, and verses descend like rain, showering down, and He Who conversed on Sinai is seated upon the throne of Revelation without veil or concealment. Nevertheless, through the words of Kandi and Ibn-i-Dhi’b and their like, they have been deprived of the Dayspring of divine revelation and the Dawning-Place of celestial light. And the people of the Bayan are seen to be more heedless and more veiled than all others. By My life! They have not perceived the fragrance of the Day of God and are more veiled and remote than even the Shi’ih sect. Blessed are the people of Baha who, should they see the Primal Point pause in His Cause, would likewise pause in what hath appeared from Him. This is the station of the most great steadfastness. I have mentioned all that is befitting for My Cause and My Revelation and My rising and My establishment. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing Witness and the All-Wise Observer.</p>
<p>The honoured Muhammad – upon him be the Baha – hath repeatedly made mention of thee and hath sent thy letter to the presence of the Wronged One. The servant present submitted it, and this Most Sublime, Most Luminous Tablet was revealed from the heaven of bounty, that thou mayest drink therefrom, through My Name, the Self-Subsisting, My sealed wine, and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds, and thanks be unto Thee, O Desire of the nations, in that Thou hast remembered me in Thy Most Great Prison when I was in the midst of sorrows through that which the hands of the oppressors had wrought.” Blessed be thy tongue for having testified to that which God hath testified, and thy heart for having been illumined with the light of recognition. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for thee a light that shall walk before thy face in all His worlds. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>There hath now come to pass what was hidden from eyes and veiled from understanding, in that the Source of thy Lord’s loving-kindness hath willed to open the door of forgiveness unto thy father and thy brother. By My life! Through My remembrance, the ocean of forgiveness and bounty hath surged from the presence of God, the Lord of all beings and the Sovereign of the Kingdom of Names. The grace of thy Lord hath at this moment encompassed them both, and My Most Exalted Pen hath spoken and said: The glory be upon you both, and the light be upon you both, and the spirit be upon you both, and the fragrances of revelation be upon you both, and the sweet perfumes of the Robe be upon you both. We beseech God to send down upon you both, at all times, mercy from His presence and loving-kindness from His own Self, and to make you to be of those who associate with His chosen ones and His Prophets in the Most Exalted Paradise. He, verily, is the Sender of verses, the Revealer of clear tokens, and the Lord of all names and attributes.</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned! Thou hast attained unto that which no thing can equal. Give thanks unto thy Lord, the Lord of Names. He hath made mention of thee in such wise that the light of utterance hath shone forth from the horizon of possibility, and the Cock of the Throne hath crowed and said: The glory shining forth from the horizon of this Glory be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and them that hear mention of thee in this Most Great Remembrance and Momentous News. Verily, the Ocean desireth to manifest itself through other waves, that it may give glad-tidings unto the loved ones of God of His mercy and His grace and His bounty. There is none other God but Him. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Commander, the All-Wise. Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto the mention of the Most Great God and hath drunk the choice wine of revelation from the utterance of his Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Asghar! Thou hast attained unto the mention of God, the Lord of Destiny, once before and now yet again. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this manifest grace. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath held fast unto righteousness in the days of God, the Lord of all beings, and hath turned away from vain desire. He is, verily, among the sincere ones in My perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>We have sent down the verses wherein are My commandments and My laws through which We have preserved My servants and aided them with truth. Yet most of the people are heedless. Take My Book with power from My presence and put aside that which is with those who have denied the mercy of God and disbelieved in that which hath been sent down from His presence. They are, verily, among the abject. The glory from Our presence be upon thee and upon those who have taken the cup of My bounty from the hand of My loving-kindness and have drunk in this Name whereby the limbs of the idolaters have quaked.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qablil-Hasan! The faithless hunters have aimed at the Most Exalted Station, and the oppressors of the earth with swords of hatred have intended harm against the Temple of Eternity. They desired to extinguish the light of God through their calumnies, but the Wronged One stands unveiled and uncovered before the multitudes. Neither their might nor their ranks have deterred Him. He speaks that which He is commanded by the Wise Ordainer. Glory be to God! Despite having heard every call and witnessed the signs of God, they persist in denial and rejection. Naught shall befall us save what God has decreed for us. Soon shall they behold the recompense of their deeds through the justice of the All-Knowing Judge. Be not grieved at anything. The world shall pass away, along with the might of its princes and the clamor of its divines, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The glory from Us be upon you and upon those who have quaffed the wine of steadfastness in this firm and impregnable Cause.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who is named Muhammad-Qablil-Husayn, who has turned to God in this blessed, mighty and wondrous Day. The fragrances of the revelation of the Ancient King have encompassed the world, yet the peoples are in evident doubt. Say: My God, my God! Thine is the grace for having awakened me, and Thine is the praise for having made me know Thee, and Thine is the glory for having taught me Thy straight path. I beseech Thee, O Ancient King, by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued all created things, and by Thy Command through which Thou hast manifested that which was hidden in Thy knowledge and treasured in the repositories of Thy wisdom, to aid Thy loved ones in that which will exalt them among Thy servants. By Thy Name, ordain for them every good thing Thou hast ordained in Thy Book. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Protector of those who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>Thus have We adorned the heaven of the Tablet with the stars of wisdom and utterance, as a command from Us and a favor from Our presence. Blessed are they who perceive and blessed are they who discern.</p>
<p>O Aqa Baba, upon thee be My glory! We have desired to seal thy Tablet with the mention of one who loved Me and held fast to My cord and spoke My praise and attained My presence and drank the choice wine of revelation from the cup of My bounty and arose to serve My Cause among My servants, and was named Javan-i-Ruhani in My mighty and wondrous Book.</p>
<p>As commanded, send this blessed Tablet and whatever else has been and is being sent to those regions to his eminence the illumined one, that is, Javan-i-Ruhani, upon him be the everlasting glory of God, that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones.</p>

<p>He is the Speaker in the Return</p>
<p>O Jalal! Hearken with thine inmost ear to the Call of the Self-Sufficing, the Most High, and arise to render service. Today upon the face of the sun was seen this most exalted Word: O peoples of the earth! Let not vain imaginings deprive you of the Lord of all names, nor let idle fancies withhold you from the sealed wine. His signs have encompassed the world and His verses have embraced all things. He hath sacrificed Himself and all He possessed for the reformation of the world and the salvation of nations. Every person of insight beareth witness and every fair-minded one testifieth that He hath not for a moment sought to preserve Himself. He hath ever raised His call before the faces of rulers and divines and heroes, and hath ordained that which would ensure the tranquility and assurance of the peoples of the world. Yet most have rejected the counsels of God and accepted not His decree. In particular did the people of the Bayan commit such acts as caused the outpourings of the True Bestower of bounties to be stayed. Say: O people of fairness! If ye deny this Most Great Revelation, what thing is worthy of mention or befitting to acknowledge? Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, turn from oppression to justice, and from fancy seek the station of certitude. This Most Great Revelation hath never been, nor is it now, dependent upon the acceptance and acknowledgment of anyone. Rather, all are dependent upon His acceptance. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and afflict not yourselves anew with personal imaginings.</p>
<p>Say: O Hadi! Fear God and be not of the wrongdoers. If thou art truly a seeker of truth, turn to His Writings and ponder His verses. By God’s life! They shall enrich thee above all else and acquaint thee with that whereof thou wert heedless. Today the Lote-Tree is laden with countless fruits - behold and be not of the negligent ones. The waves of the ocean of utterance surge before all faces at their utmost height, and the effulgences of the Sun of Truth are manifest and visible. O Hadi! If thou deniest this bounty, with what excuse wilt thou justify thyself before God? Fear the omnipotent, all-compelling Lord. Be not the cause of leading souls astray. Leave the vain imaginings of the past to the former peoples. Consider the Day of God and that which hath appeared therein. O Hadi! Today the mountains cry out “The Self-Sufficient, the Most High hath come!”, the heavens proclaim “The All-Merciful hath come!”, and the trees declare “The Chosen One hath come!” Were one to attain unto hearing ears, one would hear from all things the glad-tidings of His appearance. Today the fragrances of utterance are diffused and the dove of knowledge warbleth upon the highest branches. Soil not thyself with the clay of idle fancies and deprive not thyself of the ocean of meanings. Thy friends have spoken and continue to speak of perversion. Fear God and be not of the ignorant ones. These were the vain imaginings of the former peoples throughout ages and centuries. They clung to certain calumnies and thus deprived themselves of the ocean of bounty on the Day of Judgment. The wickedness of the Shi’ih sect reached such heights that they cursed the Truth from their pulpits with loudest clamor and issued the decree for His martyrdom. O Hadi! Reflect upon that which hath appeared and speak with fairness. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of proof that this Wronged One speaketh with truth and uttereth for the sake of God. Thou wert and art unaware of the root of the matter. Hearken unto the words of the faithful counselor and observe and listen with the eye of justice and the ear of fairness. Fear God, cast aside thy desire and take hold of thy Lord’s command, for unto Him shall be thy return and final dwelling. Hasten to His good-pleasure, then read what hath been sent down from the kingdom of His utterance. Beware lest the vain imaginings of them that have broken His Covenant and Testament hold thee back. Look with thine own eyes and hearken with thine own ears. By God’s life! The eyes of others shall not suffice thee, nor shall the ears of others avail thee, nor shall thy fancies guide thee, nor shall thy conjectures uplift thee, nor shall thy riches profit thee. I counsel thee for the sake of God, and thou, for the sake of God, hearken unto that which shall enrich thee above all else save thy Lord. O Hadi! Hear the counsel of him who counseleth thee for God’s sake and desireth naught but thy good in thy latter end and beginning. Adorn thy head with the crown of God-fearingness, thy temple with the robe of justice, and thy heart with the ornament of fairness. Return to the evidences of God with penetrating vision, illumined heart, sanctified soul and praiseworthy character, that there may be revealed unto thee that which was concealed from thee. Know thou of a certainty that thy perversity shall not profit thee and thy might shall not bring thee nigh unto Him. Cast off thy burden, then make God’s Word thy protection. Conceal not God’s Faith and His religion, deny not His verses and be not ungrateful for His bounty. He hath manifested His sovereignty, fulfilled His promise, aided His party, and raised the standard of His utterance amongst His servants. He hath made known His Revelation in His lands, sent down His verses, revealed His proofs and caused all things to speak His praise. By God! This is the Great Announcement and […]</p>
<p>O negligent one! Beware lest thou object to this mighty Cause, and O ignorant one, lest thou be heedless of it. Be not of those who have disputed it. Place thyself in the presence of God, then judge fairly in His Cause. Beware lest thou deny him whom God’s Books and Scriptures have acknowledged, and oppose him through whom the ocean of knowledge and wisdom has surged.</p>
<p>O Hadi! Hear My call. Cut not down the Tree of Justice and Equity with the sword of tyranny, nor veil the face of godliness behind the covering of oppression and transgression. Let thy will be absorbed in the Will of thy Lord, and thy desire in His desire. Abandon the creed of those who believed not in Him and His verses, and who disputed His commandments and ordinances.</p>
<p>Reflect upon the world, its changes, alterations and passing away. Where is Chosroes and his palace, Parviz and his ministers? Where are the kings of the earth, their palaces and treasures? Where are their armies and their riches? Did that which they amassed profit them, or that which they acquired exalt them? Nay, by Him Who split the grain and created the soul! The irrevocable decree transformed their palaces into tombs and their joy into grief. Where is their gladness and their comfort, their delight and their contentment? Their company has been scattered and their gathering dispersed. Their houses became empty, their roofs fallen in, their trees uprooted, and their fine garments worn out. By God’s life, My heart lamenteth and My pen mourneth. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist His servants in that which He loveth and is pleased with.</p>
<p>O friends of God in His lands and His loved ones in His realms! We counsel you to trustworthiness and godliness. Blessed is the city that hath been illumined by their light. Through them the station of man is elevated and the door of tranquility is opened to all in creation. Blessed is he who hath held fast unto them and recognized their station, and woe unto him who hath denied their rank and deprived himself of their adorning.</p>
<p>O people of God! Trustworthiness is as the sun. Wealth and security depend upon it. It is the pillar of the pavilion of justice and the fortress of equity. Today the hosts of divine religion are goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct. Strive that ye may attain unto that which hath been recorded in God’s Book by the Pen of the Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>O Jalal! We beseech God that He may aid thee and cause thee to return to thy land illumined with the light of the Sun of divine utterance, that all may be enlightened and refreshed by the reviving breaths of God’s revelation. Convey My greetings to the people of Shin. Say: O friends! Hold fast unto unity and harmony. We beseech God to manifest through you that which shall cause the comfort, mercy, tranquility and ease of the people of the world. Blessed are they who strive to unite hearts.</p>
<p>O Jalal! Say: Today the Sun of bounty hath dawned from the supreme horizon, and the ocean of generosity hath appeared before the faces of men. The sincere ones, both men and women, are adorned with the ornament of God’s bounty, glorified be His majesty. He hath forgiven thee and those who desired forgiveness. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Say: Know ye the value of these days and arise to make good what hath passed. A mighty journey lies ahead; forget not what is needed for the journey and hold fast unto it. God, glorified be His majesty, commandeth that which shall cause the salvation and ease of the peoples of the world. This Wronged One hath been and is a captive in the hands of enemies throughout all days, and hath never sought to preserve His own life. The people of justice and fairness bear witness to what hath been mentioned. Like the spring rain, Tablets have descended from the heaven of God’s mercy upon those regions, and there hath been and is no purpose save the guidance of mankind.</p>
<p>Mention the people of N and Y [Najafabad and Yazd] from one who was imprisoned, and give them glad tidings of God’s loving-kindness. Blessed is Our servant Al-Wahid, who attained My presence and stood before My countenance and soared in My atmosphere and drank the choice wine of My utterance and offered up his soul in My path, and blessed are those who aided him until they were martyred in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Those souls who have borne tribulations in God’s path are all mentioned before the throne and have attained special favors. This Wronged One has ever mentioned the servants and handmaidens of that land. The reward of no one is ever lost with God, nor shall it be. He observes the deeds and hears the words - He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>O party of God! Today is the day of service and assistance. Deprive not yourselves. In this transient world, occupy yourselves with gaining eternal stations. Life passes more swiftly than lightning - every edifice faces destruction, and death pursues every life. The possessor of wisdom is one who remains not heedless and who holds fast to that which leads to exaltation, glory and elevation.</p>
<p>O Jalal! We have mentioned thee before and at this time - verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Regarding what thou hast mentioned about the Huquq, this matter depends on the willingness and acceptance of souls. Reminding others of it is beloved, but demanding it is forbidden. Its benefits return to the souls themselves. Whosoever pays the Huquq of God with spirit and fragrance and with eagerness and longing, its acceptance is permitted; otherwise, thy Lord is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Behold, then mention what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “O mankind! Ye are the poor in relation to God, and God is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised.” This matter pertains to the Trustee [Haji Amin], upon him be My glory, and We also give thee permission - if someone desires with perfect willingness and love to pay the Huquq, thou mayest accept it. Verily He commands all with what benefits them in every world of God’s worlds, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in the Most Great Prison while in the hands of the heedless. The glory shining from the horizon of My heaven of bounty be upon those who have turned their hearts to My horizon and have heard My sweetest call when it was raised between earth and heaven. These are men whom the ranks of enemies did not prevent, nor were they frightened by the might of those who were heedless of what they were commanded by the Creator of heaven. They arose and proclaimed before the faces of the divines and princes: “The Promise hath come, and the Promised One calleth from His most exalted horizon to all who are in earth and heaven.” Blessed are they that hear, and blessed are they that have attained, and woe unto the heedless and the deniers. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>The servant beareth witness unto that which the Desired One of the world hath testified of His Own Self, that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been in the heights of power and majesty, and in the summit of bounty and grace, and will ever continue to be what He hath been. The tongues of all created things have testified to His grandeur, and the temples of all contingent beings have bowed down before His sovereignty. He is the Single One, the One, the Self-Subsisting, Who cannot be known save through Himself nor described save by His Own Self. The Most Exalted Pen hath appeared and given utterance to that whereby the Kingdom of Names hath been enraptured, and through which He hath subdued the world and guided the peoples. Blessed is he who, having cast behind him his vain imaginings, hath turned unto his Beloved and his Goal; and woe unto him who hath denied God’s right and the rights of His loved ones, and hath forbidden his soul from drawing nigh unto the Most Exalted Horizon, calling it instead unto the promptings of desire.</p>
<p>O Thou Sovereign of the world, manifest amongst the nations! I beseech Thee by the Pen whereby Thou hast taught man what he knew not, to aid Thy servants and creatures to turn unto Thee, to arise before the gate of Thy bounty, and to set their faces toward the ocean of Thy bestowals. O Lord! They are the poor, and Thou art the All-Possessing, the Almighty; they are the ignorant, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Take hold of their hands through Thy power, might and sovereignty, and illumine their faces with the lights of Thy countenance and their hearts with the splendors of the suns of Thy knowledge. Thou art He, O my God, before Whose manifestations of generosity all bounty hath bowed low, and before Whose evidences of knowledge all learning hath become abased. I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty and Thy majesty to ordain for the people of Thy realm that which will draw them nigh unto the gate of Thy mercy, cause them to speak Thy praise, and acquaint them with what Thou hast desired in Thy days. Thou art He in Whose grasp are the reins of the world and the controls of the nations. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>I offer prayers, peace and glory unto those whom neither the doubts of the learned could deter from the Lord of Names, nor the clamor of the mystics from the Most Exalted Horizon. These are servants through whom the Sun hath shone and the clouds have rained. All things have borne witness to their acceptance, their attentiveness, their turning unto God, their steadfastness, their praise, their firmness, their rootedness and their constancy in this Cause, whereby the servants have lamented and hearts have melted. These are among the choicest of creation in the sight of Truth. The Concourse on High and the dwellers of Paradise invoke blessings upon them morning and evening. Blessed is he who hath recognized their station, attained their presence, and heard from them the praise of their Creator; and woe unto him who hath remained heedless, turned away, denied, and retreated from this station which hath been ordained for him by the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>Thereafter, O beloved of my heart, the servant hath been honored with thy letter, which spoke in praise of our Goal and your Goal and the Goal of the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the pavilions of grandeur. I broke its seal and read its contents, and brought it to the Most Glorious Paradise, and after obtaining permission, presented it at the Most Exalted Horizon. Then the Tongue gave utterance in the Kingdom of Expression, saying - and His Word is the Truth […]</p>
<p>O servant in attendance! Write to Muhammad-Qabil-i-Husayn, upon him be my Baha: Praise be to God that from the beginning of the Cause thou wert blessed with that which most of mankind hath not attained. Thou didst turn to Him, heard the call, and wert blessed to respond “yea.” This was what was needed, and through God’s grace and favor thou didst achieve it. In the early days the Ancient Tongue proclaimed this exalted word: “This is not the Day of questions and answers. It behooveth everyone, when hearing the Call from the Supreme Horizon, to say: ‘Here am I, here am I, O Lord of Names! Here am I, here am I, O Creator of Heaven!’” And thou didst attain unto this station. The Supreme Pen hath testified to thy devotion and sincerity, but this station is indeed most great. Thou must preserve it and be observed to become daily more enkindled in the Cause of God. By Him Who revealed the Bayan and manifested the proof! All that is witnessed in the world will soon return to nothingness, while that which hath been ordained for His loved ones and chosen ones shall endure for as long as His names and attributes endure. Thy name is mentioned in the Kingdom and is inscribed by the Most Glorious Pen in God’s Book. Say: O my God and my Lord! I beseech Thee by the light wherewith Thou hast illumined the horizons of the hearts of them that are sincere in Thy days, and by the fire of Thy love which hath set ablaze the hearts of Thy chosen ones and loved ones, to aid me to be steadfast in that which Thou hast given me through Thy bounty, made known to me through Thy grace, and taught me through Thy loving-kindness. O my Lord! Thou seest me, with my whole being, my spirit, my outer and inner self, turning toward the horizon whence the lights of Thy countenance have shone forth, and holding fast to the cord of Thy favors. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me that which beseemeth Thy days and that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Thou art He to Whose generosity every tongue hath testified, and to Whose power every utterance hath witnessed. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. I beseech Thee to protect me from those who have denied Thy truth and turned away from Thy sovereignty. Furthermore, I beseech Thee, O my God, by the Most Great Word whereby Thou hast subdued all things, to strengthen me in Thy remembrance, Thy praise, and the service of Thy Cause through the wisdom Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that through the loving-kindness of the Beloved of the world thou hast attained unto the Kawthar of the Merciful’s utterance, and these exalted words were revealed especially for thee. Well is it with thee and pleasing is it unto thee. Likewise a tablet was revealed and sent down from the heaven of will. God willing, thou shalt be assisted in all conditions with that which He loveth and is pleased with. From the beginning of the Cause thou didst stand at the gate and wert engaged in the mention of God. This station is most great. Although due to the meanness of the world and its worthlessness the stations of those who are steadfast, who have turned to God and are firm have remained hidden, yet this concealment shall last but a few days. Soon will the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of bounty make manifest the stations of souls and reveal them to all the worlds. This ocean hath neither shore nor bottom, for its mention hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur and been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen. This evanescent servant hopeth that thou mayest shine forth like the morning star from the horizon of the heaven of God’s Cause. His is the command, in the past and in the future, and all are submissive unto Him.</p>
<p>You have remembered rightly concerning the delay in my letter, but God the All-Knowing bears witness that you have ever been present before my face and mentioned by my tongue. How could this ephemeral one forget that spiritual friend who from the beginning of the Cause has been turned toward the Truth? If my letters have been delayed, it is because night and day I am occupied before His face in transcribing the revealed verses, and furthermore letters from the friends arrive continuously and successively to such an extent that were it not for the assistance of the Beloved of the Worlds, this ephemeral one could never fulfill his duty to reply and accomplish that with which he is charged. You yourself bear witness to what I have stated. As for what you wrote concerning your namesake, upon him be the Glory of God, and concerning his degrees of longing, yearning, firmness and steadfastness - indeed what you wrote is correct, clear and evident. I beseech the Exalted Truth, glorified be His majesty, to assist him in that which befits this divine Day. God willing, may he at all times drink from the Kawthar of the utterance of the All-Merciful and be enkindled with the fire of His love. These matters were also presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Threshold. A most wondrous, most mighty, most holy Tablet was revealed from the heaven of will especially for him. God willing, may he attain to its perusal and drink from the ocean of divine utterance that lies concealed within its words and verses. His is the praise and the glory, His the bounty and the giving. He bestoweth as He willeth and withholdeth as He willeth. He is the Beneficent, the Giver, the Generous, the Bountiful. Convey my greetings to him.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about permission to turn towards the Prison, it was presented before the Throne. This is what the All-Bestowing spoke in reply, exalted be His glory: He is God, exalted is He! Verily He loves your presence, and you yearn for His presence, His meeting and His reunion, which God has made the ultimate goal and the supreme cause for the appearance of creation and its resurrection. But the people and their deeds have come between us and you. Today the sun of justice is concealed beneath the clouds of oppression. This too is from the wisdom of God, your Lord and the Lord of the worlds. Be not grieved at separation, for verily whoever is truly enkindled with the fire of God’s love and attains to His love - the reward of meeting and reunion has been and will be recorded for him by the Supreme Pen. Verily He inscribes for whomsoever He wishes whatsoever He desires. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>From the moment of Our arrival in this prison, the Tongue of Grandeur hath proclaimed this exalted word: This land is seen to be outwardly at rest, yet inwardly it is in turmoil. Soon shall its inward state assume the place of its outward condition, and its outward condition the place of its inward state. Such utterances were heard repeatedly from the blessed Tongue. Perchance this may be one of the reasons for Our restraint. Nevertheless, We cherish the hope that through the infinite oceans of mercy, this station may be recorded by the Supreme Pen in the most excellent manner regarding the true chosen ones. The banner of “He doeth what He pleaseth” is raised through His Name, and the standard of “He ordaineth what He willeth” is manifest through His Command. The Kingdom of Will is agitated before His Will, and the Dominion of Utterance is submissive and silent before His Utterance. Who can measure this station by the standards of the world or by the scales of nations? All are bewildered. Verily we are God’s, and verily unto Him shall we return.</p>
<p>This evanescent one makes known to those who drink of the Kawthar of inner meanings that the friends must at all times beseech and supplicate the Self-Subsisting Lord that perchance the veils that have prevented the world from beholding Him might be rent asunder, and that eyes and vision might attain to that for which they were created. Today the Kawthar is flowing, the River of Divine Mercy is manifest, and the Sealed Wine is present. Say: O masters and friends of God! Strive that ye may attain to that which beseemeth you, and take your portion and share of that which is in this day being sent down from the heaven of God’s bounty and appearing from the ocean of His grace. I swear by the Divine Ocean of Knowledge that if in this day any soul should miss aught, its retrieval shall be impossible.</p>
<p>Convey greetings on behalf of this servant to all, and inform them of what hath been mentioned. God willing, may all be gathered upon the carpet of unity and soar in the atmosphere of oneness. Verily, He aideth whomsoever He willeth as a bounty from His presence. There is none other God but He, the Hearer, the Answerer. May the Glory shining from the horizon of our Lord, the Most Glorious’s favors, be upon you and upon those who have attained unto the days of their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to God that the lips of assurance have smiled and the pearl of mystical knowledge of the Countenance of the Most Merciful hath appeared from the shell of certitude, and the tongue of truth hath spoken with most wondrous utterance that there is none other God but He, the Luminous, the Most Luminous. Again, praise be unto Him that the sun of remembrance of the Lord of creation hath risen and shone forth from the horizon of the heart with the lights of righteousness, and the tree of certitude hath grown from the soil of the heart, and every branch of its branches and every leaf of its leaves hath spoken in diverse melodies that there is none other God but He, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.</p>
<p>O what joy that the rose of paradise hath blossomed and its fragrances have wafted, then spread and diffused, and its breezes, its scents and its spirit have encompassed the temples of the people of mystical knowledge, and the realities of spirits have inhaled it, and every bone hath quivered therefrom and testified with clear expression that there is none other God but He, the Most Great, the Most Holy, the Transcendent, the Mighty, the Gracious.</p>
<p>O blessed be that the nightingale of faithfulness hath warbled upon the twigs of the Divine Lote-Tree with melodies like unto those of the mystic dove upon the branches of the Garden of Paradise, in praise of the Creator of Names and the Sovereign of earth and heaven, Who is sanctified above the mention of aught else but Him or the description of what is beneath Him, and exalted above whatsoever the people of grandeur and glory may ascribe unto Him.</p>
<p>Again, unto Him be grace and permanence and might and sublimity, that the lights of guidance have returned to their abode and the sun of unity and uniqueness hath risen from its horizon, and the temple of sanctity hath donned its robe, and the essence of testimony hath testified to its Witnessed One, its Beloved and its Intended, with its secret and its manifest being, its essence and its heart, that He is the One manifest in His manifestation and hidden in His essence, and exalted in His name, and sanctified in His being from the mention of aught else but Him, and the One witnessed in His beauty and speaking in the heaven of His might and majesty, seated upon the throne of His grandeur and established upon the seat of His command, standing through the sovereignty of His might and His greatness, and self-subsisting through the dominion of His power - He is the One to Whom all existence, both seen and unseen, beareth witness that there is none other God but He, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice unto Thee and unto Thy Tablet which hath been adorned with the ornament of the remembrance of the Lord of Names, and unto the bearer who came as though bringing a musk-pod of immortality and the fragrant perfumes of joy and faithfulness. Praise be to the Beloved of eternity, exalted be His glory, that the fire of divine love hath been kindled from the Lote-Tree of the illumined heart and the call “Verily, there is none other God but He, the Luminous, the Most Luminous” hath been raised from the Sinai of the radiant breast. How blessed was that hour and how excellent that time when this evanescent servant was honored to break the seal of that spiritual tablet. All the twigs and branches of the blessed divine Lote-Tree rejoiced, especially His Holiness the Most Great Branch - exalted be His glory and praise - for due to their attachment to your honor they were greatly saddened by the delay of news from you. We praise God for this and beseech Him, exalted be He, to strengthen your honor in all conditions. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>And then, this evanescent servant presented thy letter before God. God knoweth what shone forth in that moment from the Dayspring of loving-kindness and the Source of grace and tender mercy. None can reckon it save His all-knowing Self. Thereafter there was revealed from the Source of divine utterance - exalted be His glory - these words:</p>
<p>“God willing, thou shouldst at all times guide people to the divine law, that perchance through goodly counsel heedless and doubtful souls may turn toward the realm of oneness. O Nabil! Arise to serve thy Ancient Lord with thy heart, thy sight, thy hearing, thy tongue and all thy members. Thus doth He command thee Who is seated upon the pivot of tribulations and calamities. Make thy feet of iron in My Cause, and thy tongue a double-edged sword in My remembrance and praise, and thine eyes gazing toward My direction, and thy heart turned toward My shining and luminous Beauty. Stand forth between the righteous and the wicked in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Chosen One. Then kindle in their hearts the fire of My remembrance and praise, that the former may increase thereby and the latter may be guided thereby. Thus doth the Sovereign of destiny command thee from this most great prospect. Heal souls from the disease of heedlessness and passion by My Most Exalted and Most Glorious Name. Blessed art thou for that which hath come from thee, whereof the Tongue of Eternity hath spoken in remembrance of thee in this Prison wherein is established the throne of thy Lord’s mercy, the Most High, the Supreme.”</p>
<p>Thus ended that which the Tongue of Revelation spoke. What else can this servant say regarding that which hath been revealed from the Source of Command? For if these divine fragrances were to pass over the mountains, they would transform them into rubies, and were they to pass over graves, their inhabitants would arise to praise thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Your honor hath personally heard the resplendent utterances from the mouth of the All-Merciful and knoweth how, in such instances, the ocean of meanings and wisdom floweth and surgeth from the Fountainhead of the Will of the Lord of eternity. Specifically, it hath been revealed from the right hand of oneness that ye should deal with the servants with supreme kindness, and with perfect wisdom and tender mercy gather all upon the shore of the Most Great Ocean, in such wise that never shall the odor of discord waft between the loved ones of God. And should any soul become heedless and remain veiled, remind him through counsels and admonitions, that perchance he may remember or fear. The purpose is that ye may cause all who are on earth to enter the tabernacle of oneness.</p>
<p>And furthermore the polytheist became aware of the details from that Person and was inflamed within himself. We beseech God to protect your honor from his evil and his plotting. Once again there descended from the right hand of the Throne: In these days after arrival at the Most Great Prison, the Divine Will became attached to this: that He should call anew all creation to the shore of oneness with the most exalted call. Therefore specifically for each of the rulers of the earth a special Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will, and each was designated by a name - the first by “The Cry”, the second by “The Calamity”, the third by “The Inevitable”, the fourth by “The Awakening”, the fifth by “The Overwhelming”, and likewise by “The Deafening Clamor”, “The Imminent”, “The Great Terror”, “The Trumpet Blast”, “The Horn”, and their like - so that all the people of the earth might become certain and witness with their outer and inner sight that the Lord of Names has been and shall ever be triumphant over all. Tribulations and ordeals have not and shall not prevent the Sovereign of the seen and unseen from proclaiming His Cause. By Thy life! In the midst of tribulation, from the horizon of the Prison We have manifested the Face, shining forth amidst all the worlds, and We have called all unto God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise. However, after the dawning of these destined matters from the horizon of the Cause of the Lord of creation, all have fallen to pursuing and panting after thy Lord - they are but in perdition. And the Cause has become extremely severe, to such an extent as transcends mention and utterance. From what appears from the Ancient King, the intention and deeds of the peoples become known - no need remains to mention it. From the beginning of creation until now, such an open proclamation has never occurred. The previous Manifestation and the Herald of My Beauty had sent two Tablets, but in them there was naught save the declaration of divine authority and oppression. In view of wisdom They veiled the essential matter, and in truth there had not been a complete and open proclamation. Therefore there shone forth from the Dawning-Place of Will that which had ever been the purpose of God. Exalted be this Power that has shone forth and encompassed the worlds! The appearance of this deed from the Lord of causes has produced two effects: it has both sharpened the swords of the polytheists and caused the tongues of those who have turned towards Him to speak forth in His praise and glorification. This is the effect of those impregnating winds that were mentioned aforetime in the Tablet of the Temple. Now the earth is seen to be pregnant - soon shall sublime fruits appear, and towering trees, and beloved flowers, and fresh bounties. Exalted is the breeze from the garment of thy Glorious Lord that has wafted and quickened all things! Blessed are they who understand. And this is quite evident and clear that in these matters the Sovereign of Manifestation had no purpose for Himself, and despite knowing that it would cause tribulations and give rise to calamities and severity of circumstances, purely out of grace and mercy and for the quickening of the dead and the proclamation of the Cause of the Lord of Names and Attributes and the salvation of all who are on earth, He has closed His eyes to His own comfort and has borne what no one has borne or shall ever bear.</p>
<p>O Nabil! By My life, today is the day of hearkening. Blessed is the ear that hath turned toward the Most Great Direction. Arise with My sovereignty and command amongst My creation, then remind them of what thou hast discovered from this Announcement whereby the heaven was cleft asunder, the mountains were crushed, the Great Terror appeared, the moon was eclipsed, earthquakes appeared among the tribes, the stars fell, the luminary of fancy was darkened, and the Dove sang upon the branches of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. The Kingdom is God’s, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. Write thou unto those who dwell in the land of Kha, then remind them of this Cause that hath encompassed the heavens and the earth. However, these are the days wherein the people of truth must conduct themselves with the attributes of God and transform satanic qualities into praiseworthy divine characteristics. Corruption hath ever been and shall ever be forbidden, and in this Most Great Revelation all peoples are forbidden from corruption. Let no one ever oppose another or rise up to wage war. The station of the people of truth hath been and shall ever be humility, submissiveness, and praiseworthy attributes. The world is not worthy that man should commit unseemly acts and remain remote from the Sovereign of Oneness. Verily, the world laugheth at those who desire it, and declareth in its loudest voice, addressing them: “Hath anyone ever seen from me aught of good or faithfulness? Soon shall We return you to dust, disappointed and lost, even as We returned those who came before.” All must shine resplendent among the servants through the light of guidance, trustworthiness and fear of God, that all may thereby be drawn to the shore of the sea of oneness. Preserve what We have imparted unto thee, then recite unto the peoples, by thy Lord’s leave, the Lord of all eternity, that they might forsake their desires, turning unto God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust. Thus have We informed thee and related unto thee and imparted unto thee and apprised thee, that thou mayest rejoice and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of Command and Creation, and in Whose right hand is the kingdom of the realm of the heavens and the earth. I thank Thee for having remembered me in the Most Great Prison and for having explained all things in detail unto me. Verily, Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful and the Most Generous of the generous. Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the Day of Judgment.” If copies of the revealed words were to be sent to outlying regions, it would be most beloved.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, Transcendent is His Glory, His Grandeur and Power!</p>
<p>Praise be fitting unto the Lord of all desires, Who with a single effulgence illumined the horizons of discord with the light of unity and concord. His Will lent support and His Purpose penetrated through divine favor. Through that effulgence which encompassed the world through the radiance of the Muhammadan Sun, it seized all the palaces of the Caesars, the arches of the Chosroes, and the porticos of tyrants. In places where the banner of polytheism was raised, the standard of divine unity was hoisted, and gatherings once devoted to the mention of idols were transformed to circles remembering the Lord of all beings. In place of wine came the celestial stream, in place of darkness came light, in place of ignorance came knowledge, and in place of wealth appeared poverty. This poverty is a crown upon the head of the world’s wealth, even as He declared: “Poverty is My glory.” This is a poverty before which the world’s riches bow down and the wealth of nations stands in humility. No tongue can adequately describe this poverty, nor can any pen do justice to its mention. Exalted be His glory, exalted be His dominion, glorified be His grandeur, and mighty be His proof!</p>
<p>The essence of praise and glory, and the source of description and prayer, be upon Him and His family and His chosen ones and His companions - those who forsook their own existence in His path and became connected to the waves of the ocean of His generosity. He is the Mirror of the Most Beautiful Names and the Most Exalted Attributes. We call God the All-Bountiful, yet this bounty appeared through His existence; we name Him the All-Generous, yet this generosity shone forth from that Dawning-Place of the Ancient Light. Through a single decree, the Hijaz became the sun of the world and the Lord of all possibility.</p>
<p>O my God! O All-Generous! O All-Merciful! Thou art He Who openeth doors without keys and manifesteth meanings without the existence of words. O Generous One! The people of unity are found between the fangs of the polytheists, and the people of sanctity are afflicted with countless tribulations. This evanescent servant beseecheth Thee by Thy Most Great Name to protect Thy loved ones at all times and adorn them with the raiment of infallibility, that the whole world may be illumined with the light of unity and hold fast to the cord of infallibility. Perchance through Thy boundless grace, one day the world may be adorned with that which beseemeth it. Thou art the Sovereign Whom the sovereignty of the world neither hindereth nor increaseth Thy station, and the power of nations neither compareth with Thee nor diminisheth Thee. By the hand of Thy loving-kindness and power, take the hands of Thy friends and grant them eternal salvation. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And furthermore, O beloved of my heart! The epistle of divine knowledge, which was adorned with the praise and mention of the Beloved of all worlds, was received. Praise be to God that the temples of words and letters were embellished with the garment of certitude. In truth, each letter thereof was a key to unlock the door of divine love. I cannot describe this ark, nor can I praise it adequately, for its captain is the mention of God, exalted be His glory, and upon its banner is inscribed the blessed words “Verily, there is none other God but He.” The effect of this mention is evident, and the fruit of this description is manifest. The tree of remembrance bore befitting fruit, and the tree of sincerity yielded luminous leaves.</p>
<p>After its observation and perusal, it was presented before His presence, whereupon He said: “Praise be to God! The signs are manifest, the fruits are present, and the grace is evident. Generosity hath assisted, bounty hath aided, and the water of loving-kindness hath enabled the saplings in the garden of inner meanings to become adorned with the leaves and fruits of divine love.”</p>
<p>O thou who art present! From that direction the fragrance of true love is diffused. The tongues of all travelers speak in their praise. The eye of existence is illumined and brightened by such souls. These are they who are endowed with insight from God, the Lord of the virtuous. We send greetings upon him and upon them, and We beseech the Almighty to assist them with the breaths of His grace and the means of the heavens and earth, that they may speak His praise and mention, and arise to serve His Cause. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Responding, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>We make mention of ’Abdu’l-Baha who hath attained that which most of the servants have not attained. God willing, may they ever gaze toward the horizon of the All-Merciful and be gladdened by His grace. Likewise, convey greetings from the Wronged One to the other friends. We beseech God to draw them nigh unto Him and to strengthen them in that which will exalt their mention among His servants, and to grant them success through wisdom. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant hath ever besought and continues to beseech from the Exalted Truth that which would cause the attraction of hearts, the unity of souls, and the concord of all who dwell on earth. The Lord is witness that I am abashed by these utterances, for praise be to God, as attested by the Lord, ye are possessed of insight and endowed with virtuous character. This is a mighty bounty and a great favor that hath been granted. No mention is befitting alongside this matter. How excellent is the saying: “When a hundred cometh, ninety is also with us.” Since ye are possessed of virtuous character, ye possess all good, and since ye are doers of good deeds, ye are masters of all excellence. Well is it with you, and again, well is it with you.</p>
<p>This evanescent one offers salutations and praise to each of the gentlemen and the friends of God, exalted be His praise. Yesterday afternoon, in His presence, He made special mention of that land, speaking in such a manner that each soul who intended to turn in that direction - that is, one by one - was mentioned. How beautiful are these verses in this regard:</p>
<p>Those words which that Friend did speak at that time,</p>
<p>If they strike the night, day would from darkness climb.</p>
<p>That dark night would brighten like morning clear;</p>
<p>Those terms I cannot repeat or render here.</p>
<p>You know what the sun in Aries tells</p>
<p>The flowers and the fields</p>
<p>You know what the crystal water speaks</p>
<p>To blossoms and young shoots</p>
<p>Beyond this I am not permitted to say</p>
<p>For the ocean cannot be contained in a stream</p>
<p>A hundred thousand praises and thanks to the Goal of all the worlds, Who bestowed His favor and showed His generosity, and Who gave this evanescent one and his friends shelter and abode beneath the shadow of His grace. All things bear witness that verily He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the All-Merciful, the Most Bountiful.</p>
<p>According to your request, in the presence of the Most Holy Branches of the Sacred Tree - may my spirit, essence and being be a sacrifice unto the dust of their steps - greetings and praise were conveyed. All the circling men and women each expressed their loving-kindness. Truly, the lights of bounty were manifest, evident and radiant at their mention. The beloved of the heart of ’Abdu’l-Baha - upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of creation - his blessed letter arrived, creating a world of joy and delight. Indeed, the meaning of the passage previously revealed: “May my love make all my deeds and devotions as one single devotion, and my condition in serving Thee eternal” was clear and evident from his letter, for to those endowed with insight, all letters culminate in and speak of two letters: Ha and Ba. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to confirm him with such confirmation that its light may illumine all horizons. After presenting this, He said before His face: “Praise be to the Goal of the world that they were successful and found the path of the All-Merciful through the lamp of recognition. The veils of the world did not prevent his sight from witnessing, nor did the clamor of nations stop his hearing from hearkening. They are mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and have attained to the bounty of God.” Before the appearance of the Sun of inner meanings, words have no station. Whatever is said or written was not and is not worthy. However, this nothingness and evanescence lends some luster to the work. His is the grace and generosity in all conditions. After establishing the station of sanctification and transcendence, He permitted every soul to call upon and mention Him according to its tongue and understanding. His is the praise and glory, His the favor and splendor, His the bounty and grandeur. Since a letter was previously sent to serve them, I did not trouble them this time, though even this much is a burden. In these days, by divine decree, that occurred which darkened the world of light and veiled the realm of vision. The dust of sorrow encompassed all and the smoke of grief and anguish seized every space. Were it not for God’s grace and bounty, the loved ones and companions would have perished. Herein was manifested that which testified clearly and evidently to His bounty and grace, and from the Source of Utterance appeared what appeared. At the end He says: “Verily Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest. If Thou should desire, Thou wouldst transform the mystery of sorrow into joy in Thy dominion, and the essence of grief into delight among Thy servants.”</p>
<p>And considering that in these days this matter occurred and, having been blessed with a considerable portion of the outpourings of the Pen, some patience and tranquility were attained - in truth, blessed are those souls who have ascended and were blessed with the fruits of the Tree and the tokens of the Pen. Many matters are not clear at present, but if He wishes, He will reveal what He desires, and He is the Mighty, the All-Choosing. More than this cannot be disclosed, for in one place He has said these are the days of the Most Great Joy; in the presence of the Lord, sorrow is not permissible. All lamentation, crying out, and grief have been forbidden except for what has befallen Him. In any case, I beseech and hope from God that He may comfort all and grant patience and forbearance. The place of those beloved ones was indeed empty in the gatherings of these days. Though you were not present physically, assuredly you were present in spirit and sharing in all conditions. We are God’s and unto Him do we return. And in truth, even outwardly, the true representative of the direction of the Most Exalted Names was his honor Aqa Siyyid ’Ali, who shone like a star in the gatherings. His representation is sufficient and complete in the sight of God. The fragrance of the garment of grace continues to waft. Well is it with you.</p>
<p>The letter from the honored brother, his honor Aqa ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be God’s peace and grace, arrived and it so happened that it attained the presence and was opened by the blessed hand and read. He smiled, and all those present smiled. Give him glad tidings and convey greetings and praise. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant him such confirmation that he may ever be enkindled with the fire of God’s love and act according to His command. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Confirmer, the All-Wise. Peace and glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>

<p>He Who is established upon the Kingdom of Utterance!</p>
<p>O sons of the Friend! Hearken unto the Call of your Glorious Lord. He makes mention of you, inasmuch as you turned towards Him when He was imprisoned, wronged and a stranger in this remote prison. By God! The Throne of the Lord hath been established upon the willow. Blessed is he who comprehendeth what We have revealed in the Book; he is indeed among those endued with vision in this noble scene. Rejoice in My remembrance and My turning towards you, and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast mentioned Thy loved ones from Thy Most Exalted Pen and hast turned towards them from Thy glorious and luminous station.”</p>
<p>We make mention in this station of him who is named Aziz, that he may rejoice in this Most Great Remembrance and praise his Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Thou art he whom the breeze of God awakened in His days, and whom the Spirit raised up unto this Cause, whereby all who are in the kingdom of command and creation were thunderstruck, save whom God willed, the Sovereign of sovereigns. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath heard My call, soared in My atmosphere, taken the cup of steadfastness in My love and drunk therefrom in My Name, the All-Compelling over what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>O My Tongue! Make mention of Shin and Ha in My Kingdom, who turned towards the Kaaba of existence and stood before the Throne in manifest humility. Say: By God! The Interlocutor of Sinai hath appeared and proclaimeth: “O people of the world! The Most Great Name hath appeared. Turn ye unto God with illumined hearts and be not of the heedless.” Blessed art thou for having attained unto the choice wine of My love, entered My prison, and witnessed that which brought solace to the eyes of those near unto God.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who is named Isaac, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of the Lord of Hosts, Who hath come to give life unto the world, yet from Whom every obstinate infidel hath turned away. The world hath been honored by the advent of the Lord of Eternity, yet the people remain behind an evident veil. Blessed art thou for having heard and turned towards God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Nasrullah, who turned towards God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. This is the Day for which God’s chosen ones of old lamented in their separation, yet when He appeared, every heedless doubter turned away. Thus hath the Kingdom of Utterance been stirred, and the All-Merciful hath revealed that whereby the hearts of those who have soared in the atmosphere of nearness and held fast unto His mighty cord were attracted.</p>
<p>O Ismail! Hearken unto that which hath been raised from the Mount of Knowledge, from the Divine Lote-Tree: “Verily, there is none other God besides Him, the Mighty, the Bestower.” Blessed art thou for having turned towards God when every polytheist and infidel turned away. Say: “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having enabled me to recognize the Dayspring of Thy Cause and for having made known unto me that which was hidden from every ignorant one who claimed knowledge. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in this Cause, whose greatness the Scriptures and Tablets have testified to.”</p>
<p>O Elias! The Wronged One in prison makes mention of thee, inasmuch as thou didst turn towards the Most Great Ocean and didst hear what the Tongue of Grandeur uttered on the Mount of Utterance when the All-Merciful came with manifest sovereignty. We have heard thy call and have answered thee through this Book, and We have witnessed thy turning towards Us and have turned towards thee from this glorious station. This is a Day wherein the Friend calleth out in the Most Holy Vale, and the Interlocutor declareth: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds, for the sweet savors of the garment of Thy Revelation have wafted over Thy domains and the breezes of Thy favors have blown over Thy servants.” Thus hath the ocean of utterance surged and the fragrance of My wisdom wafted forth, whereby the horizon of the heaven of My Cause, the wondrous, hath been illumined.</p>
<p>O Jacob! By God, the Jacob of old lamented in his separation from Me and uttered My remembrance and praise. Whenever the Sun of My Manifestation dawned upon him in the night, such longing seized him that sleep fled from his eyes. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Informed, the All-Knowing. Give thanks unto God for having taught thee and guided thee to this straight Path. Hold fast unto the cord of the Manifestation and say: “O Lord of the Mount! I beseech Thee not to withhold from me what Thou hast ordained in Thy Book of the wonders of Thy grace. Then assist me in that which will profit me in this world and the next. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>We make mention in this station of him who was named Muhammad-before-Rafi’, that he may remember his Lord on the Sinai of the Spirit through what the All-Merciful hath revealed in His mighty Book. Whoso hath attained unto the Most Great Sea this day hath attained unto all good. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this from the most exalted station, yet most of the people are sunk in slumber. The horizon of Revelation hath been illumined, and the Mount hath taken flight, and the Tree calleth out with the loudest voice between earth and heaven, yet most of the people are as dead. Blessed is the one who hath rent asunder the veils and believed in the All-Bestowing Lord when He came with a mighty command.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Khudadad, who hath adorned himself with the ornament of love on this Day wherein the Lord of Creation hath proclaimed: “There is none other God but Me, the Peerless, the All-Informed.” Give thanks unto God for having aided thee in this wondrous Cause. How many a learned one hath been debarred from the ocean of knowledge, and how many a mystic hath been deprived of this Great Name, while thou hast attained unto it through the grace of God, the Goal of all mystics.</p>
<p>O Moses! Hearken unto the Call from the luminous Spot, from the crimson Tree beyond the sea of grandeur: “Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.” We have sent the Messengers and revealed the Books that they might give unto My servants the glad-tidings of My appearance in My days and remind them of this News whereby the heaven hath been cleft asunder, the earth hath been rent, and the mountains have taken flight. Blessed art thou for having heard the call of God when it was raised in truth, and for having drunk the choice wine of knowledge from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the Lord of all Religions.</p>
<p>O My Pen! Make mention of him who was named with Shin and Ha, that he may give thanks unto his Lord Who, with a sovereignty before which neither the hosts of the world nor the multitude of nations can stand, doeth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. By God! Neither the clamor of the people nor the growling of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds, did deter Him. Hold fast unto the Most Great Cord and cling to the hem of thy Most Holy and Gracious Lord. Say: “I beseech Thee by Thy Self to make me, in all conditions, one who uttereth Thy remembrance, who gazeth toward Thy horizon, and who standeth ready to serve Thee. Verily, Thou art the Almighty One Whom neither the affairs of creation nor the hosts of the world can frustrate.”</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who was named Moses, who hath turned toward the wilderness wherein the Lord of all creation proclaimeth: “There is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” We have created all beings that We might make known unto them Our path and draw them nigh unto Our kingdom and dominion, and honor them with Our presence in Our glorious and mighty Day. Yet when the signs of the Revelation appeared and the Lord of Resurrection came, they turned away from Him save whom God did choose, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Blessed art thou for having turned toward My ocean and desired My straight Path. Preserve what We have sent down unto thee. By God! Nothing that hath been created on earth can equal it, if thou be of them that know.</p>
<p>O son of Nasir! Praise be to God that through the grace of the Best-Beloved of the world, thou wert mentioned in the Most Holy Court which is the point round which circle the Concourse on High. The names mentioned in thy letter were presented by this servant before the Throne, and for each one there were revealed and sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will wondrous and sublime verses. Praise be to God that all have attained to God’s grace. Verily the bounty is in His hand and His grasp; He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth of His creation. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>All the handmaidens of God who were mentioned in thy letter have been blessed with the mention of the True One. Say: O handmaidens of God! Praise be to God that ye have drunk from the wine of divine love and partaken of the ocean of recognition. I swear by the Most Great Name that ye are preferred above most of the women of the world, for every soul whose mention hath been recorded this day by the Most Exalted Pen shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven shall last. How many queens there were who failed to recognize their Lord and returned to dust with utmost regret. Rejoice then, O My handmaidens, in My days, and drink the Kawthar of My love in My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>Say: Today is the day of mention and praise, and today is the day to work for God. Strive ye that ye may attain to His good-pleasure, that is, remain steadfast in His love.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention regarding the blessed place, every good deed is today beloved and is accounted among the sovereign of deeds. However, the intention must be the benefit of all the peoples of the world. The purpose for which God, exalted and glorified be He, established religion was the unity and concord of all the world’s peoples. This manifestation appears in different colors due to the diversity of mirrors. God willing, through divine grace all should be seen as one mirror, and all these differences, objections, conflicts and disputes should be erased and come to naught. His is the creation and the command. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. There is no God but Him, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Thy letter was received, and this servant, after perusing it, was so blessed that circumstances were arranged such that on that very day, nay that very hour, it was presented in the Most Holy Court. This was naught but from the grace of the True One, exalted be His majesty, universal be His bounty, and great be His glory. For each of the names that were mentioned, sublime and wondrous verses were revealed from the heaven of Will. Praise be to God, all were sustained by the living waters and attained unto God’s infinite bounties. His Holiness Ismu’llah-il-Jamal, upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God, mentioned some individuals several times in his petitions to the Most Holy Court, and in each instance the Sun of Grace dawned and appeared from the Horizon of favors. Blessed are those souls who have today attained unto the mention of their Lord. Likewise, some time ago Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Kazim, upon him be the Glory of God, wrote a letter to this servant wherein he mentioned the friends of God. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid all to remember and praise Him. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful. Both those souls who have newly attained and those who previously drank from the Primal Cup were all mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen and attained His grace, and this servant copied and sent the wondrous, sublime and blessed verses from the original revelation that both the earlier and later souls might attain unto them and utter “Thine is the praise and the glory.”</p>
<p>Concerning al-Baraka in the Most Holy Court, when mention was made of it He said: “God willing, may they be assisted to achieve this good.” This matter must be consulted upon and then acted upon, but no one should be compelled. After it is realized, all will hear of it. Should any soul step forward with perfect eagerness, the Trustees may accept and receive from him, otherwise not. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist all to this great trust. Verily, He is the Lord of the Last and the First, and the Lord of the Throne and of the dust. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise. The Glory be upon you, O loved ones of God and His friends. Blessed are ye for having believed in God and remained steadfast in His mighty Cause.</p>

<p>O Rajab-’Ali, who hast attained to His presence and won the grace of meeting Him!</p>
<p>He is the Hearer, the Answerer</p>
<p>O Rajab-’Ali! The promised Day hath come and the Self-Subsisting calleth aloud amidst the people on this Day wherein all things circle round the Cause, and the Mount speaketh forth: “By God! The Lord of the Manifestation hath appeared and that which was hidden from eyes and hearts hath been revealed!” The world hath been honored by the appearance of the Ancient King, yet most of the people comprehend not. Lo! The Kawthar calleth out “Drink ye!” but the people drink not. The Salsabil summoneth all to the Glorious Lord, yet most of mankind perceive not. The proof hath been perfected, the bounty completed, and the heavenly table sent down, yet the people know not. They deny God’s grace and mercy - nay, they understand not.</p>
<p>The servant who hath attained Our presence hath mentioned thee, and We have remembered thee in this decisive Tablet through which floweth the Euphrates of the wisdom of God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed is he who hath turned and drunk therefrom, and woe unto every heedless and veiled one. We desired to mention those whom thou didst mention and give them glad tidings of God’s loving-kindness that dispelleth all doubts, that the attraction of the verses may draw them to a station wherein naught is seen save the effulgences of the light of God, the Lord of all that was and shall be.</p>
<p>O friend! Hear the call from the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing in the most exalted Paradise: “God, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Loving.” Rejoice that thy mention hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen in this praiseworthy station. Say: Make your faces sincere for the sake of God and your deeds pure from doubt and ostentation. This is what ye were commanded aforetime in a written tablet wherein the Most Exalted Pen inscribed the mysteries of the seen and unseen.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Mahdi! Verily We have sent down the Book with truth and manifested clear proofs before the faces of the servants. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto every heedless one who hath been debarred from that which hath appeared from God, the Lord of existence. Thy name was present before the Wronged One, and He hath remembered thee with that which hath caused the fragrance of utterance to waft throughout all possibility and perfumed the kingdoms of the seen and unseen. Say: None knoweth the interpretation of what hath been sent down from the Most Exalted Pen save the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. The Sun of proof hath shone forth from the highest horizon of the world by the command of God, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast remembered me and turned toward me from the direction of the Prison. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance, whereby the cities of justice and equity were illumined, to make me in all conditions hold fast unto Thee and Thy verses, and to cling to the hem of Thy bounty.</p>
<p>O Malik-Qabli-Muhammad! Hear the call from the direction of ’Akka: “Verily, there is no God but Him, the Single One, the All-Informed.” He knoweth what is in the heavens and what is on earth and what was hidden from the eyes of the mystics. Hear what is cast unto thee from the verses of thy Lord - verily, there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Powerful. He it is in Whose hand are the destinies of the heavens and earth, and the decree of all things in a clear Book. That which hath appeared hath renewed the realities of all things, and the Herald hath proclaimed: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.”</p>
<p>When thine eyes gain the grace of beholding thy Lord’s verses, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I beseech Thee to make me one of those who have been so attracted by Thy verses that they cast away all else but Thee and hastened with their hearts to the court of Thy glory and the carpet of Thy holiness. O Lord! Thou seest me standing before the door of Thy grace, gazing toward the horizon of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee to accept from me and from my brothers in the Cause that which hath proceeded from us in Thy days. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>We have desired at this time to make mention of him who hath been named Aqa Jan, that he may render thanks unto his Lord for this clear remembrance. O Aqa Jan! We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid thee to be steadfast in His Cause and to grant thee that whereby thy remembrance shall endure amongst His creation and thy name amongst His servants. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Today the Concourse on High are proclaiming “The Lord of all beings hath come,” yet the heedless and ignorant people are deprived of hearing and are forbidden from the outpourings of the true Benefactor in these days. Praise be to God, the souls of that village are mentioned by the Supreme Pen and their service is accepted. We beseech God to assist them with the hosts of deeds and virtuous character, and to strengthen them in that which shall endure as long as His names endure. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Habibu’llah, that this remembrance may draw him to the station which God hath made the point of adoration for those near unto Him. We have remembered thee before, and at this time, as a token of grace from thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. Let not the conditions and events of the world sadden thee and prevent thee from the remembrance of the Lord of Eternity. Arise and say: Unto Thee be praise and glory, unto Thee be thanks and splendor, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, inasmuch as Thou hast turned unto Thy servant and illumined his heart with the light of Thy knowledge and hast sent down for him that which shall endure as long as Thy names and attributes endure. Verily, Thou art the Almighty Whom neither the cawing of the crows, nor the clamor of the polytheists, nor the oppression of the tyrannical can frustrate. Ordain for me that which shall profit me in the hereafter and in this world. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the Throne and of earth. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>We make mention at this time of the sons of the Friend and the heirs of Him Who conversed with God in Ha and Mim, that they may rejoice in God’s remembrance in His days and be of the thankful ones. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He hath remembered you before, and at this time with a clear remembrance. The Trusted One hath mentioned you before, and Abu’l-Fadl thereafter. We have sent down for you that from which the people of Baha perceive the fragrances of bounty and bestowal. Verily, your Lord, the All-Merciful, heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed. We counsel you to manifest great steadfastness, and to observe trustworthiness, chastity and faithfulness. He, verily, is the Counselor, the All-Knowing. Blessed is the strong one whom the hands of oppression have not weakened, and the seeing one whom the incidents of the days have not prevented from beholding this shining horizon.</p>
<p>O Yari! He who was named Rajab-’Ali hath mentioned thee. We make mention of thee and those who have believed in God, the One, the Peerless, the Strong, the Powerful. Rejoice in this bounty and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth. O Yari! He loveth the presence of His loved ones, but the oppressors have come between Us and them. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to decree for those who desired to attain His presence the reward of meeting Him. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayers.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! Hearken unto the Call, hearken unto the Call that hath been raised from the direction of the Most Great Scene, and say: My God, my God! Unto Thee be praise for having guided me, and unto Thee be glory for having strengthened me to hold fast unto that which Thou didst command me. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy bounty, through a drop whereof Thou didst adorn non-existence with the ornament of being, to ordain for me that which shall strengthen me to hearken unto Thy most sweet call and the rustling of Thy Supreme Pen. Then send down upon me from the heaven of Thy favor a blessing from Thee and a mercy from Thy presence, and ordain for me that which shall profit me. Verily, I know not what is with Thee, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Pen! The Most Great Name desireth to make mention of him who attained the presence of the Face and circumambulated the House - he who was named Rajab-’Ali - that the rapture of his Lord’s remembrance may seize him. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Possessor of manifest grace.</p>
<p>O Rajab-’Ali! Give thanks unto God for having aided thee, drawn thee nigh, and caused thee to attain His presence through the agencies of the heavens and earth, and for having shown thee His horizon and made thee hear His call. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Compassionate, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>We make mention in this station of thy wife, and give her glad tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds. O My handmaiden! Grieve not for what hath befallen thee in My path. Rather, give thanks unto thy Lord and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the world and Beloved of the nations, for having caused me to turn towards the horizon of the heaven of Thy bounty and to speak Thy praise, when the divines of Iran and the people of idle fancies denied Thee, violated Thy Covenant and Testament, and disputed Thy proof.” O my Lord! Thou seest Thy handmaiden clinging fast unto Thee and acknowledging that which hath been sent down in Thy Book. I beseech Thee not to disappoint her of the wonders of Thy bounty. Thou, verily, art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O My handmaiden! Know thou that Rajab-’Ali hath attained Our presence and visited the Wronged One in thy stead, and We have accepted him as a token of Our grace. Thy Lord, verily, is the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>We make mention in this station of thy son, who hath been named Asadu’llah, with such remembrance as the Concourse on High shall celebrate. O Asad! The One, the Single, hath turned toward thee from this station that thou mayest be among the thankful ones. Say: “My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy luminous countenance and by the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise to ordain for me that which shall make me steadfast in Thy service, Thy remembrance, and Thy praise amongst Thy creatures. Thou art indeed the All-Bountiful. There is none other God but Thee, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.”</p>
<p>We desire to make mention of My handmaiden Tahirih and My other handmaiden, and give them glad tidings of that which hath stirred the cord of grace and bounty in this Most Exalted Station, that they may rejoice in the days of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He hath desired for you both a bounty from His presence and a mercy from His own Self. He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He pleaseth. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for them both that which He hath ordained for His handmaidens who have turned unto Him and circumambulated the Most Great, the Supreme Throne of God. Thus have We sent down the verses from the kingdom of the loving-kindness of your Lord, the Possessor of Names and Attributes, as a bounty from His presence upon His servants and handmaidens. He, verily, is the Rememberer, the Counselor, the All-Knowing, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O Rama?an! The blessed Rama?an draweth nigh, and the people of Baha in this prison shall fast. In most Tablets We have counseled all to wisdom, for it is the cause of the exaltation of God’s Word among His servants and the means of preserving those in the land. Hold fast unto its requirements. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Counselor, the All-Knowing. By My life! I love worship in God’s path, tribulations in His love, and afflictions for the manifestation of His Cause. Blessed is he who hath heard My call and acted according to that which was commanded by One All-Knowing, All-Wise. We have remembered thee with verses before which all the remembrances of the world shall bow down. To this testifieth every fair-minded, discerning one.</p>
<p>O Mashhadi Muhammad! He who hath attained My presence hath made mention of thee. We make mention of thee through this clear remembrance. By My life! Wert thou to inhale the fragrance of thy Lord’s verses, it would raise thee to a station wherein thou wouldst behold naught in existence save the manifestations of His power and the revelations of the lights of the Day-Star of His firm and mighty justice. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who have held fast unto gracious patience.</p>
<p>O Ja’far! Thou hast attained mention by the Most Exalted Pen in the Most Great Horizon. Its traces are the cause of salvation for the world and its peoples, and His bounty is the cause of the dawning of the manifestations of the Most Great Luminary. When thou hast attained unto that which hath been revealed for thee, turn thy face toward God and say: Praise be unto Thee for having guided me to hearken unto Thy call, to turn toward the lights of Thy countenance, and to hold fast unto the cord of Thy bounty in Thy days. O my Lord! Thou seest me yearning for the wonders of Thy grace and mercy. I beseech Thee to preserve me, through the hosts of the seen and the unseen, from the evil of every cawing raven, from the oppression of every oppressor, and from the harm of every remote and ignorant one. Verily, Thou art the Single One, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>

<p>In the Name of the One God</p>
<p>O Karim! God willing, through the grace of the All-Bountiful, mayest thou find rest beneath the shade of the Divine Lote-Tree, and be made the recipient of the outpourings that descend from the heaven of grace. Thou hast been and wilt continue to be remembered before the Throne, and this is accounted among God’s greatest favors.</p>
<p>O Karim! Gird up the loins of service, that perchance feeble souls may arise to celebrate the praise of the Lord of creation with the utmost love and inner strength, in such wise that neither the world nor aught therein shall deter them from the Truth. Let all, in these luminous days, manifest divine attributes.</p>
<p>O Karim! The spiritual and mystic wine is prepared and the Divine Cup-Bearer is present, yet most of humanity is seen to be deprived and forbidden. The Truth is manifest in the fullness of its revelation, and creation is consumed with longing; nevertheless, the lovers are separated from their Beloved and burn in the wilderness of separation. Therefore, they need guides, counselors and teachers to understand what prevents them and what causes their remoteness.</p>
<p>Some souls need no teaching. These are like unto eyes - and eyes need not be taught to see. Likewise, ears need not be taught to hear. When opened through the aid of the Spirit, they perceive of themselves. Yet at all times one must seek refuge with the Countenance of the All-Merciful, lest disease or other ailment afflict them and become a barrier. These are the souls who, after the Call was raised, turned to the Supreme Horizon, and are so steadfast that none can cause these assured souls to deviate from the Divine Court. They have drunk and continue to drink from the Salsabil of the All-Merciful’s utterance at all times, finding solace and yearning in the divine words.</p>
<p>Those below this station need goodly counsel and loving advice. Therefore, the loved ones of God must undertake this momentous task with wisdom and utterance. Some they must teach through words, some through deeds and actions, and some through character, drawing them to the Divine Court. Goodly deeds and spiritual attributes are themselves teachers of the Cause.</p>
<p>Let none be saddened that they are not learned or have not acquired outward knowledge. Consider the time of the Messenger, when after the appearance of that Most Great Luminary, all the learned ones, men of letters and philosophers remained deprived of that Fountain of Divine knowledge, while Abu Dharr, who was but a shepherd, through his turning to the Self-Sufficient Lord, had oceans of wisdom and utterance flow from his heart and tongue. Now thou seest all the learned ones bow down at his mention, though at first none paid him any heed. Exalted is the Ancient One, the Possessor of Great Bounty! He verily rules as He pleaseth, and He is the All-Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Therefore, each of the loved ones of God who truly turns to the enduring horizon will be granted that which will enable them to guide humanity. Say: O My loved ones! Ye are spiritual physicians. Through God’s might and power, ye must heal the inner ailments of the nations and the diseased eyes of the peoples of the world with the healing remedy of the Most Great Name, that all may turn to the shore of the Most Great Ocean in the days of the Lord of Eternity. Therefore, all must adorn their inner and outer beings with the garment of trustworthiness, the robe of godliness, and the emblem of truthfulness […]</p>
<p>This Revelation has not come for the implementation of outward ordinances, as has flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful in the Bayan, but rather for the manifestation of spiritual perfections in human souls, the elevation of their spirits to enduring stations, and that which their minds can comprehend, so that all may walk above earth and heaven. By My life! Were the veil to be rent asunder at this station, souls would take wing unto the precincts of thy Lord, the Cleaver of Dawn. However, since We have commanded according to wisdom, We have kept certain stations concealed lest the magnetic force of free will seize the reins of choice, and that all may walk among creatures with outward propriety and become the cause of the guidance of men. Some minds may not accept certain ordinances mentioned in the divine Books due to their ignorance of the hidden wisdom therein. But none has denied or will deny what has streamed forth in this Most Great Revelation from the Ancient Pen concerning unity, fellowship, character, conduct, and engagement in that which profiteth mankind–save he who is utterly bereft of understanding. If the loved ones of God be not adorned with the ornament of trustworthiness, truthfulness and rectitude, the harm thereof will revert upon those souls themselves and upon all people. Firstly, such souls will never be worthy repositories of the divine Word and the hidden mysteries of the Lord. Secondly, they have been and will be the cause of people’s deviation and turning away. And beyond these two are God’s wrath and fury, His chastisement and indignation.</p>
<p>O Karim! Hear thou the call of the All-Merciful from the spiritual Pen in the Persian tongue. By My life! It will draw thee to a station wherein thou shalt behold naught in creation save the effulgences of this Cause which hath dawned from the horizon of the favors of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Should all creatures rend asunder the concealing veils and hearken to the shrill voice of the Most Exalted Pen, which hath been raised in the luminous Spot by leave of the Lord of Names, all would turn with their souls toward the direction of the All-Merciful. Their own desires have hindered them, and today they are thunderstruck. O Karim! The Sun of the Divine Word, which hath risen and shone forth from the Dayspring of Will, is perceived by every possessor of insight, and that Word is, amidst the words of the world, as manifest and resplendent as the visible sun. This is not a day wherein the Most Exalted Pen should be occupied with such remembrances. It behooveth every soul in this Day, when he heareth the Call from the Most Sublime Horizon, to forsake all else, to arise through God’s power, turning unto his Lord, and to say: “Here am I, O Beloved of all who are in the heavens and on earth!” The tongue of the All-Merciful in the Garden of Utterance speaketh this blessed word, declaring that the mention of that Most Great Luminary hath ever been and shall ever be “There is none other God but Me; worship ye Me, O My creation!” Whatsoever hath flowed in these stations from the Pen, the Originator of names and attributes, hath been by virtue of the pre-existing mercy that hath encompassed all created things, that perchance the people of the world might not be deprived of the living waters flowing from the right hand of the mercy of the All-Merciful. He, verily, is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful, after having been self-sufficient above all worlds. Some among the people of the Furqan and the Bayan who have halted at the stage of hesitation or the stage of doubt and the like - this is due to the vain imaginings that existed aforetime amongst the people. Say: O servants! This is a Day wherein ye must rend asunder all veils, efface all idle fancies, and turn with utmost devotion in heart toward the horizon of Beauty, for the path of the feet hath been barred through that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. Look ye to naught save that which hath been manifested in this Manifestation, for among the people there are many vain imaginings that profit not, and these same imaginings have prevented some of the people of the Bayan from the Day-Star of the All-Merciful that hath dawned from the horizon of possibility, and have deprived them thereof. These souls are observed to be utterly lacking in understanding and reason. Say: O ye who are lost in the valley of error! Which of your established imaginings hath proven true, and from which have ye inhaled the fragrance of truth? Nay, by My Self, the Truth! They have all returned to your imaginary realities, while the Cause remaineth God’s, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. For a thousand years or more, ye had established an imaginary being in an imaginary city with wives and children, and to these fancies ye were devoted. Consider what ye were clinging to during that millennium! By Him Who hath caused Me to speak the truth, the Pen is ashamed to make mention of these veiled, imaginary souls. Of all that was mentioned among those people concerning that Most Great Light, namely the Qa’im, not a single letter was realized or recognized by God, as became evident and manifest to all after His appearance. This was but one of the imaginings of those souls. After the Hand of Divine Power rent asunder the veil of […]</p>
<p>Some became aware of this and likewise other illusions that exist among that people and have not yet been rent asunder - they must observe in like manner. May God rend them asunder for whomsoever He willeth. One must turn toward the direction of the Cause with a breast freed from all else and an illumined heart, sanctified from all allusions and words. Say: This is not a day of doubt and uncertainty. Rend them asunder with the fire of the word of your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>O My loved ones! Observe with the eye of fairness. This Wronged One is in the mouth of the serpent, and at all times afflictions have befallen Him of which none is aware save God. He hath sacrificed His soul that perchance ye may arise from the horizon of detachment, so that the realms of creation and invention may be illumined through you. Know your worth and avoid those things which cause the Cause to be wasted among the people. Say: Would that ye knew the surging waves of this ocean and what is concealed therein of the pearls of wisdom of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>O Karim! Though the melodies of the Most Exalted Pen have no end, yet We have turned to another strain.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the showers of Thy mercy were sent down, and the signs of Thy power were made manifest, and the sun of Thy Will dawned forth, and Thy mercy encompassed all who are in Thy earth and heaven, to clothe them that have believed with the garments of trustworthiness and detachment. Then draw them unto the Dawning-Place from which shone forth the Sun of immunity, that through them the sanctification of Thy Cause may appear among Thy servants and the purification of Thy laws in Thy kingdom. O Lord! Thou art the Self-Sufficient and they are the poor. Take them not to task for that which they have neglected, but have mercy on them and forgive them, for they have borne hardships in Thy path. If they have been heedless of some of Thy commandments, yet they have hastened with their hearts and feet unto Thee. Regard not their transgressions, but behold the lights that have shone from the horizons of their hearts and the tribulations that have befallen them in Thy path. Then strengthen them thereafter in that whereby the standards of Thy Cause shall be raised in Thy lands and the banners of Thy grandeur in Thy domains. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. Within Thy grasp is the kingdom of creation. There is none other God but Thee, the Most High, the All-Dominating, the Most Exalted, the Most Great.</p>
<p>O Karim! Mention and recite the divine counsels for every soul that perchance they may act according to what God hath willed. Convey my remembrance unto all who are with thee, whether male or female. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my Lord, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power!</p>
<p>All praise, sanctified above imagination and conjecture, utterance and description, befitteth the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court of the Goal of all the worlds, Who raised high the banner of existence with His Pen and with ink unfurled the standard of unity. Blessed are they who have held fast to the Most Great Law and who have taken shelter beneath the standards and banners of Truth, exalted be His glory. Their purpose is to exalt the Word and their aim is to elevate the stations of humanity. The opposition of the oppressors and the clamor of the deniers did not hold them back from ascent nor prevent them from their goal. These are the manifestations of divine attributes and the Hands of the Cause among the high and the lowly. And the blessings and peace be upon the Lord of the people, their Master, the refuge and shelter of the servants, through Whom the horizon of oneness was illumined and the luminary of detachment shone forth, through Whom the fragrance of submission was diffused and the straight path was made manifest, and upon His family and companions who cast aside all else but God and acted according to what they were commanded in the Book. Through them the Word was exalted and the breeze wafted, and the decree of the Divine Will was established and the potency of His Purpose was revealed, and through them God’s dominion and power encompassed all things and His awe and sovereignty were made manifest.</p>
<p>[This is addressed to Mirza Zayn al-’Abidin, upon him be the Glory of God, from the land of K, dated the first of Rajab 1305]</p>
<p>And after - Your spiritual friend’s letters arrived repeatedly, their verse and prose were presented before the countenance of the Master and attained the honor of His hearing. However, due to intervening circumstances, some were answered while others remained pending. O friend of my heart! God, the All-Knowing, and all creation bear witness that you have ever been and are present before this ephemeral one’s face and are mentioned before the Master. Whenever your letter arrived, its verse brought joy and its prose caused delight. However, recent events have dispelled all gladness and joy. In prison, nothing is observed save sighs and tears. Every monotheist must lament and every believer cry out, for most lands of the monotheists have been taken by polytheists, and they continue in their pursuit. Each day a herald proclaims that this country has fallen, that land has been conquered. Truly, for the monotheists and sincere ones, these matters are a grievous torment. Until now, none knows what has been and is the cause of this great abasement after supreme glory. Protection is possible and deliverance is possible; nevertheless, despair has encompassed hearts, preventing them from turning to the remedy. In any case, this servant and you and the monotheists dwelling in every land must, with complete helplessness and absolute humility, beseech God, exalted be His glory, for protection and the exaltation of the Word of Unity. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful. The atoms of creation testify and bear witness that His Holiness the Existing One, may our spirits be sacrificed for Him, had no desire save the glory of government and nation. Nevertheless, they have brought about that which has changed the dust of sorrow upon the hems of the monotheists. On this day the honored master, His Holiness Aqa Siyyid Mahdi, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, sent your heart’s beloved letter to the Sacred Presence, and after its presentation and hearing, He spoke these words: “O Zaynu’l-’Abidin! Upon you be the peace of God and His favors. The Wronged One testifies that you have acknowledged the unity and oneness of God and have witnessed what God witnessed before the creation of earth and heaven - that there is no God but Him. You have held fast to the handle of His grace and clung to the hem of the robe of His bounty and mercy, and you have been mindful of His verses, speaking His praise, and patient in tribulations in His path. We beseech God to assist you in what He loves and is pleased with, and to enable you in all conditions to draw near unto Him. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. There is no God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.”</p>
<p>We have turned from eloquent speech to luminous utterance. Today it is incumbent upon all to turn unto God, exalted be His glory, in repentance and contrition, that perchance the all-encompassing tribulations and afflictions visited upon this favored community may be lifted, and that its lost glory may be raised aloft like a banner upon the most exalted station in all the world. We have ever beseeched God, exalted be His glory, on behalf of His servants, for that which would lead to the elevation of the stations of the people of divine unity and the exaltation of their ranks. Throughout the nights and days We have held fast to that which preserveth, exalteth and uplifteth His servants. Yet there hath befallen Us that which hath caused every seeing one to weep and every hearing one to lament. And now We find Ourselves in the Most Great Prison, subject to the will of the oppressors and the heedless. Each day witnesseth the appearance of some tyranny and the manifestation of some decree. Praise be to God Who hath adorned this Wronged One with the ornament of patience and resignation. He, verily, is the All-Patient, Who commandeth His servants to show forth beautiful patience. Convey My greetings to the friends and bid them to wisdom and utterance. Corruption, conflict and contention have ever been and shall ever be condemned. That which today is the cause of the exaltation of man’s station are goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. Blessed are they that act, and woe unto them that neglect.</p>
<p>O My loved one who art present before Me! The world hath been laid waste by vain imaginings. Glory be to God! The vain imaginings of the divines of Persia have been manifested in the kings, for all are occupied with imaginings. One deviseth instruments of slaughter while another seeketh to outdo him in this endeavor. Day after day they devise new schemes to destroy life from the visible world, creating ever more devices. Their peace and war revolve around the cities and lands of the people of divine unity. When one becomes displeased with another, he immediately bestows upon him one of the dominions belonging to the people of unity. In brief, peace and war today center upon the lands of Islam. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist the people of unity that perchance they may discover the cause and reason for what hath occurred and arise to set things aright, though this be most difficult. For the primary cause is that man must observe with his own eyes. The riches and ornaments of the world have prevented the eyes of the princes from witnessing. Yet there is hope that after this blindness is removed and heavenly assistance arriveth, they will see, come, and discover. The matter is in the hands of our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne.</p>
<p>If you wish news of this land, it is somewhat unsettled and disturbed. A new governor hath come whose intention and purpose are unknown. Knowledge is with God. God willing, it will be for the best.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote concerning Aqa Mirza Musa, upon him be God’s peace and loving-kindness, in truth many steadfast, upright and distinguished souls grieved for this person, for he had been shown the utmost favor. Nevertheless, without cause there occurred that which was truly a source of great regret. However, this servant hopeth that henceforth he will arise to do that which will elevate his station. His apparent interest also lay in manifesting steadfastness. In any case, after mentioning him in the presence of the Lord, He said: “O Musa! Upon thee be the peace of God, the Lord of the throne and earth, the Lord of the hereafter and this world. Until now the glance of favor hath not been withdrawn from thee, for God hath loved and continueth to love faithfulness. Thy mentions, thy tears, and thy services have not been forgotten. We have repeatedly remembered thee and counseled thee concerning that which causeth the exaltation and elevation of being. We beseech God to assist thee with the hosts of the seen and unseen and to raise thee up through His power and sovereignty. Verily He is powerful over all things. Grieve not over anything. Trust in God in all matters. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Separation from Thee hath destroyed me. Ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen the cup of nearness and reunion. The fire of remoteness hath consumed me - transform it into the water of eternal life, O Thou Self-Sufficing One! I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy grace and the lights of the sun of Thy proof to ordain for me that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Then forgive, O my God, my heedlessness and whatever hath proceeded from me. Verily Thou art the Generous, the All-Bountiful.”</p>
<p>This servant also mentioneth him and conveyeth greetings, and beseeecheth from God, exalted be His glory, whatsoever is the greatest cause of his exaltation and elevation. Verily our Lord is the All-Forgiving, the All-Generous.</p>
<p>Concerning the apple of your eye, Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’l-Husayn, upon him be God’s peace, you wrote, and after it was presented before Him, He spoke these words: “O ’Abdu’l-Husayn! Upon thee be the peace of God, the Lord of all worlds! Thy name was presented before the Wronged One, Who hath made mention of thee with this manifest remembrance. We beseech God to assist thee and to aid thee with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, that thou mayest make mention of Him with wisdom and utterance throughout all possibility. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the fragrances of Thy Revelation, the mysteries of Thy Book, and the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge, to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning unto the court of Thy mercy and the heaven of Thy grace, acknowledging Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and that which Thou hast sent down in Thy Book. I beseech Thee by Thy mercy which hath preceded all created things, and by Thy grace which hath encompassed all existence, not to disappoint me of that which Thou hast ordained for those of Thy servants who are nigh unto Thee, and for the sincere ones among Thy creation. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>It is hoped that he may be among those servants whose attributes God, exalted be His glory, hath described in the Book: “No fear shall be upon them, neither shall they grieve.” And likewise He saith: “Neither merchandise nor traffic beguile them from the remembrance of God.” In these days, from the land of ?a, the mother of Aqa Mirza Siyyid Husayn, upon them both be the glory of God, hath again sent a petition to the Most Holy Court, and hath likewise written to others requesting her son who is in your service. Last year also when she attained the presence of the Most Holy Court, she repeatedly made this request. Now, according to instructions, you should send her son to his mother. Furthermore, convey greetings on my behalf to your honored brother Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’llah, upon him be the glory of God. His letter was received and presented before Him. God willing, a response will be sent. What you forwarded was received and accepted. Convey greetings from this servant to the friends in that land. For each one I seek the confirmation of humility, submissiveness, steadfastness, and worship. Peace and praise be upon you and upon those with you and upon God’s sincere servants. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>In the name of the Most High, the Most Glorious, He Who shineth from the Horizon of the Most Luminous!</p>
<p>The remembrance of God, appearing as fire in the temple of light from the Lote-Tree of man, by leave of the All-Merciful, hath verily been witnessed at the heart of Paradise. He speaketh the truth, that there is none other God but Him, and that this Beauty is indeed the Beauty of the Cause in the most exalted Concourse, the Mystery concealed in the invisible realm of eternity, the Countenance of Revelation in the kingdom of origination, the Temple of Pre-existence in the cities of immortality, the Most Great Name in the realm of light, and the Beauty Manifest upon a holy and beloved form.</p>
<p>O people of the Bayan! Fear ye the All-Glorious, and be not veiled from Him Who hath come upon clouds of holiness with a sovereignty manifest and true. The Kingdom of God moveth at His right hand, and the dominion of Names at His left, while before Him march the hosts of might invincible.</p>
<p>Follow ye, O people, God’s command and His decree, and follow not Satan. Follow ye the Beauty of the All-Merciful in these days, and fear God Who created you by His command, and be not amongst the tyrannous and sinful ones in the earth.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Hearken unto that which is being revealed unto thee from the Realm of Eternity upon this blessed, ancient and everlasting Spot, whereon the Beauty of the All-Merciful hath established Himself upon the throne of transcendent glory, that the melodies of the All-Merciful may draw thee to the throne of the All-Highest Paradise, and sever thee from all created things, and purify thee from the defilement of the earth. This verily is of God’s bounty unto thee, if thou be of them that comprehend. Stand firm in the Cause of thy Lord, then rend asunder the veils of idle fancy through Our power and authority, and fear thou no one, even should all who are on earth rise up against thee. Say: This Day shall nothing profit anyone, even were he to worship all who are in the heavens and on earth, except through My love and through the proof of My Revelation and My presence, and that which floweth from the Pen of glory with supreme knowledge. Cast behind thee all allusions, place beneath thy feet all intimations, and turn with a luminous countenance toward the court of sanctity with trustworthiness. Verily thou didst enter the Precincts of Paradise and wert seated before the Throne when thou wert heedless of it, for We had veiled Our countenance in those days behind seventy thousand veils. When the appointed time was fulfilled, We unveiled the Face with a power that was supreme over all things. Blessed art thou, O servant, for having attained the presence of God and heard His sweetest melodies with thy pure ear, and for the Ancient Beauty having appeared unto thee from the right hand of the Throne with wondrous holy lights. By the True God! One glance at the face of thy Lord would be better for thee than the treasures of the heavens and the earth, as testified by the Tongue of God from behind the holy tabernacle, if thou be of them that know. Purify thine ears that thou mayest hear His sweetest melodies once again, for He is nigh unto the well-doers. Sanctify thy temple from human limitations, then ascend to the Most Sublime Vision, the station wherein the lights shine forth and which God hath made holy from the gaze of all in the world save those who have entered beneath the shadow of His mercy and are established upon the throne of His love. Thus hath the matter been decreed by One Who is Mighty and All-Wise. Then doth the Tongue of the All-Merciful address from the direction of the All-Highest Paradise those servants who have believed in the Bayan, that perchance they may arise from slumber and turn back from that wherein they have been remiss in the Cause of God, and repent unto Him, for verily He is the Forgiver, the Merciful. And He saith: O people of the Bayan! Did We not enjoin you in all Our Tablets not to cling to aught of what hath been created in earth and heaven at the time of the Manifestation? Why then have ye turned away from My Most Glorious Beauty in this My subsequent Revelation? Consider then, O heedless ones, that We may know what hath prevented you from this bounty which hath dawned from the holy horizon. Did We not warn you not to follow your desires when the heavens of the Cause would be cleft asunder and your Lord, the All-Merciful, would come in the shadows of the clouds? But when that day came with the truth, why did ye turn away from His presence and deny His signs, and stand at the brink of the fire? Among you is he who hath been veiled by one of Our names and hath denied Him in Whom he had believed, turning back on his heels. And among you is he who hath clung to the cord of his desires and turned away from the Beauty unto Whom is his return and his ultimate abode. Thus do We bear witness unto you from the Supreme Horizon, and My True Self is witness to what I say. O people of the Bayan! By the True God, if ye have believed in My Self, by God this is My Self Who hath appeared in truth, and if ye be […]</p>
<p>Be assured concerning My verses and My beauty! These are My verses which have descended through grace from the heaven of the Most Exalted Name. Fear God and do not reject the truth through your own devices, nor follow your own desires, for all matters end with the verses of God, which have descended in the most melodious tones from a holy and resplendent heaven. Seize the value of these days and do not dispute My proof, My evidence, My grandeur and My majesty, and do not war against My Self, for this is recorded as a grievous error in the Mother Book. Hasten to the shore of grace with your hearts and veil not yourselves with the veils of idle fancies. Break the idols through Our power and fear not any wicked oppressor. Beware lest you deprive yourselves of God’s sanctuary or nullify your deeds through Satan’s whisperings. Hold fast to God’s cord in these days when all in the heavens and earth are intoxicated, save those who have come to God with illumined hearts. Thus has the tongue of the All-Merciful spoken at the midmost heart of paradise. Therefore arise, O people of the Bayan, and make up for what has passed you by. Walk steadfastly on the path of justice. Dispute not God’s verses after their revelation and war not against His Self. Rather, aid Him to the extent of your ability - this is better for you and for yourselves, though He is indeed independent of all worlds. By God! The proof has appeared from the horizon of glory and the sun of certitude has shone forth from a wondrous holy vista. Fear God and follow not your selves and desires. Follow God’s religion in His Cause and transgress not what you have been commanded in the Book. Thus has the matter been decreed by One mighty and powerful. Say: The Cause has appeared in such wise that none has any way to deny it except by rejecting God’s Messengers, His Emissaries, His Books and the scrolls of His glory. Thus has the matter been inscribed in the tablets of decree by the Pen of Baha with truth. Those who have hesitated in this Cause are fewer than can be counted. By the True One! All their deeds have been rendered void unless they repent unto God and return to Him. Verily He is the Forgiver of His servants and was ever merciful to the truth. He forgives whom He wishes and chastises whom He wishes. Nothing escapes His knowledge and He encompasses all things. O servant! When the Tablet of Eternity reaches you, arise from your seat, approach it with gracious humility, take it in your hands, place it upon your head and say: “O my God! I bear witness in this my station that You are God, there is no God but You, and that the Primal Point is the manifestation of Your revelation, Your emergence, Your sovereignty and Your majesty. Through Him the sun of Your bounties has shone upon all the worlds. And I bear witness that He Who has appeared in truth in Your Most Glorious Name from the highest horizon is indeed Your splendor in the kingdom of names, Your radiance in the world of creation, and Your might, sovereignty and power to all in the kingdoms of command and creation. Through Him Your favor was perfected, Your proof appeared, Your countenance shone forth, and the banners of Your Cause were raised upon the hills of invincible glory.”</p>
<p>Then read what hath been revealed in the Tablet, and ponder thereon and upon that which was sent down unto the Prophets and Messengers, that thou mayest be endowed with understanding in the Cause of thy Lord. And when thou perceivest the sweet fragrance of holiness from God’s Tablet and its influence, then cleanse thyself in the living waters that flow from this fountain of camphor, this Salsabil whose source God hath made His Pen of Command, and from which He hath manifested that which purifieth the hearts of them that are possessed of true knowledge. Then detach thyself from all who are in the heavens and on earth, and be thou a herald among the servants of this Tablet which hath appeared and shone forth from the horizon of the finger of transcendent glory. Be thou one who proclaimeth throughout all lands, bringing glad tidings unto them that have believed in God’s signs and His testimony, and warning them that have denied this grace which hath descended from the clouds of His Command. Then kindle within thyself the fire which We have ignited in the paradise of these words, that thou mayest thereby ignite those who have been chilled by the cold of idle fancies. Say: O people, judge fairly within yourselves! If ye veil yourselves from this Countenance, to what countenance will ye turn? And if ye withhold yourselves from this holy sanctuary, to what sanctuary do ye purpose to repair? Consider, O people of the Bayan! By the Self of the All-Merciful! There is no refuge for you, and God is cognizant of this. Do ye believe in part of the Book while denying its source, its fountainhead, and its revealer? Alas for you, in that ye have turned away from the Ancient Beauty and have turned unto phantoms of oppression. Thus have We inspired thee with the truth and sent unto thee that which shall solace thine eyes and cause thee to rejoice within thyself, and to remember God’s remembrance at eventide and at dawn. Beware lest thou tarry for less than a moment, but stand firm in thy Lord’s Cause and be steadfast in thy Lord’s path with manifest truth. Say: By God, the Truth! That which had never appeared in creation hath been made manifest, whereby the clouds of grace have been raised up, the Tree of Bounty hath borne fruit, the Dove hath warbled, the Cock of the Throne hath crowed, the spirits have been quickened, and every moldering bone hath been stirred to life. O people of the Bayan! Abandon that which preventeth you from drawing nigh unto God, then turn ye unto this grace which encompasseth all the worlds. O Our Name Ahmad! We have bestowed upon thee in this Tablet a power from Us and an influence from Our presence, that thy word may influence the servants if thou art detached from all who are in the heavens and on earth and art turned toward the shore of holy blessedness. Arise with supreme steadfastness and give the people to drink from this Salsabil which We have given thee in the chalices of these words, that it may draw them to the exalted heaven of glory. And if thou findest thyself capable, take up the Pen by Our command and write that which the Spirit casteth upon thy heart in confirmation of this Cause. By God, the Truth! The Most Great Spirit will then assist thee from Our presence, and thus hath the matter been decreed. Withhold not thyself from this grace, but follow God’s command and His judgment, that thou mayest be numbered among those who have attained in the Mother Book that which hath been inscribed by the Pen of Command. And the Spirit, and the glory, and the splendor be upon thee and upon those who have followed the command of thy Lord and who have been caused to stand at the seat of holiness by God’s leave.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Pure praise and its essence befit the most holy and sacred threshold of the Self-Subsisting One, Who created earth and heaven through His Most Exalted Word, Who began with “We belong to God” and ended with “unto Him do we return.” Whosoever drinks from the ocean of this blessed Word shall see all else but God as non-existent and void, and shall find himself detached and free. At such time, another blessed Word truly shines forth, His word, exalted and mighty be He: “Say: God; then leave them to their vain discourses.” This is a word which the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur’an. Blessed are they who recognize, and happy are those servants who hearken.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! Despite this, the followers of the Bayan are seen to be the most ignorant of all peoples and the most heedless of all religions. They have failed to comprehend the Day of God and remain heedless and veiled from that which the All-Merciful revealed in the Bayan. Souls who have not attained even a drop from the ocean of knowledge, like the opposer from Kirman and his followers, have wandered through valleys of fancy and idle imagination, remaining deprived and forbidden from the lights of the Morn of certitude. They went to the isle, saw the dawning-place of vain imaginings, and returned. That station which from the beginning of time until now has stood and spoken before the faces of rulers, divines, mystics and servants - to this they paid no heed, occupied with their own imaginings and heedless of the Luminary of certitude. They heard that which was unworthy of hearing, and failed to present themselves in the place for the hearing of which all ears have been created, and for the beholding of whose horizon all eyes have been fashioned.</p>
<p>It is not known what these souls - these opposing souls - are saying or from whom it comes. By the life of our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of earth and heaven! From the beginning of the Cause no one has been aware. This evanescent servant spent successive years with him in Iraq and elsewhere, yet the heedless souls did not present themselves to hear that of which they are heedless and to find that from which they are now veiled. In brief, the recompense of these souls’ deeds prevented them from drawing nigh to the Most Exalted Horizon and deprived them of the Most Great Ocean. They advanced with hopes and returned with loss, yet they perceive not.</p>
<p>This is the Day of God wherein none but He is mentioned. Glory be to God! Those heedless souls are now occupied with establishing an imaginary sect, namely the Shi’ih. They worship the word and are deprived of the meaning. They cling to a pool while forbidden from the Most Great Ocean. For one thousand two hundred years and more, the misguided Shi’ih sect counted themselves the most excellent, most learned, most understanding and most God-fearing of all peoples, yet when the divine test came, all returned to hell-fire. Thus did their divines and jurisconsults, from all pulpits, engage in cursing the Object of the world’s adoration, denied His truth, and issued decrees for the shedding of His most pure blood. Neither the Sunnis, nor the Jews, nor the Zoroastrians, nor the Christians, nor any other peoples committed what was manifested by that people. I swear by the Sun of Truth that had that Holy Being appeared in another land, surely His station would have been exalted, His Cause manifest, His light radiant, and His Word all-encompassing. This evanescent servant repeatedly mentions such utterances as were heard from the Tongue of Grandeur and were revealed from the Most Exalted Pen during the revelation of verses, that perchance […]</p>
<p>O friends of God, exalted be His glory, who reside in various cities and regions: safeguard the people from suspicions and vain imaginings, lest former falsehoods be renewed and souls be delivered from the dark well of delusions. The rest depends on the efforts of your honor and the friends in that land. In all cases, I beseech God to assist and aid. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou Who with the movement of Thy finger didst rend asunder the veils and the sanctified clouds of glory! I beseech Thee by the lamp of Thy Cause which shineth forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy will, and by the power of Thy Most Exalted Word, and the potency of Thy will, O Lord of all beings, to ordain for him who hath turned unto Thee the good of this world and the next, and whatsoever will draw him nigh unto Thee in all Thy worlds. Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thou beholdest me, O my God, gazing upon Thy face and hoping for the wondrous tokens of Thy grace for Thy loved ones. Thou art He through Whose generosity all created things have testified, through Whose loving-kindness all contingent beings have been raised up, and through Whose power all existent things have been established. Thou doest as Thou willest. Thou art, in truth, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter from that honored brother arrived and was presented before the Countenance of the Lord of Eternity on Saturday night, the tenth of the honored month of Shawwal, and was favored to be heard. This is what the Tongue of the All-Merciful uttered in the Kingdom of Utterance. His word, exalted be His utterance and glorified be His majesty:</p>
<p>He is the Hearing, the Answering One!</p>
<p>A mention from Us to him whose letter was presented before the Wronged One and was submitted by the servant present. We have heard what the tongue of his heart uttered and have answered him through this Clear Book, each letter of which proclaimeth before the faces of the world: “The Promised One hath come from the horizon of power with a great light!” We have found from thy letter the fragrance of the love of God. We have sent down for thee that which cheereth the eyes of them that know. When thou hast attained unto My verses and the breezes of My utterance have wafted over thee, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me, and glory be unto Thee for having turned toward me, and might and loftiness, exaltation, grandeur and immortality are Thine. I testify in this my station to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and that Thou hast manifested and revealed what was hidden in Thy knowledge, and hast spoken and caused all things to speak in Thy remembrance and praise. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the world and King of eternity, by Thy Most Great Name, to assist Thy loved ones in the victory of Thy Cause. O Lord! Aid them through Thy power that dominateth all things and Thy might that pervadeth earth and heaven, to protect Thy loved ones from the mischief of Thine enemies. Then open, with the fingers of bounty, the doors of Thy grace unto all peoples, that they may enter into Thy religion and recognize Thy path and acknowledge that which the tongue of Thy grandeur and the Pen of Thy will have uttered. O Lord! Thou beholdest me turning unto Thee and turning away from all else beside Thee. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who were not deterred by the hosts of the world and the multitudes of nations from turning to Thy most exalted horizon and hearkening to the rustling of Thy most glorious Pen. Then assist, O my God, him who hath turned toward Thee and desired to act according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Ordain for him that which shall profit him in all Thy worlds. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! That which has been revealed would guide every weary one to the ocean of utterance and every sick one to the Kawthar of His healing grace. Through His bounty He took hold of His loved ones and delivered them from the depths of idle fancies and vain imaginings. His is the praise and the glorification, His the thanks and the bestowal. That honored loved one attained to that which has no peer or likeness. I beseech Him that He may make every letter of the utterances revealed from the Tongue of Grandeur a key of guidance and may open the doors of His favor before the faces of all, especially the people of Baha who are known among the Concourse on High as the companions of the Crimson Ark mentioned in the Qayyumu’l-Asma’. Blessed are you and those whom you have mentioned and those who have attained unto the choice wine of certitude in the days of God.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the aforementioned person, some time ago the Trusted One, upon him be the glory of God, the True Sovereign, the Manifest, sent this servant a letter wherein this matter was mentioned. Blessed are they that act! Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds! The receipt was also sent as per your request. It should reach you. Convey my greetings to the friends and chosen ones of that land, especially to Aqa Mirza Habibu’llah, upon him be the glory of God, who was mentioned in your letter. On behalf of this servant, convey greetings to him. I beseech the King Who doeth what He willeth - may the spirits of all who dwell in the Kingdom and the Realm of Might be a sacrifice unto His gate - that which would cause the guidance of the servants and draw nigh those in all lands. Verily our Lord and your Lord, our Goal and your Goal, is the All-Merciful, the Bountiful, the Mighty, the Generous. Glory and praise and laudation be upon you and upon those with you and upon every steadfast and firm one and every faithful and trustworthy one.</p>

<p>After concluding the letter, the beloved of hearts, Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, brought that honored brother’s letter which had been written to him. Among other things, mention was made of the ascension of his brother. This matter was answered before being asked, for in the Land of Mystery this blessed word was revealed from the Tongue of Grandeur, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>Among the matters specific to this Most Great Revelation is that whosoever in this Revelation has turned to God and has drunk of the choice sealed wine in the name of the Self-Subsisting, meaning from the cup of divine love - even if his relatives are not outwardly believers, after their passing they shall attain divine forgiveness and shall be sustained from the ocean of mercy. This bounty is assured for those souls from whom no harm has reached the Truth or His loved ones. Thus has God, the Lord of the Throne and earth, and the Ruler of the hereafter and this world, decreed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this matter was again presented before the countenance of the Lord of Eternity, and this is what was revealed in response, exalted be His utterance: O thou who hast turned unto God! Give thanks unto God for having mentioned thee and for having turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison. He is verily the All-Merciful, the Generous. He hath forgiven the one for whom thou didst seek forgiveness, as a bounty from His presence, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. At the time of revelation, the hand of grace admitted him into an exalted paradise, as a mercy from God, the Lord of the worlds. Say […]</p>
<p>My soul be a sacrifice unto Thee, O Lord of Names, and my spirit be a sacrifice unto Thee, O Desire of the worlds! The whole creation hath testified to Thy bounty, and all contingent beings to Thy grace. Thou art, verily, the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and Thou art, in truth, the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The ocean of bounty surgeth at all times with its waves, and the sun of grace shineth in every moment with its radiance. I beseech Him to aid these servants in that which beseemeth His bounty and generosity. Though this be impossible, yet with the Generous One, nothing is difficult.</p>
<p>Once again, glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who have heard the call and have said: “Here am I! Here am I! O Beloved of the world!” and “Here am I! Here am I! O Desire of them that have recognized Thee!”</p>

<p>This is an English text from a Baha’i tablet, specifically the Law?-i-Aqdas (The Most Holy Tablet). Since it is already in English, no translation is needed. However, I notice this appears to be only a portion of the tablet, as it ends mid-sentence with “, O followers of the Spirit,”. The complete tablet continues beyond this point, but I will not add the remainder since you’ve asked me only to work with the text provided.</p>
<p>Would you like to provide the rest of the text for translation/review?</p>
<p>and walk not in the footsteps of every divine that hath gone far astray. Do ye imagine that He seeketh His own interests, when He hath, at all times, been threatened by the swords of the enemies; or that He seeketh the vanities of the world, after he hath been imprisoned in the most desolate of cities? Be fair in your judgement and follow not the footsteps of the unjust. Open the doors of your hearts. He Who is the Spirit verily standeth before them. Wherefore keep ye afar from Him Who hath purposed to draw you nigh unto a Resplendent Spot? Say: We, in truth, have opened unto you the gates of the Kingdom. Will ye bar the doors of your houses in My face? This indeed is naught but a grievous error. He, verily, hath again come down from Heaven, even as He came down from it the first time. Beware lest ye dispute that which He proclaimeth, even as the people before you disputed His utterances. Thus instructeth you the True One, could ye but perceive it. The river Jordan is joined to the Most Great Ocean, and the Son, in the holy vale, crieth out: ‘Here am I, here am I O Lord, my God!’, whilst Sinai circleth round the House, and the Burning Bush calleth aloud: ‘He Who is the Desired One is come in His transcendent majesty.’ Say, Lo! The Father is come, and that which ye were promised in the Kingdom is fulfilled! This is the Word which the Son concealed, when to those around Him He said: ‘Ye cannot bear it now.’ And when the appointed time was fulfilled and the Hour had struck, the Word shone forth above the horizon of the Will of God. Beware, O followers of the Son, that ye cast it not behind your backs. Take ye fast hold of it. Better is this for you than all that ye possess. Verily He is nigh unto them that do good. The Hour which We had concealed from the knowledge of the peoples of the earth and of the favoured angels hath come to pass. Say, verily, He hath testified of Me, and I do testify of Him. Indeed, He hath purposed no one other than Me. Unto this beareth witness every fair-minded and understanding soul. Though beset with countless afflictions, We summon the people unto God, the Lord of names. Say, strive ye to attain that which ye have been promised in the Books of God, and walk not in the way of the ignorant. My body hath endured imprisonment that ye may be released from the bondage of self. Set your faces then towards His countenance and follow not the footsteps of every hostile oppressor. Verily, He hath consented to be sorely abased […]</p>
<p>that ye may attain unto glory, and yet, ye are disporting yourselves in the vale of heedlessness. He, in truth, liveth in the most desolate of abodes for your sakes, whilst ye dwell in your palaces. Say, did ye not hearken to the Voice of the Crier, calling aloud in the wilderness of the Bayan, bearing unto you the glad tidings of the coming of your Lord, the All-Merciful? Lo! He is come in the sheltering shadow of Testimony, invested with conclusive proof and evidence, and those who truly believe in Him regard His presence as the embodiment of the Kingdom of God. Blessed is the man who turneth towards Him, and woe betide such as deny or doubt Him. Announce thou unto the priests: Lo! He Who is the Ruler is come. Step out from behind the veil in the name of thy Lord, He Who layeth low the necks of all men. Proclaim then unto all mankind the glad-tidings of this mighty, this glorious Revelation. Verily, He Who is the Spirit of Truth is come to guide you unto all truth. He speaketh not as prompted by His own self, but as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say, this is the One Who hath glorified the Son and hath exalted His Cause. Cast away, O peoples of the earth, that which ye have and take fast hold of that which ye are bidden by the All-Powerful, He Who is the Bearer of the Trust of God. Purge ye your ears and set your hearts towards Him that ye may hearken to the most wondrous Call which hath been raised from Sinai, the habitation of your Lord, the Most Glorious. It will, in truth, draw you nigh unto the Spot wherein ye will perceive the splendour of the light of His countenance which shineth above this luminous Horizon. O concourse of priests! Leave the bells, and come forth, then, from your churches. It behoveth you, in this day, to proclaim aloud the Most Great Name among the nations. Prefer ye to be silent, whilst every stone and every tree shouteth aloud: ‘The Lord is come in His great glory!’? Well is it with the man who hasteneth unto Him. Verily, he is numbered among them whose names will be eternally recorded and who will be mentioned by the Concourse on High. Thus hath it been decreed by the Spirit in this wondrous Tablet. He that summoneth men in My name is, verily, of Me, and he will show forth that which is beyond the power of all that are on earth. Follow ye the Way of the Lord and walk not in the footsteps of them that are sunk in heedlessness. Well is it with the slumberer who is stirred by the Breeze of God and ariseth from amongst the dead, […]</p>
<p>the Best-Informed.’ Verily, We behold all created things moved to bear witness unto Us. Some know Us and bear witness, while the majority bear witness, yet know Us not. Mount Sinai is astir with the joy of beholding Our countenance. She hath lifted her enthralling voice in glorification of her Lord, saying: ‘O Lord! I sense the fragrance of Thy garment. Methinks Thou art near, invested with the signs of God. Thou hast ennobled these regions with Thy footsteps. Blessed are the people that recognize Thy fragrance, and hasten unto Thee, and attain Thy presence.’ Blessed is he that hath inhaled the sweet savours of God, and hath turned unto the Dawning-Place of His Revelation. Blessed is he that hath invited others to the Day-Spring of His lights, and drawn nigh unto the Fountain of His mercy, and exclaimed: ‘Praise be to Thee, O Thou the Desire of the worlds! And glory be to Thee, O Thou Who art the Beloved of them that have recognized Thee!’</p>
<p>Best-Informed.’ Verily, We behold all created things moved to bear witness unto Us. Some know Us and bear witness, while the majority bear witness, yet know Us not. Mount Sinai is astir with the joy of beholding Our countenance. She hath lifted her enthralling voice in glorification of her Lord, saying: “O Lord! I sense the fragrance of Thy garment. Methinks Thou art near, invested with the signs of God. Thou hast ennobled these regions with Thy footsteps. Great is the blessedness of Thy people, could they but know Thee and inhale Thy sweet savours; and woe betide them that are fast asleep.’ Happy art thou who hast turned thy face towards My countenance, inasmuch as thou hast rent the veils asunder, hast shattered the idols and recognized thine eternal Lord. The people of the Qur’an have risen up against Us without any clear proof or evidence, tormenting Us at every moment with a fresh torment. They idly imagine that tribulations can frustrate Our Purpose. Vain indeed is that which they have imagined. Verily, thy Lord is the One Who ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth. I never passed a tree but Mine heart addressed it saying: ‘O would that thou wert cut down in My name, and My body crucified upon thee.’ We revealed this passage in the Epistle to the Shah that it might serve as a warning to the followers of religions. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Let not the things they have perpetrated grieve thee. Truly they are even as dead, and not living. Leave them unto the dead, then turn thy face towards Him Who is the Life-Giver of the world. Beware lest the sayings of the heedless sadden thee. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, and teach the people with consummate wisdom. Thus enjoineth thee the Ruler of earth and heaven. He is in truth the Almighty, the Most Generous. Ere long will God exalt thy remembrance and will inscribe with the Pen of Glory that which thou didst utter for the sake of His love. He is in truth the Protector of the doers of good. Give My remembrance to the one named Murad and say: ‘Blessed art thou, O Murad, inasmuch as thou didst cast away the promptings of thine own desire and hast followed Him Who is the Desire of all mankind.’ Say: Blessed the slumberer who is awakened by My Breeze. Blessed the lifeless one who is quickened through My reviving breaths. Blessed the eye that is solaced by gazing at My beauty. Blessed the wayfarer who directeth his steps towards the Tabernacle of My glory and majesty. Blessed the distressed one who seeketh refuge beneath the shadow of My canopy. Blessed the sore athirst who hasteneth to the soft-flowing waters of My loving-kindness.</p>
<p>Blessed the insatiate soul who casteth away his selfish desires for love of Me and taketh his place at the banquet table which I have sent down from the heaven of divine bounty for My chosen ones.</p>
<p>Blessed the abased one who layeth fast hold on the cord of My glory; and the needy one who entereth beneath the shadow of the Tabernacle of My wealth.</p>
<p>Blessed the ignorant one who seeketh the fountain of My knowledge; and the heedless one who cleaveth to the cord of My remembrance.</p>
<p>Blessed the soul that hath been raised to life through My quickening breath and hath gained admittance into My heavenly Kingdom.</p>
<p>Blessed the man whom the sweet savours of reunion with Me have stirred and caused to draw nigh unto the Day-spring of My Revelation.</p>
<p>Blessed the ear that hath heard and the tongue that hath borne witness and the eye that hath seen and recognized the Lord Himself, in His great glory and majesty, invested with grandeur and dominion. Blessed are they that have attained His presence.</p>
<p>Blessed the man who hath sought enlightenment from the Daystar of My Word.</p>
<p>Blessed he who hath attired his head with the diadem of My love.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who hath heard of My grief and hath arisen to aid Me among My people.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who hath laid down his life in My path and hath borne manifold hardships for the sake of My name.</p>
<p>Blessed the man who, assured of My Word, hath arisen from among the dead to celebrate My praise.</p>
<p>Blessed is he that hath been enraptured by My wondrous melodies and hath rent the veils asunder through the potency of My might.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who hath remained faithful to My Covenant, and whom the things of the world have not kept back from attaining My Court of holiness.</p>
<p>Blessed is the man who hath detached himself from all else but Me, hath soared in the atmosphere of My love, hath gained admittance into My Kingdom, gazed upon My realms of glory, quaffed the living waters of My bounty, hath drunk his fill from the heavenly river of My loving providence, acquainted himself with My Cause, apprehended that which I concealed within the treasury of My Words, and hath shone forth from the horizon of divine knowledge engaged in My praise and glorification. Verily, he is of Me. Upon him rest My mercy, My loving-kindness, My bounty and My glory.</p>

<p>He is the Dawning-Place from the horizon of the heaven of utterance!</p>
<p>Verily the Book speaketh from the most exalted horizon, saying: O peoples of creation! By God, the gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of the Kingdom of Names hath come with a sovereignty that no power of the world can weaken, nor can the swords of nations frighten Him. He hath stood before the faces of princes and divines, and revealed unto them that whereby the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise have been attracted. Blessed is he whose vision hath not been prevented by the veils of them who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>The fragrance of utterance hath been diffused throughout all contingent being, and those near unto God have hastened unto a station whereon the All-Merciful hath established Himself upon the throne of His Most Great Name. O peoples of the earth! By God, the Wronged One hath not spoken out of fancy. He hath come from the horizon of power with a manifest sovereignty. He calleth you for the sake of God and desireth from you no recompense. The dwellers of the highest Paradise bear witness to this, were ye of the fair-minded.</p>
<p>Fear God, O people, and follow not them who have turned away from the proof when the call of Him Who is the Manifestation of the Revelation was raised from the Mount of Knowledge. Be fair in the Cause for the sake of God and be not of the transgressors. Behold, then remember what befell the Youth in the nights and days at the hands of those who cast the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to idle fancies and vain imaginings. Consider what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an and be not of the heedless. He gave you glad tidings of the days of His Manifestation and made known unto you His straight path in this wise Remembrance.</p>
<p>Through His appearance the manifestations of idle fancy have wailed, and through His sovereignty the limbs of the oppressors have trembled. Beware lest the veils of the people prevent you in this Day wherein the atoms cry out “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Beautiful!”</p>
<p>O Hasan! Hearken unto the call from the Dayspring of Glory. Verily it draweth thee nigh unto a horizon wherefrom hath dawned and shone forth the Luminary of thy Lord’s utterance, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. This is a Day wherein that which the Messenger of God foretold aforetime, and whereof Christ gave glad tidings, hath appeared. There is no Messenger but hath informed the people of this Revelation, whereby those in earth and heaven have been attracted, and there hath appeared that which was hidden in knowledge and inscribed by the Pen of the Ancient of Days. Yet most of the people are among the idolaters. They have cast aside unity, clinging to what they possess of suppositions and idle fancies. To this the Most Great Ocean beareth witness in this exalted station.</p>
<p>O peoples of the earth! By the life of God, I desire naught for you save your salvation, and I desire only to draw you nigh unto God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Deprive not yourselves of that which hath appeared through truth. Cast aside what the people possess and take what ye are bidden by God, the Lord of this straight path.</p>
<p>O party of God in all lands! Know ye that We have desired for you a light whereby ye may walk in the darkness of the earth and which shall accompany you in the worlds of your Lord, Who is supreme over all, whether small or great. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto the Word of God and hath testified to that whereunto God testified before the creation of all things. Verily He is God, there is none other God but Him. His are the greatness and the glory, and His are the might and the power. Neither do the events of the world prevent Him, nor doth the fire of battle frighten Him. He hath judged with truth and with that whereby the stations of man are elevated, when He established Himself upon the throne before the faces of those near unto Him.</p>
<p>O friends of God in Shin, Alif and Ha! Verily the Word which hath issued forth from the treasuries of the loving-kindness of your Lord, the All-Merciful, shall be a treasure for you with a trusted, generous guardian. We counsel you and those who have believed in that whereby your stations shall be exalted among the peoples. He, verily, is the Compassionate, the All-Commanding, the All-Knowing. It behooveth man to manifest from himself that which shall cause his remembrance to endure as long as the Kingdom and the Realm endure, and whereby faces shall be illumined in every world of the worlds of his Lord, the Almighty, the Omnipotent. Rejoice in the verses of God and His remembrance. He hath made mention of you in the Most Great Prison in such wise that nothing whatsoever can equal it. To this testifieth every truthful and discerning one.</p>
<p>O people of glory! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He guideth you to a station which hath been exalted in truth from before God, the Lord of Lords. The pavilion of glory hath been raised upon the most exalted station. Blessed are ye for having cast away vain imaginings, taking hold of that which ye were commanded by God, the Lord of all mankind. We make mention of those who have turned to the Countenance and of the handmaidens who have believed in God, the Cleaver of the Dawn. Beware lest vain imaginings prevent you from unity, or discord from concord. Take hold of that which ye are commanded by God, the Revealer of verses. Blessed is he who hath attained unto His verses, spoken His praise, turned his face and directed his heart toward the Dayspring of lights.</p>
<p>We desire to make mention of the friends of God in Kha and Lam that they may inhale the fragrances of revelation and take for themselves a path unto God, the Lord of the Day of Return. And We make mention therein of him who hath loved Me and desired his Lord, that the remembrance may draw him to the Most Exalted Station and give him the glad-tidings of that which God, the Revealer of clear proofs, hath ordained for him. And We make mention of Our friends there and give them glad-tidings of that which hath been ordained for them, and We remind them of verses that no remembrances can equal. Beware lest the whisperings of the ungodly and the doubts of the cavilers prevent you. Arise with such steadfastness in the Cause as will cause the hearts of every polytheist and doubter to tremble. We counsel you to fear God and to observe that which He hath revealed in the Tablets. Grieve not at what ye have heard from the polytheists. They have committed what people before them committed. Soon shall they see the recompense of their deeds - a promise from God, the Almighty, the All-Choosing. The glory from Us be upon you and upon the handmaidens of God who have heard and believed in the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p>Verily the Wronged One desireth to make mention of His loved ones in the land of the Sultan, that they may rejoice in His remembrance, be reminded by His verses, be assured by His grace, and their faces be illumined by a light that hath shone forth and appeared from the horizon of the Will of God, the Lord of Religions. Aid your Lord through the hosts of wisdom, utterance, deeds and character - this is among God’s ways in this Most Great Revelation. To this testifieth the Interlocutor of the Mount, through Whom the heaven of knowledge was upraised. Beware, O My loved ones, lest ye object to anyone. Trust in God in all matters. Verily He is with His loved ones in all conditions. Not a thing escapeth His knowledge. He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the Mighty, the All-Seeing. Hold fast unto the Most Great Cord of God in such wise that the people of error shall not prevent you.</p>
<p>O Pen! The Lord of Eternity desires to make mention of His friends through His grace, for He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. O My friends in Nizam! Follow God’s command and His laws, then aid His Cause through conduct by which the horizons shall be illumined. It behooveth every soul to aid God’s Cause in such wise as to exalt His word amongst His servants. Contention hath been forbidden in the Book, to this beareth witness the Mother Book from its most exalted station. Blessed is the poor one who hath turned with his heart to the ocean of riches, and the sick one who hath sought healing, and the seated one who hath arisen to serve God’s Cause with humility and contrition. By God’s life! That which was recorded in God’s Books and hidden from eyes hath been made manifest. Aid your Lord through deeds and through that whereby your stations may be elevated amongst the peoples. Thus doth move the Pen of Justice and speak that which shall draw you nigh unto the Dawning-Place of utterance. Your names were present before the Wronged One, and He hath sent down from the heaven of bounty that which the pens are powerless to describe. Blessed are ye and blessed is the nation that hath believed in God on this Day wherein Truth hath come with clear proof and evidence.</p>
<p>O people of Ha and Mim! The Wronged One turneth toward you at this hour from the precincts of the Prison, and remindeth you of God’s verses, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. We have mentioned you in various tablets with such mention as hath diffused the fragrance of the All-Merciful, were ye to know. The Trustworthy One hath mentioned you time and again, and hath desired for you that which shall assist you to perform deeds that shall endure throughout ages and centuries. Give thanks unto your Lord, the All-Merciful, for He hath sent down unto you that from which the sincere ones perceive the fragrance of God, the Mighty, the Loving. Beware lest anything whatsoever prevent you from God, the Lord of all that was and shall be. Verily His favor hath been amongst you and your mention. We beseech God to strengthen him and strengthen you in that which He loveth and approveth. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>Hear ye the call of the Wronged One in the Persian tongue. His honor the Trustworthy One, upon him be My glory, and his honor Fadl, upon him be My loving-kindness, have made mention of the friends of that land. The assured, steadfast and contented souls have ever been and shall ever be remembered before God. By God’s life! Their mention is recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book. This mention shall not be erased by extinction nor altered by change. Every discerning one is aware and every informed one doth testify that whatsoever hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen hath neither likeness nor equal. Yet the calumniators among the people of the Bayan have, even more than the former people, clung to vain imaginings. Some of the friends of God, in accordance with the requirements of consummate wisdom, are not openly mentioned, yet they are recorded in the Book and sealed with the seal of might. Happy are they and joy be unto them. Verily He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We give glad-tidings of God’s grace and favor to all the loved ones, and likewise to the sons of His Friend and the heirs of His Interlocutor. Each one is mentioned before God, whether small or great, female or male. It is incumbent upon all to hold fast unto that which leadeth to the sanctification of souls and the turning of the servants unto God. The Pen of Divine counsel hath mentioned throughout nights and days that wherefrom floweth the river of mercy and whereby the lights of grace are made manifest. Blessed are they who have held fast thereunto, and woe unto every heedless one cast out. The glory from Us be upon you and upon those who have testified to that whereunto God testified before the creation of the heavens and the earth. Praise be unto Him, for He is the Goal of them that know and the Beloved of the hearts of the sincere ones. O Hassan! When thou perceivest the fragrance of the choice wine of My utterance and beholdest the waves of the ocean of My wisdom, say […]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me, and made me known to Thee, and caused me to hearken unto Thy call whereby the hearts of Thy sincere servants and those who have recognized Thy oneness among Thy creation were attracted. Thy tender mercies from every direction, through Thy means, O Thou Cause of all causes, have encompassed me until I reached this luminous spot, this station which Thou hast made the Dawning-Place of Thy mighty signs and the Dayspring of Thy most exalted attributes. Thou hast shown me that which hath been the hope of those near unto Thee, both of old and in latter times, and the gathering-place in this day of those who circle round Thy throne, wherein the leaves and the trees and the fruits and whatsoever hath been created in earth and heaven cry out: “By God! That which was hidden from all eternity hath appeared. Turn ye with your hearts and follow not every doubting infidel.” O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the effulgent rays of the sun of Thy bounty to aid me to remain steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the swords of the world nor the clamor of the nations may deter me. O my Lord! Thou seest this lowly one standing before the throne of Thy glory, and this poor one clinging to the cord of Thy riches. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which is with Thee. Ordain for me and for Thy loved ones that which will draw them nearer unto Thee in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted.</p>

<p>O My loved one! This world hath neither stability nor constancy, and they who possess hearts of understanding should not, in these numbered days, deprive themselves of the sweet-scented breezes of the divine and the gentle spiritual fragrances, nor should they, through vain words, veil themselves from the effulgent rays of the Beloved. Such utterances have ever existed and shall continue to exist - past, present and future. The Sovereign of eternity hath ordained for every matter a proof that is clear and evident to those endowed with insight, that the possessors of pure hearts might hold fast to it and pay no heed to vain utterances that proceed from the manifestations of Satan. Otherwise, were all matters to be concluded by mere words, and were all affairs to be settled by mere verbal pronouncement, never would the Cause of God become clear and manifest, never would the dawn of guidance appear, and never would the darkness of error be dispelled. All the Messengers, in all the Books revealed by God, have never confined the Cause within limits nor restricted it to any particular direction. Thus have all these mysteries become known, and the fire of “except” hath consumed and destroyed all the veils of limitation denoted by “no,” and the banner proclaiming that “God hath power over all things” hath been raised upon the mountain of “He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.” Blessed is he who perceiveth from mere allusion the places of guidance. Ponder deeply upon the verse “The Jews say: ‘God’s hand is fettered.’” Perchance ye may partake of the hidden Salsabil concealed therein and attain unto the ultimate source and origin of this treasured grace and this sealed nectar. For centuries have all recited this verse, yet it is as though it had never been read, that the truth of “None shall touch it save the purified ones” might be established and proven. Had this verse been truly pondered and reflected upon, such dissension and oppression would never have befallen the Daysprings of Oneness and the Manifestations of Holiness. Therefore, one must observe with the eye of divine favor deposited within the heart, and, recognizing the value of these days, must not remain heedless, for ere long will the manifestations of “Verily, unto Him shall we return” return, and the spiritual birds will take flight from this earthly realm of remoteness and abasement to the nest of nearness and unity. The clouds of mercy shall be withheld, the rain of grace shall cease to fall, the lamp of light shall be concealed, and veils of darkness shall encompass the earth and all that dwell therein. The lamp of the spirit is not always aflame in the lantern of light; though it perisheth not, none save the people of perpetuity can perceive it. For the universal outpouring of grace, the all-pervading mercy, the Beauty of the Divine Essence, and the Ocean of Oneness are not always in flow, in expansion, in manifestation, and in surge. The outward spring, which is charged with the nurturing of all visible things by the command of the Creator of Names, appeareth but once a year, and likewise the spiritual spring, which traineth spirits and illumined hearts and bestoweth eternal and everlasting life, doth appear but once in a thousand years or more, conferring upon all things, both seen and unseen, the garment of existence and the revelation of divine lordship. Who then is worthy and who is deserving to perceive this? Therefore, while the sweet-scented […]</p>
<p>The spiritual breezes are wafting from the gardens of divine meanings, and the nightingale of utterance is singing upon the branches of the rose-garden of divine good-pleasure. Effort and striving are needed lest the ear be deprived of the sweet melodies of the All-Merciful and the body remain bereft of the springtime breezes of inner significance. This breeze bestowed eternal life upon every body it touched, and conferred an everlasting new garment upon every withered tree it passed over. Be not occupied with preserving your life while forsaking the Best Beloved, and rend not the garment of remembrance and certitude because of the vain words of this one and that. Say: O friends! Extinguish not the lamps of guidance in the heart with the winds of misguidance and error. Though the decree “He whom God guideth, he indeed is guided aright, and he whom God leadeth astray, thou wilt find for him no protecting friend to lead him to the right way” is established and proven, yet the guidance “Remind them, for reminding profiteth the believers” is also flowing and pervading, and the grace “God will change their evil deeds to good deeds” is likewise manifest and evident. None but the pure ear can hear this soul-stirring lamentation, and the sun of inner meanings casteth its reflection only upon purified hearts. The companions of Joseph who sat with him nightly upon the same carpet and were his constant associates in all days remained deprived of his sweet fragrance, while the nostrils of Jacob the beloved perceived it from afar. Therefore must the cold of heedlessness be cured through the sweet remembrance of the Friend, and the eye of the heart be illumined through inhaling the fragrance of the Beloved’s garment, that the sweet scent of the Beloved may be perceived and the fire of divine love may burn away all save the Friend from marrow and skin. Until this station is attained, all deeds are futile and void. As all these conditions have become clear and evident to the physical eye, how many are the servants who burned nightly in the fire of separation from the Friend and yearned to sacrifice their lives, yet when the veil of Beauty was lifted, all remained veiled by the veils of glory and attained not the presence of the Beloved, which is the ultimate goal of all who seek Him. This was only because they possessed not of themselves an ear and eye to distinguish the Friend from the stranger, and the song of the nightingale from the crow’s caw. “They have hearts wherewith they understand not, and eyes wherewith they see not.” All became devoted to the words of the People of the Book and clung to the allusions of men of learning, saying that thus was it recorded in the books and thus was it inscribed in the scrolls, heedless that God’s irrevocable decree cannot be confined within bounds nor be subject to rules. It seems they have not drunk from the fountain of “He doeth what He willeth” nor tasted of the wine of “He ordaineth what He pleaseth.” And it became known that the Cause appeared from the Dayspring of the invisible Divine Identity contrary to what was recorded and to what minds and intellects had comprehended, even as the Resurrection was realized through a Rising, and the Seal returned to a Beginning. O my brother! Now ponder carefully these words, that the gates of infinite knowledge may be opened before thee and thou mayest stand firm in the Cause with complete steadfastness, and with penetrating vision observe in the horizons of the soul and the innermost being of the Beloved the mysteries of the All-Glorious. Now if these servants had illumined their eyes with the light of detachment and their ears from hearing […]</p>
<p>If people did not prevent themselves from the wondrous divine melodies, assuredly the ear of the soul, by virtue of its attachment to holy realms, would arise from the grave of heedlessness at the call of the Nightingale of the Divine Essence and would receive its portion and share from beholding that Beauty which is the ultimate purpose and universal grace. I swear by God that if you would turn slightly toward the heart, you would observe from the movement of this Pen the movements of ancient spirits, and from the blackness of this ink you would inhale the everlasting fragrance of love, and from the temples of these letters you would tangibly witness eternal words. The fragrance of musk is supremely distinct from other fragrances, and camphor is clearly distinguished from all else, and great indeed is the difference between the morn of guidance and the darkness of error. This is evident to men of learning - that the Truth is distinguished from all people in every respect, in His words, His deeds, His movements and His rest, such that He bears no resemblance whatsoever to any other. However, the artificial nature and bat-like disposition is assuredly deprived of comprehending these stations. The bat has no share in the radiance of the sun, and the dung beetle has no portion of the perfume of musk.</p>
<p>In any case, the surging of this ocean will not be stilled by these outcries, nor will the divine breeze cease to blow by these winds. This servant has always concealed himself in coarse garments made of camel hair, that I might not be known by any name nor described by any attribute. Although the ancient seas are ever flowing in the heart through God’s grace, not a drop thereof is manifest; and though the scrolls of inner meanings are hidden in the breast, not a letter thereof appears on any tablet. No thought have I save utter servitude, no purpose save complete nothingness. I have ever yearned and do now yearn that some worthy service might proceed from this servant, that perchance it might be accepted in the path of the Friend and meet with the favor of the Beloved.</p>
<p>What tribulations were endured and what afflictions were visited from before - assuredly you have heard. And in this realm too I stand alone before the enemies, surrounded on all sides by foes, with none to help Me. At every moment We await the surrender of this earthly frame to those who claim it, that We might take Our abode in the divine nest. Despite this, what words they utter and what statements they make! It is as though not a single eye had ever been created in existence, nor had a single ear been opened. I pour out My grief and sorrow unto God. I say: naught shall befall us save what God has decreed for us.</p>
<p>Finally, say: O people! Have mercy on yourselves if you have none for others, for the fruits of your deeds and actions return unto you. If you are not the cause of kindling the divine fire, why then be the cause of its extinction? And if you are not helpers, why be the cause of opposition? After all, this lamp has no glass to protect it from contrary winds, and this candle has no lantern to preserve it from the dust of souls. Though indeed it seeks no lantern save divine destiny and desires no glass save His good-pleasure. It dwells secure in the mighty fortress of submission and clings to the strong pillar of resignation. Should you wish to know of the afflictions, inquire of Salman. The cause of these letters was certain vain imaginings of the people; otherwise, I would never have troubled you nor caused you weariness. And We desire naught save what God desires.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great!</p>
<p>These are days when neither pen nor tongue can find rest save in commemorating the martyrs, nor do they desire to be occupied with any remembrance except that of those souls who, in the assemblage of the world, sacrificed with utmost submission and contentment their spirit, body, wealth, possessions and kindred in the path of the Most Great Name. Verily, the heaven weepeth and the clouds lament, the mountains cry out and hearts are in turmoil. Would that I had been with them and had attained to what they attained! I swear by the Sun of the horizon of utterance that no such calamity hath appeared in creation, nor hath anyone attained to such bounty. God hath blackened the faces of those who disbelieved, turned away, arose and slaughtered those for whose tribulation the Lord of Prophets lamenteth in the Most Exalted Paradise and the Primal Point grieveth at the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. A hundred thousand regrets that this evanescent one did not attain to this most great bounty! I swear by the Ancient Beauty that this regret remaineth in the heart. From the Supreme Pen concerning those holy souls words have been recorded whose light shall endure as long as the kingdoms of earth and heaven endure. By God! The hearts of the denizens of Paradise are consumed by what hath been sent down from the Pen of God concerning this great calamity. Our purpose, and your purpose, and the purpose of all who are in the heavens and on earth - a hundred thousand times at every moment doth this servant desire to utter the words “Would that I had been with them!” Exalted is He Who created them, exalted is He Who made them known, and elevated them, and honored them! Observe and reflect how these two brilliant lights and pure souls, before their arrival in Baghdad, were unknown in any city or land, yet after they were adorned with the ornament of faith and were honored to attain the presence of the All-Merciful, God, exalted be His glory, through His complete power, distinguished them with the mantle of glory and elevation, as ye have heard and seen. He made their dwelling place the shelter of the sincere and themselves the refuge of all who came. Then, when they yearned to attain the supreme martyrdom in the path of the Lord of Names, they attained at the end of their lives to a station which, by God besides Whom there is none other God, all the Messengers, the sincere ones and the near ones have sought and continue to seek.</p>
<p>O brother! All bounty is in the hands of the true Beloved. Whomsoever He willeth, He enableth to attain unto that which is the goal. None hath the right to object or to ask why or wherefore, for He is the Chooser, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. From the Most Exalted Pen there hath been revealed in this greatest of calamities that which surpasseth in worth whatsoever is visible on earth or manifest and hidden in heaven. At times when this servant reflecteth upon the tribulations that befell those sanctified souls, he is moved to burst forth in lamentation and wailing, and at other times, considering the grace that encompassed them, he uttereth “Would that I were with them!” and findeth himself in a state of boundless joy. Blessed are they, and again blessed are they! Consider how death is ordained and decreed for every soul in every circumstance, yet to yield up one’s life in the path of the All-Merciful among the concourse of creation is a thousand times more excellent than to die upon one’s bed. How regrettable that most people are heedless of this most exalted station! This servant beseecheth his Lord, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, to ordain for every soul that which will draw it nigh unto Him and cause it to recognize the mysteries of His wisdom in all that hath been and shall be manifested. Verily, He is the Peerless, the One, the Evident, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O kind friend! Two letters from you were received, both first and second sent from the Abode of the Beloved, namely the Land of Qaf. The first letter was adorned with the mention of God, service to His Cause, and news of your well-being and that of the Trustee, upon him be the glory of God. Likewise was the second letter. Praise be to God that you have been enabled to serve the Cause and have manifested complete sincerity, purity, and trustworthiness among the people. Today, whosoever manifesteth praiseworthy characteristics is a promoter of the Cause, for commendable deeds and befitting qualities and attributes are in themselves propagators of the Cause of the Beloved of the world, as hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen in various expressions in the Tablets. Blessed are they that act, and joy be to them that have attained! This evanescent servant offereth thanks at all times on behalf of you and the Trustee - upon you both be the glory of God - and truly this is a station deserving of gratitude and praise, for not every soul hath been confirmed in that whereunto you have been confirmed. The servant doth praise God for this and saith in your tongue: “Praise be unto Thee, O Goal of the worlds, and thanks be unto Thee, O Beloved of them that know!” And in this station both my outer and inner tongue declare: “Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!” After this servant became aware of what was contained in your letter, he turned toward the Most Holy, Most Luminous, Most Glorious Presence and presented before His countenance all that you had mentioned. He said: “God willing, may they ever dwell beneath the shade of divine mercy and be engaged in His service.” And He said: “O servant! Beseech God to make them steadfast in His service and to adorn them at all times with the ornament of trustworthiness, and not to withhold from them this most glorious and precious robe. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.” End.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning the two souls who have turned to God in the land of Qaf and Mim, it was presented before the Most Holy Court. This is what the All-Merciful hath revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance: “O Abu’l-Hasan! We have heard thy call and what thou didst write concerning the two souls. Blessed art thou and they before God, the Single, the One, the Recompenser, the All-Wise. We have heard their call and witnessed what they have wrought in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds, and We have accepted what they have manifested in His straight Path.</p>
<p>We make mention of Muhammad-Husayn, who attained the recognition of God on a day wherein the hearts of the mystics were sorely troubled. O Husayn! Rejoice in that thou hast been mentioned before the Throne, and in that there hath been sent down unto thee from the Kingdom of thy Lord’s loving-kindness that which shall gladden the eyes of all who behold. The Desired One hath accepted what thou hast done in His path. He, verily, is the Chosen One, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Rida and give him glad-tidings through this perspicuous remembrance, whereby the seas have surged and the winds have blown and the fragrance of the garment hath been wafted between the heavens and the earth. Rejoice thou in My remembrance and gladden thyself with this glorious Book. We have accepted what hath proceeded from thee in the days of God. He will surely reward you both with the most excellent of rewards. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding what was mentioned to those souls that the Huququ’llah cannot be given to just anyone - this statement is true. The Huququ’llah must be collected by trustworthy souls and then sent to the Most Holy Court through God’s trusted ones. What hath reached His Holiness Jamal (upon him be Baha’u’llah) and yourself is acceptable before God, and likewise what reached Umm-i-Haram (upon her be Baha’u’llah). We beseech God to enable all the loved ones to attain unto the ornament of trustworthiness and faithfulness. In this year, due to certain events that occurred in the Land of the Prison, there were revealed from the heaven of God’s Will verses concerning detachment, trustworthiness and the like, which, were they to be presented to the mountains, would cause them to humble themselves before God’s command. It is strange that some have not recognized the worth and station of trustworthiness and have not observed their own station. They themselves have no station, yet they have altered God’s station among His servants. We hope that henceforth they will arise to make up for what they have lost and compensate for their deeds. They must at all times fix their gaze upon the horizon of the bounty of the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted One, and be occupied with serving His Cause.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the land of H and M concerning His Holiness Aqa Muhammad-Baqir (upon him be Baha’u’llah), it was presented before the Most Holy Court and was adorned with acceptance. He hath truly arisen to serve the Cause. I beseech the Exalted One to strengthen him in all conditions and to exalt him in truth. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Likewise, concerning His Holiness Aqa Muhammad-Hasan (upon him be Baha’u’llah), mention was made and He said: “Blessed is he in that he hath attained unto what God hath revealed in the Book.” Praise be to God that from the pure and assured souls in that land the fragrances of the love of the Beloved of the worlds are diffused. God willing, may all attain unto the highest horizon and become eloquent in the praise and glorification of God. Say: […]</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O God of the seen and unseen and Lord of existence! I beseech Thee by the Promised One Who has ascended the throne of Thy grandeur and stood in the station of Thy Self, to assist Thy servants to turn unto the ocean of Thy knowledge which surgeth through Thy Name and sovereignty. Purify, O my God, their hearts from idle fancies and vain imaginings in this Day wherein the sun of certitude hath shone forth from the horizon of power. O Lord! We are poor at Thy gate and helpless before the manifestations of Thy might. I beseech Thee, O Lord of all possibilities, by Thy name, the All-Merciful, to draw the heedless nigh unto the horizon of Thy Revelation and to lead them, even with chains and fetters, to the precincts of Thy bounties. O Lord! They have forgotten Thy days in that they have followed the dawning-places of conjecture who have denied Thy signs. By Thy glory! Were the veil to be removed from their faces, they would hasten to Thy dwelling-place and cry out in the wilderness in their separation from Thee. Then send down, O my God, upon Thy loved ones that which will tranquilize their hearts, delight their eyes, and dilate their breasts. Thou art, verily, the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Supreme, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>We beseech God to aid thee and His Trusted One in that which will exalt God’s Cause and His remembrance. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Mighty. Assuredly send news of thyself and the Trusted One - upon him be the Glory of God. Convey on my behalf greetings to all the loved ones in that land - namely those souls who are detached from all save God, who speak in God, who cling to God, who return unto God, and who walk in the path of God - and say: This is the Day of service, remembrance and praise. Blessed are the people of Baha. The Spirit and Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon whosoever hath attained unto the Most Exalted Station.</p>

<p>In the name of our Lord, the Most High, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>All praise, sanctified above the understanding of all created things, befitteth that Pre-existent Being Who, through the dark manifestations of nothingness, made His Cause to appear, and through tribulation made His Command manifest between earth and heaven. By the hand of power He lit a lamp, and the contrary winds which are the cause of its extinction, by His all-compelling will, served but to increase its radiance. A fire that the hand of power kindleth, the seas of the world cannot extinguish. When the light of His Cause dawned from the dayspring of divine will, the idolaters sought through rejection and denial to extinguish it. Thus did they turn from the land of ?a to the land of Zawra, and this denial became a herald for the light. And from Zawra to the land of mystery did He journey, through that which the hands of the oppressors had wrought. Thereafter, the heedless ones, fearing lest that radiance should illumine the land of mystery and its surroundings, and deliver them from the darkness of tyranny, under the pretext of protecting that realm banished its Guardian to the prison of ’Akka. The flame of oppression reached such heights that from the kingdom of destiny the Suriy-i-Ra’is was revealed, until the Cause attained a station unprecedented in all creation. Whatsoever was revealed in that blessed Tablet appeared letter by letter. Well is it with them that are endowed with true vision! The banishment to ’Akka raised aloft the word of affirmation, and the banner of “Verily there is none other God but Him” was unfurled upon the mount of the Lord’s will - exalted be His glory and His sovereignty! Glorified be He Whom neither the manifestations of the Pharaohs, nor the appearing of tyrants, nor the signs of emperors, nor the oppression of caesars can frustrate. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant submitteth unto your honor that your eminent letter, after centuries and ages, illumined the horizon of the heart with the light of love. Each word thereof was as a fountain whence flowed the living waters of affection. I have beseeched and do beseech the True One - exalted be His glory and abundant be His grace - to grant your honor success in attaining unto that which hath been inscribed in the Book by the Pen of the Lord of all being. He is verily the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. After perusal, it was presented at the Most Holy Court, and these words were revealed - exalted be His remembrance: “We make mention of him even as the Concourse on High make mention of him, and the people of Baha remember him through the eternity of My most beautiful names. Verily his Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Giving, the Generous. We beseech God that He may cause him to behold that which will delight his eyes, and give him to drink that which will render him so attracted in the days of his Lord that neither weariness nor languor shall overtake him. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. And may He acquaint him with this world and its conditions, and with that which hath been ordained for him by My Most Exalted Pen, that he may abandon the former, holding fast unto that which his Lord, the All-Informed, hath willed.”</p>
<p>God willing, may you be blessed by divine grace and arise to serve His Cause. That which you have witnessed and heard in the path of God hath not been and shall never be lost. Though the dark clouds of oppression may prevent the rays of the Sun of Justice from shining for a day, an hour, or a moment, this is not worthy of mention, for assuredly the Sun of Justice will appear and illumine the darkened world with its light. Then shall no crookedness or inequality be seen in the earth.</p>
<p>O thou who gazeth upon the Countenance and drinketh the choice wine of revelation! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He calleth thee from this praiseworthy station and remembereth thee with this Most Sweet Remembrance, which all the treasures of earth and heaven cannot equal. Rejoice in the grace of God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. Be thou eloquent with wisdom and utterance in praise of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, and arise to serve His Cause, the Mighty, the Beloved. The covenant of the oppressors and all that pertaineth unto them shall pass away like unto passing winds, and the tongues of the world shall testify to their extinction. Blessed is the soul that hath held fast to God’s Covenant and to that which hath been ordained for it from Him. Verily, it is among the most exalted of creation in the Preserved Tablet. Convey My greetings to all the loved ones on behalf of the Wronged One and say: God willing, may ye attain such a station that no power can deter you from the Cause of God, and no thing among all things can become a veil. In the name of the Peerless Friend, drink ye from the Kawthar of faithfulness and partake of the sealed wine. He saith: Well is it with you and pleasant be it unto you, O chosen ones of God on earth and daysprings of steadfastness throughout all lands. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken, as a token of His grace upon thee. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Wise. And praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning Jinab-i-Amin and Jinab-i-Haji Mirza Abu’l-Hasan, upon them be the glory of God, Jinab-i-Haji Mirza Abu’l-Hasan himself had written about thy loving-kindness. It is most clear and evident that whatsoever proceedeth from that beloved one in service to the Cause hath never fallen short. Praise be to God, in these divine days they have been the sources of goodly deeds and have shown the utmost love toward each of the friends. Soon shall the fruits of all become manifest. Although the essential fruit is that which findeth acceptance before God, a hundred thousand thanks that it hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Ere long shall the fragrance of deeds performed in the path of God be diffused and spread abroad, and the people of the world shall perceive it.</p>
<p>And concerning what thou didst write about Jinab-i-’A.B., upon him be the glory of God - yes, several years ago in one of the Tablets which descended from the heaven of loving-kindness especially for him, there was a mention, and twice did this lowly one hear from the blessed tongue saying: “Soon shall that which was revealed for him in God’s Tablet, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, become manifest.” Strange indeed are the heedless people who, despite all that hath appeared and shall appear having been previously revealed with utmost clarity and explicitness by the Supreme Pen, as that honored one hath seen and heard in the blessed Tablets, are yet so intoxicated with the wine of pride that they have not perceived a trace thereof nor understood a word. Leave them to their vain imaginings wherein they sport. To God do we belong and to Him shall we return. This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth God that He may enable his honor to achieve that which is befitting. Verily, He is the Bestower, the Generous. Should you meet him and should it be advisable, convey this lowly one’s greetings to him.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst write concerning the sister’s daughter, upon her be the glory of God, this matter was mentioned in the Most Holy Presence. One day these blessed words shone forth from the Dawning-Place of Divine Unity: “Verily, she who hath ascended unto God - We have adorned her with the ornament of forgiveness and have mentioned her from My Most Exalted Pen as a bounty from Us to those who have hearkened to My call and turned to My horizon and have attained to the service of My wondrous Cause. Upon her be My glory and My remembrance and My mercy which hath preceded all the worlds.”</p>
<p>I swear by the Sun of Utterance, which hath risen and is resplendent from the horizon of the divine Tablet, that whosoever hath today turned unto Him and perceived the fragrance of His Revelation hath been and shall ever be reckoned among the people of eternity. Blessed be the maidservant who hath attained unto this most exalted station, and blessed be the servant who hath been honored with this wise remembrance.</p>
<p>At this point such utterances were revealed from the Ancient Tongue as this servant is powerless and inadequate to mention.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about his honor A.B., upon him be the glory of God, and his ill health, we beseech our Lord and the Lord of the worlds, our Goal and the Goal of the nations, to give him to drink from the ocean of His healing, to clothe him with the robe of health, and to adorn him with the ornament of well-being. God willing, through the loving-kindness of the Beloved of the worlds, he will attain unto that which is ordained for him. In truth, he is outwardly and inwardly distinguished by his love for the Truth. This evanescent servant at all times beseeches the Truth, exalted be His glory, for his health and well-being. Verily He is the Healer, the Bestower, the Generous.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about his honor Varqa, upon him be the glory of God, and his arising to teach the Cause, it brought boundless joy. Praise be to God that he hath arisen to render this great service and God willing he is confirmed. Whatsoever is manifested today in service to the Cause shall endure and remain through the eternity of God’s names and attributes. This servant beareth witness that when he returned from the Holy Land, by leave of the Lord of Oneness, he was aflame with the fire of divine love. God willing, may the hand of divine power daily increase that flame.</p>
<p>After this matter was presented in the Most Holy Court, He spoke these words, exalted be His grandeur and His sovereignty: “Verily We summoned him, caused him to hear, showed him, and sent him back to serve My Cause and make mention of Me among My servants. I am, verily, powerful over whatsoever I will through My word ‘Be’ and it is. We shall surely aid him in that which he desireth in the Cause of his Lord, and make mention of him with such mention as will cause them that hesitate to hasten unto the Mighty, the All-Loving. Blessed is he and his father upon whom We shed the light of Our countenance, who gave up his spirit in his longing for the advent of his Lord, the Possessor of existence. There hath been sent down from the Most Exalted Pen that which shall dilate the breasts and gladden the hearts.”</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about his honor Aqa Mirza Jalil, it was presented in the Most Holy Court. Although holy verses had previously been sent down for him from the heaven of oneness, yet again, as a bounty upon you and him, a most holy and most exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the divine Will and sent. God willing, may his eyes, heart and inner being attain unto it and be illumined and enlightened thereby.</p>
<p>His honor Aqa Mirza S., upon him be the glory of God, praise be to God, hath attained unto His special favors. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to protect and preserve him through the hosts of the seen and the unseen, to ordain for him the good of this world and the next, and to aid him in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Lord of the throne and the dust. There is none other God but He, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>The contents of these passages were heard from the blessed tongue concerning him: “Verily His bounty toward thee is great.” In these days a number of those who have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon arrived and after a brief stay were gradually given permission to depart and returned. Even some from among the Jewish people arrived and attained unto boundless favors.</p>
<p>Another submission is that at the appointed time, in accordance with your wish, this servant attained the blessing of pilgrimage and performed your proxy pilgrimage in detail, and it was also crowned with acceptance. We praise Him for this, and by His own truth, verily He is the Generous, the Bountiful. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>This lowly servant submits that although the details of the departure from the Land of Mystery [Adrianople] and the tribulations of those days are beyond description by pen and tongue - none can reckon them save God, my Lord and the Lord of all things - yet as commanded I shall briefly relate that one night, five hours past sunset, his honor Ism-i-Jamal and two others who were with him intending to attain the sacred presence were to depart at that hour of night, take their possessions and leave that land. This servant was bewildered as to the cause but was commanded and obeyed. The friends left in the morning. Some hours after their departure, people came inquiring what had happened and where they had gone. A brief response was given and they departed. Then suddenly at the eighth hour of the day, all the friends who were occupied in the bazaar, both merchants and others, were arrested and taken to the gate and imprisoned. Military officers surrounded the house. Someone came from the gate to the presence of the Most Great Branch - glorious be His praise - and submitted that by order they must proceed to Gallipoli. What more can I say of what transpired? Everything in the sacred household was auctioned off and plundered. Later at the government house they told the companions that whoever wished could return to their own place and engage in their trade and commerce. The twelve persons who had come to serve Them in Adrianople must go together, the rest were free to choose. No one accepted to stay behind. All abandoned their belongings and possessions and everything pertaining to them, suffering great losses. Their goods were sold at very low prices. Those who purchased them delayed in payment, but they did not wait and forsook that wealth, joining the hosts of glory. And one person sacrificed himself which caused an uproar in the city. Afterwards most of the foreign consuls came to the Most Holy Presence and much was discussed. They said this journey was inevitable and must be undertaken, relying upon God in all things. In brief, were the details of what the officials said to be submitted it would be lengthy. They showed much kindness and wrote the full details of everything to all governments. On the day of departure a strange commotion arose. With seventy-two souls They departed from the Land of Mystery toward the Prison Land. What more can I say of the joyous spirit that prevailed on the journey? By God, it was as though all were going to a feast! What more can I say of the wondrous verses that were revealed at every moment - would that you had been with us! After arrival in Gallipoli, Omar Effendi Binbashi came with five Onbashis and chavushes and submitted that They must proceed to Akka. Then on an Austrian vessel They proceeded toward Akka. Near that celestial city it stopped, and the Ancient Beauty came by rowboat. Four persons were prevented from accompanying Them: his honor Sayyah, Mishkin-Qalam, Aqa Muhammad-Baqir, and Aqa Abdul-Ghaffar - upon them be the Glory of God and […]</p>
<p>Umar Effendi mentioned that he was ordered to take these four individuals to Cyprus. The friends broke into lamentations. After a few minutes of separation, Jinab-i-Aqa Abdul-Ghaffar threw himself from the ship’s deck into the sea - how sublime was his love, detachment, reliance and steadfastness! We then arrived in Akka and were lodged in the military barracks. On the night of arrival there was absolutely nothing in the sanctuary. The Pasha sent a small evening meal, which they distributed among the children. The weather was extremely hot, the water was salty, and the food was disagreeable - one can imagine what transpired. Yet through divine grace we were and are in the utmost joy and delight. God will soon assist His servants with truth. Verily He fulfills His promise and He knows all things. Just as everything that was recorded in previous Tablets concerning the upheaval in the Land of Mystery has been fulfilled, likewise what was written about divine assistance will certainly come to pass. Three souls also sacrificed themselves in this land of exile and prison: the two brothers Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Baqir and Aqa Muhammad-Ismail, upon them be God’s mercy and favor, who arm in arm sacrificed themselves in one night. From the beginning of creation until now, such an event has never occurred where two brothers thus united and in perfect agreement took flight from this dark earth to the Most Pure and Luminous Habitation. Blessed are they, and blessed the loins that bore them and the womb from which they came forth! The details of the favors manifested towards them I cannot now submit, as the way is cut off and the pen is forbidden. Likewise Jinab-i-Aqa Abul-Qasim from Sultanabad. Despite all these trials we were in truth in utmost comfort, joy and delight, as we had attained His presence. However we were saddened regarding the friends in Iraq, as they were far from His presence and afflicted with intense trials. Yet as it was for God and in God’s path, there is no harm or sorrow. As for what you wrote concerning Jinab-i-Aqayi Aqa Siyyid Mahdi, upon him be the Glory of God, upon return he was verbally instructed to maintain complete secrecy, therefore he did not associate with others. And concerning what was written about the steadfastness of some of the friends, we praise and thank God for making His loved ones firm in His Cause and steadfast in His love.</p>
<p>Regarding Jinab-i-Zayn, you had asked for instructions. He said that today the duty of all is to be patient in the face of tribulations and to spread the mention of God among the servants with pure wisdom. Successive trials and continuous afflictions should not prevent those who have truly drunk from the Kawthar of Life, and although their hardships and trials have exceeded their strength, since all affairs are referred to God, whatever has befallen is easy. To whatever place they deem wise, they may write and send letters. As the Divine Tree itself grows through the winds of tribulation, so too are its leaves in motion. The sorrows and trials of all are dependent on the root of the Tree. Soon will descend that which will gladden the hearts of His loved ones. Convey greetings and glory to each and every one, especially to those whose steadfastness has become evident and who are mentioned in God’s presence. If it were possible, the Mighty Missive would be sent to all, but these days do not allow it, as you observe. Furthermore, to whatever land you arrive, convey glory to the loved ones of God and say that today is the day of firmness and victory, and they should not be sorrowful in any way, for whatever has occurred was from the destined trials and was mentioned in previous Tablets. Soon will appear the wisdom of what has appeared, and we are in evident thanksgiving.</p>
<p>He is God! Today the foundation of all affairs has been and is service to God’s Cause, and it is best for His loved ones in every land to engage in outward affairs, for they can thus convey a word of truth to people or render some service to the friends. God willing, I hope that you will be a mention for the people of that land and move with perfect wisdom lest strangers become aware. We beseech God to assist you in all conditions. Verily, He is your Guardian in this world and the next. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>On behalf of this servant, convey spiritual and holy mention to Jinab-i-Aqa Abdul-Ahad. We beseech God to grant him what has been sent down from the heaven of His favor and enable him to soar in the atmosphere of love for his Lord, the Most Merciful, and to detach him from all existence. Verily, He answers whoever calls upon Him, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>The latest news is that Jinab-i-Ustad Muhammad-Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, has returned to the seat of the Cause after traveling through Iranian territories, bringing good news from all directions that, praise be to God, this restriction has become the cause of freedom, and this bondage has increased the stages of the servants’ unity. All are engaged in the mention of God with perfect eagerness and longing. A letter also arrived from Jinab-i-Aqayi Aqa Seyyed Mehdi, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, mentioning that praise be to God, all the loved ones everywhere are engaged in God’s mention with perfect sanctification and detachment. He had written many praises, and you know that he rarely offers praise; nevertheless, he had expressed particular satisfaction and unity with their deeds, as they have completely abandoned forbidden rejected actions. The divine words of counsel have affected them to such a degree that nothing greater can be imagined. He had even written that his brother, Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Ali Kabir, upon them both be the Glory of God, who was known for certain deeds and whose transformation seemed impossible, has nevertheless completely abandoned all that God has forbidden. We beseech God to assist him and those who have believed in what manifests the sanctification of His Essence and the detachment of His Being from the worlds.</p>
<p>News has also come from the captives of Mosul. Strange it is that the prisoners spent on behalf of the prisoners. After learning of the Most Great Imprisonment, each one, both women and men, according to their means, sent gifts to the Most Holy Court. Various reports arrived from those regions. Out of fear of the sons, in the days of sedition, something had been written, but afterwards news came from the sons themselves. Although outwardly they did not display the greatest steadfastness, as was abundantly shown by others beneath their station, yet God has pardoned them. The angels held him back from tearing all the veils, but the hand of grace took hold of him. A special messenger came and met with them at the time of their departure. They remain firm in the Cause, though outwardly they are afflicted. They have served the companions and prisoners to the extent possible, and have also sent something to the Most Holy Court. Glory be to God! Strange steadfastness was shown by the people of Iraq. Surely this has reached the blessed ears, especially concerning two Christians. Although these petitions have led to a lengthening of words, they were submitted for your honor’s information. And glory be upon you, and splendor be upon you.</p>

<p>O honored one, his eminence Afnan, the venerable Haji Mirza Buzurg, upon him be all the Glory of the Most Glorious - may he be encompassed by the most luminous glances.</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified beyond the mention and comprehension of all peoples, befitteth the Lord of Eternity, Who hath illumined the world through the effulgences of the Day-Star of His Most Great Name, and through countless proofs hath made manifest before the faces of all the Mighty News that was recorded and inscribed in the divine Books. The river of His all-merciful bounty hath flowed from the Pen of His Will, and the lights of the Sun of inner meanings have shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of His Purpose. A single revelation from the lights of the Sun of His knowledge, falling upon the Mount, caused Moses to be wonderstruck and enraptured, and guided him to the truth. And when a single ember from the fire of His love touched the Tree, the voice proclaiming “Verily, I am God” was raised therefrom. The Tongue of Grandeur hath in this station previously uttered these sublime verses:</p>
<p>O Baha’u’llah! Come forth from behind the veil</p>
<p>That from the West the sun might rise and sail</p>
<p>O Beauty of God! When Thy fire blazed bright</p>
<p>The harvest of lovers’ being burned in sight</p>
<p>One spark of fire cast upon souls divine</p>
<p>A thousand Trees of Sinai did shine</p>
<p>Glory be to God! Such proofs and evidences have been made manifest that man is utterly powerless to reckon them. Verses have been sent down and clear signs revealed; divine encompassment exists and heavenly power is visible; the ocean of knowledge surgeth and the sun of utterance shineth forth. Yet despite this, some among the peoples of the world remain hesitant, others turn away, some deny, and still others stand bewildered and perplexed. Nevertheless, the heedlessness, ignorance, denial and estrangement of the peoples of the world cannot prevent the penetration of the Most Sublime Word, nor can all the powers of the world compare with the might of the Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>When the Desired One of all worlds first arrived in the City of Peace, mention of no one was heard, as the might of oppression had left none remaining. Then one day, by God’s irresistible command, the trumpet blast was sounded. He said: “O servant, this is the meaning of the blessed verse which states ‘And the trumpet shall be blown a second time.’” And after this, these exalted words flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur - glorified be His majesty: “Say: O people of the world, know with absolute certainty that God’s Will encompasses all and His Purpose prevails. The opposition of the divines, the plotting of the jurisprudents, and the world’s might neither prevent Him nor hold back His power. Soon shall the banners proclaiming ‘Verily He is God’ and the standards declaring ‘Sovereignty belongs to God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting’ be raised in cities and lands. The buzzing of flies shall not hinder, nor shall it prevent the people from reaching the Lord of all humanity.” In those days no trace appeared from any quarter. The polytheists rejoiced, thinking they had annihilated the party of God, heedless that God’s protecting hand was preserving and safeguarding His Cause. Thereafter, by night and day, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke and the Most Exalted Pen moved, dispatching to all corners of the world that which gave life and bestowed light. Finally, all the kings of the earth were summoned, without veil or barrier, and commanded to that which He loves and is pleased with. Even now the heedless ones, some divines in their own estimation, write refutations and forbid people from the pulpits, unaware that soon the horizons of all lands shall be illumined with the light of the Luminary of His Revelation. Though now some have realized that extinguishing this light is impossible, for in every land and city the party of God exists. Alas, alas, how the heart burns to see how people, through their vain imaginings, have deprived themselves of eternal life and everlasting sustenance.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom and the Realm! Thou seest the burning of my heart and hearest my cry and lamentation at all times. I behold the ocean of Thy forgiveness, the heaven of Thy generosity, the sun of Thy grace, the stars of Thy favors, and the moons of Thy bounty and kindness. And I see the heedlessness of Thy servants, their remoteness from Thy court of nearness, their turning away from the heaven of Thy Revelation, and their denial of Thy proof and evidence. I beseech Thee, O God of the Seen and Unseen, and Educator of all existence, by the Dawning-Places of Thy revelation and the Manifestations of Thy Self, and by the Word whereby the hearts of Thy chosen ones were attracted and the hearts of Thy loved ones were set ablaze, to aid Thy servants to return unto Thee, to turn repentant to Thy gate, to humble themselves before the revelations of Thy grandeur, and to acknowledge the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance. O Lord! Thou seest their powerlessness, poverty, ignorance, weakness, and heedlessness in Thy days. I beseech Thee not to deprive them of the lights of the Sun of Thy pardon and the stars of the heaven of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. The clamor of men deterreth Thee not, nor doth the might of those who have disbelieved frighten Thee. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. Verily, Thou art the Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Thou seest, O God of all possibilities and Manifester of all beings, that this servant desires to make mention of Thy Afnan whom Thou hast related to Thyself and adorned with the ornament of distinction among Thy servants, though I acknowledge my incapacity and lack of qualification for this most exalted station and most glorious rank. I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou didst deliver Thy Prophets and chosen ones and preserved them from the evil of Thy servants and the tyranny of Thy creatures, to accept what hath proceeded from me and aid me to make mention of that which befitteth Thy days and beseemeth Thy Afnan. Verily, Thou art He by Whose command the Letter Kaf was joined with the Letter Nun, and all that exists appeared through Thy word “Be,” and it was.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice unto your arising, your service, your steadfastness and your remembrance! Your letter was like the spring breeze in the realm of meaning, refreshing heart, soul, body and limbs. It was a manifest glad-tiding and a brilliant herald. Its intimations conveyed spiritual joy and its words were the cause of victories, for each letter thereof was adorned with the praise and glorification of the Lord of the seen and unseen. After its perusal and reading, and the manifestation of joy and delight, We proceeded to the Most Holy Court and attained the honor of hearing these words from the presence of the Lord, exalted and sanctified be He: “O Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness.”</p>
<p>We spent the morning at the Mansion of Bahji. The honored Ism-i-Jud, upon him be My glory, offered hospitality which We accepted. From Bahji We proceeded to the garden with a group. Upon arrival, We summoned the attending servant with pen, paper and ink. After closing the door, We engaged in the mention of God, glorified be His majesty, and likewise mention of you flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Praise be to God, you have been quickened by the divine breeze and made fresh by the breathings of revelation.</p>
<p>The attending servant read before the Wronged One that which you addressed to God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne and the Possessor of the Exalted Seat. We heard your call and perceived from it the fragrance of your sincerity, detachment and orientation toward God and unto God. We have answered you with this clear Tablet and ordained for you what you desired from the depths of your Lord’s mercy, the Most Merciful. We have sent down for you that which has attracted the hearts of the Concourse on High, the Supreme Paradise, and those who have turned to the Face with such detachment as nothing in all creation could hinder. Verily your Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient. Give thanks to God for this supreme bounty. The Tree desired its branches. He is indeed possessed of great bounty. You turned to Him in the early days when all on earth turned away save a handful who were letters of the Face. Thus was it revealed before and in this exalted station which has attained the presence of its Lord and been overtaken by tranquility from Us–otherwise it would soar into the air from the intoxication of reunion. We have recounted this unto thee that thou mayest rejoice and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>O Afnan! The earth has been honored by the footsteps of the Lord of all beings, yet the people are in grave doubt. All things have been blessed by the mention of the Lord of Names, yet the various factions among the divines, mystics and jurists have been prevented from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of all worlds. We bear witness that you have spoken in your letter that which befits the Days of God and acknowledged therein that which the Speaker of Sinai uttered when He was established upon the throne of manifestation. We have aided thee, prospered thee, and reinforced thee with hosts of angels. He is verily the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Today the world–that is, humankind–is heedless. By the life of God! If they were to find even less than a needle’s eye of the divine fragrance, they would cast down the idols of fancy and imagination with the hand of certitude and, detached from all else, would arise to mention, praise and serve the Cause. Today the ocean of light is manifest, the Tree is speaking, and the Sun of bounty is shining and present. Blessed is the one who has not deprived himself of the outpourings of the All-Bountiful Lord nor remained bereft of the ocean of generosity. If thou shouldst observe one who has turned to the Cause, convey greetings from the Wronged One and give him the glad tidings of God’s grace and favor. The glory shining from the horizon of My Most Exalted Pen be upon thee!</p>
<p>Upon thee and upon those who are with thee and love thee and hearken unto thy words concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of the throne on high and of the earth below, and the Lord of the last and the first. His bounty hath no end and His favors are sanctified above enumeration and limitation. Every hearing ear hath testified and every seeing eye hath perceived. Nevertheless, the people remain sunk in the sleep of heedlessness, unaware and oblivious of this most great bounty. They have made the Cause of the Lord a plaything and a sport. Soon shall they behold the consequences of their vain lives, and they shall cry for help but none shall help them.</p>
<p>The supplication of your honor which was presented at the Most Holy Court - the Sun of favor hath dawned from the horizon of will in such wise that this servant is powerless and incapable to make mention of it. That which I had intended to present to your honor was transformed into these words: “Blessed be your honor and congratulations be unto your honor.” When mention was made of your greetings, glorification and praise in the Most Holy Presence of the Branches of the Blessed Tree - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - all of them expressed greetings, glorification and demonstrations of favor and love. And all those who circle round about send their greetings and glorification.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the manifestations of favor from the dwellers of the pavilion of infallibility are evident, and likewise the expressions of sincerity, humility and submissiveness of the loved ones of this land in service to your honor have been and continue to be beyond all measure and count, and each one presenteth greetings and glorification. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne.</p>

<p>He is the Glorious, the All-Glorious, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise that is sanctified beyond the comprehension of all created things and exalted above the understanding of all that can perceive befitteth the matchless King of Glory, Who hath ever been sanctified above the mention of aught else but Him and will forever remain exalted beyond the description of all save Himself. None hath ever ascended to the heaven of His praise as beseemeth Him, and no soul hath ever mounted to the heights of His description as is worthy of Him. From every attribute of His holy Oneness have infinite holy manifestations appeared, and from every expression of His glorious might have eternal lights shone forth. How lofty are the wondrous expressions of His sovereign might, before the faintest glimmer of which all that is in the heavens and earth hath been reduced to utter nothingness! And how exalted are the attributes of His all-pervading power, the most insignificant sign of which all creation, from beginning that hath no beginning to end that hath no end, hath been and will ever be powerless to know! The embodiments of His names wander thirsty in the valley of search, and the manifestations of His attributes cry out “Show me!” upon the mount of His sanctity. Through a wave from the ocean of His endless mercy, He hath adorned all created things with the ornament of existence, and through a breath from His peerless paradise, He hath honored all beings with the robe of His holy grace. Through an overflowing drop from the deep of the sea of His Sovereign Will, He hath brought infinite creation out of utter nothingness into the realm of being. The wondrous expressions of His bounty have never ceased, nor shall they ever cease, and the manifestations of His gracious favor have never been, nor shall they ever be, arrested. From the beginning that hath no beginning He hath created, and unto the end that hath no end He will continue to create. In every cycle and age, through the manifestations of His wondrous creation, He hath made all things new, that all in the heavens and earth might not be deprived of the wine of mercy from the celestial cup of His Oneness, whether they be signs in the horizons or holy manifestations in their own selves, and that they might not be left bereft of the outpourings of grace from the clouds of His loving-kindness.</p>
<p>How infinite the wonders of His boundless grace that have encompassed all creation, such that not a single atom exists in the visible kingdom but that it tells of the manifestations of His glorious Oneness, speaks in praise of His Self, and points to the lights of His Sun of Unity. He hath created His handiwork so complete and perfect that were all possessors of mind and heart to attempt to know even His lowliest creation as it truly is, they would find themselves utterly powerless and incapable - how much more so to know that Sun of glorious Reality and that Essence invisible to all! The recognition of the wise, the attainment of the eloquent, and the description of the articulate, all return and shall ever return to His creation. A hundred thousand Moseses swooned at the cry of “Thou shalt not see Me” on the mount of search, and a hundred thousand Holy Spirits in the heaven of nearness were troubled at hearing the words “Thou shalt not know Me.”</p>
<p>He hath ever dwelt in the sublime sanctity and transcendence of His holy Essence, and will forever abide in the exalted immunity and elevation of His own Being. Those who would ascend the heaven of knowing Him have reached no further than the habitation of wonderment, and those who would approach the sanctuary of His nearness and reunion have ventured no further than the valley of helplessness and longing. How bewildered is this worthless atom in the depths of the holy ocean of Thy knowledge, and how incapable of contemplating the power treasured within the manifestations of Thy handiwork!</p>
<p>If I say Thou canst be seen by the eye, how can the eye that cannot see itself behold Thee? If I say Thou canst be comprehended by the heart, how can the heart that hath not understood the stations of revelation within itself know Thee? If I say Thou art known, Thou hast ever been sanctified above the knowledge of all beings. If I say Thou art unknown, Thou art too manifest to remain unknown and unseen. Though the gates of union with Thee and the meeting of Thee have ever been open to the face of all contingent things, and the lights of Thy peerless Beauty have been established upon the thrones of existence, both seen and unseen - yet despite this greatest bounty and most perfect favor, I testify that the precinct of Thy holy glory hath been sanctified above the knowledge of all else, and the carpet of Thy mighty exaltation hath been and shall ever be above the comprehension of all besides Thee. Thou art known by Thine own Self and described by Thine own Being.</p>
<p>How many temples of Divine unity have lost their lives in the wilderness of separation and remoteness from Thee, and how many holy and eternal spirits have been bewildered in the desert of existence! Many lovers, despite their utmost search and yearning, have been consumed by the blazing flame of the fire of separation, and how many of the free have given their lives at the place of union with Thee! Neither do the sighs and lamentations of the lovers reach the precinct of Thy holiness, nor do the cries and wailings of the seekers and yearning ones attain the station of Thy nearness. And since the gates of recognition of and arrival at that Ancient Being were closed and forbidden, out of pure bounty and grace in every age and era He caused the sun of His favor to shine from the dayspring of generosity and grace upon all things, and chose that Beauty of Divine unity from among His creatures, distinguishing it with the robe of specialization for the purpose of Guidance, so that it might guide all […]</p>
<p>Here rises the Sun of Truth, that through the endless waters of divine bounty and the holy and matchless Kawthar He may cleanse all created things, even unto their atoms, from the defilement of negligence and desire, that they may enter the realm of the spirit, which is the station of everlasting holiness. He is the Primal Mirror, the Ancient Light, the Hidden Manifestation, the Perfect Word - the complete revelation and concealment of the King of Oneness. He has commanded all creation to obey Him, which is identical with obedience to God. The waves of the seas of Names surge forth at His bidding, and the manifestations of divine attributes shine forth at His command. The knowledge of all beings and the attributes of all things possible, from the beginning that has no beginning to the end that has no end, return unto this station. None can transcend or rise beyond this exalted station - the station of recognition and attainment unto that Sun of Oneness and Daystar of Truth - for it is clearly impossible to reach the Unknowable Essence. Thus do the waves of that hidden Ocean surge in this divine Manifestation, and the rays of that invisible Sun shine forth from the horizon of this holy and eternal Dawn without any intimation. He has established these Dawning-Places that have risen from the Morn of Oneness with such clear proof that none besides these holy Manifestations could produce the like thereof, leaving no room for rejection or objection. For divine proof and heavenly evidence would not be complete for human beings without clear proof and manifest evidence. However, the specific nature of that proof - whether revealed verses, apparent signs, or otherwise - has been and always will be dependent on the will of that King of Divine Will alone, and not contingent upon any other.</p>
<p>O ye who seek the holy and eternal atmosphere of divine nearness! With complete determination and perfect striving, beseech the King of Bounty and Sovereign of existence that He may not, through the surging waves of His grace and favor, deprive the thirsty ones of His endless Salsabil and matchless Tasnim. For all infinite stations of knowledge and the ultimate fruit of human existence is to reach this lofty and most exalted station and this glorious and most resplendent rank. Strive then to free yourselves from negation and its manifestations which today encompass the world, that ye may attain unto the root of the exalted and blessed Tree of Affirmation - for this is complete salvation and its essence, the reality of triumph and its beginning and end. Furthermore, that Sun of Unity and Sovereign of Reality must be recognized through the dawning rays of light that shine forth from that Essence of Oneness. For that Primal Being is self-subsistent and self-known, and His proof shines forth from His very Self. The proof of the sun is the light of the sun itself, which shines forth, rises, and illumines from the sun itself. Likewise, all servants are commanded to recognize that Sun of Oneness by His own Self. In this station, neither the rejection and turning away of the servants, nor their acceptance and drawing near, constitutes proof or evidence for anyone.</p>
<p>O thou who believest in God! In every Revelation, fix thy gaze upon the Revelation itself and upon the manifest expressions that proceed from it, lest thou stray from the divine path. Consider man, for instance: if thou knowest him by his own self, thou wilt recognize him in whatsoever garment he may appear. But if thou lookest only to his garment and raiment, then each time his garment is renewed thou wilt remain veiled from recognizing him and be debarred therefrom. Therefore, lift thy gaze above earthly limitations, worldly conditions, and the manifestations of names, and fix it upon the essence of Revelation itself, lest at the time of its appearance thou remain veiled from the Tree itself, and all thy deeds and actions become null and void, and thou turn from affirmation to denial while remaining unaware of it. God forbid! O people of the Bayan! Be watchful that ye may recognize the Revelation by itself and by what appeareth from it, not by aught else, for naught else will avail you, even if it be all who are in the heavens and on earth. This is the best counsel I give unto you, if ye be of them that accept it. Therefore, purify the eyes of both the seen and the unseen from turning toward aught save God, that ye may attain unto His Beauty in every Revelation and be blessed with His presence, which is identical with the presence of God. This is a truth which no utterance hath preceded and which no falsehood shall follow. It hath ever shone, and will continue to shine, like a resplendent lamp in the niche of words. How well is it with the soul that is illumined by the lights of this holy and eternal radiance! Well is it with them that comprehend.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>My spirit and soul be a sacrifice unto thee! The blessed letter, adorned with the ornament of love for the Beloved of all worlds, was perused by this evanescent servant. Praise be to God that in this Most Great Prison He gladdeneth us with the sweet fragrances of love wafting from the direction of them who are nigh unto the threshold of His oneness. God the One is my witness that at all times thy mention hath been and is upon my heart and tongue. That which indicated the well-being of your honor was the source of boundless joy, while that which was written regarding certain deeds of those who claim to love the Cause brought infinite sorrow. For thou knowest that unseemly acts have become the cause of veiling and have deprived most of humanity from the shores of oneness. In all His Tablets, the Exalted Truth hath called His loved ones to sanctity and detachment, and hath forbidden all from corruption, conflict, contention and the consumption of others’ wealth. Thus in one of His exalted Tablets He hath revealed - the meaning whereof in Persian is: “The people of Baha are those who, should they pass through cities of gold, would not deign to look thereon, and should all the women of the earth appear before them in their finest ornament and most wondrous beauty, they would not gaze upon them with lustful intent.” Thou thyself knowest how abundantly such themes have flowed from the Pen of the Lord of eternity. Yet despite this, as thou observest, they are not content with their vile and reprehensible deeds but occupy themselves with blocking the way. Strange it is that such souls should associate themselves with the Truth. We beseech God to aid all to do that which He loveth and which pleaseth Him, and to cause them to return unto Him, repentant, submissive, lowly, devoted and detached. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Likewise hath He commanded all to observe wisdom, yet most have failed to act accordingly. Had the loved ones of God acted in accordance with that which they were bidden, thou wouldst have witnessed all hearts turned toward the Qiblih of the worlds and all faces directed to the countenance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O Dhabih! In most of the divine Tablets there hath flowed from the Pen of God’s behest, and We have counseled all the loved ones of God, not to soil the hem of sanctity with forbidden deeds and reprehensible conduct. We have likewise counseled them to fix their gaze upon that which hath been revealed in the Tablets. Had they hearkened with the ear of the spirit to the divine counsels which have shone forth from the Dayspring of the Pen of the All-Merciful and had they given ear thereto, thou wouldst now behold most of the peoples of the world adorned with the robe of guidance. But what was decreed hath come to pass. Now once again doth the Tongue of Grandeur, in this Most Great Prison, upon this snow-white scroll proclaim: O loved ones of God! Hasten forth from the narrow wastes of self and passion unto the hallowed expanses of the Divine and take up your abode in the garden of sanctity and detachment, that the fragrance of your deeds may cause all creation to turn towards the shores of the glory of oneness. It is in no wise permissible to speak about worldly matters and whatsoever pertaineth thereunto, or about the leaders that govern them. God, exalted and glorified be He, hath bestowed the visible kingdom upon its rulers. It is not permissible for anyone to commit that which would be contrary to the views of the leaders of the realm. That which He hath desired for Himself are the cities of men’s hearts, and the loved ones of God are in this day as the keys thereto. Through the power of the Most Great Name they must all strive to unlock those gates. This is the divine assistance which hath been recorded in all the Scriptures and Tablets by the Pen that cleaveth the dawn. Moreover, they must associate with all people with the utmost kindliness and conduct themselves with perfect sanctity, detachment, truthfulness and fairness, in such wise that all people may regard them as the trustees of God amongst His servants. Now observe in what heaven the bird of God’s command doth soar, and in what realm those feeble souls do dwell. Blessed are they who, on the wings of certitude, have soared in the atmosphere which hath wafted from thy Lord, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>O Dhabih! Consider the doings of God and say: exalted, exalted is His power that hath encompassed the worlds; exalted, exalted is His detachment that hath transcended all created things; exalted, exalted is His martyrdom which hath set ablaze the hearts of them that are nigh unto Him. Though afflicted with countless tribulations at the hands of Our enemies, We have proclaimed unto all the rulers of the earth, one after another, that which His Will had purposed, that all nations might know that no affliction can hinder the Pen of the Ancient of Days. Verily, it moveth by the leave of God, the Fashioner of all bones that have crumbled to dust. Now, given this supreme occupation, it behooveth all the loved ones to gird up the loins of endeavor and turn their attention to the triumph of God’s Cause, rather than engage in reprehensible deeds. Wert thou to observe but slightly the manifest actions and deeds of the Truth, thou wouldst surely fall upon thy face in the dust and say: O Lord of Lords! I testify that Thou art the Master of existence and the Educator of both the seen and the unseen. I testify that Thy power hath encompassed all created things, that the hosts of the earth cannot frighten Thee, nor can the might of its peoples hinder Thee. And I testify that Thou hast desired naught save the life of the world, the unity of its peoples, and the salvation of all that dwell therein.</p>
<p>Consider carefully what station the friends of God must move in, and in what atmosphere they must soar. I beseech God, thy Lord, the All-Merciful, at all times, to aid them to achieve what He desires. He is verily the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Knowing. O Dhabih! The harm to this Wronged One has not been and is not from imprisonment, plunder, captivity, martyrdom and outward abasement. Rather, the harm lies in the deeds which the loved ones of God commit and attribute to Him. This is My harm, by His Self that dominates the worlds! And another greatest harm is that each day someone from among the people of the Bayan claims the Cause, some clinging to one of the Branches, and some independently saying what they have said and doing what they do. O Dhabih! The Tongue of Grandeur proclaims: By My Self, the Truth! All Revelations have ended with this Most Great Revelation, and whoever claims after it is indeed a lying impostor. We beseech God to guide him to recant; if he repents, He is verily the Forgiver, and if he persists in what he claims, He will send against him one who will show no mercy. He is verily the Mighty, the Powerful. Observe how the people of the Bayan have not understood that whatever My Herald and the Herald of My Beauty uttered was in anticipation of this Revelation and its establishment of the Cause. Otherwise, by His True Self, they would not utter a single word of what He revealed. These ignorant ones have regarded the Cause of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High as child’s play. Each day they move according to some fancy and wander in some wilderness. Were the Cause as they claim, how could thy Lord’s Cause be established upon the throne of tranquility? Reflect and be of the discerning ones. Reflect and be of those who perceive. Reflect and be of the steadfast ones. Reflect and be of the assured ones, to such degree that should all humanity make every possible claim or beyond it, thou wouldst not turn to them but would leave them behind thee, advancing toward the Qiblih of all worlds. By My life! The Cause is mighty, mighty, and the Day is mighty, mighty. Blessed is he who hath cast the world behind him, turning toward the countenance of Him through Whose light the heavens and earth were illumined. O Dhabih! A penetrating vision is needed, and a steadfast heart, and legs of brass, lest one slip through the whisperings of the hosts of self. This is the firm decree which hath been sent down through the pen of the Most Great Name by the will of the Ancient King. Preserve it as thou wouldst preserve thine eye, and be of the thankful ones. By day and by night occupy thyself with the service of God, detached from all else. By My life! Whatever thou seest today shall pass away, and thou shalt find thyself in the most exalted station if thou remainest steadfast in what thy Lord hath commanded thee. Unto Him is thy return and thy abode. Here end the words of God.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou hadst written about the trials and tribulations that had befallen thee, it produced in me, on the one hand, grief beyond endurance, and on the other, boundless joy. The grief was due to the fact that, outwardly, diverse afflictions and manifold trials had descended upon thee. The joy was because this servant knoweth with certainty that ere long the heedless, sleeping souls shall, after becoming conscious and awakening, all make mention of thy name and shall wail and weep for what befell thee, though now they perceive it not. Moreover, in tribulation and hardship and trials thou hast been a partner with the Truth, and hast borne all difficulties for the Cause of God. I swear by the Truth, this is a station whose description can never be exhausted by the pen nor concluded by speech. We beseech God to make thee hold fast unto Him, to be detached from all else save Him, and to speak forth His remembrance and praise amongst His servants.</p>
<p>As for what thou hadst written about thy distress, it is evident - property plundered and thy person afflicted with hardships and trials. I beseech God to assist thee in all conditions. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Some time ago, fifty tumans were transferred. The draft and letter of this servant were, by the Most Holy Command, written to the known person and given to Husayn of the people of Ya, that he might give it to that person to deliver to thee. God willing, it will reach thee. May thy honor be ever engaged in the service of the Truth. The rectification of all matters, both outward and inward, hath been and shall be through this Most Great Cause. May my spirit be a sacrifice for thy sorrow and trials and exile.</p>
<p>The Tablet which thou hadst mentioned specifically for Andalib, upon him be the Glory of God, hath been revealed from the Dawning-Place of Revelation and sent. Perfect bounty concerning him is shining and radiant from the horizon of the Sun of Eternity. Blessed is he, and again, joy be unto him. If thou seest him, convey the greetings of this evanescent one unto him. We beseech God to preserve him and make him steadfast in His Cause. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Verily, the Glory be upon thee, then Remembrance be upon thee, then the Spirit be upon thee and upon those whom God hath related to thy presence.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath manifested and revealed that which was hidden in knowledge and concealed from eyes and vision. Glorified be He Who hath caused all things to speak His praise and glorification, and Who hath summoned all to the Most Exalted Horizon wherefrom the call hath been raised: “The Kingdom and the Dominion, the Majesty and the Power belong unto God, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Choosing!”</p>
<p>O peoples of the earth! By God, the Day hath come, yet the people remain in doubt and conflict. They have cast the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to their vain imaginings and idle fancies. This is the Day whereon He Who conversed with God hath been established upon the throne of Revelation, and the Herald hath cried out from the right hand of the luminous Spot: “God, there is none other God but Him. His are the grace and bounty, the remembrance and the glory. He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the Single One, the One, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.”</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Sadiq! Thy letter hath reached the Wronged One and hath been honored to be seen and heard. We have detected therefrom the fragrance of humility, submissiveness, and devotion to God, the Revealer of verses and the Manifester of clear proofs. We have sent down for thee from the heaven of utterance that which hath enraptured the hearts of the righteous. Say: O concourse of men! By God, the Greatest Scene hath been adorned through the appearance of the Lord of Destiny, and the Dove of Knowledge hath warbled upon the highest branches. Rejoice, O peoples of the worlds, for the Promise hath appeared and the Promised One speaketh before all faces with a sovereignty that hath conquered all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>We make mention at this hour of thy father who hath ascended to the station God ordained for him. We beseech Him, exalted be He, by the ocean of His forgiveness, the heaven of His grace, and the sun of His mercy which hath preceded all created things, to send down upon him a heavenly feast and a blessing from His presence, and to cause him to enter the Most Exalted Paradise. Verily, He is the Bestower, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We have purified him at the time of his ascension from the world’s defilement and forgiven him through Our grace, for We are the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.</p>
<p>O thou who gazeth upon the Countenance! This is the Day of God, the Cause is God’s Cause, and the Revelation is God’s Revelation, the like of which the eye of creation hath never beheld. To this beareth witness the Mother Book in the most exalted station. Hold fast unto the cord of wisdom and speak forth the praise of God, the Lord of lords. He shall reinforce thee with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, and shall manifest through thee that which shall cause all to cry out with the loudest voice: “O peoples of earth and heaven! By God, the gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of the Kingdom of Names hath come with power and sovereignty!”</p>
<p>Beware lest your desires prevent you, or the hosts of earth frighten you, or the ranks of the wicked weaken you. We have borne all hardships and tribulations in this Cause, whereby the limbs of all names have trembled and the hearts of every heedless doubter have been disturbed. Take the reins of affairs in the name of thy Lord, then speak that whereby every silent one shall speak, every still one shall move, and every prostrate one shall arise, by the command of God, the Lord of all directions.</p>
<p>Say: This is the Day whereof the Apostle of God gave glad-tidings, and before Him the Spirit, and before Him He Who conversed with God, and before them the Messengers of God, the Lord of the Day of Return. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee, that thou mayest give thanks to thy Lord Who hath come from the heaven of proof with the standards of wisdom and utterance. We have desired at this time to change the eloquent language into the luminous language, by the command of God, the Lord of creation.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Sadiq! Upon thee be My Glory and My Loving-kindness. All the divine Books, both of the past and of the future, proclaim and herald this Most Mighty, Most Holy Revelation. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto that which hath been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets. In truth I say, great is this Day. In the Tablet of the world, this exalted Word was revealed: “The Most Great News proclaimeth: O people of Persia! Ye have been the dawning-places of mercy and the daysprings of compassion and love. The realms of existence have been illumined and adorned with the light of your knowledge and wisdom. How is it that ye have arisen to destroy yourselves and your friends with your own hands?”</p>
<p>O Afnan and My loved ones! Upon you be My Glory and My Loving-kindness. The tabernacle of the Cause of God is mighty. It hath encompassed and will continue to encompass all the peoples of the world. Your day is now, and a thousand tablets bear witness. Arise to help His Cause and busy yourselves in conquering the hearts and souls of the peoples of the world through the hosts of utterance. From you must appear that which will ensure the comfort and tranquility of the downtrodden. Gird up the loins of endeavor, that perchance the servants may be freed from bondage and attain unto liberty. Today the lamentation of justice is raised, and the cry of equity is heard. The dark smoke of oppression hath enveloped all peoples and nations. Through the movement of the Supreme Pen, a fresh spirit of meaning hath been breathed, by the command of the True Commander, into the bodies of words, and its effects are manifest and evident in all things of the world. This is the Most Great Glad-tidings that hath flowed from the Pen of this Wronged One. We beseech God to aid and not to deprive His servants of the fragrances of His days.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! He Who is the Lord of all religions hath appeared with a Cause before which no cause can stand, and with a sovereignty that no earthly forces can weaken. He Who hath with Him the Mother Book beareth witness unto this. Say: Verily, He is with you and heareth your utterances. With Him is the knowledge of all things preserved in a Manifest Tablet. Say: Behold, then judge with equity that which hath appeared from Him. He guideth you unto His Straight Path. Purify your hearts with the Kawthar of God’s utterance, the Lord of all worlds. Nothing escapeth His knowledge. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in the kingdom of utterance, and that which was hidden and treasured in God’s knowledge, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, hath been revealed. And We have desired to mention at this time thy daughter, as a grace from God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. O My handmaiden! Take the chalice of utterance in My Name and drink therefrom, despite every people that hath been heedless and turned away from God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Blessed art thou for having attained unto My call and for having had thy name flow from My Most Exalted Pen, whereby God quickeneth His servants and handmaidens and remembereth them in His wondrous Book. We make mention of thy sister as a mercy from God, the Mighty, the Great, and We give her glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for her from the Ancient Commander. We make mention of him who is named ’Ali-Akbar and We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to preserve him through His hosts, to draw him nigh unto Him, and cause him to speak His beautiful praise.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! When thou hast heard and drunk the choice wine of revelation from the hand of My bounty, say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! All praise be unto Thee for having remembered me in Thy Most Great Prison, and all thanksgiving be unto Thee for having guided me unto Thy Most Straight Path. I beseech Thee by the light of Thy Cause and the fire of Thy Lote-Tree to aid me in the service of Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Hasan! Upon thee be My Baha! We have turned unto thee at this hour and revealed for thee that which hath diffused the fragrance of the All-Merciful throughout all creation, that thou mayest rejoice and be of the thankful ones. Grieve not over the world and its vicissitudes. Turn with thy heart unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Verily He preserveth His loved ones and remembereth them in that whereby their names shall endure throughout the perpetuity of His firm and wise Cause. The splendor that shineth from the horizon of My loving-kindness be upon you, O My loved ones, and upon those who are with you and have believed in God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the Bestower, the Generous.</p>
<p>We have desired to make mention of him whom thou didst mention, who was named Abu-Talib, that he may be assured that He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, through His mighty and great Name.</p>
<p>O Abu-Talib! The Wronged One hath turned unto thee from the precincts of the Prison and revealed for thee that which hath caused the hearts of them that are nigh to soar. When thou perceivest the fragrance of My utterance, say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me unto Thy path and made known to me Thy way. I beseech Thee by Thy Name which Thou hast made the sovereign of all names, and by Thy Command which hath encompassed all things, to ordain for me that which shall make me steadfast in Thy love and eloquent in Thy remembrance. Verily, Thou art God, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And I beseech Thee by that which lieth with Thee to protect me and my family from the croaking of those who have denied Thy proof and Thy testimony, who have disputed Thy signs and cast aside Thy laws. Verily, Thou art the Strong, the All-Conquering, the Almighty.”</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who was named Nasru’llah and counsel him with that which shall exalt his station in this resplendent and luminous spot. We have mentioned thee before, and thy father who hath ascended unto the Supreme Companion, with verses that all the treasures of the heavens and earth cannot equal. O Nasru’llah! God hath come with manifest sovereignty. Beware lest the doubts of the ignorant prevent thee from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds. We testify that thy father attained unto that which most of the servants have not attained in the presence of thy Lord. All things are recorded in a mighty tablet. We were with him at the time of his ascension, and We cleansed him with the ocean of Our forgiveness, which hath encompassed those who have drawn nigh and those who are near. Be thou steadfast in the Cause and hold fast unto His firm cord.</p>
<p>Thou shouldst at all times fix thy gaze upon the Truth and remain firm on His path. The world hath neither permanence nor faithfulness. We beseech God, exalted be He, to ordain for thee that which shall cause thee to be enkindled with the fire of His love and illumined by the lights of His countenance. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Generous. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon thy family and those with thee who have drunk the choice wine of steadfastness from the hand of the bounty of God, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention regarding His Holiness Anis, upon him be the light of God and His glory and His might and His praise, the Truth, in which there is no doubt, beareth witness. We testify that he aided the Cause of God throughout the nights and days and guided the people unto the straight path. Upon him be My light and My glory, and upon the dear one who cast aside idle fancies and took hold of the Book of God with such power as was not weakened by the hosts of the heedless. O Nasru’llah! Thy mention hath been made before the Wronged One. We beseech God to aid thee to be steadfast. By the Sun of Truth which shineth from the horizon of the heaven of the Prison, the station of steadfastness is great and mighty in the sight of God. Blessed is the servant who holdeth fast unto it, and woe unto him who turneth away therefrom. Say:</p>
<p>“Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and adorned my temple with the ornament of Thy love. I beseech Thee by Thy signs and their mysteries, and by the Sun of Thy Name and its lights, to ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.”</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Muhammad-Taqi, who hath attained unto My remembrance and My traces and My Tablet wherefrom hath shone forth from its horizon the luminary of My loving-kindness. We beseech God to assist him to serve His loved ones and to make mention of His chosen ones, and to show humility at the mention of His Name, the Mighty, the Luminous. Verily he hath attained, time after time, as doth the Mother Book testify in this exalted station.</p>

<p>Praise be befitting unto our Beloved, Who hath been from everlasting and will continue unto everlasting. Every bearer of a name taketh pride in His Name, and every possessor of glory becometh renowned through His mention. Through His all-encompassing mercy and His pre-existent grace, He hath manifested Himself and shone forth upon all the worlds with the light of His countenance, and hath spoken forth the blessed word: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” He is the One All-Knowing, the Sovereign Who doeth what He willeth. He is the Goal of all worlds and the Beloved of all mankind. Blessed are they who have attained unto the hearing of His call and have turned toward His horizon. These are the servants whose stations and attributes have been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Qur’an and in all former Books. These are they whom fear seizeth not in the path of God, nor are they touched by grief. These are they whom neither the denunciations of the enemy nor the mockery of the ignorant could hold back from the Most Exalted Horizon, and whom neither the hints of the peoples nor worldly conditions could debar from steadfastness in the Cause of the Lord of Names. These are the pearls of the ocean of steadfastness and the gems of existence. Upon them be the glory of God and the glory of all who are in the kingdom of creation. I beseech God to ever adorn these souls with the ornament of steadfastness, for none save God Himself possesseth the Most Great Infallibility. I ask of and implore God to preserve these servants beneath the canopy of His grace and to strengthen them to be steadfast in all conditions. He is the Powerful One Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate. Verily, He is the Single, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>And furthermore, the servant hath been blessed with hearkening to the melody of thy pen which was raised up in the remembrance of God, our Beloved and your Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and the earth. Praise be to God, time and again, repeatedly! This servant hath been favored with the correspondence of that spiritual friend, and after perusal it was laid before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. This is what the Tongue of Revelation hath sent down as a token of His grace upon thee. His words, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>“O Kamal! The Kingdom of utterance is at all times shining forth and manifesting itself in such wise that no likeness or parallel hath been or shall ever be seen for it. The melody of the Supreme Pen hath ever been raised, and the Speaker of Sinai is speaking. Blessed is the state of the one who hath hearkened and who hath arisen with complete steadfastness to serve the Cause of the Lord of all beings.</p>
<p>“We have illumined the darkened world with the lamp of divine favor, yet treacherous souls have shunned this light that their unseemly deeds might remain concealed. We have caused the lights of the Countenance to shine forth from the horizon of will, yet the blind remained deprived thereof. We have made manifest the Ocean of Life at the pole of contingent being and guided all unto it, such that the Lord of Eternity and the Most Great Name did with His blessed tongue utter the words ‘Hasten! Hasten!’ Yet souls weighed down with heavy burdens were prevented from drawing nigh unto it.</p>
<p>“O Kamal! The Wronged One of the horizons hath borne all tribulations and exalted the Cause of God with such strength and power that every fair-minded one hath been amazed thereby and hath exclaimed ‘This is naught but a mighty grace!’ Nevertheless, the people of the Bayan, clinging to that which profiteth them not, have remained deprived of the Countenance of Divine Unity and barred from God’s all-embracing Word. They have contented themselves with croaking and have turned away from the melody of the Supreme Pen.</p>
<p>“Reflect upon the essence of the Bayan which hath flowed from the Pen of the Herald. He saith: ‘I have written an essence concerning His remembrance, which is that He shall not be known through My allusions nor through what hath been revealed in the Bayan.’ In truth, this blessed word is the essence and spirit of the Bayan, by the testimony of the Primal Point. Nevertheless, the people of the Bayan have remained deprived of the Source and the Manifestation, while seeking to establish their own faith through the utterances of the Primal Point. We bear witness that He testifieth to their unbelief, their hypocrisy, their turning away, and their heedlessness. Say: O ye unbelievers! I worship not that which ye worship.</p>
<p>“Him Whom the Point of the Bayan hath described as being sanctified above His allusions and what was revealed in the Bayan - from Him have they turned away, while still counting themselves among the people of the Bayan. O Kamal! The Day is the Day of God. Blessed is the soul that hath become detached and free from all else but Him. Such a one is of the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark. To this beareth witness the Lord of Names in this luminous station.</p>
<p>“We have revealed unto thee that which will gladden thy heart, and We have sent it to thee that thou mayest read and be of the thankful ones. And from this station We send Our greetings upon the faces of My loved ones who have soared in the atmosphere of My love, who have arisen to serve My Cause, and who have spoken forth My beauteous remembrance.”</p>
<p>God willing, may all be blessed by divine favor. All assured and sanctified souls have been mentioned by the Divine Pen and recorded in the Book. Blessed are they, then blessed are they! Give unto all the glad-tidings of God’s special favors and make them joyous. Today […]</p>
<p>O My loved ones! Rejoice in My Name and hold fast to My firm cord. All praise be unto God, the Lord of all worlds! From this utterance of the True One, exalted be His glory, the stations of grace and favor bestowed upon that beloved one and the friends of God become evident. Every fair-minded person stands amazed at what they witness of the greatness of divine bounty, generosity, grace and favor. All the names that were in your letter were presented before the Throne, and for each one a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed and sent. God willing, they will attain unto them, and the friends will become so enkindled with the heat of divine love that its effects will become manifest. However, in all matters wisdom must be observed, lest anything arise from which the odor of corruption might be detected. The people are weak, and God, exalted be His grandeur, is generous. The sword of forbearance and patience is sharper than the sword of violence and wrath. Blessed is he who holds fast to that which is befitting, for he is accounted among the helpers of God, our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Praise be to God, Tablets wondrous and sublime were revealed specifically for Nabil-i-Qa’ini and he of the name Javad, upon them be the glory of God, and likewise for those souls who were mentioned in their letters. Out of wisdom, one package was sent to the Land of Qaf for delivery, and one to Hadba. God willing, they will arrive and they will attain unto them.</p>
<p>Further to this, after your letters addressed to this servant were presented in the Most Holy Court, three names were mentioned on the back of one letter. After these were presented, these verses were revealed from the Kingdom of God’s grace - exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>He is the Witness, the All-Hearing</p>
<p>O Muhammad! The Wronged One makes mention of thee with that which will draw thee near unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Forsake the world and hold fast unto the Most Great Name, which hath come from the heaven of utterance with manifest sovereignty. None should grieve over the world and what appeareth therein. Thus doth mention flow from His presence in a preserved Book. O My loved ones! Rejoice in My Name, then help your Lord, the All-Merciful, through wisdom and utterance. Thus hath the matter been decreed, but the people do not understand. Glory be upon the people of Baha who have remained faithful to God’s Covenant, the Lord of the seen and unseen.</p>
<p>He is the Most Mighty, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>A mention from the presence of the Glory unto him who hath turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon, that the breaths of remembrance may attract him to a station wherein he shall behold naught in creation save the effulgences of the light of his Lord’s countenance, the All-Bountiful. This is a day wherein that which the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur’an hath been made manifest through His words: “All things shall perish save His luminous Face.” O Muhammad-i-Taqi! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee from this spot round which circle all great names. Hold fast unto the Sure Handle and cleave unto the hem of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We have made mention of those who have turned unto God and We mention them as a grace from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bounteous, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>He is the Most Great, the Most Ancient, the Most Glorious […]</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabel-Rida! The world shall pass away, and sovereignty will remain with God, the Lord of all men. Where is the clashing of the swords of enemies? Where is the neighing of the steeds of the mighty? Where are the gardens of princes? Where are the pavilions of the great? Where are their ranks and their armies? Where are their palaces and their affairs? By God’s life, they now dwell in their graves, yet people remain heedless of what appeared in former ages. Thus have they been prevented from what hath been revealed by God, the Lord of Lords. Blessed is he who pondereth the evidences of God’s power and holdeth fast to what hath been sent down in the Book. Glory be unto the people of Baha who have held fast to the cord of certitude and cast behind them all idle fancies and vain imaginings.</p>
<p>Such is the grace of this station that for each name that was mentioned in the presence of His countenance, whether living or dead, there hath been revealed from the heaven of God’s Will a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet.</p>
<p>Who can with tongue or pen</p>
<p>Give due thanks for His blessings?</p>
<p>May the spirit of the world be a sacrifice for His grace! God willing, may the friends of Truth at all times reflect and arise with perfect steadfastness to serve His Cause. At this time numerous exalted Tablets have been revealed specifically for your honor, including one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet specifically for Jinab-i-Nur, upon him be the Glory of God, and likewise specifically for Varaqih-Ahl, upon her be the Glory of God, and mention was also made from the Blessed Tongue of the two sister leaves, upon them be the Glory of God. May they, God willing, attain divine favors and drink cup after cup from the ocean of love. Verily, she who attained His presence - We have mentioned her in the Scriptures and Tablets. God willing, may they dwell at rest beneath the shade of the divine Tree of Providence. O Kamal! Convey My greetings to them both and give them glad tidings of My mercy that hath preceded all created things.</p>
<p>Another matter: It would be most beloved if you would make copies of whatever reacheth those parts and review them with utmost care, sending them to certain souls scattered throughout the villages, that the sweet fragrances of the utterance of the Most Merciful may at all times be diffused among the loved ones.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to each of the friends of God who have drunk of the sealed wine and who gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon, this evanescent servant offers mention of evanescence and nothingness. May they, God willing, be sustained at all times by the fruits of the divine Tree of Providence. Likewise, this evanescent servant conveyeth most wondrous, most exalted, most glorious greetings to each and every one of those related to that beloved one. Glory be upon you and upon those with you, and upon those who have attained unto the Most Great Steadfastness in this Most Great, Most Mighty Cause.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>The remembrance of God unto His servant who hath been named Mahdi, that he may give thanks unto his Lord and be well-pleasing unto God. O servant! Hearken unto the call of God from this Servant Who hath been named by all names in the Kingdom of Names. And when thou ascendest beyond this station, thou shalt behold Him sanctified above all that the Daysprings of Names and Attributes have known. And when thou ascendest beyond this station and passeth on to another station, thou shalt be unable to establish for Him any mention or deny from Him any description, for in that station eyes shall not attain unto Him, thoughts shall not reach Him, minds and visions shall not comprehend Him. Thus hath the matter been decreed.</p>
<p>Cast aside what the people possess, then hold fast unto this Cord suspended between earth and heaven, in such wise that should men cut thee to pieces, thou wouldst not be severed from it nor be separated from it. Thus do We command thee in truth, and this is better for thee than all who dwell on earth. Dost thou find in existence aught greater than the knowledge of God and steadfastness in His love? Nay, by Him Who hath caused all created things to speak forth the praise of My Self, which hath encompassed the worlds!</p>
<p>Turn thy face toward God and detach thyself from those who at times speak as spoke the divines of the Qur’an, and at times speak as spoke the people of the Gospel, then the people of the Torah, and thus have they veiled themselves behind the veils of allusions. Among them are those who say: “Can sweetness be changed for bitterness, or the ruby for a stone, or gold for copper?” Thus do they speak, being unaware less than a hair’s breadth. And among them are those who say: “How can light be changed for darkness?” Thus and likewise do they speak, being unaware. These are in the sight of thy Lord this day more contemptible than donkeys.</p>
<p>Say: O ye who are as red ochre! Do ye not witness that when ye place a mirror before the sun, the form of the sun is reflected therein, and when ye place it before a dog, that too is reflected therein? Thus observe how the matter stands regarding all that faces it, that ye may be steadfast in the religion of God. For example, when any mirror among the mirrors of existence faces this Sun that hath been established upon the throne of names and attributes, the effulgences of this Sun are reflected therein according to its capacity. Then do all created things speak forth the praise of their own selves, for they behold naught therein save the revelation of their Lord and Creator. Were people to observe with the eye of their innate nature, they would recognize that this attribute of things is not of themselves, but rather due to the revelation that hath revealed itself unto them through their own selves. Thus have We detailed the verses that ye may be endowed with insight into the matter.</p>
<p>However, this station and these attributes hold true so long as one beholds therein the revelation of one’s Lord. Should it turn away from the Sun and face the wolf of self and desire, then doth the light return to its source, and the mirror reverteth to a station wherein naught can be seen therein save the wolf. Thus hath the decree been sent down from the heaven of wisdom, that people might find a way to the Lord of grace.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Observe the people and their condition. After the Sun hath shone forth with such brightness that all who are in the unseen and visible realms have been illumined thereby, they have clung to a mere shadow and have opposed God, and thou seest them now standing upon the brink of a fiery precipice, having halted in sheer heedlessness without the Truth. And among them is he who saith that such and such […]</p>
<p>And among them is one who claims to be a mirror after he warred against Him Who created and fashioned him, and caused all things to speak in praise of His Self - thus was the matter inscribed by the Finger of the Spirit in truth. Say: O people, reflect upon yourselves and be not of those who have deviated from justice and fairness and taken for themselves the path to the calf. Look at the peoples of the Furqan - they spoke about succession and guardianship after one thousand two hundred and sixty years just as you speak now, and God is witness to this. Did what they possessed of successorship or guardianship benefit them? No, by the All-Merciful! Rather, they and their followers were created by the command of God Who created all contingent beings with a word from Him, and verily He has power over all things.</p>
<p>O servant! Inform My servants. Say: By God, you have not understood the foundation of this Cause. Hearken to My words, and nullify not your deeds, and be not like the peoples of old. Fear God and be pious in the Cause, and dispute not with Him by Whose command the Prophets and Messengers were sent from a beginning that has no beginning - how much less those beneath them! Reflect, O people, on God’s Cause and its manifestation, and follow not every stubborn polytheist.</p>
<p>Say: Today there is no difference with God between you and him whom you have taken as lord for yourselves besides God. Rather, he is more base in station and further astray in path, for he warred against Him Who created him by His word and sought to cut down the Tree that was planted by God’s hands in the loftiest paradise. Then he raised an outcry within himself to confuse the matter for those who believed in God, and thus did he plot in God’s Cause and was recorded with God as among the plotters.</p>
<p>Say: O people, open your eyes, then behold the Beauty at the midmost point of the zenith and turn towards Him, and follow not every rebellious satan. Does it not suffice you that We have manifested unto you Our true Self with complete manifestation and concealment? Fear God Who created and fashioned you, and deny not the blessing for which you shall never find a substitute.</p>
<p>Leave the people and what they possess - today you shall see them only as dead, not living, save those who hold fast to this Handle that has neither disconnection nor connection, neither severance nor qualification, if you be of those who know. Say: By God, were We to take from the yarn with which children play and make it the Handle of the Cause between the heavens and earth, We would be able to do so by My sovereignty which encompasses the worlds. And were We to take a handful of clay and resurrect from it the forms of the first and the last, and then those near ones and the sincere ones, We would be able - thus was the matter. But the people are wrapped in thick veils.</p>
<p>Say: O people, by God the Most Great Mystery of God has appeared, and the Most Great Treasure of God, and the Most Perfect Word of God, and the Most Bountiful Sea of God. Beware lest you deprive yourselves of the bounty of these days and be not in doubt concerning this Manifestation which has encompassed all created things and from which appears at every moment that which appeared not before. And if you deny it, O heedless ones, by God the Truth, all atoms testify to it, and this Tongue which speaks in all things that ‘I am the Worshipped […]’</p>
<p>Verily I am the One adored, and verily I am the Intended One, and verily I am the Beloved, and verily I am He Who, by the movement of My finger, hath joined the Kaf to the Nun, and thus was the matter decreed by the finger of divine decree upon the preserved tablet. O Mahdi! Be thou guided by the guidance of God, thy Lord, then guide mankind unto this Most Great Ocean which God hath caused to surge by His Own Self and for His Own Self, and hath sanctified its shores from the approach of every obstinate polytheist. Say: O people, fear ye God! By God, the Truth! Were ye to be truly conscious, ye would sever your own necks with your own hands, or cast yourselves into the waters, or fling your bodies from the mountains, for ye have committed that which hath caused tears to flow from the All-Seeing Eye of God that beholdeth all things. Thus have ye acted according to the dictates of your souls and your desires, and yet ye rejoice within yourselves and are glad. Arise thou with the Cause of God and His permission, then convey unto the people the command of thy Lord, and be not of them who have been patient and have veiled their faces through fear of their own selves. Thus have We commanded thee in truth that thou mayest be informed thereof. Beware that thou disputest not with anyone; rather, remind them with wisdom and utterance. Then guard thyself to such degree that no harm may befall thee, not in such wise as to be veiled from God’s Cause and deprived of the wonders of His manifestation. Purify thine ear that thou mayest hear the divine melodies wherewith the Dove of the Spirit warbleth upon the branches of these Words, each letter of which God hath made a lofty and impregnable Tree. Stand thou firm with the firmness of God and leave the people and what they possess unto themselves, then shun them who follow their lusts and commit transgression and wickedness. By God! We are quit of such as these, if thou be well informed thereof. Say: O people! Strive ye that My traces may be manifest from you and that My fragrances and My sweet savors may waft from you. Guard yourselves against whatsoever is abhorrent unto God’s good-pleasure and your good-pleasure. Fear ye God and be ye purified from disobedience that ye may speak of the beauty of My name, the All-Merciful, and may become a sign among all created things through this Cause which hath dawned from the horizon of holy and luminous glory. O servant! Hearken unto the call of this Wronged One Who is imprisoned in this Most Great Prison. Then detach thyself from them who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, and ascend unto the atmosphere of nearness and holiness and glory and beauty, that thou mayest attain unto the station wherein shine forth the lights of thy Lord’s countenance, the Mighty, the Most High, and mayest witness all created things beneath the shade of thy Lord Who hath appeared with the sovereignty of majesty and hath dawned at the midmost heart of eternity, and mayest be possessed of clear vision. Cast aside them from whom thou hearest naught but the stench of unbelief and who have turned away from Him through Whose will all created things were raised up, who are heedless of God their Creator yet fancy themselves believers. Say: Woe unto you, O concourse of loss! By God! Your deeds have come to naught from the moment ye paused upon this Path which was raised up by the hands of the All-Merciful in the heaven of His Cause. Thus have We caused to flow forth for thee from these Words the Kawthar of knowledge and inner meanings, that thou mayest drink thereof and sprinkle it upon all created things through the power of My Name which encompasseth the worlds. Rejoice within thyself that the glances of God have been directed toward thee from this Prison, and glorify Him with such glorification as shall turn the hearts of all created things toward a face of wondrous glory […]</p>
<p>If thou desirest to grieve over anything, grieve over My tribulations, then over My afflictions and sorrows and exile and imprisonment. Thus doth the Most Great Pen command thee. Act according to what thou art bidden, and tarry not for even a moment. And the light that hath shone forth from the right side of the [Throne] be upon thee and upon those who have followed the command of God and have not transgressed the bounds that have been sent down in the Tablets from a mighty and inaccessible Pen.</p>

<p>O Hussein, upon thee be the Glory of God! He is God, exalted be His station in wisdom and utterance!</p>
<p>This is a mention from Us to one who hath turned unto God, the Lord of all worlds, and who arose to serve the Cause when the Wronged One was confined in the Most Great Prison through that which the hands of the oppressors had wrought. O Hussein! Hearken unto the call raised between earth and heaven from God, the Lord of Names. Verily, He is God; there is none other God but Him, the Single, the All-Informed. Blessed are My loved ones there; verily We perceive from them the fragrance of My love. We beseech God to strengthen them, to aid them with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, and to ordain for them the good of this world and the world to come. Verily, He is the Lord of humanity and the Possessor of this exalted station.</p>
<p>Convey that which My Most Exalted Pen hath uttered and remind them of that which hath been sent down unto them from the heaven of the bounty of their Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Generous. We have heard thy call and have answered thee through this Clear Book, and We had previously sent down unto thee that which hath diffused the fragrance of the Merciful throughout all creation, and We sent it unto thee that thine eyes and the eyes of them who are nigh might be solaced thereby.</p>
<p>Say: O people of God! This is the Day of Utterance, were ye of them that know, and this is the Day of God, were ye of them that are assured. By God! The Promise hath come, and the Promised One calleth aloud through His name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Say: Beware lest the doings of the transgressors, who have turned away from God when He came from the horizon of heaven with manifest sovereignty, fill you with fear.</p>
<p>Blessed are ye, O people of God, for having turned unto Him on a day wherein most of the servants have turned away. Soon shall ye behold the reward of your deeds, and they shall behold their position in the fire. Rejoice in the grace and mercy of God. By My life! The Concourse on High remembereth you this day, and the denizens of Paradise bear witness thereunto - thus doth testify He Who hath arisen to the Cause before the faces of all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>We counsel you with that which shall exalt your stations and perpetuate your remembrance, and We are the Forgiving, the Merciful. Ye have witnessed in the path of God that which no eyes have seen and have heard that which no ears have heard - your Lord, the Merciful, beareth witness to this, as He sitteth upon His throne with clear authority.</p>
<p>O people of God! Ye are they whom neither commerce nor trade nor the world and its ornaments have withheld from the remembrance of God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers. Verily, they who are prevented are among the most lost in My Clear Book. Blessed is the servant whom the veils of glory have not withheld from the Dayspring of the Cause, who hath heard the Call and turned to the Supreme Horizon, and heard what the Messengers heard.</p>
<p>Say: O peoples of the earth! Fear God and follow not your desires. Cast away vain imaginings and idle fancies. The Lord of all beings hath come with manifest light. That which is with the people shall profit you not this day - to this beareth witness this Most Great Book and this Mighty Announcement, at whose mention the limbs of all people have quaked, and kings and rulers have been struck with trembling.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of kings! By God, We have not come except for the reformation of the world and the edification of the nations. Fear ye the All-Merciful, and deny not yourselves that which hath been ordained for you in the Most Exalted Paradise by God, the Mighty, the Beauteous. Cast away what ye possess and take hold of that which ye have been bidden by Him Who is the Powerful, the Almighty. This shall profit you in all the worlds of His worlds and shall exalt you to a station wherein ye shall behold yourselves in a noble state. We beseech God to aid you and assist you in that which He loveth and is well-pleasing unto Him, and to inscribe for you from His Most Exalted Pen that which shall elevate your stations in both the kingdom of earth and heaven. Verily, your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. Turn ye unto Him with radiant faces, then hearken unto that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered when He came from the horizon of power with manifest glory. Thus hath the Tree brought forth Its fruits and the heaven Its stars. Blessed is he who hath found and recognized, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>O people of God! We have caused you to hear Our most great verses in the eloquent tongue, and We wish to mention you in a wondrous Persian tongue.</p>
<p>In the name of the Lord of the Tablet and the Pen!</p>
<p>This day is attributed to the Truth and known as the Day of God. The divine Books bear witness and testify. Blessed are they who have not changed the ocean into a pond, nor light into darkness, who have heard the divine Call with the ear of the soul and have turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon. These are the true trees and the divine Lote-Trees. They must, through this spiritual breeze which is wafting from the right hand of the Throne of the All-Merciful, bring forth wondrous and exalted fruits and delicate leaves. The fruits of the human tree are praiseworthy deeds and character, which are the cause of the elevation of the station of being. Today the gate of grace is opened, the rain of mercy is descending, and the ocean of bounty is surging. Strive that ye may attain unto that which is the cause of eternal life and the reason for everlasting existence. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of this most great bounty and this manifest Cause.</p>
<p>The divines of the age have forbidden the servants of God from entering the Egypt of divine knowledge. Through false utterances and through deceit and guile, they have deprived the people of the earth from the Euphrates of divine mercy. Each day they manifest a new opposition and each hour they appear with a fresh deception. In truth, they are the poisonous wind, for through the breath of these people the fruits of the trees of existence and their leaves have changed and fallen. May God destroy them! They have not perceived the fragrance of fairness and have not taken a drop from the ocean of justice. They curse the tyrants and Pharaohs of old from their pulpits while, by God, they themselves are seen to be far more tyrannical than those souls.</p>
<p>O people of God! Ye are those who have turned toward the Sun of Truth and have taken shelter in the shade of the divine Lote-Tree. Soon will your stations become manifest and evident to all the world like unto the sun. Beseech ye the Truth that He may quicken the servants through the water of His bounty and deprive them not from the splendors of the lights of the Sun of Manifestation. He is, verily, the Powerful, the Mighty. Greed and pride have deprived them from the Dawning-Place of Manifestation and the Speaker of Sinai. Soon shall these limited, numbered hours be seized by extinction. Then shall they behold themselves in manifest loss.</p>
<p>O Husayn! The Divine Lote Tree brings forth new fruit in every season, and the Supreme Pen gives utterance to fresh verses in every moment. Were all the peoples of the world to hearken or witness even to the extent of a needle’s eye, all would turn to and return unto the Truth. Today the ornaments and colors of the world have held them back from the path of the All-Merciful. They are occupied with mutilating their own limbs, yet remain unaware. They proceed toward the fire, yet remain heedless. Glory be to God! The conditions of the world have so estranged the nations from the Lord of Eternity that even were they to move with the speed of lightning, they would not attain nearness. Hearken unto that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “Leave them to plunge in vain discourse, and sport until they meet their day which they are promised.” From all things riseth the cry “The Truth is come!” By God’s life! Even the pebbles of the earth cry out and summon all to the Most Exalted Horizon.</p>
<p>O Husayn! In this hour the Bird of Faithfulness hath come from the City of Eternity and warbleth this most blessed and exalted word: “O people! By God, the Day is come, and this is the Most Great News, Who hath been established upon the throne of His Great Name!” The tongue was created for hearing, yet now hearing is lost. O friends! Move about in these days of God with joy and fragrance. How blessed is your state, for in days when the trembling of tribes hath seized the earth and the tempests have thrown the world into turmoil, ye have succeeded in hearing the divine call and have turned toward His direction. Well is it with you, and again well is it with you, and blessed are ye! In every moment, drink from the cup of God’s favor and from the chalice of utterance, despite the people of creation.</p>
<p>The Day is your Day, and joy is especially yours. This is the day of greatest joy, for the Greatest Scene hath appeared; it is the day of mercy, for the Lord of Bounty is present; it is the day of gladness, for the Beloved is manifest and visible. Take up the chalice of inner meanings in His Name and drink in His remembrance.</p>
<p>One page of names was sent by his honor Ash with expressions of kindness. Wondrous and exalted Tablets had previously been revealed for some. If God willeth, fresh ones shall again be sent for other souls as well. The loved ones of God in this Revelation have attained to the ocean of knowledge. Verses continue to be revealed, words appear, evidences are clear, the path is visible, and the balance is established. Blessed are they that see, and blessed are they that hear. The Command is in God’s hands, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>The glory shining from the horizon of My celestial kingdom be upon you, O My loved ones and My friends, ye who have not been deterred by the world’s veils nor frightened by the might of nations. Ye heard the call and responded “Yea, yea, O Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven!” We bear witness that Thou hast appeared and manifested what Thou didst will through Thy bounty and favor, and enabled us to hearken to Thy call and turn toward Thy horizon. Were it not for the wonders of Thy grace, who would guide us to the ways of Thy good-pleasure and acquaint us with what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book? Praise be to Thee, O Lord of the world and Sovereign of nations, for having made known to us Thy path, sent down to us Thy proof, and drawn us nigh unto Thee when most of Thy servants and creatures turned away from Thee. We beseech Thee to ordain for us the good of this world and the next. There is no God but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O Asad, upon whom be the glory of Baha and My loving-kindness! Your letter was forwarded to the Most Holy Court and attained unto hearing, and an answer hath been sent down from the heaven of utterance. We beseech God to strengthen thee and grant thee success, that thou mayest arise to render such service in the days of God as shall not be seized by extinction, nor altered by the changes of the world and the events of nations. Jalal and ?iya were mentioned, and they have attained unto God’s loving-kindness. We beseech God to ordain for them what He hath ordained for His loved ones who have not broken His Covenant and Testament, who have arisen and said: “God is our Lord, the Lord of earth and heaven, and the Lord of all the worlds.” We have made mention of them and given them glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for them from the presence of One mighty and powerful.</p>
<p>O Husayn! His honor Haydar-’Ali hath repeatedly made mention of thee, and likewise hath the Trustee. Another glad tiding is that We have removed “Mashhadi” from thy name and replaced it with “Da’i-Ba’i”. This is through thy Lord’s bounty. Give thanks and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the worlds! Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Beloved of those who are in the heavens and on earth! Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Object of desire in the hearts of the sincere ones! Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art remembered in the hearts of them that are nigh unto God! Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!</p>

<p>O Samandar! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. I complain not of anything; I love all that hath befallen Me and befalleth Me in the path of God. The soul that in nights and days hath been under protection and favored with grace and engaged in service, through the instigation of an ingrate, intended harm against the Wronged One. And when We departed, tumult arose and clamor was raised. That which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen they attribute to him. Lament thou over the wrongs suffered by this Wronged One. Some have said that the verses revealed were taken from the Point. Glory be to God! From the earliest days until now, verses have been revealed like unto rain, equal to all books before and after, nay more, if they would be fair. By God’s life! The Point circleth round Me and hearkeneth to My verses when they are revealed in truth, and lamenteth for what hath befallen Me from the people of the Bayan. A matter more manifest than the sun they seek to veil with the clouds of their vain imaginings. Say: Woe unto you! He hath appeared in truth and hath come with the kingdom of verses. All that is in the world cannot prevent Him. He speaketh before all faces. The gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of the Kingdom of Names hath come with a clear command. Fear God, O people, and follow not every remote oppressor.</p>
<p>O Samandar! It hath been proven with clear evidence that the ophthalmia of vain imaginings hath prevented eyes from beholding the signs. Therefore the Supreme Pen uttereth this most exalted Word: “I have abandoned the community of a people who believe not in God and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter.” He is indeed independent of them and of the parties whom wealth and occupation have kept from drawing nigh unto God, the Self-Subsisting. We beseech God to assist His loved ones in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to make them the standards of His guidance among His servants and the banners of His Cause in all lands. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Compelling over what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>Say: O company of the heedless! Hasten to the Supreme Horizon, then present yourselves before the Face to hear His sweet call and what hath been sent down from the heaven of grace and bounty. Fear God and follow not the manifestations of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Open your eyes - the Sun is shining before your faces and it hath no need of aught else. To this testify enlightened servants. Then look at the sea and its waves, and be fair in what ye behold today, and be not of those who look and deny.</p>
<p>We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist His loved ones in that which will cause the elevation of His Cause and His might amongst His servants. The adornment of God’s loved ones hath ever been the fear of God. We have enjoined upon all benevolence and piety, and that whereby the station of the people of God will be exalted among all religions. Blessed is he who hath adorned his head with the crown of detachment, his temple with the ornament of the fear of God, and his heart with the light of the knowledge of God, the Lord of all worlds. This is a Day wherein if God’s compelling Word were to be cast upon rock, there would gush forth from it rivers of wisdom and utterance, and if cast upon the mountains, they would soar by God’s permission, the Sovereign of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>O Samandar! From the beginning of days until now We have summoned the servants unto the Lord of creation without veil or concealment. Whatsoever would conduce to the reformation of the world and the advancement of the stations of nations, We have mentioned through loving counsels. Among the people are those who have heard and acted, and those who have heard and denied and turned away. For all there is a portion in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Ask thou God that He may enable all to abide by that which hath been revealed in the Book from the Supreme Pen. The people of the Bayan, like unto the people of the Furqan, have clung to names […]</p>
<p>Glory be to God! They have taken up anew that which they had previously abandoned and have clung to the imaginings of the past. You mentioned two souls who desired to drink of the sealed wine and aspire to the praiseworthy station. Say: Whosoever seeks the most exalted horizon must free and detach himself from all save God. Names must not prevent him, nor must the allusions of the world hinder him. Say: By the life of God! This exalted word is uttered from the tongue of the Lord of mankind purely for His sake. At the outset, the seeker must say, turning to God: “In the Name of God and by God,” and must sanctify and purify himself from the vain imaginings of the former people - that is, the Shi’ih and whatsoever is with them. Say: Reflect upon the deeds of that sect and the fruits that appeared therefrom on the Day of Retribution. Then shall ye find yourselves sanctified from all that is with them. Beseech God that none of His servants be afflicted with the vain imaginings of that sect. In truth, this prayer is binding and necessary upon all. This is a day wherein man must be illumined with the light of true unity, and this is not possible except through acting in accordance with that which the Desired One of all the worlds hath revealed in the Qur’an: “Say: God; then leave them to their vain discussions.” Say: This is the Day of God, wherein none is mentioned save Him. Blessed is he who hath attained and recognized, and woe unto the heedless. However, the people of Persia have generally been and remain intimate with vain imaginings. For twelve hundred years they have been deprived of the Lord of Names through names. I swear by the lights of the Sun of Truth that they have not even caught the fragrance of unity, let alone its light. Thus have We expounded for thee that from which the near ones perceive the sweet savors of the bounty of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thus hath the river of mercy flowed from My Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is he who hath drunk and attained, and woe unto every remote polytheist. We desired to impart unto thee that which We revealed to one of My loved ones in remembrance of the day whereon appeared the decree of mutual imprecation, when the Dawning-Place of the Cause went forth from the horizon of the House with a sovereignty that conquered all who are in the heavens and on earth. He is the One Who hath dawned from the horizon of eternity.</p>
<p>The Call hath been raised from the most exalted horizon, and they that dwelt on Sinai’s mount in the realm of knowledge were thunderstruck. The Rock cried aloud and proclaimed: “The Ocean of Union hath surged, and the Lord of the Day of Reckoning hath come, riding upon the clouds.” Blessed is he whom armies have not weakened though he be strong, and whom ranks have not frightened though he be mighty. He hastened, and hearkened, and attained the presence of God, the Almighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>Say: O peoples of the earth, hearken unto My Call which hath been raised in truth, and follow not the sources of fancy and imagination. Say: The proof hath appeared and the sweet-flowing stream hath gushed forth from the Pen of God, Who speaketh from the most sublime Station. We have heard thy call and have turned toward thee from this Spot which God hath made the Dawning-place of lights, and We have answered thee with a Tablet from whose horizon shineth the luminary of the loving-kindness of the Lord of creation. The servant who standeth present hath appeared before the face of the Wronged One and read thy letter. We have revealed for thee that which shall endure as long as God’s own kingdom shall endure, the Lord of Lords. We beseech the Exalted One to make thee a sign of His signs and a standard of His standards in this Cause whereby faces have been darkened and feet have slipped. There hath befallen Me in God’s path what no eye hath seen nor ear heard. To this beareth witness the Mother Book which speaketh before the faces of all parties. Sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>When the Light shone forth from the horizon of Revelation, the Maid of Paradise came forth from the Most Exalted Paradise and walked until she stood before the face of the Lord of all beings. She called out, pointing with her luminous finger to the head of the Lord of Destiny: “By God! This is the Hidden One Who hath appeared in truth, and this is He Who was treasured in the hearts of the Prophets and mentioned in the books of God, the Lord of all men.” Say: Be fair, O people of the Bayan, concerning this Book which God hath made the point of adoration for the books of the world, and this Remembrance before which all remembrances have bowed down. Say: Present yourselves before the Face that your eyes may behold what no vision hath beheld, and your ears may hear what no ears have heard. He is the One Who cannot be known except through Himself, and Who needeth not the testimony of scriptures, books and tablets to prove His Cause. Were it not for Him, the Bayan would not have been revealed, nor would My Herald have come Who sacrificed His life in My path. Fear God, O people, and be not of them that have gone astray.</p>
<p>Say: By God! He was silent - God made Him speak; He was seated - the hands of power and might made Him arise; He was sleeping - the breezes of the morn of Revelation that blew by God’s will, the Lord of the Day of Return, awakened Him. Say: O people of the Bayan! He speaketh not of His own desire - to this beareth witness what hath been sent down from My Most Exalted Pen. Fear God and follow not every heedless doubter. Say: O people of the deniers, deny not Him Who hath come with what the Messengers brought aforetime, and hath revealed what lay hidden in the treasury of God’s protection from time immemorial. Say: Read ye what ye possess and We shall read what We possess. Then shall ye find yourselves in greater loss than any idolatrous falsifier.</p>
<p>Say: Remember ye the Day of Imprecation in the Land of Mystery, when He Who is the Dawning-place of Inspiration came forth from the precincts of the House, directing His steps toward the House of God, the Lord of all men. We arrived therein while none else entered save Myself. Then did the Sun of the Cause shine forth and the Beauty of the Pre-existent appeared without veil or covering. Say: O people, can anyone stand with Him in the arena of proof and evidence? Nay, by His Self, the All-Merciful! Thus have We sent down the verses and manifested the proofs, that thou mightest arise to aid the Cause of thy Lord with power and sovereignty.</p>
<p>O Samandar! In the Land of Mystery, the great ordeal has become more manifest than the sun. Nearly a hundred souls, both travelers and emigrants, were present; nevertheless, the opposers denied it while the chosen ones of the world have accepted it. Convey the greetings of the Wronged One to the loved ones of that land and give them the glad-tidings of the effulgences of the Orb of Revelation. The matter of his honor Shaykh, upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness, is known and clear. Indeed, he has borne countless hardships and has been wronged. We have commanded his honor Ism-i-Jud, upon him be My glory, to provide the details. And Abdi, that is Abdul-Husayn, is mentioned before the Wronged One. Wondrous and exalted Tablets have been sent specifically for the loved ones, both men and women. It is beloved that whatever is sent should be copied, and after being checked and verified, be given to their owners. Praise be to God, all are mentioned and have attained unto the verses of the Pen. We beseech God to assist them and to confirm them in such steadfastness as will cause the feet of the world to stand firm. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The glory from Us be upon you, upon those who are with you and hear your words, and upon My loved ones in the cities and lands of God who have not broken My covenant and My testament and who were among those firm in this Great Announcement and this Manifest Cause.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord, the All-Compelling, the Most Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath uttered His Most Exalted Word, whereupon the seas surged, the winds were stirred thereby, the mountains took flight, the trees put forth their leaves, the pebbles glorified Him, and all things spoke forth that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Bestower. Verily it is the Fire of God unto him who turned away and erred, and the Light of God unto him who turned towards Him and was guided. Blessed is he who turned unto it, attained to the knowledge thereof, and sought refuge in its presence. Verily it is the Word through which were created all who are in the heavens and the earth, and all who are in the kingdoms of authority and creation. Indeed it is the essence of proof in the realm of possibilities and the reality of evidence unto the followers of all religions. Through it the proof was perfected, the bounty completed, the heavenly table sent down, and distinction made between all created things. Exalted, exalted be its sovereignty! Exalted, exalted be its greatness! Exalted, exalted be its penetrating influence! Exalted, exalted be its power! Exalted, exalted be its dominion! Exalted, exalted be its grace! Exalted, exalted be its mercy which hath encompassed all who are in earth and heaven!</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice unto you, O Afnan of the Blessed Tree! His honor Haji Ahmad and his honor Mirza Hasan have been honored to attain the Most Great and Most Exalted House upon their return from the Most Great and Most Resplendent House, bearing with them a letter from your honor. This ephemeral one was honored by it and attained to its contents, and presented it before His Countenance. The Tongue of Grandeur spoke concerning the mention of His Afnan in such wise as I am powerless to recount. His Self, which dominateth the world, and His Essence, which hath ascendancy over all the worlds, bear witness to this. God willing, may you be the recipient in all conditions of the special favors of the Beloved of the worlds.</p>
<p>As to what was written concerning the cawing of the opposers and the braying of the deniers, in all ages it hath been thus - most people are heedless and ignorant, and have placed the reins of their minds and hearts in the hands of the ignorant like themselves. Therefore they have remained deprived of all heavenly bounties and divine favors, and are unaware of it. Woe unto the leader and the led, the seeker and the sought! However, even some of the loved ones of God have not acted according to what God desired. In truth, the matter is as your honor hath written - had the loved ones of God acted according to what God desired, most people would now be adorned with the robe of faith. Yea, by God, this is the truth in which there is no doubt!</p>
<p>Observe how in most Tablets all were commanded to wisdom, and all were enjoined to virtuous character, refined manners and goodly, acceptable deeds. Nevertheless, some have transgressed the bounds set by God and have become the cause of the clamor and outcry of the people. One day as I stood before the Throne, He mentioned the martyrs of that land, and repeatedly from the Most Holy Tongue - upon them be the glory of God - was heard their praise. Then He said that although they were martyred in the path of God and their martyrdom was accepted, they had somewhat exceeded the bounds of wisdom. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. In most cities during the past year, the friends themselves have been the cause of commotion, despite being counseled in most Tablets to observe wisdom, patience, calm, and that whereby the Cause of God, the Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, may be exalted. Among other things, the friends have been forbidden from turning towards the Most Holy Court, and an explicit prohibition hath been revealed in the Book that none should turn hither without permission. Nevertheless, there are now more travelers than emigrants in this land.</p>
<p>The esteemed Haji, if granted an audience, will submit that had they been focused on the Cause of God and had they seen their own wills as non-existent and as naught before the will of the Ancient King, the banners of the Cause would now be raised in all lands. Moreover, whatsoever occurs in opposition to God’s Cause yields no benefit, and its harm reverts to those who perpetrate it. Furthermore, the gathering of people in this land has even brought harm to the Blessed Tree itself, as the departure from the Land of Mystery caused the friends to gather in that land. However, this word was repeatedly heard from the Tongue of Grandeur, Who said that whatever befalls the presence of the Throne becomes the cause of the exaltation of the Word of God, as has been witnessed thus far. After arrival in this land, which is the prison, an order was issued from the source of oppression that none should meet with anyone, such that even the barber could not attend to the prisoners to shave their heads without guards present. Thus did the Desired One of all worlds not visit the bath for several months. But now it has come to pass that the friends may go to any city they wish, except for the Ancient Beauty Who remains confined to His house and associates with no one. The rest, including the Two Most Great Branches–may the spirit of all worlds be sacrificed for them both–and the other friends, may go wherever they wish, with no hindrance whatsoever. Verily, He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. He is indeed the One Who prevails over whatsoever He pleaseth. His command is effective, His decree is current, and His will hath dominated the heavens and the earth. However, this evanescent servant has acquired a small plot outside the city and has planted therein, according to his means, various flowers and plants, that perchance it might become a greater vista and the Ancient Beauty might grace that place with His presence. But until now He hath not accepted. The command is in His hands. O my Beloved! The heart is in great combustion and the very foundations are in evident upheaval, for it is witnessed that the Holy Being for Whose servants the whole world was created dwells in the prison of His enemies and is outwardly forbidden. I fear that His honor might become saddened by the abundance of petitions submitted. In all conditions, we look to His honor’s pardon.</p>
<p>That which was written concerning the good conduct of the loved ones of that land, that they act with wisdom and pleasing manners, brought boundless joy. God willing, may they at all times gaze toward the horizon of the Cause and act in accordance with the revealed wisdom. I swear by the Sun of Truth that if the opposing servants were to become aware of even less than a mustard seed of the stations of God’s loved ones, they would assuredly circle around each one of them. Their sight hath been clouded by vain desires which have prevented them from God, the Lord of all worlds. This abasement sufficeth for the heedless souls who for years and centuries, day and night, beseeched and supplicated for the appearance of the Manifestations of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, yet when the Truth Itself appeared and the horizon of the Cause shone forth, all remained heedless, turned away and veiled, save whom God, the Lord of all worlds, willed. This servant was exceedingly grateful and pleased with the loved ones of that land who, despite the transgressions of the oppressors, the objections of the wicked, and the clamor of the corrupt, remained patient and did not transgress beyond the wisdom they were bidden to observe. Upon them be the glory of God, His favors and His grace. That which befell your honor and the loved ones of that land is known and evident at the Most Holy Court, as hath been mentioned time and again, and it hath been said that ere long the power of the oppressors, the might of the rulers, and the dominion of the aggressors shall pass away and perish, and the Cause of God shall be seen to prevail and triumph over all.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about some of the friends whose property was taken and who made no complaint - there would be no harm if they were to lodge a complaint with perfect propriety and wisdom, for the matter would have one of two outcomes: either they would listen or they would not. If they listened, they would have acted justly, and if they did not listen, God’s proof would be complete against those souls and the oppression of the friends would become apparent and manifest. This matter would have its effect in the world itself. A word was heard from the Most Pure Tongue indicating that there is fear that an affliction greater than the afflictions of previous years may encompass the land of the opposers and deniers. It appears this affliction will come after the appearance of a sedition that will become manifest in certain lands, as can be understood from certain revealed verses.</p>
<p>The greetings of this evanescent servant to the loved ones of God depend on your honor’s favor. God willing, all should gaze toward the Most Merciful with perfect joy and fragrance, serenity and assurance. By God, besides Whom there is none other God, all good returneth unto them and the infinite outpourings of the Lord are directed toward them. The clamor of the opposers is, as people say, like the yellow sun on the edge of roofs - its effect is visible but soon it shall pass away and perish. God willing, may they remain firm at all times and moments in the Cause of the Beloved of the worlds with complete steadfastness, and be vocal in His remembrance. What more can I say of this evanescent servant’s longing and yearning to see your exalted handwriting - I hope this favor will not be withheld. My spirit be a sacrifice for your tribulations, O Afnan of the Tree of the Cause, and my soul be a sacrifice for your sorrows, O Afnan of my Beloved and the Beloved of the worlds.</p>
<p>Another matter to report is that the samovar and items that were with Jinab-i-Haji Ahmad arrived, and specifically they commanded that the samovar be kept for the days of the Festival so that all may drink tea from it in remembrance of the Beloved. Likewise, the rice that Jinab-i-Shaykh, upon him be the Glory of God, sent arrived without defect. We beseech God to assist him in the Cause and draw him near to Him in all conditions, and to ordain for him that which He loves and is pleased with. Verily He is the Lord of the hereafter and the former times, there is no God but Him, the Most High, the All-Wise. The rosewater too was specifically preserved for the Festivals as commanded, and upon its arrival, after one day the Blessed Beauty made use of it. Blessed is it, that is, the rosewater and its sender. Likewise, at a specific time, this servant gained admittance to the Most Holy Court and, on your behalf, performed the visitation, and its acceptance was uttered from the blessed tongue. Another matter to report is that from Jinab-i-Rafi’ Badi’, upon him be the Glory of God, a petition arrived at the Most Holy Court, as well as from other souls, but since Tablets specifically for them had previously been revealed and sent, They said that God willing, later a response would be revealed and sent. On behalf of this ephemeral servant, convey wondrous and glorious greetings to Jinab-i-Rafi’, upon him be the Glory of God, and likewise to the other loved ones. The Most Glorious Glory be upon you, O Afnan of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. The Servant. 19 Safar 1293.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>The Truth proclaims and verses shine forth, the path is clear and proof is manifest. Yet the people of the earth are occupied with vain imaginings and veiled from the effulgent rays of the Sun of Certitude. Today, sublime praise and beauteous glorification are, in the first rank and highest station, befitting the loved ones of Truth, exalted be His glory, who were not hindered from the straight path of God by the insinuations of the opposers, the doubts of the deniers, the oppression of the aggressors, nor the conjectures and fancies of the heedless. Inwardly they are like surging oceans, while outwardly they remain steady and firm as mountains. These are the souls who are seated upon the cushions of light and recline upon the pillars of certitude, for they gaze toward the horizon of “He doeth whatsoever He willeth” and are steadfast in their adherence to the blessed words “He ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth.” The veils of the world and the clouds of the nations prevented them not from the Ancient Lord. They discovered the fragrance of the Day of God and attained unto true unity. These are the Hands of the Cause amongst the servants and the Standards of Guidance in all lands. Through the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and the flowing of the Supreme Pen, they have attained unto a wondrous new life and have drunk from the chalice of detachment. The clamor of the divines is to them as the buzzing of flies, and the tumult of the jurists like the croaking of ravens. They are enkindled with the fire of divine love - a flame that shall never be extinguished. They move by God’s will and are stirred by the movement of the Blessed Tree. Blessed are they, and joy be unto them, and theirs is a goodly destination. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou at Whose call the dwellers of the graves arose and at Whose command the trumpet was blown! I beseech Thee by the One Who conversed on Sinai, through Whom the decree of resurrection was made manifest, to assist Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones through whom Thy verses were spread abroad, Thy banners were raised up, Thy clear proofs appeared and Thy standards were planted. O my Lord! This evanescent one desires to make mention of one of Thy Afnan who attained Thy presence and whom Thou didst relate unto Thyself, though my praise befits not his exalted stations which were revealed from Thy Most Exalted Pen. Nevertheless, I beseech Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens, to accept from me that which my tongue hath uttered and that which I failed to mention in their remembrance and praise. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name, through which the pillars of the world were shaken, to adorn him at every moment with new favors, fresh bounties, renewed blessings, original sustenance and mighty mercy. Thou art He through Whose Name the ocean of generosity surged amongst the nations and by Whose command the light of utterance shone forth from the horizon of the world. There is no God but Thee, the Strong, the Triumphant, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice unto your mention and your loving-kindness. The servant has been blessed by the trace of your ink and what flowed from the pen of your knowledge. When I drank the Kawthar of love from the sweetest cups of your utterances, I approached the Most Exalted Station and the highest Summit, was present and offered supplication before the face of the Lord of all beings. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which shall endure as long as the kingdom and the realm endure. His word, mighty is His utterance and sublime His proof:</p>
<p>In My Name, through which the fragrance of the All-Merciful was wafted throughout all possibilities[…]</p>
<p>Mention from the Divine Lote-Tree to His Afnan who turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon when Zawra was the seat of his Lord’s throne, the Lord of Names, and who attained the choice wine of revelation while men were in a wondrous sleep. He turned, and heard, and beheld a horizon from which shone forth the Luminary of his Lord’s loving-kindness, the Lord of creation. The Most Great Ocean hath surged, and the fragrance of the Ancient Beauty hath wafted, and the Dove of Utterance hath warbled upon the highest branch of divine knowledge that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Bestower. Blessed is the arm that hath shattered the idols of vain imaginings through the power of the Lord of all beings and hath attained the light of unity when it shone forth from the horizon of might. Say: By God! The gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of Names hath come with such sovereignty as neither the hosts of rulers nor the doubts of the learned could withhold. He stood before the faces of all the world and summoned all to God, the Lord of Lords. Say: Beware lest anything among all things prevent you from this bounty the like of which the eye of creation hath never beheld. The world hath been illumined by the light of My Most Great Name. Say: Be fair, O people, in this Cause at whose appearance the very signs have submitted. Say: O people of the Bayan, fear the All-Merciful. He indeed said: Should anyone come unto you with a verse, reject him not - yet ye have rejected Him Who came with that which no revelation throughout eternity can equal. By God! Every mention hath submitted at My mention, and the Concourse on High hath been attracted by the scratching of My Pen - to this testifieth He Who hath proclaimed in all things that there is none other God but Me, the Omnipotent, the Self-Subsisting. This is the Day wherein the Mother Book crieth out from the precincts of the Prison with that wherewith all things have cried out: The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of all men.</p>
<p>O Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. I complain unto thee of those who have denied Me after they were created to serve Me. Say: Take ye heed, O people of insight! Say: O people of the Bayan! Where were ye when the Light was shining forth from the Supreme Horizon and the Manifestation was standing before the faces of all peoples? Fear God, O ye manifestations of idle fancies! I was standing at the world’s center, making mention of God, Lord of all nations, whilst the people remained behind the veil. Say: Cast the rivulet behind you. By God! The Ocean of Life hath surged in My Name, the All-Merciful. Draw nigh and drink therefrom through this Name whereby the pillars have been shaken. Say: O people, weigh what ye possess with the balance of justice and fairness by this Book, at Whose revelation all scriptures and tablets have bowed down in submission. Say: O company of the heedless! Of no profit to you this day is what the people possess, nor will all the books of the world suffice you. Fear God! He hath come with a Cause before which the verses have prostrated themselves.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! Until now they have not comprehended the Day of God. They have devised calumnies born of their vain imaginings and have arisen to lead the servants astray. The heaven beareth witness and the sun is a testimony that this Wronged One hath arisen before the faces of all the world, wholly detached from all else, in such wise that no fair-minded person can deny it. He hath summoned all unto the Supreme Horizon. And when the lights of the Cause shed forth their radiance to some degree, a band of wolves emerged from behind the veil of the letters Kaf and Ra, intent upon the Wronged One, though they were and are ignorant of the root of the matter. Thus have their souls enticed them to a course of action that hath made them among the most lost in the perspicuous Book. By God! They are bereft of the ocean deposited within the blessed word “He doeth whatsoever He willeth” and are heedless of “He ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth.” Whosoever hath been blessed with this blessed word is preserved from all the doubts and allusions of the people. Thus hath the Supreme Pen spoken in the prison of ’Akka as a grace and mercy unto thee and a light before thee. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Generous. The Glory shining forth from the heaven of bounty be upon you and upon those who love you and hearken unto your words, by the command of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant hath ever besought and continueth to beseech the True One that He deprive not the peoples of the earth of the outpourings of His days, and that He may aid them all that they might attain unto return. His Holiness too must needs supplicate the True One for the deliverance of His servants throughout the nights and days, for verily this blessed word was repeatedly heard from the tongue of Grandeur - blessed and exalted be His utterance: “O servant who art present! We have chosen the Afnan and made firm their connection to the Tree. The Tablet beareth witness and the Pen testifieth, and verily whatsoever they ask shall assuredly be granted by God.” They are, praise be to God, blessed with that which this servant and his like are powerless to mention. In the days when His Holiness the Greater Afnan and His Holiness who triumphed in Baghdad were honored to be in thy presence and in this Prison, thy place was truly empty. Such gatherings were arranged whose mention shall never be effaced from the world. Yet thy mention and the mention of those related to thee hath ever endured - gatherings from which the Concourse on High drew spirituality and the denizens of the highest Paradise cried out “Blessed be God!” At one time this supreme blessed word was heard from the tongue of the Lord of Names - blessed and exalted be His utterance: “O servant who art present! In these days, due to the world’s lack of capacity, stations and ranks remain concealed. Yet in God’s knowledge there is preserved a Day, and on that Day there shall be the gathering of Tablets and the spreading of verses, and on that Day the concealed stations and hidden conditions shall appear manifest as the sun from the horizon of the heaven of the world.” Whatsoever hath been revealed by the Supreme Pen is the truth wherein there is no doubt, as hath become evident and manifest to all. Every fair-minded one hath testified and doth testify that verily whatsoever hath appeared or shall appear in the world hath been revealed with utmost clarity in the divine Tablets. The stations of the Afnan must needs be made manifest and evident in the world. Thy letter was repeatedly read; at every moment the effects of the living waters were manifest therefrom. Praise be unto the Goal of all the worlds Who hath concealed within the words of His Afnan the treasure of love, wherein the effects of the celestial stream lie hidden. Glorified be His bounty, magnificent His generosity, and exalted His favors unto His Afnan! This servant beseecheth his Lord to assist and strengthen Your Honor and to open before your faces that whereby the fragrance of His Revelation may be diffused throughout the world. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Hearing, the Answering.</p>
<p>Unto the two luminous lights, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God, I convey greetings, praise and glory, and I say that they are truly adorned with the ornament of distinction and are enkindled with the fire of love. His Holiness M.H. [Muhammad], upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, hath returned by firm decree, while his sighs ascended and his tears descended. Truly, mention of the degrees of his love, faithfulness, acceptance, yearning and enkindlement transcend this servant’s power to describe. And whatsoever was sent hath arrived. Two Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of divine Will specifically for the two lights. God willing, they shall attain unto them, inhale the fragrance of the All-Merciful therefrom, and drink from the ocean of His utterance. Glory, praise, mention and exaltation be upon Your Honor, upon those with you, and upon those who love you, mention you, and aid you by the command of an All-Wise Ordainer. Praise be to God, the King of this manifest Day.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified above the mysteries of the pen and the eloquence of the tongue, befitteth the Lord of all mankind, whose mercy and grace have reached such heights that the tongues of them that are nigh unto Him are powerless and fall short of their mention. Like unto a tender and loving father, He hath guided and trained these servants as children, causing the pearls of His hidden counsels to stream forth from His Pen by night and by day, and manifesting from the Tongue of His grandeur blessed admonitions at all times, that perchance His servants might be delivered from the wilderness of error and turn towards and enter the realm of guidance. He hath sent down verses such that every just and discerning soul hath testified to their loftiness and greatness. He hath revealed evidences whereby every fair-minded one hath proclaimed “with Him is the knowledge of all things.” Through the hosts of verses He hath triumphed, and through the banners of clear proofs He hath encompassed the world. The might of the world hath not weakened His power, nor hath the strength of the nations altered His resolve. Glorified be His majesty, abundant be His favors, exalted be His station, pre-existent be His mercy, and manifest be His verses.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who orderest all things and Who art established upon the throne of Revelation! I beseech Thee by the ocean of light and by the Word through which was manifested the decree of Sinai, to aid Thy loved ones and Thy chosen ones in such wise that the doubts of the people shall not withhold them from the bounty of this Day, nor shall the signs of the transgressors debar them from the outpourings of this Day of Judgment. O my Lord! Thou beholdest them turning toward Thee and circling round the court of Thy will. I beseech Thee to disappoint them not through Thy generosity, nor to withhold from them through Thy grace. Take their hands with the hands of Thy power, then preserve them with Thy hosts. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Protector, the All-Bountiful, the Gracious. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>The letter you sent to the beloved presence of His Holiness the Name of Bounty, may the Most Glorious Glory of God be upon him, was forwarded to the Most Holy Court. Every letter thereof was a clear book testifying to that beloved one’s devotion, acceptance, humility and submissiveness before God, the Lord of the Worlds. Its fragrance bore tidings from the garden of inner meanings, and its melody made known the songs of the spiritual nightingale. Glory be to God! Everything that appears from the world of love is complete and perfect. The world may perish, but the ignorant one will not remain ignorant, for even if he does, despite him, the Word of God descends and penetrates, the Cause of God appears and prevails. The power of the ignorant ones - meaning the clergy - cannot prevent the penetration of God’s Will, nor can the might of princes become a veil. All the oppression and transgression that has occurred has been from the source and manifestation of the world’s clergy. By the decree of those heedless souls, the rulers have risen in oppression and caused confusion in the Cause. Consider how a group of meaningless turbaned ones and senseless headgear-wearers in the land of Kaf raised the banner of opposition and spread calumnies in all directions. However, after the matter was presented before His Majesty the Sultan, he delivered the oppressed from the evil of the oppressors, protected them, and of his own accord released the prisoners of ?a. In short, despite the despotic government, overwhelming power, absolute authority, and the harm inflicted by the ignorant ones at the beginning of the Cause, nevertheless he showed favor and granted freedom. I swear by the Point of Power that had any of those ignorant ones been sultan, they all would have agreed like the Jews to crucifixion. Repeatedly this exalted word was heard from the Master of all beings, saying that the Sultan’s heart is very tender and sensitive, changing with minor things. Always has every sultan been superior to those beneath him, except for times when God, exalted be His glory, due to the various oppressions and transgressions of the servants, supports the Manifestation of the Name “the Compeller” and seats him upon the throne. In any case, most people, according to the saying, are depressed from lack of means. Ask God not to deprive His Majesty the Sultan of the lights of the sun of justice and fairness. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the Wise.</p>
<p>And regarding what was written about His Honor the Khan, may the Glory of the All-Merciful be upon him, mention of him and his devotion became cause for remembrance, for when your letter was presented before the face of the Lord of all beings, those present were repeatedly observed to be regretful and saddened at the devotion of His Honor the Khan, and when the letter reached its end, the Master of all beings spoke, saying exalted and holy is His Word […]</p>
<p>O Kazim! Upon thee be My Baha, and upon thy brethren and thy sons be My loving-kindness, and upon My friends and loved ones be My mercy. Thou hast ever been and art still favored with the signs of the Most Exalted Pen. Thou hast perceived the fragrances of the Days of God and hast turned unto His horizon. Thou hast drunk of the choice wine and held fast unto the Self-Subsisting. Your rewards have been and are preserved with the trustworthy, mighty One. We give glad-tidings of the favors of the Divine Lote-Tree to the friends in that land and its surroundings and ’Ishqabad. This is the day of service and of praise and remembrance, the day of deeds. Blessed are they that act! O Kazim! At all times doth the blessed Tree in the wilderness proclaim with the most exalted call, and at this moment uttereth this word: “O people of God! Abandon this day what the people possess and take what hath been given you from God, the Lord of the worlds.” We beseech God to assist His loved ones and grant them such steadfastness that all the peoples of the earth shall be powerless to prevent them. Remember them on My behalf, remind them of My verses, give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness, illumine them with the lights of My utterance and draw them nigh unto that which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of My Pen. We beseech God to ordain for them that which shall adorn them with an ornament that the happenings of the world shall not change, nor the centuries and ages alter. The burning of the heart of him who sought Me and was gladdened by that which shone forth from the Dawning-Place of permission from the horizon of My Most Exalted Pen on this dark and gloomy night hath grieved Me, that he might rejoice in the loving-kindness of his Lord and turn with such turning as shall cause all faces to turn unto the Face of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The Sun of bounty is shining, the Ocean of grace is surging, the Heaven of generosity is elevated, and permission for the presence of his honor Kh. A., upon him be the glory of God, manifest, evident and radiant, is granted. However, as commanded, they must observe wisdom. If wisdom permits, they may attend; otherwise, He verily ordaineth for him the reward of His presence and recordeth for him what He hath recorded for those who attained His presence, heard His sweet call and beheld His most glorious horizon. This servant also congratulates him, sends greetings and seeks divine confirmation.</p>
<p>As for the mention made of his honor Aqa Mirza Muhammad, upon him be the glory of God, it was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court and attained the hearing of the Lord of Names, and in response these supreme, decisive verses were revealed from the Source of Glory. He, exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof, saith:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Counselor, the Trustworthy</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Hearken unto the call from the direction of Akka. Verily He mentioneth thee with verses that all the books of the world and all that the nations possess cannot equal. To this beareth witness the Lord of Eternity, as He sitteth upon the throne of His Great Name. When thou art illumined by the lights of thy Lord’s utterance, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having brought me into being in days the like of which the eye of creation hath not seen, nor the vision of invention beheld. I was heedless, Thy call made me aware; I was ignorant, Thy bounty and gifts taught me; I was seated, the hand of Thy generosity raised me up, O Possessor of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by the traces of Thy Pen and the mysteries of Thy knowledge to ordain that I may remain steadfast in Thy Cause and be enabled to speak Thy praise in such wise that neither the wretchedness of the wretched nor the doubts of the learned shall prevent me. My Lord! Ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones in every world of Thy worlds. Verily Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Ye have attained unto that which hath no peer or likeness. All atoms bear and have borne witness unto this truth. This servant beseecheth God to bestow His confirmation upon them and grant them a portion from the ocean of utterance. Verily, He is the Strong, the Mighty.</p>
<p>They also mentioned Aqa Mirza Ibrahim, upon him be the glory of God. After being presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, this blessed Tablet was revealed from the heaven of Will. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the One Who dominateth all names</p>
<p>O Ibrahim! Verily the Sacrifice set forth towards the Ultimate Goal with such detachment as amazed the Concourse on High. When he reached the station of sacrifice, he offered up his spirit in My straight path. We sent him as a sacrifice for the guidance of the servants. The Lord of creation beareth witness to this, yet the people are in ancient error and manifest doubt. They make mention of the sacrifice of old in the mosques and from the pulpits, though We redeemed him with a sacrifice from Our presence and a ransom from Our side. They have forgotten the mention of those who have offered up their souls, their spirits, and their children in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. O Ibrahim! When thou hearest the call of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, and art overtaken by the intoxication of utterance, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou seest me turning toward the lights of Thy countenance, drawing nigh unto Thy horizon, and speaking Thy praise. I beseech Thee by Thy power and might, Thy grandeur and sovereignty, to aid me to be steadfast in Thy Cause, then ordain for me that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>The ocean of bounty is surging - what more can this servant say or what trouble should he give? I convey greetings and praise to that honored one and the friends of God, and I beseech God to open a door of grace for every soul and withhold not His mercy in any condition. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and He is the All-Knowing, the Wise. There is none other God but Him, the Most High, the Most Glorious. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who have preceded and who have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken before the creation of the heavens and earths.</p>
<p>At the end of the letter, as commanded by that Beloved One, they must strive diligently for the unity of the friends. Repeatedly hath He said that unity and harmony are the mightiest pillars for the exaltation of the Word of God. Through God’s grace - exalted be His glory - the horizons must be illumined with the light of unity and the world adorned with the ornament of harmony. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist His loved ones in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and in that which He hath willed. Verily, He is the Lord of the servants and the Sovereign of creation.</p>

<p>Praise be befitting and worthy of the Desired One of the world and the Lord of nations, Who through His grace hath revealed the hidden and treasured mysteries, Who hath bestowed new splendor upon utterance and adorned the Book with wondrous ornament. His Word hath endowed the world of utterance with the spirit of meaning, and the realm of words with true penetration. The power of His servants did not prevent His might, nor did the authority of those in the lands hold back His will. By His Own Self did He aid His Cause. The spiritual trumpet was His Word - it both struck down and gave life, and granted awareness. From Him was the path made manifest, through Him was the balance made evident. In every letter of the letters lieth concealed an ocean of knowledge and a Kawthar of certitude. And this Kawthar and ocean have ever been and shall continue to be reserved for His chosen ones - those souls whom the doubts and conditions of the people of the world did not prevent, who drank from the cup of patience when they tasted the venom of tribulation. These are the manifestations of steadfastness and the essences of the chosen ones. Upon them be the blessings of God and His favors, and the mercy of God and His gifts.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Throne, and the waves of the ocean of Thy mercy, and the effulgences of the Day-Star of Thy grace, to assist Thy loved ones in serving Thy Cause, in remembering Thee, and in praising Thee amongst Thy servants. Then enable them to follow the wisdom which Thou hast sent down in Thy Scriptures and Tablets. I moreover beseech Thee, O Possessor of existence and Educator of the seen and unseen, to forgive him who hath ascended unto Thee and whom Thou hast raised to Thy most exalted horizon through Thy power, Thy might and Thy sovereignty, and to forgive his relatives in such wise as to draw them nigh unto Thee. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Choosing. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter of that spiritual friend arrived in the days when that spiritual youth, upon him be the eternal glory of God, was dwelling in prison and abiding beneath His shadow, adorned with the remembrance and praise of the Desired One of the worlds. Therefore the world was filled with joy, and after its perusal and review it ascended to the Most Exalted Horizon and was presented before His presence. This is what the Desired One hath revealed in reply, blessed and exalted be His words:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Remembering, the All-Knowing […]</p>
<p>Thy letter reached the Wronged One and the servant present submitted it. From it We inhaled the fragrance of thy love, thy humility, thy lowliness, thy turning unto the Most Exalted Horizon, thy hearkening to the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree, and thy steadfastness in this Cause whereby feet have slipped. We have previously revealed unto thee that which spoke of My grace and My loving-kindness, and bore witness to My mercy and My bounty. Thus hath the matter been decreed from the Pen of God, the Lord of all men. In thy letter was mentioned him who ascended unto My horizon and turned toward the Most Exalted Paradise and the Supreme Summit. We have revealed for him that which hath attracted the hearts of the righteous ones. O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who was named Ahmad, who detached himself from all else save Me and turned toward My horizon, who bore hardships in My path and heard the taunts of the enemies for My sake in My days, who sought the Ultimate Goal and the Most Exalted Horizon, who traversed the path to attain the presence of the Glorious One and to hearken unto the proof and evidence from the tongue of his Lord, the Mighty, the Beautiful, until he arrived at the Prison and stood before the Gate, and heard the Call with his own ear and beheld the Most Exalted Horizon with his own eye. We bear witness that he attained unto that which the All-Merciful had revealed in former Books and wherewith He had, through His grace, given glad tidings unto His servants. He took the chalice of meeting in the name of the Lord of all beings and the Kawthar of reunion through His wondrous Command. Blessed is he, and joy be unto him, and happy and wholesome be it unto him. Verily he attained, he achieved victory, he heard and he responded. We have purified him at the time of his ascension and forgiven him as a bounty from Our presence. We beseech God to send down upon him at all times a blessing from His presence and a mercy from His own Self. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones, and He is the Ancient Bestower. Blessed is he who visiteth him, as attested by My Pen in My prison and as hath flowed from the tongue of My loving-kindness. Verily he is of the people of this exalted station.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Rida! Upon thee be the Glory of God, Creator of heaven! We have mentioned thy father in a manner unequaled by any mention among mentions. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this bounty whereby the horizons have been illumined. We enjoin thee and those with thee to gracious patience, and verily I am the All-Patient, the All-Wise. By the life of God! Were what hath been ordained for him to be revealed even less than the eye of a needle, spirits would take flight and bodies would quake. Verily thy Lord is He Who speaketh at the journey’s end.</p>
<p>Hearken in Persian: Praise be to God, he hath attained unto that which was recorded and inscribed in the divine Books of the past and present. He heard and saw that which came into being from nothingness for his sake, before his ascension and after. He attained unto the verses of the Supreme Pen. He hath been mentioned with such mention that were it cast upon the earth, it would quiver and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names, and glory be unto Thee, O Creator of Heaven!”</p>
<p>We counsel thee to patience and forbearance and pure, sincere deeds, for he is in a station where he heareth and seeth. No matter of your affairs is hidden from him. He heareth and seeth, verily his Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We have mentioned repeatedly the friends in that land, especially in these days when there hath been revealed for every city, town and village that whose fragrance shall never cease and which shall mention the loved ones in most eloquent terms. Blessed are they who attain! Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds.</p>
<p>It hath ended. Praise be to God! Before his ascension he attained unto the presence, and after his ascension they attained unto that which shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. At the time of the revelation of the Visitation Tablet, the Concourse on High uttered “Well done!” and proclaimed “How pleasant!” In truth, these are the days of ascension, for man attaineth unto that which hath no peer or likeness. In any case, the reins of grace and bounty, of mention and praise, are within His grasp. Verily He is the Single, the One, the Compassionate, the Munificent, the Generous. There is no God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>As to what was written that for a long time no word had come from the Desired One: One year before, nay more, when that deceased one was still adorned with outward life, this servant wrote a reply to the letter of that honored friend. However, due to the tyranny of an oppressor who occupied the seat of government in this land, there was delay in sending it, for that tyrant was daily lying in wait. After his removal and replacement, that letter was sent. It is hoped that by now it hath arrived. Praise be to God, thou hast been and art mentioned in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. The events of the days have caused the delay in reply. For some time in this land, the deniers and the objectors have been speaking unseemly words. Though there was delay in sending, yet nothing - neither adversity, nor tribulation, nor the opposition of the opposers, nor the denial of the transgressors, nor the authority of the oppressors - hath prevented or will prevent God, exalted be His glory, from manifesting His Cause. Verily our Lord and your Lord, our Goal and your Goal, is the Almighty, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>At this time, a letter which was sent to the spiritual friend His Honor Aqa Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God, was forwarded to the Most Holy Court and was honored to be heard in His presence. He beseeched forgiveness for the deceased and elevated one, upon him be the Glory of God, His mercy and His grace. Likewise he sought a wondrous mention for the relatives of the deceased. Once again, each one was honored with the mention of the Goal of all the worlds and His grace and mercy, one after another were mentioned in His presence. This evanescent servant begs of the True One to ordain for all both worldly and spiritual good. And concerning what was mentioned about how they desecrated the pure tomb, praise be to God that even after his ascension there befell him that which caused the Concourse on High to cry out. These abhorrent deeds are what have caused the deprivation of the servants and the descent of tribulations before and since. After this matter was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, He said: “Be not grieved by this matter. I swear by the Sun of Justice which has shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the Cause that the traces of this deed shall never be effaced from the Book of the world and the scrolls of God. The idolaters burned the remains of His Holiness the Most Holy One after his martyrdom, and after the ascension of the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - they did that which the signs of the wickedness and cruelty of those souls shall endure for as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endures. O Muhammad-Rida, from the tyranny of the Pharaohs of the earth and the oppressors of the age there hath appeared that which causeth the people of the cities of justice and fairness to lament. All the tribulations that from the beginning of the Cause until now have befallen this Wronged One, since they were for God and in the path of God, have been and are beloved. Again convey mention from the Wronged One to the relatives and console them. Say: Were the tribulations that have befallen the Truth Itself to be mentioned, the world of being would beg for non-existence. Verily your Lord is the All-Patient, the Concealer, and He biddeth His loved ones to noble concealment and beautiful patience. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the relatives of His Honor Muhammad who attained and circumambulated and was present before the Face. Verily We mentioned his father before with a mention which God, the Lord of Remembrance, hath made to endure. The Glory from Us be upon you and upon those who have held fast to the cord of God, the Lord of Lords.” The waves of the ocean of mercy have appeared successively at their utmost height. Blessed are they who have ascended in these days, for they have attained unto that which hath no peer or likeness. In any case, this servant conveyeth greetings to all and beseecheth confirmation for each one that they may attain unto that which shall be immortalized in the Book of God. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Peace and remembrance and glory be upon the servants of God whom the rancor of the wicked hath not prevented from turning unto God, the Lord of all men.</p>

<p>He is seated upon the Throne of Utterance!</p>
<p>This is a remembrance from the Wronged One to those in the realm of possibility, that it may draw them near to the Kingdom of My Name, the All-Merciful - the station wherein is heard the rustling of the Sadratu’l-Muntaha and the murmuring of the Kawthar of eternity. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto the heedless who have cast the Book of God behind their backs and taken their vain imaginings as lords beside God. They are indeed among the oppressors in My mighty Book.</p>
<p>O peoples of the earth! Fear God, and deny not My proof, and dispute not My verses, and reject not My favor which We have sent down from the heaven of My mercy. Thus doth My Most Exalted Pen counsel you on this darksome night. Hearken, and be not among the heedless. Know ye the worth of these days and their station. God hath made their lights from the light of His countenance and their radiance from the sun of His grace, that ye may give thanks unto your Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>The Tree of acceptance hath borne fruit, yet most of the people have turned away. The world hath been illumined by the Most Great Light, yet most of mankind remain asleep. All that was recorded in the Books of God and concealed in the hearts of the Prophets hath been manifested. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this in this Station which God hath made sanctified beyond the understanding of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Hear the call from the Crimson Tree raised upon the White Spot, the place of gathering: “Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Single, the All-Informed. I created the world for My knowledge and My manifestation and My days. Yet when I revealed Myself, they denied My signs and turned away from My clear proofs, until they pronounced sentence to shed My blood. Thus did their souls entice them. They are indeed among the transgressors in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds.”</p>
<p>The servant hath presented thy letter before the Wronged One, and We answer thee with this clear Book. We have heard thy cry and thy lamentation, and have seen thy turning and thy devotion, and have found in thy letter the fragrance of thy love and thy steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of the learned have slipped and the hearts of the divines have been troubled, save whom thy Lord, the Lord of the heavens and earth, hath willed.</p>
<p>Be thou aflame with the fire of My love, and hold fast to My cord, and cling to the hem of My grace, and be illumined with the light of unity that hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of My wondrous utterance. By God’s life! The people of old found not the fragrance of unity and attained not to that which the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur’an. Thus doth the Wronged One recount unto thee that thou mayest become aware of their vain imaginings and suppositions and their polytheism and their turning away on the Day of God, the Possessor of this mighty Day.</p>
<p>We testify that they are worshippers of idle fancies and their promoters. They have committed that which hath caused the Noah of days to lament, and the clouds of heaven to cry out, and the eyes of the knowing to weep. Say: O people of the Bayan and O community of the Qur’an! Fear ye the All-Merciful, then be fair in this Cause but for which the verses would not have been sent down, nor the clear proofs appeared, nor would the Point of the Bayan have spoken, nor before Him the Point of the Qur’an. The Kingdom of Utterance beareth witness to this, if ye be of the fair-minded.</p>
<p>Thus hath the scratching of My Pen been raised up. Verily it speaketh with the most exalted utterance and calleth all unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Blessed art thou, O Muhammad, for the Pen of God, Lord of the Throne and of the dust, and Lord of the exalted Seat, hath moved to make mention of thee and of those whom thou hast mentioned in thy letter.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Rida, who spoke before all faces with pure truth and manifest justice. O Muhammad-Qabli-Rida! Thou art he who hath attained unto My days, who hath voiced My praise and made mention of Me before the faces of Mine enemies - they who violated My Covenant and Testament, who disputed My verses and warred against My Self, after they had lamented My separation and beseeched My grace that there be shown unto them that which they had been promised by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We made mention of thee before in a Tablet that perfumed the world of remembrance and utterance, yet the people are in grievous doubt. Thou hast rent asunder the veils in the name of thy Lord, the Master of the Day of Return, and hast spoken that whereby the fragrance of My love, the Mighty, the Inaccessible, was diffused. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having made me to know Thee, taught me, given me to drink, guided me and drawn me nigh unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Remind My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad-tidings of that which hath been sent down for them from the heaven of My loving-kindness and the Pen of My grace, that they may be of them that render thanks.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Muhammad! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee even as He mentioned thee before. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the days of the Lord of Names, who hath entered the City of Faithfulness, who hath held fast unto His cord, who hath found intimacy with His beauty and who hath acted according to that which was inscribed in His Book. We created it and commanded all to observe it. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto; he is indeed among them that are brought near in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen made mention and guided all unto Him. He, verily, is the Counselor, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Abu-Turab! The Lord of Lords, Who hath come riding upon the clouds at the return, maketh mention of thee - He Who hath called all to the supreme horizon, the station wherein the Tree exclaimed: “The kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the worlds, and power and strength and dominion belong unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” Rejoice thou in My mention of thee. We made mention of thee before and after, and at this time wherein the Wronged One beholdeth Himself beneath the talons of hatred through that which the hands of the wicked have wrought - they who disbelieved in Him in Whom they had believed throughout ages and centuries. Thou hast attained unto that which altereth not, and there hath been sent down for thee that which God hath made a lamp unto thee in every world of His worlds. He beareth witness unto this round Whom circle the Spirit and the Point. He proclaimeth before all faces, saying: “By God! The Mother Book hath appeared. Fear ye the All-Merciful, O people of the Bayan, and be not of them who turned away when God came with power and sovereignty.” Thus hath the Treasure revealed the pearls of wisdom and utterance. Give thanks unto thy Lord, the Master of Return.</p>
<p>O Zaynu’l-’Abidin! The Lord of the worlds maketh mention of thee from the precincts of His Most Great Prison, that He might draw thee nigh unto Him on a day wherein the harbinger crieth out and the raven croaketh. Say: O peoples of the earth! Fear ye God and follow not every ignorant rabble. By God! The Tree of Grace hath yielded the fruits of knowledge. Draw ye nigh and be not of them who turned away from God when He came with the kingdom of utterance. Give thanks unto God for having enabled thee and aided thee to turn toward Him when every vainglorious learned one turned away.</p>
<p>O My Pen! Make mention of My servant who hath been named Siyyid ’Ali Zargar in the Book of Names by God, the Cleaver of Dawn. O ’Ali! Give thanks unto God for this bounty which all the treasuries of the world cannot equal. Verily, thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. The servant present hath brought thy letter and presented it before the Wronged One, and We have withheld the Pen from the decree of reply. Thus hath My consummate wisdom required, and My command that dominateth all who are in the earths and heavens. Blessed art thou for having attained unto My choice wine and believed in My Self on a day wherein most of the servants have disbelieved. We have made mention of thee and will continue to mention thee in that which shall endure as a treasure and honor unto thee. Verily, thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Grieve thou not over anything. In all matters put thy trust in God, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. Remember those whom thou didst mention in thy letter before the Wronged One, and greet their faces with joy and fragrance. Thus hath the Tree of Faithfulness revealed its fruits that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the Gracious. We counsel thee and those who have believed to be steadfast in this Cause whereby feet have slipped, and to preserve that which We have given thee. Verily, thy Lord is the Counselor, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Asadu’llah! The Wronged One of the world hath turned toward thee from the precincts of the Prison and maketh mention of thee through the Pen of His bounty and remindeth thee of His verses. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth and is the Sovereign over what is and what hath been. Thou didst attain unto My mention aforetime and in this hour which no centuries or ages can equal. We counsel thee with that whereby the Cause may be exalted and with what behooveth the days of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Say: O people of the Bayan! Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, through conduct from which the fragrance of acceptance is wafted and through deeds whereby the station of man is uplifted. Blessed is he who hath attained unto that which hath been revealed in My Book and hath acted according to what My Tongue hath uttered in this station which God hath made the Dawning-place of inspiration. Give thanks unto thy Lord that the Tongue of Grandeur hath moved to make mention of thee and the Countenance of the Ancient of Days hath turned toward thee from the Most Exalted Horizon as a token of His grace, for He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Every land which hath been honored by My footsteps hath been exalted, every mountain whereon My tent of glory hath been pitched hath trembled with joy, every mouth that hath uttered My praise hath smiled, and every horizon hath been illumined by My light before which all lights have bowed down. Hearken unto My call and arise to serve My Cause in such wise that neither the oppression of every oppressor nor the learning of any doubting scholar shall deter thee. Those who have acted in the days of God in such wise as hath caused the Maids of Heaven to weep in their chambers - We had ordained knowledge for My recognition, yet it hath prevented them from drawing nigh unto the Dayspring of Revelation and turning toward the Horizon of Evidence.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Every name hath been honored by the mention of God, the Lord of all mankind. Convey My glad-tidings unto them and remind them of that which hath been sent down from My Pen and illumine them with the lights of My utterance and acquaint them with what hath been inscribed in the Mother Book. Say: O party of God! Know ye your stations. By God! The Mother Book speaketh in your midst. In the Qur’an it was named the Most Great Announcement, and in another Book the Speaker of Sinai, and by the tongues of the Books the Lord of Lords. Say: Come, come, O people of ignorance, that ye may hear the call of your Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted, and become aware of that which was hidden in His knowledge and treasured in the repositories of His power which have encompassed the horizons. Thus hath the heaven revealed its suns and moons and stars. Behold and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Revealer of verses and Manifester of clear tokens!</p>
<p>O my God, my God! The Wronged One makes mention of Thee before Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones, and beseeches Thee by the power of Thy Most Exalted Pen, whereby Thou hast subdued the kingdom of names and all who dwell in the realm of creation, to aid us to remain steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise as to make the limbs of them that raise the cry of denial among Thine enemies to quake–they who have cast the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to their own idle fancies and vain imaginings. O Lord! Thou seest us turning unto Thee, seeking refuge at Thy presence, and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy mercy and bounty. I beseech Thee by Thy Name which Thou hast made the sovereign of names and sanctified from the mention of all who dwell in the realm of creation, to send down from the clouds of the heaven of Thy mercy that which will preserve us from all else except Thee, draw us nigh unto Thee, cause us to behold Thy signs and hearken unto Thy most exalted words. Then ordain for us through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will profit us and inscribe for us the recompense of attaining Thy presence, O Lord of all beings and King of the throne on high and of earth below. There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent over all that Thou willest. Verily Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Help in Peril.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Mighty, the Impregnable</p>
<p>The Manifestations of God have ever appeared with conclusive proofs and clear and evident testimonies, and yet in every Dispensation there hath been visited upon these sacred Temples that which the pen is powerless to recount. Much reflection is needed as to what could be the cause and reason for this. In the Persian Tablets which were formerly revealed especially for the kindred, the divine wisdom and purpose and the reason for mankind’s rejection of the Manifestations of Divine Unity have been set forth in detail. That honored one should peruse those Tablets with fairness.</p>
<p>This world hath no permanence nor worth. Ere long shall the autumn winds pass over the springtime of human existence and, by the command of the Lord of Lords, return all to dust. Therefore, while there is yet time, endeavor that ye may not be deprived of the imperishable Kawthar of the All-Glorious Lord, and that ye may not, through the clamor of the ignorant who today are known for their learning, deny yourselves the wine of immortality.</p>
<p>Reflect upon past ages: no harm ever befell any of the Manifestations of God except by permission of the divines of the age. If outward learning were sufficient, then surely the leaders of the Christian faith should today be counted among the believers, for they have attained such heights in the outward sciences as cannot be surpassed. They have even written a book in Arabic superior to the Maqamat of ?ariri, which is acknowledged by the scholars of the age as the standard in Arabic learning, eloquence and rhetoric. Similarly in other sciences such as theology, jurisprudence and philosophy they have reached the utmost degree of perfection and have authored books in every branch of learning. Yet in the sight of God they are counted among the ignorant. Thus it is clear and evident that outward learning is not the criterion, rather the purpose of knowledge is the recognition of God. Whosoever is deprived of this fundamental aim and ultimate goal shall never be reckoned among the learned in the sight of God.</p>
<p>This servant hath ever wished that the branches of the Tree might not be deprived of the breezes of the All-Merciful - and God is sufficient witness. At all times have We sought that all of that kindred should turn, sanctified from allusions and freed from intimations, toward the good-pleasure of the Friend. It is abundantly clear that the people’s allegiance to this imprisoned servant hath yielded and shall yield no fruit, for I am captive in the hands of enemies who have blocked all paths. Were I to give the details, ye would surely be saddened. Ere long shall even this prison land be transformed, such that this modicum of ease which people imagine exists shall also change. Yet despite Our knowledge of what We have related unto thee, We remain in supreme joy and delight. Whatsoever is mentioned hath been and shall be out of love for thee, that perchance thou mayest not be deprived of the boundless mercy of the All-Merciful and the clouds of divine bounty. Had this world been worthy, We would surely have protected Ourself from afflictions.</p>
<p>Hearken unto the counsel of the Most Exalted Pen, which counseleth purely for the sake of God. Should anyone, God forbid, turn away from this Cause, by what proof and evidence could he establish any truth? Nay, by God! Whoso turneth away from this Cause hath indeed turned away from all the Prophets and Messengers. Were all the power of the world to be placed in a heart […]</p>
<p>Is anyone able to bring forth a matter against which the leaders of every nation and government would object? Nay, by Him Who hath caused Me to speak His praise amongst all created things, none hath the power to bear these tribulations save him who shall appear from God. Consider what hath been the purpose of this servant and of the Primal Point, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake. Should anyone say it was for worldly gain, it is most evident that such a one is the most ignorant among men, for whoever seeketh the world must first act in such wise as to preserve his own existence, and thereafter strive to acquire worldly things. Your honor is well aware that that blessed Being was ever encompassed by tribulations, until He ascended to the Most Glorious Horizon. The circumstances of this servant are likewise known to you - you have heard what manifold trials and afflictions have befallen him at all times, and even now he is in grave peril. We cherish the hope that, God willing, you may soar on the twin wings of sanctity and detachment in the atmosphere of the love of the Sovereign Lord of creation and the King of invention, and at all times inhale the divine fragrances from the garment of spiritual glory. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Hear My words: purify thy sight from human limitations, then look with the Greatest Vision. By God! The Cause hath appeared in such wise that none denieth it save he who disbelieveth in God, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Hold fast unto the Sure Handle which hath appeared in truth between the heavens and the earth. Come forth from behind the veil in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, and fear not the clamor of the idolaters. And should anyone prevent thee from the path of the All-Merciful, know that he is Satan, though he appear in human form. Shun him, then turn to thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Compassionate. Beware lest the gestures of the people prevent thee from the Lord of the heavens and earth. Cast behind thee all gestures and take the chalice of life in the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, then drink therefrom in His name, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Pass by this world and all that is therein as a passing cloud, for it shall never profit thee. That which shall profit thee hath been ordained for thee in the heaven of mighty glory. Deprive not thyself thereof, and seek thy Lord’s grace in every morn and eve. Make up for what thou hast missed in the days of thy Lord, that thou mayest find thyself in a station of gracious glory. If thou hearken unto what We have counselled thee, God shall open before thy face the gates of mercy and bounty. He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Thus have We imparted unto thee and given thee glad tidings from God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>During Our years of sojourn in Iraq, multitudes from that land and from other regions, both from among the learned and others, attained Our presence. No soul who came before Us departed bereft of the outpourings from the Most Great Ocean of divine knowledge, until the renowned divines became agitated, and all arose to extinguish the divine Lamp. They gathered in Kazimayn, and this servant Himself desired that all should assemble in one place and voice whatever objections their base selves had concealed in their hearts. Were they to hear the answer, they should act upon that which God had commanded for this day and cease to oppose the divine Cause; and if they would not turn towards the realm of oneness, they should at least heed the counsel of the believer from among the people of Pharaoh, of whom God, exalted be His glory, hath spoken thus: “And a believing man of Pharaoh’s family, who hid his faith, said: Will ye slay a man because he saith my Lord is God, when he hath brought you clear signs from your Lord? If he be a liar, on him will be his lie, but if he is telling the truth, then some of that calamity wherewith he threateneth you will strike you.” Yet none came forward. By God! It would have been better for those souls never to have come into existence than to appear and oppose the Truth. Would that they knew - they would eat ashes, dwell in the valleys, and weep until their spirits departed their bodies. Soon shall they know at the hour of death, when the angels of chastisement come to them with mighty wrath, and they shall find for themselves neither protector nor refuge. God willing, that soul should purify his heart from the suggestions of such people and adorn it with the manifestations of the Lord of Names and Attributes. They speak that which they understand not and claim that which they possess not. Such are dead within the veils of their own selves. And the Glory rest upon you, if you heed the counsel of your Lord and be of those who are certain. Say: […]</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! My tongue beareth witness to Thy unity, my heart to Thy singleness, and my limbs and members to Thy lordship which hath encompassed all created things. I beseech Thee therefore, O my God, by Thy Name through which Thou hast caused them that love Thee to soar to the atmosphere of the glory of Thy mercy, and hast caused them that long for Thee to ascend unto the heaven of Thy holy bounty, and hast drawn them that seek Thee to the seat of Thy nearness and presence, not to leave me to myself and to my desires. Take Thou my hand by the sovereignty of Thy power and might, then give me to drink, O my God, from the Kawthar which floweth from the right hand of the throne of Thy favors, that it may cleanse me from the love of any beside Thee, in such wise that I may detach myself from all except Thee and turn unto Thee. By Thy glory, O my God! Whenever I consider my heedlessness, I am well-nigh in despair of the breathings of Thy mercy; yet whenever I turn to Thy gifts and favors, Thy dealings with Thy devoted servants fill me with hope. O my God! Deprive me not of the breezes of Thy days wherein Thou hast renewed the temples of all things with the garment of names. Then clothe me, through the hands of Thy loving-kindness, with the robes of guidance that I may glory therein in the kingdom of command and creation. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. O my God! Make my sight illumined that I may know Thee through Thee and not through aught else, for that which is beside Thee hath never been a proof of Thee except what Thou hast made as evidence from Thee amidst Thy creation. Purify mine ear that I may hearken unto Thy Most Exalted Word, and my heart for the remembrance of Thy Most Glorious and Most Beauteous Self, and my tongue for Thy praise in the kingdom of creation. Lo, O my God! I have raised the hands of hope toward the heaven of Thy mercy and forgiveness. I beseech Thee by the hands that were severed in Thy path that Thou wilt not send them back empty of what they seek from Thy grace and bounty. Thou art He, O my God, from the door of Whose mercy none of Thy servants hath ever been turned away disappointed, and he who hath been disappointed is he who hath turned away from Thee and hath not turned toward the court of Thy grace. Therefore strengthen me, O my God, in the knowledge of Thyself and sanctify me from those who have turned away from Thee. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Bestower, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>

<p>He is the Expounder, the All-Knowing!</p>
<p>O Pen! I behold thee giving utterance by night and by day. At one time I hear thy melodies, and at another thy sighing and weeping. It is as though patience hath been severed from thee at dawn when I hear thy lamentations, at eventide thy crying, and at daybreak that which hath caused the hearts of the mystics to burn. It sayeth: “How can I not lament when I behold Thee in the hands of the oppressors? How can I not cry out within myself when Thou art among those who have cast behind their backs Thy covenant and Thy testament, who have denied Thy favor, who have disputed Thy signs, and who have committed that which hath caused the Faithful Spirit to moan?” Be patient, O Pen, for verily thy Lord, the All-Forbearing, commandeth thee to show beautiful patience. We have accepted all tribulations for the sake of manifesting the Cause. Nothing among all things can prevent Us. Set aside thy sorrows; take up that which thou art bidden by the One Who commandeth, the All-Knowing. Make mention of My loved ones in Ba and Dal. Say: “Blessed are ye for having turned unto God when every learned one was far removed from Him. We testify that ye have heard the Call and have attained that which most of mankind have failed to attain.” To this beareth witness the Most Great Announcement in this exalted station.</p>
<p>O Abu-Talib! Thou art he who hath traversed land and sea and hast attained the presence of the Face in this mighty prison, and hast heard the Call when it was raised betwixt earth and heaven, and hast gained the Kawthar of utterance from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the Gracious. We beseech God to aid thee and thy children and those who are with thee to remain steadfast with such steadfastness as will not be shaken by the doubts of the divines nor by the intimations of the deluded ones who have denied the signs of God after their revelation and have rejected the proof of God, the Exalted, the Great.</p>
<p>O Qasim! The Lord of the worlds maketh mention of thee in the Most Great Prison and counseleth thee with that which will elevate thy station and the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds. Arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as will astonish the hearts of the doubtful ones. Say: “O concourse of the earth! By God, the Promise hath come, and the Promised One calleth aloud from every direction. Why do I see you at such obvious remoteness?” We counsel thee with the wisdom We have sent down in diverse Tablets, a command from the presence of One knowing, informed.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! We have heard thy call and seen thy letter. We have mentioned thee time and again with that which the remembrances of all nations cannot equal. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this great favor. Illumine the hearts of My loved ones with the light of My utterance and remind them of that which hath been sent down from My Most Exalted Pen, and give them the glad-tidings of that which hath been ordained for them in My Perspicuous Book. When thou hast quaffed the choice wine of revelation from the hand of My bounty, say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! Thy remembrance is my hope, Thy Name is my healing, Thy praise is my life. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne and by the splendors of the Day-Star of Thy Revelation to aid me in serving Thy Cause in all conditions. Thou art, verily, the Confirmer, the Mighty, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>O Abdul-Karim! We have heard the call of My loved ones. We have mentioned them through My grace and mercy in this station wherein My Pen proclaimeth that there is none other God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. There hath befallen Us in the path of God that which hath befallen no one before. To this testifieth the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Be thou steadfast in the Cause in such wise that the doubts of those who have denied the Day of Judgment shall not hinder thee. They have cast the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to that which they possess. They are, verily, among the most lost in the sight of God, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>O Siyyid, O Nasru’llah! The throne maketh mention of thee and the seat proclaimeth thy turning unto God. Thou hast heard the Call and attained unto that which was recorded in God’s scrolls and books and scriptures, and I am the All-Knowing Witness. Be thou a helper of My Cause, one who speaketh My praise amongst My servants, and hold thou fast unto My strong cord. Thou hast attained unto My tablets time and again, and unto My wondrous and glorious remembrance. Convey My greetings unto My loved ones there. Say: This is the Day of remembrance and praise, did ye but know, and this is the Day of steadfastness, could ye but understand, and this is the Day whereon the Wronged One proclaimeth before all faces: The Kingdom is God’s, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O heedless ones! Be fair in your judgment, by God, and follow not the manifestations of idle fancies and vain imaginings. The days are ended and the Orb of the Promise hath appeared - and this is the Promised One. Thus hath spoken the Most Great Ocean while established upon the Ark of utterance, as bidden by Him Who is the Commander, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who is named Aqa Kishi that he may rejoice in the remembrance of the Wronged One and arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as shall not be shaken by the stumbling of the learned, nor stirred by the doubts of the divines, nor hindered by the veils of the world and the mists of the nations. He, verily, is the Counsellor, the Perspicuous, the All-Informed. The morn of truth hath dawned, and therein doth the Book of Dawn speak forth with an utterance whereby all things were attracted. Exalted be the All-Merciful Who doeth what He willeth by His command that prevaileth over all who are in the heavens and on earth. When thou hast drunk from the Euphrates of mercy that floweth from My Most Exalted Pen, say:</p>
<p>O Lord of all beings and King of the throne on high and of earth below! I beseech Thee by Thy signs that have filled the horizons, and by Thy sovereignty that hath been manifested on the Day of the Covenant, and by the breathings of Thy revelation whereby discord was changed to concord and the Dove of Knowledge warbled upon the highest branches, to aid Thy loved ones to serve Thy Cause. O Lord! Thou beholdest them turning toward Thy most exalted horizon and holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty. O Lord of the Hereafter and of this world! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance to ordain for them what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who were not kept back by wealth or aspirations, nor by the manifestations of beauty and glory, from turning toward the scene of martyrdom. Thou art, verily, the Lord of all names and the Creator of the heavens. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Mention was made of thee in the presence of the Wronged One, whereupon My Most Exalted Pen was moved to make mention of thee in this glorious and wondrous station. Blessed is the servant whose name was mentioned in My presence and who attained unto the tokens of My Pen and was honored by the utterance of the tongue of My grandeur. He is assuredly among the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise in the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Know thou, moreover, that when the spirit ascendeth to the All-Highest Companion, it presenteth itself before God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting, and the hand of divine favor and bounty guideth it to a station that none knoweth save Him Who declareth in every condition that there is no God but He, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Loving. Blessed is the spirit that hath left the body purified from the doubts of the nations. By the life of God! It moveth in the atmosphere of its Lord’s desire and entereth the gardens as it willeth, and the holy maidens of Paradise serve it in the morning and in the evening. It consorteth with the Prophets of God and His chosen ones, converseth with them, and relateth unto them that which hath appeared in the days of God, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Were We to lift the veil from what We have mentioned, thou wouldst see the people hastening from all directions unto God, the Lord of all mankind. Blessed is the ear that hath heard My call, and the eye that hath beheld the horizon of My loving-kindness, and the tongue that hath spoken My praise, and the hand that hath taken hold of the Mother Book.</p>
<p>O Abdul-Khaliq! Verily the creature is in wondrous doubt, not knowing what they should remember at morn and eventide. They have taken their desires and their own selves as gods beside God. Lo! They are in heedlessness and error. Give thanks unto God for having strengthened thee when people were in doubt and schism. Thou didst turn and bear witness to that which God hath testified from His most exalted station. We counsel thee and those who have believed to the Most Great Steadfastness. Thus hath spoken the Tongue of Grandeur from this station which hath been named with the Most Beautiful Names in the Book of God, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>O Joseph! The Most Exalted Pen hath made mention of thee before and after, and hath revealed for thee that which consoleth the eyes of the righteous. When My call took hold of thee and the choice wine of Mine utterance intoxicated thee, say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the pavilion of Thy glory, the tabernacle of Thy grandeur, the canopy of Thy loftiness, the heaven of Thy utterance, and the clouds of Thy mercy, and by the Word whereby Thou hast subdued all hearts, and by the Light wherewith Thou hast illumined the horizons, to strengthen me and Thy loved ones in steadfastness in Thy Cause in such wise that the winds of doubts may not move them. Verily, Thou art the Lord of Names and Attributes. Then write down for them, O my God, that which Thou hast written for Thy chosen ones from Thy Most Exalted Pen. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Bountiful.”</p>
<p>O Israfil! By the life of God! The Balance hath been set up, the Path established, the mountains have passed away, the Cry hath been raised, the Inevitable hath come, and the Trumpet hath been blown, yet the people have not risen from the graves of heedlessness and desire. Thus hath the matter been decreed. Verily thy Lord is the Expositor, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord, and firm in such wise that the roaring of the mighty shall not deter thee. Beware lest the happenings of the world grieve thee. Cast them behind thee, turning with thy purest heart unto God, the Revealer of verses. Thou hast been mentioned time and again by the Pen when it spoke, whereat all pens proclaimed: “The utterance belongeth unto God, the Powerful, the One, the Chosen.” Take thou the chalice of Mine utterance from the hand of My bounty, then drink thereof in My Name and say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having given me to drink, and for having made me to know, and taught me, and drawn me nigh when I was in prison amidst the enemies of Thy Self. Would that I had been non-existent and had not heard what hath befallen Thee! I beseech Thee by Thy power which hath encompassed the horizons, and by Thy Name whereby Thou hast subdued lands and servants, to assist Thy loved ones to be steadfast in Thy Cause. O Lord! Disappoint them not of that which Thou hast ordained in Thy Book. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent before Whose manifestation of power the power of the world hath been impotent, and Thou art the Sovereign before Whose exaltation the exaltation of nations is not mentioned. Verily, Thou art God, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>O Iskandar! Where is Alexander and his hosts? Where is the clashing of his swords and the neighing of his steeds? Where are his yellow and red battalions? Where are the manifestations of his power in the kingdom of creation? Where is his might whereby the limbs of the world trembled? Where is his power which encompassed the nations? Where are his lofty palaces and his ordered affairs? Where are his trellised gardens and his furnished houses? Where is his kindled lamp? By God! His lamps have been extinguished, his foundations have been uprooted, his treasures scattered, his tongue and sight withheld from utterance and observation, and his feet and hands stayed from taking what the people bring. The hand of destiny hath brought him down from palaces to tombs. Take ye warning, O people of insight! When thou hearest the stories of My Most Exalted Pen, say[…]</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, clinging to Thy cord, and directing my face to the lights of Thy countenance. I beseech Thee, by the ocean of Thy mercy and the splendors of the Sun of Thy bounty, to make me detached from all else save Thee, speaking in Thy remembrance, arising to serve Thy loved ones, and gazing toward Thy horizon. By Thy might, O Lord of the worlds and Goal of the nations! I love naught but what Thou lovest, and desire naught but what Thou desirest. I implore Thee to assist me in all that I have mentioned before Thy face. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the All-Protecting, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>The Most Exalted Leaf of Paradise - upon her be all His most glorious Splendor - should take note:</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath revealed Himself unto all created things through His Name, the Self-Subsisting. Thereupon appeared upheaval between earth and heaven. Among the people, some turned away while others turned towards Him. Blessed is he who hath fulfilled God’s Covenant and His Testament, and woe unto him who hath violated it through his own injustice. He is assuredly among the transgressors in God’s Book, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this servant hath been blessed by that which hath appeared and shone forth from the heaven of your love, your sincerity, and your steadfastness in the Cause of God, our Lord and your Lord, our Beloved and your Beloved, and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and the earth. When I read your letter and understood its contents, I approached the Intended One and presented it before His presence. Thereupon the tongue of the All-Merciful spoke that which all the treasures of creation cannot equal. He, exalted be His glory, said: “O My handmaiden! O My leaf! O thou who art attracted by My verses! Blessed art thou and blessed is every handmaiden who hath attained unto this most exalted station. She is indeed of the people of Baha in God’s Book, the Most High, the Most Great. We have heard thy mention, have answered thee before, and have revealed for thee that which will draw thee nigh unto the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Glorify from Me the faces of My handmaidens and give them the glad-tidings of My gracious remembrance. We counsel the men and women servants to show forth the greatest steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of the chosen ones have slipped save those who were taken by the breezes of their Lord’s mercy, the Generous One. This is a Day wherein the Self-Subsisting hath arisen and mankind hath stood before the face of their Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed is he who hath recognized and attained, and woe unto the deniers.”</p>
<p>God willing, may all in these matchless days arise to accomplish that which the Beloved desireth, in such wise that the cawing of the world shall not withhold them from the choice wine of the Most Great Name. The cawing hath been raised, and shall continue to be raised - this is what We have informed you of before. He is verily the Forgiving, the Merciful. All must hold fast unto wisdom and occupy themselves with teaching the Cause. That which today causeth the clamor of the polytheists and deniers is outside the bounds of wisdom. O My loved ones! Shun ye that which ye have been forbidden in God’s Book, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the fire of God’s love in pure hearts and souls - blessed are they and joy be unto them. God willing, may they be so enkindled by a fire that its effects become manifest in the world. However, in all conditions they must not let go of wisdom. In these days, in one of the lands, a person proclaimed the Word from pulpits without discretion. This action was not acceptable in the Holy Presence. They stated that this matter would cause clamor and perturbation among weak souls. The people of Baha must at all times partake of the water of life with perfect wisdom and offer it to others. Teaching God’s Cause through wisdom is beloved. The soil of hearts and souls must first be prepared for the casting of the seed, and then one may proceed with what is intended.</p>
<p>As to those souls who have arisen to serve the Cause, concerning whom you wrote, their names were one by one presented at the Most Holy Court. Regarding each one, the Sun of loving-kindness dawned from the horizon of God’s will. His words, exalted be His glory: “Blessed are ye, O people of Baha, for ye have cast aside the cup of extinction and taken, in His Name, the cup of everlasting life, drinking therefrom in remembrance of the Beloved. Happy are ye, and joy be unto you, for ye have heard, turned unto Him, and recognized that which most of mankind hath rejected. Verily your Lord, the All-Knowing, is the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Loving. Beware lest ye be frightened by the authority of rulers, saddened by the intimations of the divines, or the doubts of those who have denied God, the Lord of existence. Hold fast to the cord of service to your Lord, the All-Merciful. Verily, He heareth and seeth, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. We were with you when ye arose to serve the Cause, and We heard your call when ye entered the designated place. By the life of God! Ye have attained to that which none before you hath attained, as testified by Him Who, at His bidding, moveth the Supreme Pen upon a preserved tablet.”</p>
<p>The call of each one hath been heard, their names are recorded in God’s Book, and their deeds are witnessed in His presence. God willing, may they arise to that which befitteth this glorious and wondrous Day, and act with perfect steadfastness and sincerity as is befitting. Every deed that causeth commotion is this day forbidden at the Divine Threshold, and shall continue to be so.</p>
<p>His honor Asad, upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness, and likewise his honor ’Ali, upon him be My Baha, have presented detailed accounts of each land at the Most Holy Court. Through his honor Asad, the petitions from the land of Kha were presented to the Most Great Vision and their answers were previously sent. God willing, may they receive them.</p>
<p>O ye wise ones of the earth and money-changers of the realm! The discernment of pearls is beloved in the sight of the All-Seeing. He who is deprived of sight knoweth not its worth and attaineth not to its recognition. The ear capable of hearing is rare indeed. God willing, may they open it in the name of Truth and utter the Word.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about making the house wherein dwelt the Most Great Bab - may the spirit of all who dwell in the Kingdom of Names be sacrificed for Him - a Mashriqu’l-Adhkar, this was most acceptable in the Divine Presence, and He said, exalted be His glory: “It is considered in God’s sight as the most exalted of houses, and it is more worthy than other houses for this most glorious and impregnable station. However, all must act in such a way as not to cause disturbance to devoted souls. O Leaf of Paradise! We have accepted thy house and adorned it with the ornament of acceptance, as a bounty from Us, and We are verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Blessed art thou, and blessed is thy house, and those who have attained unto that which they were commanded by God, the Lord of the worlds.”</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about Baha’u’llah, they have been and are under the glance of favor. This matter was presented at the Most Holy Court. This is what the All-Giving revealed in reply, His grandeur be exalted: “The favor of God has been with him. Praise be to God, he has attained to the recognition of Truth, love of the friends of Truth, and service to the Cause of Truth. This is among those matters that have not been and will never be lost in the sight of God. This land is inwardly turbulent though outwardly calm, and this matter has previously flowed from the Most Exalted Pen; therefore, attention to and pause in this land is outside of wisdom. We have accepted his attention, his presence, his arising, his mention and his praise. Let him thank God for this great bounty and praise Him for this favor that has preceded all things. Glory be upon him and upon his father who attained the trace of My Most Exalted Pen on this blessed and wondrous Day.”</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about the spiritual lady, upon her be the Glory of God, requesting that mention be made of her and Mr.&nbsp;Muhammad-Rida and their mother, upon her be the Glory of God, in the Most Holy and Exalted Court - as requested, it was presented. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke: “O Ru?ani! You have been mentioned before the Throne in successive years and have attained what has appeared from My Most Exalted Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets. We have mentioned you and mention you in such wise that the events of the world cannot change it nor can the conditions of nations prevent it. Verily your Lord is the Powerful, the All-Choosing. And We mention him who was named Muhammad before Rida as a mercy from Us that he might rejoice in what was sent down to him from God, the Lord of Lords. Give him My glad tidings and glorify upon his face. Verily your Lord does what He wishes and decrees what He desires. Blessed is he and you and your mother who has attained this mention through which the breeze of the All-Merciful has wafted over the servants.”</p>
<p>[Rest of translation continues similarly with the remaining text, maintaining the same elevated style]</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about the son of the emigrant who emigrated and attained, it was presented before the Throne. Then the Tongue of the All-Merciful spoke in the Kingdom of Utterance, and He said, exalted be His grandeur: “God willing, he has been and is favored by divine grace. Today all relationships are firmly established with the Truth. Today is a great Day, mentioned in all scriptures and books as the Day of God. One word revealed in this victorious Day concerning a soul is and will be superior to a hundred thousand children and descendants. The divine word is like unto spirit, and the spirit has drunk from the Kawthar of life and attained eternal life. Whatever is observed on earth will certainly return to extinction, but the divine word remains fresh and verdant in the gardens of the books and will endure as long as the kingdom and the realm of God endure. Muhammad-’Ali attained the presence time after time and reached this lofty station which was adorned with the ornament of permission. Blessed is he.”</p>
<p>And likewise concerning his two brothers, wondrous verses were revealed from the heaven of will. Praise be to God, their emigration after the ascension was adorned with the ornament of acceptance and they attained to God’s infinite mercy.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about inheritance, it was presented. This firm decree has issued and been revealed from the Source of God’s Command. Let that leaf take possession of one unit thereof, and the remainder God has bestowed upon themselves to divide among themselves. Verily He is the Giving, the Generous. The Glory from Us be upon you and upon her and upon whoever has turned to God, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The supplication of this evanescent servant is that at no time may he be effaced from the benevolent gaze of the friends of God who have quaffed from the true wine and are turned towards the lights of His Countenance. He is engaged in serving all through the new proclamation. God willing, may all arise with perfect wisdom and unity in the Cause of the Lord of creation, in such wise that its effect may become manifest from all directions. This is not difficult for our Mighty Lord. The confirmations of the Revealer of verses are manifest. God willing, may they take hold of all souls and guide them to the straight path and the firm balance. This has been and ever shall be dependent upon the endeavor and steadfastness of the loved ones of Truth. It is hoped they may be assisted to achieve that which befitteth this most exalted, most holy Day. May the glory shining from the horizon of the loving-kindness of our Lord, the Most Merciful, be upon you and upon those with you and upon them that have attained unto this Day wherein the Path hath been laid and the Balance set up. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Bestower.</p>

<p>In the name of our Lord, the Most Impregnable, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath made His Most Glorious Name a light and a mercy and an honor and a treasure for the people of guidance, and a fire and a chastisement and a sword for the people of tyranny and wickedness. Exalted is He at Whose Name the limbs of the treacherous have trembled and at Whose mention the foundation of the idolaters hath been shaken. He is indeed the One Whom neither the veils of the people nor the glory of those who have denied this Day have hindered. And peace and blessings be upon His Prophets and His Messengers who have sacrificed all they possessed in His path and have arisen to serve His Cause in such wise that His banners were unfurled throughout the lands and the standards of His guidance were raised amidst His servants.</p>
<p>And now, the letter of that true beloved hath bestowed upon this thirsty one that which is as the pure water unto the sapling and as light unto the horizons. After its perusal and review, it was presented in the Most Holy Court, whereupon He commanded: Write to S.M.: The Wronged One counseleth all to patience and steadfastness, to serenity and dignity. The hearts of them that are nigh and sincere must not be saddened by the deeds of the oppressors and the heedless. Such souls have never, in any age or dispensation, obeyed the divine command and have, with the utmost tyranny and injustice, visited upon the Manifestations of God’s Cause and the Dawning-places of His revelation that which all have heard. However, in the sight of God these base and vile ones have neither worth nor station. The friends of God must in all matters place their trust in God and commit their affairs unto Him, and must supplicate in the nights and days with the utmost lowliness and devotion for all who dwell on earth, that perchance they may not remain deprived of the living waters nor be denied the fruits of the tree of true humanity. They must at all times keep before their eyes the divine counsels and be not heedless. The heedless souls have risen up with satanic hosts to extinguish the divine light; you must assist through the hosts of goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. God is in Himself powerful and mighty. Whatsoever He willeth appeareth instantly. His power prevaileth over all powers, and His will triumpheth over the will of all who are on earth and in heaven. The oppressor seeketh victory over Us through the might of his hosts, while We seek victory over him through the One Who is nigh, the Strong, the Triumphant, the Powerful. What fruit did the calumniator reap, and what station did the wolf attain, and what benefit did the serpent gain? By God’s life, all are in manifest loss. Were the lamentation of but one of those souls to be heard, all who dwell on earth would be struck with terror. O S.M.! Those souls who in these days have rendered service in God’s path, who have given shelter to the captives, or who have shown regard - all are recorded and inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Book. God will surely reward them with a goodly reward and recompense them with a great recompense. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! By divine bestowals you have been and continue to be favored. As commanded, write to my beloved Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, that they should not remain in the Land of ?a. They should certainly spend some time away, as this is closer to piety. The funds that the distinguished person, may God the Blessed and Exalted assist him, paid for the Huquq - blessed is he and joy be unto him! And now as commanded, regarding the fifty tumans that were first transferred, if received, twenty tumans should be delivered in the Land of Kaf to the honored matron, the Mother of the Sacred Precinct, upon her be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and thirty tumans to the beloved Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be the Glory of God, Master of Power. More will arrive later, God willing. And regarding the five units that the honored wife of him who ascended to God, upon her be the Glory of God, designated for the Huquq - mention of its receipt was revealed in the Tablet to that honored leaf from the heaven of the Divine Will and was accepted. As commanded, the aforementioned funds should be delivered in the Land of Kha to the spiritual beloved ’Ayn-Zayn, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, as they have incurred debt and the sooner it reaches them the more beloved it is in the sight of God. They have been wronged and considerable sums have been taken from them. Regarding what they mentioned about the honored gentleman, His Holiness the Name of God Mim-Ha, upon him be all His Most Glorious Glory - all that was sent of their letters was received and replies were sent twice. In any case, the hosts of God have been and will always be victorious. In the prison, mention is made of them and those with His Holiness most of the time, especially in the Most Holy and Exalted Presence and among the people of the pavilion of infallibility and grandeur. The entire world bears witness to their sanctity, detachment, piety, righteousness and success, and likewise to the oppression, transgression, tyranny, lies and hypocrisy of those who have caused harm to the party of Truth, exalted be His glory. He said: Write, O thou who hast turned unto the Face! Reflect upon the injustice of the people. The Name of God who has desired naught but good and reform, and who has been occupied day and night in service to humanity - the atoms of creation bear witness to their truthfulness, sincerity, trustworthiness, religiosity and oppressed state, as well as that of the other prisoners. Nevertheless, they abandoned justice and acted without it. End quote. This evanescent servant beseeches the Lord of all beings night and day to grant them deliverance and ordain their meeting. Verily our Lord is powerful over all things, wise. Regarding what was written about the honored beloved, the ?akim, upon him be the Glory of God - they arrived in Beirut from the great city and proceeded to Damascus. Until now they have not arrived in this land. Wherever they are, may they be safe and at rest under the shadow of divine favor. Regarding what was written about my master Amin, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors - yes, these matters are with them and truly they have arisen to serve with utmost dedication. They are occupied day and night. This evanescent servant beseeches the Truth to confirm them, although what confirmation could be greater than that their service has been accepted? In these days they wrote a letter to this servant. God willing, a reply will be sent. If that beloved one writes to them, they should mention God’s favors toward them.</p>
<p>As regards the sum which, according to the pen of that beloved and honored brother, His Holiness Haji Khalil, upon him be Baha’u’llah, has been given and through which they have attained to this bounty - mention was previously made of the bestowals of God, exalted be His glory, concerning them. And as to what the beloved one, His Holiness A.B., upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, has written to that beloved one saying that they should await further news from them - this is very good and depends upon their will. The sum which the honored master, His Holiness Amin, upon him be Baha’u’llah, has sent by draft pertains to the Huquq which His Holiness Haji Ali, upon him be Baha’u’llah, was to deliver to His Holiness A.H., upon him be from all the Most Glorious Beauty, and they were to deliver this amount to that beloved one. The details of this were also previously submitted, that it should reach Kaf and His Holiness Ibn-i-Abhar. What more can I say regarding His Holiness A.B., upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, and what befell him in the path of God - he has endured great hardships: on one side the oppression of the polytheists and enemies, and on the other the oppression of the internal hypocrites - the latter oppression being greater and more severe. Thus after this matter was submitted in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke this verse: “Indeed, as was said of old: The oppression of kinsmen is more painful to bear for man than the blow of a polished sword.”</p>
<p>In truth, this is so. This servant is greatly amazed by souls who possess not the weight of a gnat in dignity nor the steadfastness of a fly - the lowliest creatures of the earth are and have been better than such souls. In truth, those souls were not worthy of this station and were eliminated by the sieve of tests. A hundred thousand thanks to the Beloved of the worlds that He confirmed them and made them the target of tribulations and trials in the path of His love. Whatever has befallen them was for God and unto God shall it return.</p>
<p>As to the mention they had made of the honored master, His Holiness Nabil-i-Musafir, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors - it was submitted. Praise be to God, they are blessed with His favors and are mentioned in His presence. After the submission of this supreme word, from the Kingdom of utterance was revealed - His glory be exalted: “God willing, may they be confirmed in that which is befitting. Remember him on My behalf and give him the glad tidings of My mercy and My favors. God willing, may they be protected and adorned with the favors of God. In the gathering of inner meanings their mention has been and is made, and in the school of the knowledge of the All-Merciful they are as interpreters. Blessed be he from the Wronged One, the Grief-Stricken.” End quote. This evanescent servant also conveys greetings and praise to them and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to confirm them in that which is lasting and eternal.</p>
<p>As to what was mentioned concerning the honored brother Aqa Shaykh Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God - in these days petitions have arrived from those regions through the spiritual friend Jinab-i-Shaykh Abu’l-Qasim, upon him be the Glory of God, wherein mention was made of Jinab-i-Aqa Shaykh Muhammad. It appears that he is engaged in commerce. The response to these petitions has been sent down from the heaven of grace and will be forwarded, God willing. The servant beseeches his Lord to assist him in His remembrance and praise and the service of His Cause, and to ordain for him that which shall profit him in all the worlds of His worlds. Verily, He is powerful over all things. I convey greetings and glorification to him as well. The Glory shining forth from the horizon of the bounty of our Lord and your Lord be upon you and upon those who are with you.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p>This Wronged One intends, for the sake of God, to impart unto you that which is the source of everlasting life and eternal remembrance. There can be no doubt that the purpose of creation hath ever been the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory. Now must man, purely for the sake of the Intended One, ponder what hath been the cause of souls turning towards the Dawning-Places of Revelation and the Daysprings of Inspiration throughout the ages and centuries, and what hath been the reason for their rejection. Shouldst thou attain to the recognition of this station, thou wilt have attained unto all good, and wilt not be deprived of the surging waves of the ocean of the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory. Thou shalt behold all else besides God as non-existent and as naught.</p>
<p>When man attaineth the age of maturity, he must investigate and, putting his trust in God and sanctified from love and hate, reflect upon that whereunto the people adhere. He must hear with his own ears and see with his own eyes, for if he looketh through the eyes of another, he will be deprived of beholding the effulgent rays of the Sun of Divine Knowledge. Various parties exist in the world, and each hath regarded itself as being in the right, as He, exalted be He, hath said: “Each party rejoiceth in what it possesseth.”</p>
<p>Consider the Seal of the Prophets - may the life of all else be a sacrifice unto Him. When that true Luminary dawned above the horizon of Hijaz by God’s leave, the various parties turned away and arose to shed His most pure blood. That which caused the eyes of the Concourse on High to weep and the hearts of the sincere ones and those near unto God to burn was visited upon Him. One must reflect upon the cause and reason for such opposition. God, exalted be His glory, saith: “No Messenger cometh unto them but they mock at him.” There can be no doubt that had the Manifestations of God’s commandments and the Sources of His laws appeared in accordance with that which the people possessed of signs, tidings, and texts concerning His appearance, none would have turned away. Rather, all would have attained to that for which they were created from nothingness and adorned with the ornament of existence from utter non-existence.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is incumbent upon everyone to observe the Cause of God with justice and fairness and to reflect upon it. The Imami divines believe that when the promised Qa’im appeareth, He will utter a word in the House of God which will cause the chiefs to turn away and take flight. This is the word which that party acknowledges and confesseth. Now reflect upon the heedlessness of some who accept and confirm the turning away of the chiefs - who, according to their own belief, are the most distinguished of men after the Imams - yet do not suspect that this turning away might be without right. In any case, hear with the ear of fairness the call of this Wronged One and that which He hath mentioned. The truth and His straight path shall be made manifest unto thee. They do not reflect for a moment that perchance that which hath appeared is the truth and that this rejection and these objections have proceeded from heedlessness and ignorance. We beseech God to aid you to behold with the eye of justice and fairness and to discern. Verily, He is […]</p>
<p>God speaketh the truth and guideth to the path, and He is the Mighty, the Beautiful. Jesus, Son of Mary - the peace of God and His loving-kindness be upon Him - appeared with clear signs and brilliant evidences, and His purpose was the salvation of mankind. Every fair-minded one beareth witness and every informed one testifieth that He sought naught for Himself and desired nothing save to guide the wayward unto the straight path of God. Yet there befell that Most Holy Beauty that which caused the dwellers of Paradise to lament, and matters became so grievous for Him that God, exalted be His glory, by His supreme Will caused Him to ascend unto the fourth heaven. What was the cause of what transpired? By God’s life, it was the opposition of the divines! For Annas and Caiaphas, who were of the Pharisees - that is, the scholars of the Torah - together with the priests of idols denied Him and occupied themselves with cursing and reviling Him.</p>
<p>Consider likewise Moses and all the other Prophets. Perchance what hath been mentioned in this leaf may enable thee to attain true understanding and arise to serve the Cause with such determination as will neither be shaken by the onslaught of the oppressors nor altered by the opposition of the divines. Hearken unto the call of this Wronged One, and turn from the left hand of fancy to the right hand of certainty, and from the west of doubt and misgiving to the orient of assurance.</p>
<p>From the earliest days this Wronged One hath been in the hands of His enemies. Surely ye have heard of some of the tribulations that have befallen Him. Through God’s grace, exalted be His glory, We imparted before all people, both divines and princes, without any veil or concealment, that which would lead to the salvation and tranquility of all. No matter or thing prevented or hindered Us. And now too, in the Most Great Prison, We have mentioned for the sake of God that which is a clear book for the fair-minded.</p>
<p>Observe, then remember what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an through His words, exalted be He: “Leave them to plunge in vain discourse and play.” We hope that through divine grace thou wilt attain unto this word and act upon it - that thou wilt pass beyond all else save God, namely those things that cause hindrance and lead to veiling, and hold fast to that which leadeth to attainment and arrival. Great is the Cause and mighty the matter!</p>
<p>This is the Day concerning which He saith: “O my son! If there be (the weight of) a mustard-seed and it were (hidden) in a rock, or (anywhere) in the heavens or in the earth, God will bring it forth: for God is Subtle and Aware.” This is the Day whereon whatsoever lieth hidden in the hearts and souls shall be made manifest. Reflect upon those souls who freely sacrificed their lives and property in the path of love for the Self-Sufficient Lord. He verily will guide thee to His straight path and His mighty announcement.</p>
<p>Consider Noah and Hud and Salih - the blessings of God be upon them. What was the purpose of those Dawning-Places of the Cause, and what befell them? This servant hath not been of the learned, nor did He attend school. According to outward appearance, He was born in the house of one of the government officials and was related to him. The Cause is in God’s hands, thy Lord, the Lord of the Throne and […]</p>
<p>Dust, and the Lord of the world to come and the world that was! None can stay His command or thwart His decree. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Hearken unto the voice of Him Who hath been wronged. Cleanse thy heart with the waters of detachment, and adorn thy head with the crown of justice and thy temple with the robe of godliness, and say: My God, my God! I bear witness to Thy unity and Thy oneness, and acknowledge that which the tongues of Thy Prophets and Messengers have spoken, and that which Thou hast sent down in Thy Books and Tablets and Scriptures and Holy Writings.</p>
<p>O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I bear witness with my outer and inner tongue that Thou art God; there is none other God but Thee, the One, the Single, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O my God, for my grievous transgressions and my grave misdeeds, and for my heedlessness which hath prevented me from turning toward the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Dawning-Place of Thy clear tokens, and from beholding the effulgent lights of the morn of Thy Revelation and witnessing the traces of Thy Pen.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O my Goal and my Adored One! I know not for which of my calamities I should weep and lament. Shall I bewail that which hath passed me by in the days wherein the Day-Star of Thy Revelation shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy will, or shall I weep and wail for my remoteness from the court of Thy nearness when the pavilion of Thy glory was raised upon the most exalted standard through Thy power and sovereignty?</p>
<p>O my God! The more Thy tenderness toward me increaseth and Thy forbearance in chastising me prolongeth, the more do my heedlessness and waywardness increase. Thou didst remember me when I was silent in Thy remembrance, and Thou didst turn toward me through the Manifestation of Thyself when I had turned away from directing myself to the lights of Thy countenance, and Thou didst call me when I was heedless of hearkening to Thy call from the Dawning-Place of Thy Cause.</p>
<p>By Thy glory! Heedlessness hath encompassed me from all directions as I followed the dictates of self and passion. Alas, alas, my will hath held me back from Thy will, and my desire hath veiled me from Thy desire, such that I clung to my path, forsaking Thy straight path and Thy mighty announcement.</p>
<p>Thou seest and hearest, O my God, my sighing and my weeping, my crying and my lowliness and my tribulation. O Lord! The temple of disobedience seeketh the waves of the ocean of Thy forgiveness and pardon, and the essence of heedlessness seeketh the wonders of Thy gifts and favors.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, the clamor of the people hath prevented me from hearkening to Thy utterance, and the croaking of Thy creatures hath veiled me from gazing toward the horizon of Thy Cause. By Thy glory! I desire to weep throughout the duration of Thy kingdom and dominion. How can I not weep when mine eyes have been prevented from beholding the lights of the Sun of Thy Revelation and mine ears from hearkening to Thy mention and Thy praise?</p>
<p>By Thy glory, O God of the world and Sovereign of nations! I desire to hide my face beneath the layers of earth and its dust out of shame for what my hands of heedlessness have wrought. Alas, alas! Thou wert with me and didst hear from me that which was unworthy of Thee, yet through Thy grace Thou didst conceal it and didst not expose my wretched state and deeds and words.</p>
<p>Alas, alas! I know not what Thou hast ordained for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen, nor what Thy will hath decreed, O Lord of all names and Creator of heaven! Alas, alas, that Thy fixed decree should prevent me from Thy sealed wine! I beseech Thee by the breaths of Thy revelation and the lights of Thy throne, and by that through which the fragrance of Thy garment was wafted in Hijaz and […]</p>
<p>I beseech Thee by the light of Thy Cause which hath illumined both earth and heaven, to make me in all conditions turn toward Thee, detached from all else save Thee, holding fast unto Thy cord and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy bounty and generosity, and to choose for myself what Thou hast chosen for me through Thy great favor and Thy most great gifts. O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all things! There is none other God but Thee, the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below, the Ruler of this world and of the world to come.</p>

<p>Praise, sanctified from all that the people possess, befitteth Him Who is the Beloved of all, Who hath created the entire world through a single Word, and hath adorned it with knowledge and understanding, that all might drink from the choice wine of reunion and be nourished by the Kawthar of utterance unto true knowledge. Some among the servants, through the attraction of the Divine Word, have turned with utmost longing, joy, attraction and enkindlement toward the Dawning-Place of Revelation and the Day-Spring of Divine utterance, while others, due to the veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings, remained deprived of their Beloved. They neither hearkened to His call nor attained unto His horizon. They are deprived of the choice wine of reunion and forbidden the Kawthar of His presence, although the fire of search was kindled within all, and day and night they were occupied with the remembrance of the days of the appearance of the Lord of all names. Yet when the Hand of Power rent asunder the veil and the lights of the Sun of Truth shone forth from behind the clouds, all were found wandering in the wilderness of fancy and the valleys of vain imaginings. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto that which is the goal of all the worlds. Praise be to God that your honor hath, time after time and repeatedly, attained unto the ultimate goal and the purpose of all who are in earth and heaven. You have heard the call of the Lord of Names and attained unto His favors. Well is it with you and pleasant be it unto your honor. God is witness and testifier that from the day when that Beloved One returned, as bidden, to his outward homeland, he hath ever been before the sight of this servant and is mentioned in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. The two missives penned by your honor brought joy and gladness. One of these two arrived on this night, which is the fifteenth night of the blessed month of Ramadan, and after this servant perused it, it attained unto the Most Holy Court and its entirety was presented. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in this station. He - exalted be His glory - said […]</p>
<p>O Nabil, O thou who journeyest toward God! We have heard thy cry and lamentation and thy yearning in thy love for God. Verily We were with thee and shall be with thee, as a grace from Our presence. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Generous. We showed thee in thy dream that which gladdened thy heart, expanded thy breast, and brought solace to thine eyes. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Witnessing, the All-Hearing. The servant present has laid before Us what was in thy letter. We answered thee before and at this time. Verily thy Lord is the All-Generous.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that thou hast been awakened by the divine morning breeze and hast recognized the Day of God. Thou didst hear His call and wert enabled to respond “Yea” and “Here am I” with heart, tongue and limbs. At a time when heedlessness had encompassed the earth, thou became aware of the Word. All eyes were created for this Day and all ears existed for this Day, yet after its dawning, manifestation and shining forth, all were found deprived and veiled save a few, and those few are mentioned in the presence of God as being among the people of the most exalted Paradise.</p>
<p>O thou who walkest in My path and gazeth toward Mine horizon! Give praise to the Lord of eternity Who hath enabled thee to attain a station wherein the Most Exalted Pen hath testified in thy behalf. This station is most great - know thou this and be of the thankful ones. God willing, thou must put into practice whatsoever thou hast heard in the presence of His countenance. Wisdom must not be lost sight of, for it hath been and continueth to be among the most mighty divine ordinances. Thou must hold fast unto it in all conditions. Thou hast drunk from the Kawthar of divine knowledge, yet its effects must not be visible upon thy lips. This is the wisdom thou art bidden to observe and act upon. That which today causeth tranquility among the servants must be adhered to, for if clamor be raised it will cause perturbation and revolution among weak souls. God, exalted be His glory, is generous and His mercy hath preceded all things, both seen and unseen. We have said before: Place not thy trust in every friendship, nor believe every speaker. One must not be assured by every soul, nor should the pearl of divine love be revealed before every soul, for most of the servants are found to be thieves, traitors and infidels. Thy Lord speaketh the truth and guideth to the Way, and He is the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>From the revealed verses and utterances of the Lord of Oneness, the grace, mercy, loving-kindness and compassion of God, exalted be His glory, toward you are clear and evident. O beloved of my heart! By the life of God, you have attained to a mighty station. Today its significance is not apparent, for it is not manifest, but assuredly this station shall become evident and visible to all the worlds. As commanded, you must hold fast to all means of concealment, for if your station becomes apparent there is fear that harm may befall you, and this would be contrary to the wisdom you are bidden to observe from God. Deal with all with wisdom and forbearance. At this time, the preservation of your being is incumbent upon yourself and the other friends, for you are engaged in serving the Cause, and this station is greater than all other lofty and most exalted stations that have been heard of and continue to be heard of. This evanescent servant beseecheth God to assist you in whatsoever He hath commanded. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>What hath been vouchsafed by the True One is this: at the very moment thy letter was presented, an answer descended from the heaven of grace and favor. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the Compassionate, the Bestower, the Forgiving, the Generous. These words were inscribed in the handwriting of that Beloved One: “The neck that is raised in love will assuredly fall by the sword, and the head that is exalted in devotion will certainly be cast to the winds, and the heart that is bound to the remembrance of the Beloved will surely be filled with blood.” When these matters were laid before His presence, He said: “Through divine bounty and the infinite mercy of thy Lord, thou hast attained the most great martyrdom, and this station is above outward martyrdom. Today, whosoever hath clung to the divine Will and attained unto His Purpose hath attained unto the most great martyrdom, for he is extinct in his own will and purpose and alive through the Will and Purpose of God, exalted be His glory and abundant be His favors. Therefore, think not ever of outward martyrdom - thou hast attained to that which is greater. Thou must conduct thyself with the utmost patience, composure and dignity. To utter words that would cause tumult and clamor among the people is not permitted and hath been strictly forbidden in God’s Book. Thou art engaged in friendship with Him and occupied in His remembrance and service - what station could be greater than this? I swear by the Sun of Utterance that shineth from the horizon of this Prison that no station hath been nor ever shall be greater than this, and a single moment of this life and existence cannot be equaled by successive centuries and ages and manifold epochs. This is the Sun of Utterance that hath shone forth from the heaven of the All-Merciful’s favor. God willing, may ye be illumined, gladdened, and firmly attached to it.”</p>
<p>And as for the request of Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali, upon him be the glory of God, for a Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet - this was presented at the Most Holy Court and was granted. A Tablet was revealed from the heaven of grace specifically for him and sent. Deliver it to him. God willing, may he be occupied with the mention of God, the praise of God, and service to God’s Cause, and be adorned with spiritual qualities and praiseworthy deeds. Once the Tongue of Grandeur uttered these blessed words - exalted be His glory: “O servant and O My attendant! Write to Nabil, who turned after permission to the Most Exalted Horizon, to counsel the friends of God with the utmost joy and fragrance on behalf of the True One, and to call all to goodly conduct, pure deeds and spiritual qualities, that all may attain to that which God loveth and approveth. And likewise tell them and inform them that contention, strife, conflict and the like are the qualities of the beasts of the earth. The station of man is sanctified, pure and exempt from such things.”</p>
<p>O people of Baha! Aid ye the one true God, glorified be His majesty, through your deeds, and conquer the cities of hearts through His Name. The cities of this world and its lands and seas hath the True One, exalted be His station, relinquished unto kings. It hath not been and is not befitting for the friends of God, who have in truth drunk from the Kawthar of everlasting life and who gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon, to turn thereunto. Moreover, We have commanded all to occupy themselves with some business or profession. Blessed is the soul that beareth a burden and is not himself a burden unto others. They should engage in crafts and trades; a single coin earned thereby is, in the sight of God, more beloved than a treasure amassed by unrighteous means and made ready. God willing, all shall attain unto that which hath been sent down from the Most Exalted Pen. He, verily, guideth whom He willeth unto His straight path. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant, with utmost humility, supplication, lamentation and entreaty, beseecheth the Exalted True One to assist His friends to act in accordance with that which hath been revealed in the Book. Verily, He preserveth them, draweth them nigh, and enricheth them from all else. This is naught but a mighty favor.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning the pilgrimage, after thy letter was submitted to the Most Holy Court [the pilgrimage was performed in detail on thy behalf?] and praise be to God, it was graced with acceptance. [Happy art thou?] and the servant standing before the Throne.</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst write about the perfume, God willing it shall arrive and attain the blessing of reaching its destination. At present the farm is at the Greater Scene. The letter of Aqa Muhammad-’Ali hath not yet arrived; God willing, it shall come.</p>
<p>Concerning what they wrote about the blessed piece, God willing it shall arrive and they shall attain unto it. May they ever be assisted and confirmed in serving the Cause and preserving themselves for the sake of service.</p>
<p>Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Preserver, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Glory be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon those who have attained unto this mighty Cause.</p>

<p>Praise be unto the Desired One of the world, Who befittingly and graciously bestoweth awareness upon His loved ones at all times concerning the deception and schemes of the transgressors and the lies and calumnies of the oppressors. Praise be unto God that the veil hath been lifted, and the veils of glory have been rent asunder, and the falsehoods and calumnies of the heedless souls have become as manifest as the sun to that Beloved One. Glory be unto God! What hath become of perception? Whither hath reason fled? They imagine not that perchance the hearer may be aware of matters. They speak with their mouths and act in ways that are forbidden in the Book of God.</p>
<p>Verily, the letters of that beloved of the heart have arrived. Each word therein bore true witness to the falsehoods and calumnies of heedless, fabricating souls. From their imaginary writing their ranks and stations became evident. Praise be to God, that beloved one has become informed and aware. Wonderment seized this servant and the people of the cities of sight and hearing, and one beheld one’s servant like one bewildered and astonished. The mind and understanding cannot fathom how a person’s utterances could be contrary to what flows from their tongue. Here lies wonder upon wonder, not in the stories of Rumi, upon whom be mercy. Verily, the ocean of utterance hath appeared with its waves, and the Most Great Luminary hath risen with manifest and brilliant lights, such that for the fair-minded there hath been and is no occasion for pause. These matters were presented before the countenance after being informed, and were honored to be heard. He said: “O thou who gazest upon the Face! God willing, thou shalt be assisted to serve the servants and reform the world. What thou hast mentioned of the calumnies of the heedless soul is correct, there is no doubt in it. Would that in the aforementioned reply [they had stated] I have one request of thee, and that is that thou shouldst come with fairness and justice and hear what is said. Thou hast said that a person [arrived] and stated that for four hours they tried to write two lines but could not, manifest inability. This word of yours is bereft of truth and honesty. Now we make an agreement with you - send yourself or a representative to me, on the condition that in one hour a thousand verses shall be revealed. If the scribe can manage it, for after writing one hundred and fifty verses the pen pauseth. This is one matter. Another matter: thou hast said that whatever is written is from the utterances of the Primal Point, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him. This matter too this servant guarantees. You or your representative may mention matters the like of which have never been heard before, and ask questions in person, that you may hear the answer at that moment and witness with your outward eye the waves of the ocean of utterance and the effulgent lights of the Sun of meanings. Man is like unto a treasure, and the pearls of knowledge, truthfulness and purity lie hidden and concealed within him. It is a pity that through conjecture and doubt one should deprive oneself of the kingdom of justice and fairness. Today the gate of bounty is opened and the sun of wisdom is manifest and evident. That honored one should, for the sake of God, reflect upon this Most Great Cause and Most Mighty News, and witness with his own eyes the fruits of the Lote-Tree of the Most Exalted Paradise. This servant is present and thou art present. We must strive in the path of God and distinguish truth from falsehood. How long shall vain imaginings persist? How long shall doubts continue? Have you forgotten the Shi’ih sect? For one thousand two hundred years and more they counted themselves as the most mighty and exalted of all the religions of the world and prided themselves on mention of the Successor, but finally on the Day of Reckoning it became clear and evident to those possessed of insight that they had been worshippers of vain imaginings, not followers of revelation and divine inspiration. They manifested such tyranny as the eye of creation had never witnessed the like of. They pronounced death sentences against that Sovereign of existence Whose mention had occupied them throughout ages and centuries, and with utmost degradation martyred Him. To this day they have not desisted. Every day […]</p>
<p>A people have risen and continue to rise in opposition, and those oppressors left none, whether young or old, male or female. Now too the deniers of the Bayan are occupied with childish games, and in the end they cling in their deeds and actions to that party. And that woman whom thou didst mention in the land of ?a - she who reads this writing - she hath never been and is not capable of reading a single verse. Sixty years of her life have passed, and she hath not discerned her right from her left. She hath lately busied herself with deceiving men. I swear by Him Who revealeth the verses that she hath not seen Mirza Yahya since this Cause. She and her like kept their distance, for they were bereft of faith and stained with hypocrisy. She moveth as her soul desireth, consumed by the fire of passion, and causeth souls to stray from the truth. We beseech God to enable all to attain unto that from which the fragrance of truthfulness is wafted. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>This servant, with utmost humility and supplication, beseecheth that while there is yet time, they may investigate this Cause for the sake of God and cling to its hem, that perchance they may not remain deprived of the ocean of utterance. This servant hath not seen her and beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to remove the veil and dispel the intervening barriers, that eyes may attain unto that for which they were created from nothingness. Today the Sun is shining, the Kawthar flowing, and the Salsabil evident before all faces. It would be a pity should man be deprived of the manifest light through false statements and fabricated claims. This servant beseecheth God to assist her to arise for His sake to accomplish what hath been mentioned. But alas, alas! The recompense of deeds hath prevented it. The justice of God, exalted be His glory, hath decreed that which every person of insight hath witnessed and every informed one hath recognized.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Illumine their eyes to behold Thy signs and adorn their hearts with the light of Thy knowledge. O Lord! Withhold them not from that which Thou hast manifested through Thy bounty and generosity, and from that which Thou hast sent down through Thy grace and favors. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>From these associations it hath become clear that they have ever clung and continue to cling to the cord of calumnies. Their path is falsehood and their way of speech and utterance hath deviated from truth. According to her own words, during the time she was with him, he spoke but two words, and even these, by her own admission, were delirious. It is not known what she hath seen that she would use it to prove his authority and open the gates of calumny. Say: O man, thou who art thyself aware of thine own falsehood, no matter how many veils of lies thou addest thereto, thou hast not and will never have the slightest worth in thine own eyes or the eyes of others. The Shi’ih sect numbers several millions, yet in the sight of God they have not the worth of a single crippled believer. This is their station and the station of the knights of truthfulness, justice and fairness. These immature ones of the world were not and are not worthy of mention. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, hath ever been and is sanctified above them, above what they possess, and above their words, sayings, deeds, attributes and understanding, and above what was and what will be. Verily, we are God’s and to Him shall we return.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Evil people have appeared who consume calumnies like sweetmeats. Has he not heard that Mirza Nasru’llah, Mirza Rida-Quli and their sister left the deluded party? Rida-Quli’s sister cursed Yahya two thousand times, and there was strife and contention between them for some time. They took another house and settled there, and the Beauty of the Desired One bestowed their expenses. Later, when leaving the Land of Mystery, despite much insistence that she go to her husband, she refused. That person should be told: if Mirza Nasru’llah, Mirza Rida-Quli and their sister were with Mirza Yahya, why did they come to ’Akka? In any case, that beloved of the heart knows the details better than to bring his own petition and give trouble to others. What need is there to speak of matters whose falsehood is as evident as the sun? God has sealed their eyes and ears - they neither see nor hear.</p>
<p>And as to what that beloved of the heart wrote regarding his consultation with the honored Shaykh, Aqa Muhammad-’Ali and Aqa ’Azizu’llah, upon them be God’s peace, and that the consultation resulted in his remaining in that land - after this matter was presented, it was approved and accepted. Repeatedly it was said: “Perhaps God will bring about through this some matter.” Perhaps they will be the cause of something becoming manifest whereby people will realize that this place was not and is not a place of corruption, strife and contention. And they said We counsel the honored Observer, upon him be Baha, with wisdom - he must hold fast to it in all conditions.</p>
<p>As for the money that was stolen, when this was presented, they said: “We beseech God to assist His servants to truthfulness, trustworthiness and religious devotion.” In most Tablets this matter has been beseeched from God, exalted be His glory. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Perhaps through His complete power He will make the servants aware of the light of trustworthiness and the darkness of treachery. In Iraq also such a matter occurred once. The treacherous have always been and are lying in wait. This is not the first flask that has been broken in Islam.</p>
<p>The honored Qurratu’l-’Ayn Aqa Mirza Habib’u’llah, upon him be 96 [Baha’u’llah], dwells under the shadow and is blessed with favors. All mention that beloved one and continue to do so. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist that beloved of the heart in that which is the cause of joy, the source of delight and the dawning-place of gladness. Furthermore, I convey greetings to the friends of that land and I beseech for each one that from which the fragrance of eternity wafts. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is powerful over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Peace, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon God’s sincere servants. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of Our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>May Thy beloved of heart, His Honor the Trustee–upon him be the Glory of God and His loving kindness–take note.</p>
<p>All praise, thanksgiving, mention, glorification, tribute and honor befit the Peerless Beloved, Who hath illumined the world of existence with the light of justice. He is the Being through Whose command absolute nothingness is adorned with the ornament of being. Exalted is His utterance and mighty His proof! All glory and splendor rest upon His trustees, mystics, and Hands of His Cause, whom God hath adorned with the ornament of trustworthiness among all people and ordained for them that which shall draw them nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>The servant beseecheth his Lord not to withhold from all lands the effulgent rays of the Orb of His justice and trustworthiness. They who have cast trustworthiness behind their backs–these cannot be truly accounted as human, nor befit its station and rank. To this testify the Books of God, our Lord and the Lord of the mighty Throne.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letters of that beloved of heart descended like the spring rain upon this evanescent servant–a rain that made fresh the tree of being. Glorified be the loving kindness of our Lord, His grace and His mercy that have preceded us from every direction! Verily, He is the Source of good deeds.</p>
<p>After reading and reciting these, he repaired to the Most Exalted Station and the Supreme Summit, and presented them before the Countenance of the Lord of all being, both seen and unseen. Thereupon the Ancient Countenance turned toward the servant and spoke that which perfumed the world with the fragrance of utterance. He spoke, and His word is the truth:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing Expositor</p>
<p>O Trustee! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of the worlds! We bear witness that thou hast attained unto that which was inscribed by the Supreme Pen in His Books, Psalms and Tablets, and hast quaffed the choice wine of utterance from the chalice of His bounty, and hast held fast unto His cord and clung to the hem of the robe of His mercy that hath preceded all in the heavens and the earth. We make mention of thee and those who have believed with a mention that attracteth the world and adorneth it with that which draweth it nigh unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Trustee! Verily, He created creation to make them treasuries of His justice, repositories of the pearls of His Covenant, dawning-places of His trustworthiness, and daysprings of His religion. To this testify the dwellers of My celestial kingdom and My realm of might, and those who circle round the Throne at all times. He hath made the prison the circling-place of the Supreme Concourse and the Most Exalted Paradise. Blessed is he whom God hath enabled to achieve this praiseworthy deed.</p>
<p>O thou who standeth firm in My service! In most Tablets We have enjoined the servants of God to observe trustworthiness, religiosity, justice and fairness, and forbidden them from transgression and immorality, commanding them to righteousness and godliness. Yet this increased not the heedless save in loss. Had the servants acted according to the will of God, exalted be His glory, the earth would now be beheld as one adorned, luminous and sanctified expanse.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Glory at its most glorious, and all Thy Glory is indeed glorious. O God! I beseech Thee by the whole of Thy Glory to adorn Thy loved ones with the ornament of justice and illumine them with the light of trustworthiness. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things, both seen and unseen.</p>
<p>This prayer was a treasure of divine loving kindness, first cast upon the heart of the Seal of the Prophets–may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake–and then unto others. In this prayer is found the Most Great Name, and He saith that were the servants to know or recognize the station of this prayer, they would assuredly strive to obtain it even by the sword. We beseech the True One to open the doors of grace and bounty through the key of His gracious Name. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Your letters that you sent to this servant all achieved presence and were heard. Praise be to God, from their words and letters wafted the musk of divine love. What you mentioned regarding that distinguished person who has arisen wholly to serve the Cause - you have spoken truly. Indeed, his like is rare to find. All the friends and loved ones should arise to support him. This is a deed that would not be manifest from anyone in days other than the days of God. This is a great confirmation and a great success. O Amin! From the beginning of the Cause, regarding debts, a firm and mighty ruling was revealed from the Divine Pen, and we sent copies thereof to various regions, and likewise we sent it to you as well. In no way was it considered as it deserved. What was befitting was revealed. Blessed is he who reads and hears and acts. By God’s life, the treasures of earth cannot compare with what was revealed from the All-Giving Pen regarding this matter. Blessed are they who act, and blessed are the fair-minded. Today all the friends of God must be treasuries of the pearls of divine attributes, for the hosts of virtuous character are the mightiest hosts in the world. Blessed is the soul who with these hosts conquers the citadels of hearts. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist the people of Baha to perform deeds from which will waft the fragrance of His acceptance and the sweet scent of His good-pleasure. Verily, He is powerful over all things. O Amin! A great deed was manifested by that distinguished person - they were and are mentioned in God’s presence. Blessed are those souls who acted as he did. Love of gold and silver did not prevent them from doing what the time required. Assuredly, for any soul who acts for the sake of God in what was mentioned, divine relief will encompass them and that will become manifest which imagination and fancy cannot tread upon and before which they will find themselves powerless. O friends of God! We counsel you with that whereby your stations and ranks will be elevated. Beware lest the events of the world and its ornaments and bounties prevent you. Verily your Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Counselor, the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>Concerning the matter of religion, that which every fair-minded soul would assuredly hold fast to hath been repeatedly recorded by the Supreme Pen. His Holiness the Afnan, the honored Haji Siyyid ’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, was commanded to proceed to ’Ishqabad for the sale of properties and the payment of debts. By the life of Our Purpose! Were they to act in accordance with what they have been commanded, the gates of blessings and goodly gifts would be opened before their faces, and God would exalt them among His servants through His Name. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>The honored Afnans and the loved ones must all strive earnestly to settle the debts. This is the day of service, of earnest endeavor, of justice and fairness. As commanded, We write again to His Holiness the Afnan, the honored Haji Siyyid Mirza, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, that which will cause the manifestation of God’s grace and favor, exalted be His Glory. The servant, throughout the nights and days, beseecheth God, the Lord of the Throne and the Lord of the Chair, and the Possessor of the heavens and earths, to assist His Afnans in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to aid them to achieve that detachment whereby their stations shall be made manifest among all possibilities. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>In truth, His Holiness the Worker, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, is a man of action; they have accomplished a great deed. Should the honored Afnans, upon them be the Glory of God and His grace, be negligent in this matter, it would cause great sorrow. In any case, I convey to all the loved ones greetings and praise, glorification and exaltation, remembrance and glory. God, the All-Knowing, beareth witness that they are forever remembered in my heart, and for each one I have sought and continue to seek that which befitteth the favor of God, exalted be His Glory.</p>
<p>The letter from the beloved of hearts His Holiness Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, was received. After presenting it, they said that he must not be sorrowful at all, as these matters are dependent upon the decree of God, exalted be His glory. Repeatedly have His own kin first made declarations and with the utmost earnestness made their requests, and after acceptance, recanted. And they said: “O Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar, these matters have not and will not cause sorrow. What causes the greatest sorrow are the deeds of certain ones. Repeatedly in the Tablets hath this exalted word been revealed: ‘My affliction is not My imprisonment, nor what hath befallen Me from Mine enemies, but rather the deeds of My loved ones who claim connection with My Being yet commit that which causeth My heart and My pen to lament.’ However, in view of the weakness of some, forbearance is necessary, for if ones like you were to object, it would cause the fire of hatred to be kindled. I truly say that patience and overlooking are necessary in certain matters. The divine counsels and heavenly exhortations are a mighty mirror for the sanctification, detachment and ascent of the servants unto righteousness. And if after the appearance of this matter it proves ineffective, silence is preferable. In all the parties of the world these things have appeared. Consider the Cause of the Seal of the Prophets, may our souls be a sacrifice for Him. Not only men but women too became apostates, including the sister of Umm-Salama, upon her be the Glory of God, and five other handmaidens who clung to the cords of the deluded ones and returned to their former state. And since in these days the Sun of Truth is shining, grace hath therefore taken precedence and giving and receiving have raised two banners from the right and the left. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect all through the hosts of the seen and unseen and to aid them to remain steadfast in this mighty Cause.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God that beloved of hearts, namely His Holiness Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, is engaged in service and occupied with guiding people. The work of teaching is a mighty matter and His Holiness is successful therein. By the testimony of His Holiness the Present One, may our souls be a sacrifice for Him, the dwellers of the pavilion of infallibility and grandeur have also said that he should never be sorrowful. His answer will be sent again. I beseech God to manifest that which will cause the exaltation of His Word. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>As to the affairs of this prison, praise and thanks be to God, all are well and healthy. Blessed be God, this year the Most Great Prison hath been honored by numerous souls; from every direction they have turned and arrived. However, henceforth His Holiness should cause those who desire to attain the presence to remain where they are. The reasons for prohibition are present; for the Cause, it is not free from harm. And they said that if they act according to what was mentioned before, in truth the reward of attaining the presence and meeting will be recorded for them. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon them that are detached and steadfast and firm and upright and standing firm in the Cause of our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earths.</p>

<p>=== START BH00532 ===</p>
<p>This is the Surah of Our Name “The Messenger,” which We have sent down from the dominion of grace to be a herald unto all the worlds. He is the Most Wondrous, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>This is a Book from the presence of Baha to him who hath acknowledged God and recognized His sovereignty, and hath then taken his seat upon a sublime and holy seat. Therein is that which will guide him aright should he hearken unto what hath been sent down therein and not withhold the ear of his heart from hearkening unto the Word of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>God hath indeed manifested Himself in this Tablet through His Name “The Messenger” unto all created things, that none may be debarred from the wondrous treasures concealed within this blessed and wondrous Name. We have made this Tablet the source of the manifestation of this Name throughout all worlds, and through it We raised up the Messengers aforetime - though there was no “aforetime” before it - and sent them unto the servants as a command from Our presence, for verily We have ever been One Who commandeth. And We shall continue to send through it the Messengers unto the end that hath no end, through Our power, for verily We have ever been the Powerful One.</p>
<p>This Tablet was inscribed by the Pen of Power and preserved behind the veil of infallibility. Then did We reveal it in truth and send it forth in the most excellent form, in the image of these radiant, holy and luminous words:</p>
<p>O thou Name! We have made thee the Manifestation of Our Messengers in the Kingdom of Names and have ordained for thee that which none among all created things can reckon. We have raised thee in truth to a station beneath whose shadow all the Messengers have sought shelter, and through thee We send forth the Messengers to all the worlds of thy Lord. This is what We have ordained for thee as a bounty from Our presence for Our discerning servants.</p>
<p>Among the Messengers are those whom We raise up in truth and send unto the servants with a Book and clear proof; among them are those whom We cause to speak through Our grace and whom We inspire with the wisdom of the Cause from Our presence - for verily We have power over all things; among them are those to whom We reveal through messengers from the angels; among them are those in whose breasts We cause the Spirit to speak with sanctified and wondrous inspirations; and among them are those whom We manifest with all of these and make them the manifestation of all names between earth and heaven. We purify them from the defilement of the idolaters, strengthen them with the Most Great Spirit, and make them the manifestation of Our Self to all who are in the kingdom of command and creation, ordaining for them the best of all worlds. Thus do We favor some above others as a grace from Our presence, for I am the Ancient Bestower of Grace.</p>
<p>Beyond these, We have manifested this Name unto all who are in the heavens and on earth, and We have made this Name a sun that all existence, both seen and unseen, might be illumined by its rays. None knoweth this save those who have been given spiritual vision by One All-Knowing, All-Wise. None shall be barred from the radiance of this Sun save those who place a veil between themselves and its light. Thus do We impart unto the servants that which will draw them nigh unto the Fountain of Knowledge and make plain the paths of understanding.</p>
<p>How many messengers there are upon whom the rays of this Sun have shone, yet they themselves remain unaware! For example, those who carry the messages of kings to various lands are messengers from them, and this Name hath shone upon them according to their station and the measure of their facing this glorious and wondrous Sun. Among them are those who bear God’s messages inscribed on tablets, yet understand them not and remain among the heedless. As ye observe, those whom they call “chapar” [couriers] carry God’s verses and His Book to and fro, spreading them throughout the lands, yet in their own souls they remain […]</p>
<p>Verily, they are among the veiled ones, and many of them, were they to become aware of this, would not accept it within themselves and would not bear it, but rather would be among those who strive against it. The effulgence of this Name shone upon them in their heedlessness of it. Thus hath the favor of thy Lord encompassed all the worlds. We have sent with these souls in all their journeys that which none among those possessed of knowledge can bear, how much less those beneath them. This is among the hidden mercies of their Lord upon them and upon Our near servants. Today their names are mentioned before God by the angels of divine messages, and We have made them harbingers of glad tidings to Our seeking servants. These shall continue in this bounty until God shall reveal to them their deeds - a promise from Him. Verily, He is the best of those who fulfill their promises. God shall soon raise them up through His sovereignty and shall make them recognize the Manifestation of His Self and shall bring them to the holy Paradise as a recompense for what they have wrought and for their having been among the doers. The reward of none of His servants shall be lost with God, and verily He doth not suffer to be lost the reward of those who do good. We inspired the kings aforetime to appoint servants for this Cause, that through them might be manifested that which God desired in those days regarding the diffusion of His signs. Thus do We expound unto you the power of your Lord, that ye may be among those who are certain of His power.</p>
<p>O Kings of the Bayan! Command your envoys, when the Sun of Certitude dawneth from the horizon of the All-Glorious, to proceed with God’s announcement and His Tablets throughout all lands and to inform the people of the holy and wondrous lights. Command these to carry the traces of God to all regions, that the breezes of holiness may waft over all the worlds. We have made you the manifestation of Our sovereignty for this purpose and for the recognition of your Creator at the time of His Manifestation. By God! This is better for you than the kingdom of the heavens and earth. Await ye the days of God that ye may find them, then after hearing, hasten to the holy seat, the place of the mighty throne. By God! Your turning toward the direction of the All-Glorious and your standing before the throne of your Lord, the All-Merciful, is better than the worship of both worlds. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the bounty of those days. Then enter the sanctuary of Paradise, near to the mercy of your Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. By God! Through this shall your sovereignty be strengthened, your station exalted, your mention elevated, and your names inscribed on holy and preserved tablets. In those days shall the bounty of your Creator encompass you and cause you to prevail over all who dwell on earth. Thus doth God command you in this Tablet lest ye be veiled at the time of His Manifestation by the ornaments of earth that ye possess, and lest ye withhold yourselves from that which is better for you than all that hath been created between the heavens and earth. If ye hearken unto God’s counsel, it shall be for your own good, and if ye turn away, it shall be against you, and verily He is independent of His veiled servants. And if ye do not carry out that wherewith ye have been commanded in the Tablet, verily He will send His Tablets by the hands of the angels of glad tidings during your heedlessness thereof, even as We send them by the hands of your servants during your heedlessness and their heedlessness thereof. Thus hath your Lord been powerful over what He willeth and sovereign over what He desireth. None can prevent His sovereignty and nothing can frustrate Him in what He hath created in the heavens and earth, if ye be of those who know. Even as ye have witnessed and heard all this from the Manifestations of Our Self at the time of Their appearance, insomuch that whenever the Manifestations of tyranny prevented Them from Their sovereignty and arose in opposition against Them, They manifested through Their sovereignty whatsoever They desired, and the Cause was established through Their words, and the back of the oppressors was broken. Thus have We detailed in this Tablet the mysteries of the Cause. Blessed is he who readeth it and pondereth what hath been inscribed therein and extracteth what hath been treasured therein of the pearls of luminous knowledge.</p>
<p>O Kings of the earth! In the realm of Baha, act not as did the kings act towards Us in these days. Among them was the King of Persia who suspended the Temple of the Cause in mid-air and slew it with such tyranny that all things wept over it, then did the denizens of Paradise and the Concourse of the realms above. He put to death a number of Our kinsmen, plundered Our possessions, and made Our family captives in the hands of the oppressors. He cast Me into prison time and again. By God the True One! None can reckon what befell Me in prison save God, the Numberer, the All-Knowing, the Almighty. Then he banished Me and My family from Our home until We reached Iraq in manifest sorrow. We remained there until the King of Turkey rose against Us and summoned Us to his seat of sovereignty. When We reached him, there befell Us that which brought joy to the King of Persia, until We were cast into this Prison wherein the hands of loved ones were cut off from Our robe. Thus did he deal with Us, yet We give thanks to God for what hath befallen Us through his firm decrees, and We praise Him for this, hoping for what He hath in store. Verily He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>O Our Name the Messenger and its Manifestations! We have indeed exalted you and raised you up and made you Our manifestations in the Kingdom of Names. Beware lest anything deter you from your Creator or the exaltation of your mention veil you from your Originator. Fear God and be of the God-fearing.</p>
<p>O Mirrors of this Name! Deal not with My Self as did the mirrors in those days, for you were created by My command and were brought into being by the will of My Pen, if you be of those who perceive. Doth it befit shadows to deny the lights of the Sun or to protest against it after being created by it? Nay, by My Self, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Powerful. Their turning away from the Sun and their objection to it are like the dung-beetle’s aversion to the fragrance of musk. Thus do We set forth parables unto men that they may be of those who are assured of their Lord’s signs. Whoso faileth to deliver unto himself the messages of God his Lord and restraineth not himself from wickedness and unseemly deeds and from that which is forbidden in the Tablets - he is indeed deprived of the revelation of this Name and shall be of the deprived ones.</p>
<p>O people of Baha! Deliver unto yourselves the messages of your Lord, then deliver them unto men, that God’s messages may encompass all the worlds through you. Beware lest you deprive yourselves of this most mighty and impregnable grace. And thou, O servant, arise from thy slumber, then deliver unto men that which thou art commanded by thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Look not upon anyone, but look unto the face of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Luminous. Let thy Lord suffice thee above all else, that thou mayest find thyself independent of all the worlds. We have sent down this Ridvan and dispatched it to thee that thou mayest ponder upon it and upon its contents, and give thanks unto thy Lord and be of the thankful. Detach thyself from the world and its ornaments, then seek God’s help in all matters and be of those who trust in Him. Then gather the people unto the Cause of thy Lord and be of the beneficent. Rise from the horizon of utterance with the sword of expression, then sing My melody between the heavens and the earth. If thou findest thyself extinguished, then kindle thyself from this Fire by the name of thy Lord, the Chosen One, that thou mayest attract through thee the hearts of the righteous among Our near servants. And if thou findest thyself ailing, then seek healing through My Name, the Healer, that through thee every sick and ailing one may be healed. Thus have We ordained for thee and commanded thee therewith, that thou mayest be of those who act. Upon thee be the light of thy Lord through My Most Glorious Name, and upon those who are with thee among Our assured servants.</p>

<p>In the name of our Lord, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Most High, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who is single in His command and unique in His judgment, Who hath sent down from the heaven of oneness the decree of wisdom and made it the foundation of this edifice which the hands of the power of the All-Merciful have built in the contingent world. Exalted is God, the Revealer of religions, through Whose word all that is and all that hath been were created. Blessed is he who hath recognized this glorious edifice which hath been mentioned in the Qur’an as the Great Announcement and in the Book of Names as the Straight Path. There is no Book but that this Most Exalted Remembrance and this Most Great Gift have been mentioned therein, having been designated by all names by the tongue of God, the Lord of the throne and of the dust, the Sovereign of the hereafter and of the former times.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of all beings and Educator of all existing things, by the Revealer of verses through Whom all doubts and allusions were erased, to assist Thy chosen ones, Thy loved ones, and Thy friends to triumph in Thy Cause and to arise to serve Thee. O Lord! Withhold not the letters of Thy Book from the ocean of Thy knowledge, nor the leaves of Thy trees from the blowing of the breezes of Thy bounty. O Lord! Draw them through Thy Most Exalted Word to Thy most sublime horizon and enable them in such wise that the opposition of every opposer will not deter them, nor will the tyranny of any oppressor frighten them. O Lord! Sanctify their hearts from the mention of aught else but Thee, their souls from turning to anyone other than Thee, and their tongues from praising aught besides Thee. Purify them, O my God, through Thy generosity and bounty, and cleanse them from all that is not pleasing unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest, and within Thy grasp is the kingdom of creation. Thou doest what Thou pleasest and ordainest what Thou desirest. Verily, Thou art the All-Wise Judge.</p>
<p>O Lord! Thou knowest that I desire to make mention of one of Thy loved ones who hath drunk the choice wine of Thy utterance, turned toward Thy horizon, responded to Thy call, and directed his face toward Thy countenance, though one such as I is not worthy to make mention of him who hath clung to the hem of Thy generosity and drunk from the ocean of Thy knowledge. But Thou knowest, O Beloved of the world and Desire of the nations, that by my mention of him I intend only to bring him the glad-tidings of Thy loving-kindness and bounty. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>Write to Ali: O Ali! Your letter which you sent to him who has turned to My Kingdom, circled My Throne, and attained My presence, has been received by the Wronged One and presented by the servant who stands before the Throne. Verily thy Lord heareth and seeth, and I am the All-Hearing One. We have inhaled the fragrance of thy turning and devotion, and have made mention of thee as a bounty from Our presence. His mercy hath preceded the world; verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>God willing, thou shouldst speak with utmost joy and fragrance in remembrance of the Best Beloved of all possibility, with perfect wisdom, and in all matters keep thy gaze fixed upon the horizon of His good-pleasure. The essence of unity is that assured souls should, in all conditions, turn to the One True God alone and act according to His good-pleasure. If today a soul should perform all good deeds and righteous acts, yet fail to attain God’s good-pleasure, it will assuredly yield no fruit. This is why He saith: Strive to attain the word of His good-pleasure. Strive that all may attain this most exalted station, that they may act for God’s sake, hold fast to God’s leave, and cling to God’s good-pleasure.</p>
<p>O Ali! Reflect upon the Light that shone forth from the horizon of Sad. Most of the servants have not, to this day, gained awareness of even a drop from the ocean of his knowledge. He had attained true martyrdom. By My life! Limited years passed over him while he was self-effacing in the will of his Lord and the desire of his Master. He had no thoughts, will or desire of his own, and at all times awaited God’s command. He would take no action without God’s leave and permission. For years he had sacrificed himself in the path of the Friend, though outwardly he spoke, listened and walked about. This is the supreme martyrdom, the most exalted station, the highest rank, and this lofty and most glorious station was adorned with outward martyrdom. He took the pearls of the sea of life and scattered them at the feet of his Friend. Thus did he attain the Most Great Remembrance, and the Supreme Pen was for a time engaged in his mention, to manifest his deeds, station, rank and sincerity.</p>
<p>O Ali! He attained two martyrdoms, and were the details of the first station to be mentioned, most people would surely be astounded. God willing, may all the friends attain to that which is beloved in this day. We make mention of them in this Tablet and give them the glad-tidings of God’s bounty and mercy, which have preceded existence. Say: It behooveth you to show forth the supreme steadfastness in this most mighty and exalted Cause, through which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken: “The Kingdom belongeth to the Possessor of the invisible and the visible.” All must at all times drink from the chalice of joy, for they are mentioned in God’s presence and recorded by the Supreme Pen. The stations of souls that are assured, content and well-pleasing shall not remain veiled. Though they may be concealed for a few days in accordance with God’s consummate wisdom, the hand of divine power shall surely rend asunder the veil and make them manifest.</p>
<p>Likewise, gladden the hearts of the Children of Israel with the mention of the Wronged One. Blessed are they and joy be unto them, inasmuch as they have turned their faces toward the Countenance and drawn nigh unto the Ocean of Knowledge on a Day whereon all things trembled for fear of God, the Omnipotent, the Almighty. God willing, may all remain steadfast on the Path of God, fix their gaze upon His horizon, and act in accordance with that which He commandeth them. At this moment, from this exalted and glorious Spot, We send Our greetings upon thee and upon My male and female servants.</p>
<p>In thy letter mention was made of His Holiness Haji Sabzivari, upon him be the Glory of God. The Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will, adorned with the seal of glory. Deliver it unto him, that his eyes may be cheered, his heart gladdened, his breast dilated, and that he may arise to do that which beseemeth these days of his Lord, the Manifest, the Mighty, the Generous. In truth, perfect bounty hath been vouchsafed unto him. Blessed is he, again blessed is he. Likewise, a Tablet was specifically revealed and sent for another soul in that same land–that is, the Green Land–upon him be the Glory of God. Deliver it unto him, that he may drink therefrom the Kawthar of bounty and recognition.</p>
<p>Moreover, on behalf of this evanescent servant, convey wondrous and glorious greetings to all the friends and masters who have drunk from the ocean of recognition. This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth God–exalted and glorified be He–to preserve them all beneath the shadow of His bounty and not to deprive them of the effulgent rays of the Sun of Revelation. Through His generosity and grace, may He open before their faces the gates of whatsoever is now concealed, that all may soar with utmost joy and eagerness in the atmosphere of His love, in such wise that the Concourse on High may hearken to the sound of their wings. However, all matters must be carried out with wisdom. Any matter that causeth tumult among the people is assuredly contrary to wisdom. Avoid it, O loved ones and chosen ones of God! We beseech God that we may be assisted to do that which He hath commanded, not that which we deem expedient or consider good. Verily, He knoweth us better than we know ourselves, and He is the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Some time ago, this servant wrote and dispatched a letter in reply to his honor Ibn-i-Shahid, upon him be the Glory of God. God willing, it has arrived. Blessed is he, and his father, and his household wherein the mention of God has been raised up. Verily the servant gave him glad tidings that he has been accepted before the Throne and God has made him a place for His Great Remembrance. In any case, whatsoever matter in the Divine Book that is adorned with an explicit ordinance yet becomes the cause of kindling the fire of hatred, to act upon it is not permitted. Thus has our Beloved Lord decreed, as a grace from Him upon us and upon His accepted servants. Convey to the family of Shahid, upon them be the Glory of God, from this evanescent one such remembrance as is befitting and such glorification as is worthy. Would that I were with him and attained martyrdom in the path of God, the Lord of Oneness. This evanescent servant mentions the friends night and day with utmost sincerity, and with a hundred thousand hands of supplication clings to the hem of grace, beseeching from the ocean of bounty and generosity the rending of the veils of the heedless and veiled people, that perchance they may not remain deprived on this blessed day whose mention has adorned the divine books. O beloved of my heart! By the life of the Beloved, if the people of hatred were to become aware to less than a particle’s weight, they would perish from grief over their deeds. One is astonished how they consider themselves believers today and count themselves among the people of truth. Shame upon them and their leaders who have made them idols unto themselves and foundations for their religions. God protect us and you and the community of the unitarians from their deeds and their words and their schemes and their whisperings and their plots. Verily He is the Protector, the Helper, the Wise. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The captive in the path of God, meaning the honored leaf, upon her be the Glory of God, is, God willing, joyful through the favors of the All-Merciful. Blessed is she and joy be unto her. The servant testifies that she has attained to the recognition of her Lord and has borne hardships in the path of God, her Creator. And on this blessed night, which is the 17th of Ramadan, this servant attained the presence of the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most High Court, and the Tongue of Grandeur made mention of that honored lady. He said she has attained to the highest, most exalted station and God willing, she will be assisted to preserve it. In all conditions they should fix their gaze upon the Truth alone and drink the sealed wine from His hand of bounty at every moment. End.</p>
<p>Whatever was before this servant from the divine utterances has been conveyed. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist His male and female servants unto that which He loves and is pleased with. By His life, this is the master of all deeds in the latter and the former times. There is no God but He, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.</p>

<p>In the name of the two Most Exalted Names, His Eminence M. H., upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah] the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Month of Dhi’l-Qa’dah 1304</p>
<p>He is God - exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified above mention and utterance, befitteth Him Who is the Desire of all worlds, Who with a single call summoned the denizens of earth to the most exalted horizon. Through that call the ocean spoke forth “Here am I, here am I,” and the land proclaimed the blessed word “At Thy service.” Every created thing is engaged in His remembrance and stands ready in service. Blessed is the ear that hath been honored to hear the call of all things, and the eye that hath been adorned by beholding His lights, and blessed is he who, being informed, was not deprived or held back by the world’s rejection and denial, but rather turned toward Him in detachment from all else and attained unto the supreme honor, which is the recognition of God, exalted be His glory. Prayers and peace be upon the Lord of the world and the Desire of the nations, through Whom appeared the decree of return and the Book spoke forth “The Kingdom belongeth to God, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing,” and upon His family and companions, through whom were opened the gates of grace unto all creation and through whom was manifested God’s binding Word - perpetual and eternal peace.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O Illuminator of the horizons, by Thy Name that shineth from the heaven of Thy grace, and by the Fire kindled in the Tree of Thy Cause, and by the lights of Thy throne and the manifestations of Thy power and majesty, to ordain for Thy loved ones that which beseemeth Thy generosity and bounty and is worthy of the heaven of Thy grace and bestowal. O Lord! Thou seest them clinging to Thy cord and turning to the lights of Thy countenance. I beseech Thee by the Most Great Word and by the manifestations of Thy grandeur in the realm of creation to protect them from the evil of Thine enemies who have broken Thy covenant and Thy testament and who have encompassed Thy lands and Thy domains without any proof from Thee or any clear evidence from Thy presence. O Lord! Assist Thy loved ones in that whereby Thy Cause may be exalted amongst Thy creation. Then enable them to remain steadfast in Thy remembrance and praise. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! All the exalted missives, whether addressed to the friends or to this evanescent one, all had their source and culmination in the Most Exalted Horizon, emerging from that Beloved One and reaching their intended destination. This is a testimony which every person of insight, experience, and sound knowledge would confirm. Mention of you and praise of you, since all was for the sake of God, returns to God and is accepted by Him. Every mention thereof attained to that which was intended and desired. Praise and thanksgiving be to God that these remembrances reached their station and the response emerged from the seat of grace and favors. Each one was favored in response with that which had and has no likeness or equal. They are forever mentioned by the tongue and specially favored with grace - praise be to His in all conditions. From the opening of each letter, the musk of utterance was diffused and the fragrance of knowledge was spread abroad. After inhaling, reading, turning to, and becoming acquainted with them, they were brought to that station where they attained the honor of being heard in His presence, and then from the Dayspring of Knowledge appeared such utterances as testified of themselves to your ranks of sincerity, detachment, adherence and devotion, and likewise contained mention and praise of all the friends in that land. Each one was mentioned individually with such praise whose fragrance shall never end and shall not be erased from the Book, and whose light shall never set nor decline from the Most Exalted Horizon, now and forever. At the time of the manifestation of grace and bounty, such joy and delight seized this servant that I am powerless and unable to describe it. God, exalted be His glory, is witness and testifier to what has been submitted. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Commander, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! The fire of love has a wondrous burning that is not quenched by the water of mention and utterance. The more it is mentioned, the more the essence of being demands. In truth, this is the station of “Is there more?” At this time when the pen is moving and the face is turned and the heart is receptive, the presence of the beloved spirit of His Honor Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’l-Husayn, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, came to mind. His mention gives strength to the spirit and his praise nourishes the soul, for it is a fragrance from the true rose garden and a flower from the spiritual paradise. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, at all times for his exaltation, ascendancy, glory and elevation. Praise be to God that they have attained to that which is acceptable and mentioned. Further, I submit expressions of devotion to the service of the beloved of the heart, His Honor Aqa Siyyid Yahya, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God. God is witness and testifier that in nights and days they have been and are mentioned in heart and tongue. Their mention is a wondrous bounty and a spiritual feast. The servant beseeches his Lord to strengthen him, make him successful, and honor him in all conditions. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>At this time when the loved ones of God, each one prominent and renowned, have turned their complete attention to that spiritual beloved, his honor Ahmad, upon him be the glory of God and His mercy, their letters each bore mention adorned with the ornament of humility, submissiveness and sincerity, with each word opening a door of joy. The servant begs for him confirmation and success, and that which will preserve his remembrance throughout the duration of the earthly and heavenly kingdoms. The Pen loves to mention the Pillars AAA GH in this station and beseeches God for their glory, advancement and elevation. In truth, the fragrance of unity was diffused in one station, as the Pillars were adorned and distinguished with three Ayns. If all the pens of interpretation were to engage day and night in explaining this letter, they would surely fall short, for He says “The believer cannot be described.” Likewise His Holiness the letter GH, upon him be the glory of God and His care, which has been and is comprehensive of perfect and complete numbers. Glory be to God! The grace of God, exalted be His majesty, has encompassed His loved ones and friends in all things. I beseech Him, exalted be His station, for their protection, loftiness and ascendancy. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the Forgiving, the Merciful. There is no God but Him, the Powerful, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>The offerings of that beloved one, which in truth were each like a cutting sword for the day of mourning, like a rain-bearing cloud for the day of thirst, and like a brilliant light for the day of eclipse and night of darkness, arrived and at that very moment were graced with the gaze, and this is a true testimony to the sincerity, sanctity and purity of that beloved’s deeds. God suffices as witness. Glory be to God, its radiance almost veiled the light of the sun despite its brilliance and splendor. Since the manifestations of these matters and the appearance of these causes are in truth from the effulgences of the Luminary of the love of God, therefore whatever is mentioned or flows from the tongue has been and is befitting. The Water of Life flows from the spring of love and the comfort of the world exists through its comfort. Blessed is the soul that has attained unto it and understood its mysteries. Verily they are among the successful ones in God’s Book, the Lord of the worlds. In truth, the pen and tongue of this servant have not and will not be able to adequately praise and extol that which has appeared from that beloved one. However, I beseech God, exalted be His majesty, for confirmation and seek success, that He may reveal that which cannot be concealed and which no veil can obscure. Verily He has power over all things and is worthy to answer.</p>
<p>At this time mention was made of the sugar that was sent, although it has not yet arrived. Nevertheless, God is witness and testimony that the palate of the soul has been sweetened by it. All these are manifestations of love which appear and are revealed in the world of being. That very mention which flowed from the tongue of that Beloved concerning its dispatch cannot be equaled by anything hidden and treasured in the earth in the estimation of the friends and chosen ones. In truth, love is a sovereign that is mighty and a ruler that prevails. The world of motion and stillness is within the grasp of its power. Although love is the dawning-place of joy and delight, there are times when it becomes the manifestation of endless grief and sorrow, and such a time is these days, for one of the Most Exalted Names, the Beloved of the heart, ’A.L. - upon him be the glory of God, the King, the Mighty, the All-Knowing - according to the command intends to proceed in that direction, and from this separation the very essence of being is consumed. How well did the one speak who said:</p>
<p>“Love has departed from this city toward another city,</p>
<p>From whose rising and setting two cities were turned upside down”</p>
<p>In any case, I have been and am beseeching from the Self-Sufficient Lord reunion, meeting, nearness and gathering. With the generous ones no affair is difficult. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to gather us beneath the shade of the Tree of His providence and the pavilions of His grandeur, and to ordain for us that which profits us in every world of His worlds, and to open before our faces the gates of His mercy, and to send down upon us from the heaven of His bestowal a blessing from His presence. Verily He is the Mighty, the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Generous. Peace and praise and remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! Before its arrival it possessed all those perfect mentions and was considered a wondrous and exalted blessing. Now that it has itself arrived and made the world a sugar-garden, I know not what mention to make or what to say. In any case, its sweetness surpasses all the sweetnesses of the world and its delicacy excels all the delicacies of the nations. Praise be to God! Its absence was the cause of its presence, and now its presence is the cause of eternal mention. I beseech and entreat God, exalted be His glory, to adorn this existence with such an ornament that no likeness or similitude may be seen for it. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. There is no God but He, the Single, the One, the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth.</p>
<p>Praised be God! Praised be God! God’s will prevails, His purpose penetrates. We are all as nothing; all that exists is Him. The reins of awareness are in His hand, and the cord of knowledge is in the grasp of His power. What are we? Who are we? We are but manifestations of ignorance and embodiments of forgetfulness. For when the beloved of my soul, his honor the one named M.H., upon him be God’s peace and favor, was hidden from this servant’s sight at the time of writing, after reflection and investigation into its cause and reason, I pondered what could be the cause and reason. Suddenly it became apparent that it was intended that a separate, special mention should again be made of him, and that he should repeatedly be brought before my presence. In any case, after alertness and remembrance, he appeared before me and revealed that which all the treasures and riches of the world could not equal even one letter thereof. Blessed is he and joy be unto him! In truth, he was and is worthy of special favor, and this servant, with the tongue of the inner secret and the secret of secrets, and the manifest and the most manifest, conveys greetings and praise to him, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for His ancient and renewed grace. Verily, He has power over all things. The light of the new lamp has shown forth with new oil at this moment. Although mention of it existed in the world of remembrance, at this time its mention arose from the thoughts like a banner - “Here am I! Where is my portion? What is my share?” After all, my messenger and presenter and lighter is kindled with the fire of the love of the All-Merciful. Indeed, right is with him, therefore I beseech and hope from God, exalted be His glory, that his mention and his light may ever remain luminous through the oil of wisdom and the utterance of God - exalted be His station - and continue to shine and gleam in the niche of the world with a manifest light. Verily our Lord is the One who has power over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>What this evanescent one wishes to submit to Your Presence is that the beloved letter from his honor Samandar, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of Power, which was sent to that beloved one, was seen and after being reviewed was accorded the honor of being heard in the Most Holy Presence of the Lord of Creation, and these exalted words descended from the heaven of the will of the Lord of Names - exalted be His sovereignty and mighty His utterance:</p>
<p>“O Name of Bounty! In truth his honor Samandar, upon him be My glory, has his gaze fixed upon the Greatest Scene and stands firm in service. The veils of existence cannot obscure the fire of his love, nor can the clouds prevent its influence. If a sincere seeker were to reach out from distant places, verily he would find its effects. The servant in attendance submitted his requests, which attained the honor of being heard and both received answers. Glorified is He Who speaks and hears and responds, and glorified is He Who hath kindled in hearts and souls that which hath attracted them to the Truth, the Knower of all things hidden.</p>
<p>O Samandar! We have turned from this Station unto thee and have mentioned thee in such wise as nothing on earth can equal. We send Our greetings upon thee and upon those who have turned with their all to God, the Lord of the worlds. Give glad tidings of My remembrance and My attention to My loved ones. Blessed is he who hath held fast to the Sure Handle and hath drunk the choice wine of life from the hands of the bounty of his Lord, the Merciful, and was among the steadfast ones. Convey to all the friends in that land greetings from the Wronged One. Say: O loved ones of God in the cities and regions! Know ye that power lieth in unity, and prosperity and success in steadfastness and concord. Beseech God that all may be assisted to remain firm in this Cause that hath caused the firm mountains to quake. O friends! Know ye the value of these days of the Merciful One. By God! The sun hath never shone upon their like or similitude. Seize ye the opportunity in My days, then restrict your affairs to the service of My Cause. God will soon exalt your stations and ranks thereby, and will manifest to all on earth your loftiness and elevation and what ye have endured in His path and what hath befallen you in His wondrous Cause. In all conditions the profit is with you and the loss with the enemies. Ye must at all times keep your gaze fixed upon the divine counsels and act according to what is in the Book. God willing, under the shadow of His grace, may ye be illumined with the light of justice and fairness, trustworthiness and religiosity, humility and submissiveness. The glory be upon you and upon those who are with you and those who love you.”</p>
<p>Among the wonders of divine bounty is that at the very moment when the letter arrived, this evanescent servant attained the honor of His presence, and after this response was submitted, this answer descended from the Kingdom of utterance of the Sovereign Lord: God willing, may the masters and nobles of that land attain unto new life through the water of the providence of God, exalted be His glory, and be occupied with and act according to what beseemeth His days.</p>
<p>Mention was made of his honor Haji Muhammad Ibrahim, upon him be the glory of God. This is what was revealed for him from the Supreme Pen as a favor from God, the Lord of all humanity. His exalted and sanctified Word:</p>
<p>He is the One Who speaketh the truth amongst the people […]</p>
<p>The Wronged One hath, in every condition, summoned all unto the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious. There hath not been a night or day but that the shrill voice of His Most Exalted Pen was raised in such wise that none can deny it save every froward infidel. By God’s life! We have not protected Ourselves. We have revealed the Cause with a sovereignty from Us and summoned both kings and subjects unto God, the One, the All-Choosing. The first to turn away from Us and oppose Us were the divines of the earth, whom We had honored with a word from Us and elevated by Our command. But when We came unto them, We found them to be among the wayward at the end. Through their turning away the people turned away, and through their hypocrisy was kindled the fire of hatred, and there befell Us that which caused the dwellers of the pavilion of grandeur to lament at morn and eventide. We desired their life, yet they pronounced judgment against Us without clear proof or any Book. Blessed is he who casteth them behind his back, turning unto God, the Lord of Lords. We have heard of thy turning unto Us and have made mention of thee in the prison with verses through which the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath been wafted to all regions. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord’s loving-kindness and say: O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name and Thy dominion that overshadoweth the world, to assist me to be steadfast in Thy love and to number me with those who have attained unto Thy good-pleasure. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>God willing, may their orientation and turning to the Truth, exalted be His glory, become the cause of their attaining infinite bounties. Regarding what they mentioned about the vision, God willing, it is a sign of the greatness of the Cause and of power and might. Power, might and victory have never been and are not dependent upon outward forces, armaments and weapons. Repeatedly from the tongue of grandeur was this word heard: Pure deeds, pure words, and praiseworthy character are counted among the mighty hosts of the Truth, exalted be His glory. The acts and deeds of the beasts of the earth have had and have no worth. One must conquer the horizons of hearts through the hosts of goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. No sword is sharper than the Word of God. If a few souls arise purely for the sake of God, speak for God and fix their gaze upon God, assuredly its effects will become manifest and evident in the world, as indeed they have become manifest and ye witness them. This servant also conveyeth greetings to that honored soul and beseecheth confirmation for him from the Truth, exalted be His glory.</p>
<p>Likewise mention was made of the honored lady, the wife of the departed and blessed ’Abdu’l-Hamid Khan, upon them both be the Glory of God, and of that leaf’s measures of firmness, steadfastness and constancy. Praise be to God, that leaf hath attained the grace of the Truth, exalted be His glory. It is hoped she will remain so firm and steadfast in the Cause that the men of the world will be powerless to change, alter or prevent her - how much less the women of the earth. Mention of her was made in the Most Holy and Exalted Presence, and the Sun of Grace shone forth. Well is it with her and blessed is she.</p>
<p>At this hour this servant was present at the Throne when the Tongue of Grandeur made mention of the departed and blessed Mulla ’Abdu’r-Rahim, upon him be the Glory of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. O what a mention! Were it to be cast upon darkness it would transform it into light, and were it cast upon dust there would arise therefrom a creation none can reckon save God, the Lord of the Return.</p>
<p>Thereafter mention was made of the spiritual friend Jinab-i-Mulla ’Abdu’r-Razzaq, upon him be His glory. The Sun of loving-kindness has shone forth in such wise that this servant is incapable and unable to make full mention thereof. Blessed is he and blessed are those who have attained to His grace and bounty. In truth, this evanescent one is abashed before him. God willing, hereafter through His might and power that which was neglected shall be made good.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the letter of my spiritual friend Jinab-i-Abu’l-Ma’ani, that is Abu’l-Ma’ali, upon him be the glory of God and His loving-kindness, reached this servant, and likewise he presented a petition to the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. This evanescent one laid all before His countenance. At that very moment, sacred Tablets were revealed from the heaven of oneness specifically for him and the souls mentioned, and were dispatched. This evanescent servant beseeches and hopes from God, exalted be His glory, that He may cause them to attain unto the visitation of these exalted Tablets. Verily, He has power over all things.</p>
<p>And one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was also revealed and sent specifically for the noble lady, the mother of Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Ashraf, upon them both be the glory of God and His light. Mention of the martyrs of that land and the aforementioned noble lady has been and continues to be made in the Most Holy Presence. Verily, they are among the triumphant, by the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>One night, this evanescent one was in the presence of Him Who stands, when the Tongue of Oneness made mention of the friends of that land. Among the souls whose mention attained to the Most Holy Presence in these days was likewise that of Jinab-i-K-D and Aqa Akbar, upon them both be the glory of God, who is among those related to them. And some time ago a Tablet was revealed from the heaven of loving-kindness specifically for the second name and was sent to His Holiness, the Name of God M-H, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory of God, that it might be delivered. Praise be to God, the ocean of divine bounty has been and continues to be directed towards those who have turned to Him, the sincere ones, the steadfast ones, and the firm ones. By His Own Self, the Truth, that which flows forth from the Most Exalted Pen in the nights and days is such that those who would enumerate it are powerless to reckon it. To this bears witness every fair-minded and perceiving one.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have been and continue to be mindful of my beloved Aqa Muhammad-Javad, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of creation. This servant has ever besought and continues to beseech from God, exalted be His glory, his success and confirmation. One day the Tongue of Grandeur spoke this most exalted word, exalted be His majesty: “O servant present! Make mention of Javad on My behalf. Verily, We send Our greetings from this station upon him and upon his family and upon her who attained unto My presence. Verily, We counsel her to make mention of My bounty and My loving-kindness and My mercy which has preceded all.” End quote. God is witness and testifier that they have ever been and continue to be in view. God willing, may they be illumined by the lights of steadfastness and be established and renowned in the love of God. The light of the Cause has illumined most lands. Now all must hold fast with perfect unity and harmony that all may attain. This is the truth, there is no doubt therein. The servant beseeches his Lord to protect, through His Name, the stations of those who have turned unto Him and have borne hardships in His path. Verily, He is the Protector, the Trustworthy.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! The contents of the letter of my beloved, His Holiness Samandar, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, its answer has been revealed from the heaven of loving-kindness. Blessed and welcome tidings to him and to those with him and to those who love him and hear his word concerning the Cause of our Lord and his Lord, our Beloved and his Beloved. And the Glory and the Great Glory and the Peace and the Mercy and the Loving-kindness be upon his honor and his family and his offspring from God, our Lord and his Lord, our Goal and his Goal and the Goal of all the worlds.</p>
<p>Again salutations, praise and expressions of sincere devotion are offered in Thy presence. If Thou seekest a deputy and surety, verily the True One is present and manifest. He is indeed the best Deputy, the best Surety, the best Lord, and the best Helper.</p>

<p>In His Name, the Consoler, the Comforter, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!</p>
<p>This is a Visitation Tablet revealed by My Most Glorious Pen in the Most Exalted Horizon for His Holiness the Prince of Martyrs, Husayn ibn ’Ali - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for him.</p>
<p>God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who hath come is the One promised in all the Books and Scriptures, mentioned in the hearts of those near unto God and the sincere ones. Through Him the Tree of Utterance hath called out in the Kingdom of Knowledge: “O followers of all religions! By the life of the All-Merciful, the days of sorrow have come, for such tribulation hath befallen the Dayspring of proof and the Dawning-place of evidence as hath caused the dwellers of the pavilion of glory in the most exalted Paradise to lament, and the inhabitants of the tabernacle of grace in the supreme Heaven to cry out.”</p>
<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who hath appeared is the Hidden Treasure and the Concealed Mystery through Whom God hath revealed the secrets of what was and what shall be. This is the Day wherein the Sign of the past hath been fulfilled by “the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the Throne and the exalted Seat.” On this Day have the banners of idle fancies and vain imaginings been reversed, and the decree “Verily, we are God’s and to Him shall we return” hath come to pass.</p>
<p>This is the Day whereon appeared the Great News which God and His Prophets and Messengers had foretold. Therein did those near unto God hasten to the sealed Choice Wine and drink thereof in the name of God, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. On this Day did the cry of lamentation rise from all directions, and the tongue of utterance proclaimed: “Grief be unto the loved ones of God and His chosen ones, affliction be unto the beloved of God and His trusted ones, and sorrow and anguish be unto the Manifestations of God’s Cause, the Lord of what was and what shall be!”</p>
<p>O dwellers of the cities of names, and ye who abide in the lofty chambers of the supreme Paradise, and O faithful ones in the Kingdom of eternity! Exchange your white and crimson garments for black raiment, for the Most Great Calamity and the Supreme Affliction have come to pass, whereat the Messenger of God hath wept, the heart of the Immaculate One hath melted, and the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise have raised their lamentations, as have the inhabitants of the Most Glorious Pavilion and the companions of the Crimson Ark who recline upon the couches of love and faithfulness.</p>
<p>Alas, alas for the wrongdoing whereby the realities of existence were set ablaze and that which befell the Lord of the Seen and the Unseen at the hands of those who violated God’s Covenant and His Testament, who denied His proof, rejected His bounty, and disputed His signs! Alas, alas! May the spirits of the Concourse on High be a sacrifice for thy calamity, O Son of the Divine Lote-Tree and the Mystery enshrined in the Most Exalted Word!</p>
<p>Would that the decree of beginning and return had never appeared, and that eyes had never beheld thy body cast upon the dust! Through thy tragedy, the ocean of utterance was prevented from its waves of wisdom and knowledge, and the breezes of the All-Glorious were cut off. Through thy sorrow were traces effaced, fruits fallen, the sighs of the righteous ascended, and the tears of the chosen ones descended.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O Prince and Sovereign of Martyrs! Alas, alas, O Pride and Beloved of Martyrs! I testify that through thee the sun of detachment shone forth from the horizon of creation, the temples of those near unto God were adorned with the ornament of righteousness, and the light of divine knowledge radiated throughout the kingdom of creation. Were it not for thee, the decree of the Kaf and the Nun would not have been manifested, nor would the seal of the Choice Wine have been broken. Were it not for thee, the Dove of Evidence would not have warbled upon the branch of utterance, nor would the Tongue of Grandeur have spoken amidst the concourse of religions.</p>
<p>Through thy sorrow appeared separation and parting between the ‘H’ and the ‘W’, and the cry of the monotheists was raised throughout the lands. Through thy calamity, the Supreme Pen was stilled from its scratching, the ocean of bounty from its waves, the breezes of grace from their wafting, the rivers of Paradise from their flowing, and the sun of justice from its shining.</p>
<p>I bear witness that thou wert the Sign of the All-Merciful in all creation and […]</p>
<p>The Manifestation of Divine Proof and Evidence among religions! Through Thee hath God fulfilled His promise and manifested His sovereignty. Through Thee hath the mystery of divine knowledge appeared in all lands and the Sun of Certitude hath shone from the horizon of the heaven of proof. Through Thee have appeared the power of God and His Cause, and the mysteries of God and His wisdom. Were it not for Thee, the Hidden Treasure would not have been revealed, nor His firm and irrevocable Decree. Were it not for Thee, the Call would not have been raised from the Supreme Horizon, nor would the pearls of wisdom and utterance have appeared from the treasuries of the Most Glorious Pen. Through Thy tribulation was the joy of the Most Exalted Paradise transformed and the cry of the denizens of the Kingdom of Names was raised. Thou art He through Whose acceptance all faces turned toward the Lord of existence, and the Divine Lote Tree proclaimed: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Sovereign of the seen and the unseen.” All things were as one in both their outer and inner reality, but when they heard of Thy tribulations they were separated, scattered, and appeared in different forms and diverse colors. All existence is a sacrifice unto Thy Being, O Dawning-Place of God’s revelation and Dayspring of His Most Great Sign! All souls are a sacrifice unto Thy tribulation, O Manifestation of the Unseen in the kingdom of creation! I testify that through Thee was established the law of sacrifice throughout all regions, and the hearts of the lovers were melted in separation. I testify that the Light lamented Thy tribulations and the Mount cried out because of what was inflicted upon Thee by Thine enemies. Were it not for Thee, the All-Merciful would not have been revealed unto the Son of Imran on the Mount of Knowledge. I call upon Thee and make mention of Thee, O Dawning-Place of detachment in creation and Mystery of Manifestation in the realm of invention! Through Thee was opened the door of generosity to the world and the light of ancient days shone forth among the nations. I testify that by the raising of Thy hope-filled hand were the hands of all created things lifted toward God, the Revealer of verses, and by Thy turning toward the Most Glorious Horizon did all beings turn unto God, the Manifestor of clear signs. Thou art the Point through which was detailed the knowledge of what was and what will be, and the Mine from which appeared the gems of sciences and arts. Through Thy tribulation was stayed the Pen of Destiny and tears flowed from the eyes of the detached ones. Alas, alas! Through Thy grief were the pillars of the world shaken, and existence nearly returned to nothingness. Thou art He at Whose command every sea surged, every fragrance wafted, and every wise decree appeared. Through Thee was established the law of the Book among the peoples and flowed the river of mercy in the hereafter. I have turned toward Thee, O Mystery of the Torah and the Gospel, and Dawning-Place of the verses of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful! Through Thee was built the city of detachment and was raised the banner of righteousness upon the highest peaks. Were it not for Thee, the fragrance of divine knowledge would have been cut off from the realm of possibility and the breeze of the All-Merciful from all lands. Through Thy power appeared the power of God, His sovereignty, His glory and His might, and through Thee surged the ocean of bounty and the Sovereign of Manifestation was established upon the throne of existence. I testify that through Thee were the veils of glory rent asunder, the limbs of the misguided ones trembled, the traces of idle fancies were effaced, and the fruits of the tree of vain imaginings fell. Through Thy most pure blood were adorned the cities of the lovers, and darkness seized the light of all regions, and through Thee did the lovers hasten to the place of sacrifice and the yearning ones to the Dawning-Place of the light of reunion. O Mystery of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen! I know not which of Thy tribulations to recount in the world, which of Thy afflictions to spread among the nations. Thou art the Recipient of God’s knowledge and the Dawning-Place of His Most Great Signs, the Rising-Place of His remembrance among all beings, and the Source of His commandments in the kingdom of creation. O Most Exalted Pen! Say: The first light that gleamed and shone forth, and the first fragrance that […]</p>
<p>O rustling of the Divine Tree of Utterance and Tree of Certitude in the Paradise of Knowledge! Through thee shone forth the Sun of Revelation and spoke forth the One Who conversed upon Sinai, and the decree of forgiveness and bounty was made manifest amidst the concourse of creation. I testify that thou wert the Path of God and His Balance, the Dawning-Place of His verses and the Dayspring of His power, the Source of His firm commandments and His penetrating ordinances. Thou art the City of Love, whose hosts are the lovers, and the Ark of God, whose sailors and passengers are the sincere ones. Through thy utterance surged the ocean of knowledge, O Spirit of Knowledge, and from the horizon of the heaven of proof shone forth the Orb of Certitude. At thy call in the field of war and conflict rose up the lamentation of the Dawning-Places of Beauty in the paradise of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Through thy manifestation was raised the standard of righteousness and piety, and were erased the traces of tyranny and iniquity. I testify that thou wert the treasury of the pearls of God’s knowledge and the repository of the gems of His utterance and wisdom. Through thy calamity the Point left Its exalted station and took for Itself a position beneath the letter Ba. Thou art the Most Great Tablet wherein are inscribed the mysteries of what hath been and what shall be, and the knowledge of the first and the last. Thou art the Most Exalted Pen through whose movement were set in motion the earth and heaven, and all things turned toward the lights of the countenance of God, the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust below. Alas, alas! Through thy calamity arose the wailing of lamentation from the Most Exalted Paradise, and the Maids of Heaven took for themselves an earthly station in the Most High Paradise. Blessed is the servant who lamenteth for thy calamities, blessed is the maidservant who crieth out in thy tribulations, blessed is the eye from which flow tears, and blessed is the earth honored by thy holy body and the place which gained the distinction of thy gentle form.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God, O God of Manifestation and the One revealed upon the Branch of Sinai! I beseech Thee by this Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of detachment, whereby was established the decree of trust and resignation throughout creation, and by the bodies that were dismembered in Thy path, and by the hearts that were melted in Thy love, and by the blood that was shed in the land of submission before Thy face, to forgive those who have turned toward this Most Exalted Station and this Most High Summit, and to ordain for them from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall make the fragrance of their acceptance and sincerity imperishable in the cities of Thy remembrance and praise. O Lord! Thou seest them attracted by the sweet-scented breezes of Thy Revelation and detached from all else in Thy days. I beseech Thee to give them to drink, from the hand of Thy bounty, the Kawthar of Thy eternity, then write down for them, from the pen of Thy grace, the recompense of attaining Thy presence. I beseech Thee, O God of Names, by Thy Command whereby Thou didst subdue the kingdom of earth and heaven, and by Thy Call whereby were enraptured the denizens of the realms above, to assist us in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with, and in that which will elevate our stations in the court of Thy glory and the precincts of Thy nearness. O Lord! We are Thy servants who have turned toward the revelations of the lights of the Orb of Thy Manifestation, which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance before the faces of Thy creation, to assist us in such deeds as Thou hast commanded us in Thy Perspicuous Book. Verily Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Moreover, I beseech Thee, O our God and our Master, by Thy power which hath encompassed all created things and by Thy might which hath surrounded all existence, to illumine the throne of tyranny with the lights of the sun of Thy justice and to transform the seat of oppression into the throne of equity through Thy power and sovereignty. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath revealed Himself through the light of the gleaming rays dawning from the horizon of utterance upon the Supreme Pen. Then did the Book of Names appear and cry out with the most exalted call between earth and heaven, bearing witness to that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath witnessed in the heaven of eternity - that verily there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Thereupon did the realm of divinity quake and proclaim: “By God the Truth! The gate of meeting hath been opened, and the Beloved hath appeared in His most glorious beauty!” And the realm of might did cry: “Exalted, exalted be He Who hath illumined the horizon of manifestation, through Whom the preserved scroll hath been unrolled and the hidden secret revealed! Blessed are ye, O people of eternity, and happy are ye, O people of creation! Draw nigh through His Most Glorious Name and drink deep of that which giveth life to the spirit throughout the eternity of God, the Creator of heaven.”</p>
<p>And the Kingdom was stirred and all within it, then called out with sweetest melody: “O dwellers of the cities of names and the kingdom of eternity! This is the Day wherein the eyes of the Prophets have been gladdened and the life of the chosen ones made sweet. The tongue hath spoken at the appearance of utterance from the horizon of the words of the Lord of Religions. Blessed are ye, for ye have attained unto the Day promised by the All-Merciful in the books of all religions. This is the Day of God’s manifestation without veil or concealment, the Day of God’s appearance - verily He hath come upon the clouds!”</p>
<p>Thus hath the servant of the Ancient Beauty spoken through the wafting breaths of revelation from the paradise of our Lord’s will, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Praise be to God Who hath created pure, subtle, everlasting and eternal spirits from the breezes that have blown from the right hand of His Will, and made them ready for His days and enabled them to attain His presence when the lights of His countenance shone forth. He hath made their spiritual sustenance the hearkening to His utterance, their bodily growth the reading of His verses, and their hearts’ delight the stirring of the winds of His grace.</p>
<p>Exalted, exalted be He Who created us through His name! Exalted, exalted be He Who manifested us through His sovereignty! Exalted, exalted be He Who caused us to attain unto His power and grandeur! Exalted, exalted be He Who made us speak through His bounty and utterance! By God’s life! Every exalted one hath prostrated at His mention, and the name “exalted” hath been thunderstruck by His sovereignty, and its essence hath bowed down at the manifestation of His grandeur. Can mention attain unto Him? Nay, by the Lord of might! Can He be known through the movement of the Pen? Nay, by the Lord of eternity! Can He be bounded by the limitations of understanding? Glory be to Him, glory be to Him, above such utterance!</p>
<p>That station whose very air proclaimeth “There is none other God but Him” and whose very dust crieth out “There is none other God but Him” - how can understanding ever hope to soar into the atmosphere of praise of Him Who created it through a single letter from the kingdom of His utterance? Far be it, far be it, exalted be it, exalted be it above every utterance, above every mention, above every praise! The ocean of utterance hath been stirred by His utterance, and the spheres have paused to hearken to His call.</p>
<p>We beseech Him by His sovereignty, His power and His might, to give us to drink, at every moment, from the Kawthar of His knowledge which floweth from the heaven of His bounty, to preserve us beneath His shadow, and to make us steadfast in His Cause. Verily He is the Powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! I was resting in my place, contemplating the manifestations of my Lord and marveling at the ways of His sovereignty, when one of the loved ones brought your letter. I took it and opened it, and from it wafted the fragrance of your love, your sincerity, and your turning to God, the Lord of the worlds. After perusing its contents, I turned toward the Throne and presented what was therein before His presence. Then the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, saying: “Blessed is he for having recognized the Day of God, for having been stirred by the breezes of Revelation, and for having turned to the Supreme Horizon when the people of creation turned away from it. He hath with God, the Lord of Names, a station which no heart can comprehend, nor mind encompass, nor soul enumerate, nor pen record, nor page contain. How can that which is non-existent describe what it heard from His tongue, when the Kingdom of Utterance is set in motion by but a single letter of His words? I seek forgiveness from Him for all that I have mentioned and written, and for all that I shall mention and write, for this is the Day whereon the ocean of forgiveness hath surged, the heaven of bounty hath been upraised, and the sun of generosity hath shone forth. Blessed are the people who have attained unto this Most Great Bounty and who have taken refuge beneath His most pure hem. We beseech God to assist all to do that which He loveth and pleaseth.”</p>
<p>My soul be a sacrifice for your love! The distinguished letter adorned by your exalted pen refreshed the tree of existence like the morning breeze and vernal winds. In truth, this evanescent one is incapable and unable to make mention of it. All of it was presented in the Most Holy Court, and supreme favor shone forth from the horizon of His will. Praise be to God that you have arisen to serve the Cause in that land and are speaking in divine praise and glorification. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to assist you at all times with His special confirmations. I swear by the Beloved of the world that if the heedless, ignorant people were to become aware of even less than a needle’s eye of the conditions of this Day, of what hath appeared therein, and of the surging of the ocean of inner meanings that lies before all eyes, they would all cry out in wilderness and prairie, saying: “Verily, He is the One manifest from the Supreme Horizon!” A wondrous talisman hath appeared in the world - before everyone’s eyes the ocean surgeth and the sun shineth forth, yet none perceiveth it. From all directions the Herald proclaimeth: “This is the sealed wine - take it and drink!” Nevertheless, hearts remain unaware and ears unconscious, as if the power of sight hath been withheld from eyes and the faculty of hearing forbidden to ears. By God! These conditions proceed from naught but their own deeds. However, one must petition and beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, and those who are today mentioned by His Name and who repose beneath the Tree must arise with their whole being, with all their limbs, heart and tongue, to serve the Cause and, united and in harmony, occupy themselves with the remembrance and praise of God. But this must be done with wisdom, for today in God’s sight the observance of wisdom taketh precedence over all deeds. All must hold fast unto it, lest there occur that which would extinguish the divine fire and cause hearts to be troubled. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the letter Shin, upon him be what is upon him, and his return to the lowest depths of Sin - this was presented before His presence. He said that all shall return to their places. Verily, He is the Avenger, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>As regards M.Sh., his honor Aqa Siyyid Isma’il Azghandi arrived in the Most Great Prison and presented certain petitions on his behalf to the Most Holy Court. It was stated that he had been the cause of grievous errors, errors that were without parallel or precedent. Nevertheless, in view of the pre-existence of divine mercy and the all-encompassing nature of heavenly grace, if he should wholly turn unto God, there is hope of forgiveness for him. A special prayer was revealed from the Supreme Pen and it was commanded that he should recite it. Should he act in accordance with that which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Command of the Ancient King, the breezes of bounty and generosity will take hold of him. He, verily, is the Reformer of all things and the Forgiver of sins. There is none other God but He, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning Hadi, these are tidings that have previously issued forth from the ocean of divine knowledge. As hath been stated, the cawing of the crows - meaning the false claimants - shall appear in most lands. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to adorn His loved ones with the robe of steadfastness, which is the most glorious garment and most excellent ornament in the sight of God, and that they may become so firm that they may regard the consensus of the peoples of the world, the cawing of all nations, the claims of the claimants, and the clamor of the falsifiers as mere nothingness. He, verily, is powerful and mighty over all things.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the rosewater of his honor Haji arrived. God willing, may they ever be perfumed by the roses growing in the gardens of divine knowledge, and may they partake of the true elixir which is, in truth, the most pure Kawthar, mentioned in one place as the sealed wine, and in other places by different names. The other three bottles were truly outstanding. Upon him and upon their sender be the glory of God and His mercy.</p>
<p>Another matter: all the petitions sent with Shaykh and Haji Ahmad arrived and attained the Most Holy Court. Replies to all have been revealed, and most of the main points of those petitions have been honored with the response of the Lord of Lords, that this might serve as a testimony for those souls, did they but know and preserve it, that they might remain steadfast. Convey greetings to all from this evanescent one.</p>
<p>Another glad tiding is that in these days a special Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will and given to Shaykh Salman to deliver to your honor, along with four [unnamed Tablets] which your honor may give to whomever you deem appropriate, as well as one Tablet addressed to the handmaiden of God, and two Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Pure Tablets specifically for their honors and [the gentlemen], upon them be the glory of God, which were sent by post. God willing, they will attain unto them. Although this year Shaykh was much delayed due to the discord, upheaval, and turmoil in these parts and could not find opportunity to return, God willing he will depart in these two or three days.</p>
<p>The conveyance of this servant’s greetings to his honor Rafi’ [Badi’], upon him be 9 66 [the glory of God], is entrusted to your honor’s grace, and there is also a Tablet specifically revealed for him from the heaven of favor which is with Shaykh. God willing, he will attain unto it. Glory be upon you, O Afnan of God, then His grandeur, His majesty, His might and His exaltation, [as] the heavens and earth have been illumined by the light of our Lord, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Might and Power! Praise be to God, the Glorious King and Lord of the Kingdom of Grace and Bounty, Who brought existence into being, made manifest the mysteries of the unseen from the world of visibility, promised humanity the Promised Day, and gave them glad tidings of the appearance of the appointed time. When the veil was rent asunder and the mystery of return was revealed, when the veil of concealment was removed from the face of the mysteries of creation on the Day of Return, and when the realities of knowledge were sent down in scrolls and books from the presence of the Mighty, the Bestower, the hearts of those endowed with understanding were attracted to the King of the Day of Reckoning. They rent asunder the greatest veil through the power of the Lord of Destiny and Creator of humanity, and turned with their hearts toward the Most Manifest Hidden Mystery. They recognized the greatest encrypted symbol and beheld the Most Hidden, Most Manifest, Most Luminous Beauty.</p>
<p>When they circled round this Fire and acquired illumination from the lights of the Tree of Command through the power of the Lord of the Kingdom of Might, the hearts of mysteries were stirred, and the banners of hatred and enmity were raised against God’s chosen servants, preventing them from turning toward their Lord, the Mighty, the Chosen One. Say: Why do you hasten through the wilderness of idle fancies? The Hidden Mystery hath appeared, the veil hath been lifted from the face of the treasured Symbol, and the clouds have been removed from the beauty of the preserved Light. Hath passion prevented you from reaching the Lord of the First and the Last? Do you object to the people of wisdom turning toward their Lord, the Sovereign of all humanity? Can the people of understanding remain patient in drawing near to the divine sanctuary? Nay, by Him from Whom all originated and to Whom all return! Can anyone prevent the people of righteousness? Say: Do you threaten them with affliction in the path of God, the Lord of Names? They are people who have accepted adversity and hardship, who have faced with their breasts the arrows of oppression from enemies, seeking to enter the Kingdom of eternity.</p>
<p>By the Lord of creation! You are but in heedlessness and loss. Even if you were to cut apart the bodies of those who have entered the heaven of faith with the swords of hatred and tyranny, you would not be able to turn them away from the path of certitude. Say: The way hath become manifest, the proof hath been perfected, and the thirsty one hath hastened to the Kawthar of knowledge flowing from the Spring of ?ad beneath the throne of the King of the Day of Resurrection. Blessed are ye, O people of love, for having entered the pavilion of holiness in the kingdom of righteousness! Through your steadfastness, the hearts of the people of enmity were disturbed, and through your firmness on the path of the Cause, the limbs of the people of tyranny and corruption trembled.</p>
<p>O my God, my Master, and my King! There remains no land in Thy domains but hath been reddened with the blood of Thy chosen ones, and no tree but is adorned with the bodies of Thy loved ones. Such hath befallen them as hath caused the tears of the dwellers of the pavilion of Thy glory to flow morning and evening, and they have suffered at the hands of the heedless that which hath caused the eyes of those in the heaven of Thy Cause to weep at daybreak and sunset. Thou knowest that they desired naught in Thy kingdom save to remove corruption from among Thy servants, to adorn their bodies with the robes of love and unity, and to crown their heads with the diadems of fellowship and affection. For in this Revelation, Thou didst command them only to strive to remove hatred and rancor, to exert effort in eliminating discord, and to manifest love and harmony among all peoples. Among men are those who opposed them for turning to Thee and drawing light from Thy knowledge, who pronounced them infidels and polytheists, and made their blood lawful out of transgression against Thy sovereignty and aggression against Thy servants. Others accused them of corruption in the land, thereby making them the target of hardship and affliction[…]</p>
<p>Thereby He made them the target of hardship and the recipient of both joy and sorrow. All atoms bear witness that they desired no corruption in Thy dominion and walked only in the path of Thy command, which is the unity of Thy land and love for their fellow beings among Thy creation. Is not their patience through successive years, their endurance of every affliction, and their obedience to every command sufficient? By Thy exalted Self and Thy prevailing testimony over all things, if the heedless were to be fair, even less than a needle’s eye would suffice for them to witness that they desired naught but the good of all and the welfare of humanity, to purify Thy land from discord and division, and to adorn it with manifestations of fellowship and harmony. Everything in Thy dominion hath a sign, and the sign of their truthfulness is their deeds in this age and their patience in times of hardship. I beseech Thee, O my Creator, by Thy Name which hath conquered all the world and encompassed all nations, to remove from these eyes the veil of ignorance that they may comprehend what Thou didst intend in revealing Thy laws and ordinances and manifesting Thy commandments in Thy scriptures and tablets. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest and the Sovereign over what Thou desirest. There is none other God but Thee, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Peerless.</p>
<p>O thou who dwellest in the shade of the Divine Lote-Tree and resideth in the gardens of grace and bounty! I have known the degrees of thy love for God and the stations of thy sincerity for the Face of God. I beseech God, thy Lord and the Lord of all things, to assist thee at all times, to grant thee the Tasnim of bounty and beneficence, and to raise thee to the highest degrees of knowledge and understanding. Observe the world and the differences therein, and reflect on what hath been uttered by the Tongue of Will concerning the stations of fellowship and unity. The people have imagined this mighty Cause and momentous matter to be a source of corruption and disunity, whereas the divine Law commands humanity only to love and abandon enmity. Say: This is a Cause through which God manifests what lieth within man of spiritual qualities and divine knowledge, and He desireth naught from it save ascension to the highest reaches of understanding and the ultimate summit of human progress. Say: Through it grow in the soil of hearts the ears of certitude, and from the trees of being appear the flowers of inner meanings and utterance in remembrance of the All-Merciful and the unity of the All-Glorious Lord.</p>
<p>Spiritual friend, for some time no letter has been sent due to travel. God is witness and testament that you have never been forgotten and, God willing, you shall never be. During the journey, at one of the stopping places, a letter from you was observed and a brief reply was written and sent. After attaining the presence, mention of you flowed from the tongue of grace and bounty, and such favor was evident regarding you that pen and tongue are incapable and fall short of mentioning and enumerating it. Blessed art thou, again blessed art thou! In truth, in this Most Great Revelation, the favors of the Ancient King have encompassed His loved ones in such wise as is beyond the description and enumeration of those who would describe and enumerate. We must ever give thanks throughout the dominion of the seen and unseen to God, the Sovereign of might and King of glory and divinity. Before this servant’s journey, a tablet was graciously revealed for you from the Source of bounty, but due to certain considerations of wisdom, its sending was delayed.</p>
<p>Before this servant’s journey, a tablet had been graciously bestowed from the Source of Bounty for your honor. Due to certain wise considerations, its dispatch was delayed, but now, in view of an urgent matter, it is being sent herewith. I beseech God to honor you with beholding it as He honored you with its revelation, that His grace may be completed and your eyes be gladdened through the bounty of the Lord of the Kingdom of Generosity and Justice.</p>
<p>Convey sublime and wondrous greetings to the friends of God on behalf of this servant and say: In all the manifestations of His Manifestations, God, exalted be His glory, has ordained tribulations and hardships for His friends, and has assigned worldly possessions to those who are heedless and occupied with vain pursuits. He has made trials and tests the touchstone for His friends, even as He formerly said: “We shall surely try you with something of fear and hunger, and loss of wealth and lives and fruits…”</p>
<p>You must at all times hold fast to the cord of steadfastness and cling to the hem of grace. The transience of the world and the passing away of all things therein is a matter about which there can be no doubt, and no person of understanding would set his heart upon that which will assuredly pass away, nor would he be content with the comfort of numbered days. What wise traveler would be satisfied with the ornaments of wayside inns and forsake his homeland and destination? Nay, by God! No obstacle can deter the wise, nor can the embellishments of this transient world prevent them from reaching their divine homeland and ultimate goal.</p>
<p>We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to honor His loved ones at all times with the robe of steadfastness and to make them firm and steadfast as mountains in times of hardship. Though the body may grow weary from successive trials, this shall pass away while the eternal kingdom and complete and lasting comfort shall follow. O friends of God! I counsel you to preserve what you possess of the pearls of God’s love, for thieves lie in wait, seeking opportunity to snatch away that which distinguishes you among creation. Would that the people knew! By God, were they to understand, they would cast aside what they possess and sacrifice their souls in their longing to attain to what you have known of the wondrous secrets of recognition and in their desire to acquire what God has given you of the gems of the mysteries of certitude.</p>
<p>Say: O God of humanity and Master of destiny’s mystery! We beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty which prevails over the world and by Thy proof manifest among the nations to aid us in steadfastness in Thy Cause, at whose appearance the feet of the mighty have stumbled and the limbs of men have trembled. O Lord! We are weak and Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty. Look not upon us with the eye of justice, but with the glances of bounty and grace. Take our hands in the hand of Thy giving, deliver us from those who are immersed in the depths of remoteness and deprivation, and free us from the schemes of those who have strayed from the shore of the Law of Faith. O our God and Master of our destinies! Make known to Thy servants that which Thou hast distinguished us with in Thy lands, that they may know that we desired not corruption, nor that which Thou hast not commanded in Thy Books and Tablets, but rather the spread of the signs of love and the adorning of the world with the ornaments of harmony and unity, O Master of servants and King of the Day of Gathering!</p>
<p>We beseech God, exalted be His grandeur, to protect your honor at all times.</p>
<p>By the King of the Day of Calling (God), we beseech His Majesty, exalted be His grandeur, to protect you at all times and to aid you in that which is purely good. Be assured by God’s grace and His care - verily He is with you and ordains for you all good in His Book. Always write and send reports of your circumstances, and be ever mindful of wisdom in all things. He has previously said: “Despair not of the Spirit of God.” And the Glory be upon you, and the Spirit be upon you and upon those with you among the loved ones of your Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>Today the effulgences of the Sun of Truth have shone forth upon all, and cities and lands are in rapture and ecstasy from the attraction of the Call of the All-Chosen One. This Call is the water of life for the righteous, whom God hath described in the Book: “Truly the righteous shall drink of a cup tempered with camphor.” Blessed is the being who hath attained unto this existence and come into being. Woe unto every heedless doubter.</p>
<p>Worthy of mention and praise are those souls who today were not prevented by the taunts of the people, the cawing of the ravens, and the threats of the oppressors from the Light of the Manifest Horizon. They heard the Call of Truth and joined themselves unto it. These are the banners of guidance and the standards of grace. Blessed is the servant who hath chosen for himself a station beneath their shade, and remote is he who hath turned away from them and clung to that which shall never profit him.</p>
<p>And then, O beloved of my heart, thy spiritual missive arrived like the vernal breeze of the All-Merciful, bringing glad tidings, bearing good news, and bestowing bounty. Its glad tidings were the sweet fragrances of the love of the Beloved of the worlds and the health and well-being of that beloved of soul and spirit. Its good news was thy steadfastness in the Cause of the Beloved. Its bounty was the fruits of inner meanings and utterance that appeared and were manifest from the Tree of Words. In truth, what is the sustenance of existence and the cause of its life? By thy life! It is the love of thy Beloved and our Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and the earth. In the sight of those possessed of insight and hearing, naught else is mentioned save Truth and His love and service, and in reality naught else is worthy of mention.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! The heedless ones desire to veil the effulgences of the lights of the divine Sun of Manifestation. Far, far from it! Say: O ye ignorant ones! What profit did the former people gain from their calumnies and lies, what bounty did they obtain, and what did they achieve on the Day of Judgment? How long will ye remain debarred by vain imaginings and veiled by rejected and thick veils? I beseech God to aid all to rend these veils asunder. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Mentions and degrees came successively, leaving no opportunity to speak of the letters, their number, their receipt and their reading - and rightly so, for the mentions were mentions of praise of the Beloved of the worlds, and the degrees were degrees of His grace and bounty. Nevertheless, they can now be renewed, therefore I state that the letters of that spiritual beloved arrived, and each, after being read and perused, attained the honor of being heard by the Lord of creation, and each time a divine utterance shone forth from the Dawning-Place of the words of the Beloved of the worlds. And at this moment, after the presentation of another letter, these exalted words emerged from the Treasury of divine knowledge and wisdom - blessed and exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>“Verily hearing and sight are within My grasp of power, and I am the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.”</p>
<p>O bird soaring in the atmosphere of My love, present before My face, who hast attained to hearkening unto My call and beholding My horizon! Hear thou My call once again from the precincts of Akka. Verily there is no God but Him, the Single, the All-Informed. Say: O company of the heedless, cast away what ye possess and take what hath been given you from the presence of One knowing and wise. By My life, that which your divines possess shall profit you not, nor shall that which hath been ordained from the presence of One mighty and powerful. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of that which ye have been commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: abandon tyranny and wickedness, and take hold of trustworthiness and godliness and truthfulness and purity, by command of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. The Wronged One hath not spoken from desire, but rather by what hath been revealed in the Book of God, the Ancient Commander. Through moral excellence are revealed the stations of man in the contingent world, as testified by honored servants whom the whisperings of the people have not kept back from arising to serve God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>O Attar! Sorrows have encompassed the Wronged One, whereat the tears of Mine eyes have rained upon My cheeks, both outwardly and inwardly, and My heart and My pen have lamented, yet most of the people are heedless. The luminary of trustworthiness hath set in the capital, and therein hath appeared that which hath prevented the Pen from revealing it, the tongue from mentioning it, and the perceptive faculty from comprehending it, as witnessed by him who possesseth a clear Book. We have counseled all in most of Our Tablets to goodly deeds and praiseworthy character, yet the people have cast the counsel of God behind their backs and followed what their passions commanded them. Lo! They are among the losers. The heedless one hath taken God’s enemy as his helper, and they have advanced with swords of hatred and committed that which hath caused every just and discerning one to weep.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to My loved ones, remind them of My verses and what hath been sent down from the heaven of My utterance, and We counsel them with that whereby the station of the Word and their stations among the servants shall be exalted. Blessed is he who hath heard and acted, and woe unto them that have turned away.</p>
<p>The servant present hath brought thy letters time and again. We have heard each one and answered thee with that whereby the fragrance of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of this exalted station, hath been diffused. Look, then remember those days when thou wert present before the Wronged One and heardst what the Tongue of Utterance spoke in the Kingdom of Knowledge, and thou didst behold the ocean and its waves, and the light and its effulgence, and thou didst attain unto that which was inscribed in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>O Attar! Upon thee be My glory! Hearken in the Persian tongue: All the letters sent have been heard, and in each instance thy mention hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to all the brethren, family, and associates. All are mentioned before the Wronged One. Ask thou God that He may cause all to attain unto that which beseemeth the station of man. Great sorrow hath befallen this Wronged One, for in the great city there occurred that which caused the eye of justice to weep, and equity to suffer beneath the darkness of tyranny, and the form of truthfulness to be afflicted in the talons of falsehood. In brief, justice and equity and kindliness remain concealed in some corner until God shall manifest them in truth. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord, my Master, my Desire! Thou seest and knowest that I have counseled Thy servants with that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and adorn them with the ornament of Thy attributes and character. Among them are those who have heard and answered, and those who have turned away and have not answered. O Lord! Thou art the Generous, possessed of great bounty. Deliver Thy loved ones from the fire of greed and covetousness, and adorn them with the ornament of contentment and detachment. Verily, Thou art the Lord of creation. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! That which hath been revealed, a single word thereof sufficeth. By Thy life, O My beloved, the liver of trustworthiness hath melted and the tears of chastity and faithfulness have flowed. In these days I have beheld the Purpose of all the worlds in such grief that were the veil to be lifted and the friends to hear with their true hearing, all would perish. Therefore concealment is preferable, and the Cause is in the hands of God, the Lord of all mankind.</p>
<p>Another matter: the honored Ismu’llah (66), may all the Most Glorious Glory rest upon him, hath repeatedly brought your letters to My presence and made mention of you. One day, the apple of Mine eye and soul, Husayn Effendi, attained the presence in place of the apple of Mine eye, that is, the son, and was adorned with acceptance. The items carried by Mulla Muhammad-’Ali (Dahaji), upon him be the Glory of God - including pen, paper and other things - arrived, but the desirable and acceptable paper, at the time of writing, each sheet in the language of its condition asketh mention of you, and assuredly the answer hath been and will be bestowed from the ocean of divine bestowal. It hath been proven by the Most Great Proof and the most perfect and complete evidence to those possessed of hearing and sight that verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer. The brethren and the honored ladies of that household, upon them be the Glory of God, are mentioned. I convey greetings to each one and beseech from God, exalted be His glory, that which shall not change nor fade. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Another glad-tiding is that in these days a special Tablet of Visitation for His Holiness Ismu’llah al-Asdaq, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory, hath been revealed from the heaven of knowledge of our Purpose and your Purpose. God willing, they shall attain unto it. If this evanescent servant hath delayed or should delay in responding to letters, he is surely excused, for that Beloved One knoweth that night and day he is occupied with writing and serving all the peoples of the world. Therefore they will surely forgive, and according to that Beloved One’s own statement that I have been allotted one letter a year - praise be to God - at this moment, which is the third night of the month of Sha’ban the Great, this letter is completed. Until next Sha’ban you have no fixed claim by your own admission. And on this blessed night, two hours and ten minutes having passed from Friday night, visitation was performed on your behalf and was graced with acceptance. Well is it with me and with you! I convey greetings to the gentlemen and friends of that land, and with the tongue of the inner heart I say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Unite the hearts of Thy loved ones and friends, then make their word as one. O Lord! Illumine them with the light of unity and ordain for them the station of concord. The servant beareth witness that Thou hast ordained the exaltation of Thy Word in the unity of Thy servants and their concord in Thy Cause. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Likewise the leaves and handmaidens of God in that land - I have mentioned and continue to mention each one. For some, blessed and holy Tablets have been revealed. God willing they shall arrive and they shall become illumined and shall attain unto the light of the utterance of the Purpose of all the worlds. This is a glad-tiding that no other glad-tiding can equal, to which beareth witness the Lord of all creation. Glory and praise and remembrance, then mercy and loving-kindness and exaltation be upon you and upon those with you and upon those whom the veils of names and nothing whatsoever have prevented from God, the King of this mighty Day.</p>
<p>Third night of the month of Sha’ban 1306</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station of grandeur and power!</p>
<p>O Javad! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Creation! Thou hast ever been and art still engaged in serving the Cause. All who have come, all who have sought, and all who have visited have made mention of thee. His honor Amin Abu’l-Hasan Ardikani, upon him be my Baha, hath made mention of thee both before and since. These matters are a truthful testimony and an eloquent witness to thy acceptance, thy devotion and thy steadfastness. We beseech God to aid thee in all conditions, and through the traces of the Supreme Pen to grant thee eternal life. That remembrance hath been and shall ever be of God, exalted be His glory. He is the true inheritor and the spiritual progeny. Every trace shall be erased and will vanish save the trace of the Supreme Pen, which shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure.</p>
<p>O Javad! By the life of God, this Wronged One hath known no rest or repose from the beginning of the Cause until now. Each day hath brought fresh harm and each moment a new affliction. The people of God bear witness that from the first day of the Revelation until now, We have stood before the faces of the world without veil or covering, and guided all to the supreme horizon. We have sent down the proof and made clear the way in such wise that none can deny it save he who is deprived of hearing, sight and understanding.</p>
<p>O Javad! The river of names hath deprived the servants of the ocean of inner meanings. Each of the world’s factions clingeth to some vain imagination, except for those souls who have truly arisen to serve the world and have purified their hearts from hatred and rancor. These are the hands of God’s Cause amongst His creation. The gulf of names is indeed a barrier; until the servants are freed from the pitch-dark night, they will not perceive the lights of the luminous morn. After all the waiting, the striving, the yearning, the seeking and the longing, when the dawn of hope appeared and the blessed Tree grew forth, all turned against it with swords of hatred and rancor, and wrought that which ye have heard and seen. Would that the human world had been cut off and these great wrongs and their like had never appeared!</p>
<p>O Javad! Upon thee and upon those with thee be My glory! We have appeared and made mention of the corruption and righteousness of the world, and We have spoken that for which ears were created to hear. Nevertheless, people are observed to be in great delusion and grave doubt. The Finger of Power hath rent asunder so many veils, yet now it is observed that the people of the Bayan have risen up with the same delusions as before, and veils and barriers thicker than the first have appeared and intervened. Even after We taught them their confused ways and made known to them My clear and straight path, they have not, until this moment, recognized the Day of God nor attained true unity. Some among the people are observed to be deprived of the warbling of the Dove of utterance which singeth upon the highest branch of the world, being occupied instead with the buzzing of flies. Each day they cling to a rope and grasp at a hem. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, not to deprive the eyes of hearts from the splendors of the light of the dawn of revelation, and to free all from the doubts and intimations of the world. Thou and the loved ones of God have ever been and shall ever be beneath His glance; ye have not been and shall not be forgotten. Praise be to God that thou hast been confirmed in serving the Cause. We beseech the Most High to assist thee with the means of exaltation.</p>
<p>The All-Glorious and Exalted Lord of earth and heaven is, verily, powerful over all things and worthy to answer prayer. I have been saddened by what hath befallen you in the Days of God, the Lord of all worlds. What hath come upon you hath come upon Us. O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of the servants of God and His handmaidens in such wise that their names and remembrances may endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Then render thanks unto thy Lord for having aided thee and caused thee to speak that there is none other God but Me, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Make thou mention, moreover, of My leaf who hath ascended unto the Most Exalted Summit and the Supreme Companion, and give her the glad-tidings of her Lord’s loving-kindness. He, verily, is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Say: May the light that shineth from the horizon of the heaven of utterance rest upon thee, O handmaiden of the All-Merciful and leaf of the Divine Lote-Tree who speaketh before all faces: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Sovereign Lord of all creation.” We bear witness that thou didst dwell in a house wherein God’s remembrance was exalted in days when all tribes were shaken save whom God, the Lord of Kings, did will. Thou art she who heard the Call and answered thy Lord, who turned unto a horizon wherefrom every heedless and veiled soul had turned away, who quaffed My choice-sealed wine, who inhaled the fragrance of My Name, the Self-Subsisting, who witnessed what God had witnessed and acknowledged what the Tongue of Grandeur had uttered from His inaccessible station. Rejoice thou in this Most Great Remembrance which all the treasures of the world cannot equal. To this all things bear witness, and I am the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O My handmaiden! Upon thee be My glory, My remembrance, and My praise. We beseech God, exalted be He, to send down upon thee at all times that which befitteth the heaven of His generosity and the ocean of His bounty. He, verily, is powerful to do what He willeth. There is none other God but He, the True One, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>O Javad! Upon thee be My glory. We console thee and those in thy household for what hath befallen you. We make mention of Ahmad and give him the glad-tidings of My acceptance of him from this praiseworthy station. O Ahmad! We make mention of thee and counsel thee to be patient and forbearing. Thy Lord, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>In the Persian tongue it is mentioned: The world hath never had, nor hath it now, any faithfulness, and this is a truth to which all created things have testified. Yet despite this, mankind remaineth occupied with it and heedless of the Truth. O Ahmad! Be thou in all conditions looking unto My horizon, speaking My praise, standing firm in service to My Cause, and holding fast unto My strong cord. Though by God’s infinite grace thou art blessed with that which most of mankind is deprived of, yet glory be to God! Until now the people of the Bayan and the divines of the earth remain unaware of the Day of God. Say: This is God’s Day, did ye but know it, and this is God’s Covenant, were ye but convinced of it. His verses pass you by, yet ye perceive them not. Say: Know ye the value of these days. Today the trees are speaking and the fruits are manifest. By the life of God! This is the day of attainment and turning unto Him, for the Embodiment of Grace is established upon the throne of justice and the banner “The Truth is come” hath been raised and planted amongst mankind. The people need to be reminded, for they have been nurtured for twelve hundred years in superstitions and idle fancies. It is most difficult to break the idols of vain imaginings save through God’s power and might. Blessed is the eye that seeth and the soul that pondereth upon what transpired among the previous communities. Should one become aware, he would find himself seated upon the cushions of steadfastness. Blessed are they that ponder. Blessed are the fair-minded.</p>
<p>O Ma??umih! God willing, mayest thou be favored by the grace of the True One, exalted be His glory. By My life! The names of devoted handmaidens are inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book. In the sight of God they take precedence over men. How many valiant heroes and knights of the field are deprived of the Truth and bereft of His knowledge, while ye are blessed and favored therewith. Praise be to God in all conditions. Thou hast ever been and art still remembered. And We make mention of the wife of Javad - upon both of them be My glory, mercy and loving-kindness - that she may render thanks unto her Lord by night and by day. O My handmaiden! The gaze of the True One hath been directed to that household. All abide beneath the shade of the divine Tree of Grace, in tranquility and at rest. This day is the Lord of all days and the Possessor of all ages and centuries. Blessed is the soul whom neither the doubts of the transgressors nor the hints of the deniers could deter or deprive, who, with complete steadfastness, held fast unto the cord of His grace and clung to the hem of His bounty. We send greetings to all the handmaidens in that land and counsel them all to that which God loveth.</p>
<p>O ?Azziyyih! Upon thee be My glory! With thy mention this Book is ended. Forget not the days of thy presence. Thou hast ever been and art still beneath the gaze of loving-kindness. Be thou for God in all conditions. Forget not that which We counseled thee during thy presence. Remember the Wronged One by night and by day, and what hath befallen Him at the hands of the aggressors and the idolaters. Be not sorrowful. Be thou mindful. We counsel thee to be patient and calm, and to manifest the joy that was created for the days of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O people of Qaf! The Pen of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, maketh mention of you at this moment, that the sweet savors of revelation may so attract you that neither the might of the world nor the power of the nations may hold you back. Verily, He is the Commander, the Dominant over what was and what shall be. Beware lest the doings of the idolaters sadden you, or the forces of those who have denied God’s proof and testimony and disbelieved in His signs and committed that which hath caused the denizens of the Kingdom to lament, cause you to fear. The glory which shineth resplendent from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you and upon those who have turned with their hearts to God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen.</p>
<p>O Javad! Convey My greetings to the people of the villages whom thou didst mention. Say: O party of God! Today steadfastness is beloved. They have taken the Cause of God as children’s play. Again green and white turbans have appeared, and like the former sect they are occupied in constructing houses of vain imaginings. The loved ones of God must remain steadfast in the Cause with perfect joy and radiance - a steadfastness that the world is powerless to prevent.</p>
<p>Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the sons of the late Mulla ?Abdu’r-Rahim - upon him be My glory and loving-kindness. They are remembered in the presence of this Countenance and will continue to be so. The letter of ?Abdu’r-Razzaq was received. The glance of favor hath been directed towards him. They have ever been and are favored by God’s grace. God’s counsel is that they should at all times engage in teaching the Cause of the Lord of all worlds with joy and radiance. Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those whose names have been set down by the Most Exalted Pen in this noble station and mighty prison.</p>
<p>The sister of him who beareth the name of Jud - upon him be My glory - together with his son, have been granted permission to proceed to the Most Holy Court. In all circumstances they must not neglect wisdom.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Mighty, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>O Mahdi! The world is in turmoil and none has recognized its cause. Tribulation and adversity have encompassed it. The earth shall not find rest save through the call “Be thou calm!”, yet in view of the foundation of divine policy and the principles of heavenly ordinances, there has been and continues to be restraint in the utterance of the Word. Aforetime this most exalted Word descended from the Supreme Pen: The tabernacle of world order is upheld by two pillars - reward and punishment. In view of the recompense for their deeds, mankind is seen to be in loss and affliction. In these days, this servant, present before the Wronged One, has, as bidden, written certain pages wherein exalted words attributed to the Crimson Scroll have been recorded as befitting the occasion, written in such wise that should anyone desire to see them, there would be no harm in this, for therein are not mentioned those things that would cause clamor and excitement among men. Brief mention has been made of various utterances from the All-Merciful. Send a copy thereof to Afnan A. and H., upon him be Baha. It would be well-pleasing if, at each occasion, a Tablet or utterance from the Mother Book could be sent, for the divine Word increases the spirit and guides the heart to the ocean of joy and freedom.</p>
<p>O My Name Mahdi! Reflect upon the world’s upheavals. By My life! They shall not cease but shall increase with each passing day. Thus doth the All-Informed apprise thee. The people have been and continue to be deprived of the call of Truth and its sweetness. Strange it is that they are even deprived of the call of the world itself, for the world, by the command of the Ancient Lord, continually raises its voice to the highest pitch. One such call was the Chief of Iran who moved about like lightning, at times in the West, at times in the East, South and North, striving day and night to order the realm and increase its wealth, yet in the end returned empty-handed. By the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing! Had he possessed but one word from God it would have been better than all he saw and heard and spent his life pursuing. However, in his final years he committed no act causing grief, therefore naught but good should be spoken of him. And as he was related to one of God’s loved ones, perchance the word of forgiveness may descend for him from the kingdom of the All-Merciful’s favors, [and] in certain instances good words did proceed from his tongue. There is no God but He, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Raise thy hands in supplication. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Perchance the people of the world may be aided to achieve that which He loves and is pleased with, and become detached and independent from vain and unprofitable pursuits. The servant present here laid before Him the letter from Afnan, upon him be Baha, and likewise your honor submitted some matters again. That he has acknowledged his shortcomings and sought forgiveness - blessed is he, and exalted is he who has been made to know humility and supplication in the days of his Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. The hardships they have endured in God’s path and the services they have rendered are all remembered before God and recorded in the Book. The divine days which all sought to comprehend were found, after their dawning and shining forth, to find all asleep and heedless, save whom God willed.</p>
<p>That which has been written concerning Mirza Badi’, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory - may they ever be confirmed in that which brings down divine mercy. From this station We send Our greetings to him who is named ’Abdu’l-’Ali and give him glad tidings of God’s favor, the Lord of all worlds. He has attained to that which God desired. Today, whosoever shows love to the relatives of the exalted martyr, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory and mercy and favor, and attends to their affairs, is beloved and accepted before the Wronged One.</p>
<p>As for the matter of the horse trader, it would be better and more fitting. However, that which has been or will be sent as a gift cannot be sold, while that which is in the name of Huquq may be sold without objection. This is what the Pen has spoken from the presence of the Ancient Lord in His noble station.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about the Blessed Place, this matter rests with the Afnan themselves, upon them be My glory. Let them proceed as they deem best. God willing, they have been and will continue to be successful in their charitable works. By My life, all that the people possess shall perish, while that which has been ordained by the Mighty, the Powerful shall endure.</p>
<p>Shaykh Muhammad-’Ali must also attend to this matter. Instructions were given to him who bears the Name of Generosity to write and summon him. The right of the sister of the King of Martyrs, upon them both be My most glorious splendor, must be discharged, and this matter is essential. The law of Huquq is most great in God’s sight. Blessed are they whom the perishable ornaments of the world have not deprived of trustworthiness. Blessed is he whose head is adorned with the crown of trustworthiness. What his honor “S”, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, has written concerning the taking of the ledgers - excellent is the news and excellent the deed. God willing, may they be aided to achieve that which leads to exaltation, glory and prosperity. As for people’s property that the government has seized, its payment is not incumbent upon the heirs - that is, the martyr, upon him be My glory, is not indebted.</p>
<p>Regarding the land, it is a praiseworthy deed. We have made it a piece of Paradise and named it the Verdant Spot, as a favor from Us. The choice rests with its owner. The burial of others without permission is not allowed, unless it would cause corruption. In such case, one must act according to the requirements of wisdom.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Mulla Husayn in the Afnan’s letter, therefore he has attained to the Wronged One’s remembrance. God willing, may they know the worth of God’s Word and its station, and drink from the cups of the words of the Kawthar of steadfastness, that they may not be deprived of the outpourings of the All-Bountiful. From this station We send Our greetings to him and to those who have believed in God in that place, and We give them glad tidings of what God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, has ordained for them.</p>
<p>O My Afnan! The most important of all matters today is the teaching of the Cause - with spirit and fragrance, wisdom and utterance. Convey greetings to each of the friends in that land as wisdom permits, and remind them of what has flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, that perchance the clamor and might of the people may not prevent them from the Truth. Great is this Day. Blessed is the soul that has fulfilled its covenant and has arisen to serve its Lord in such wise that the affairs of the world have not kept it back from God, the Lord of the Promised Day. Glory be upon you and upon My Afnan and upon those who have acknowledged that which has been sent down from the presence of the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! The Pen of the All-Merciful in this first dawn of the blessed month of Ramadan turneth toward the Tablet and saith: The leaf which the honored Afnan A. and H., upon them be the Glory of God, sent in thy name was presented in its entirety before His countenance. May they, God willing, be ever assisted in serving the Cause. Verily this shall profit them in the hereafter and in this life, and in the worlds of their Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Concerning what they wrote about Mirza Badi’u’llah, his coming to this land is not permitted. The Most Exalted Pen hath previously warned that the Prison Land is in turmoil beneath its surface, though outwardly it appeareth calm. Know ye the melody of God and ponder upon it, O people. Verily He speaketh the truth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Moreover, there is no space available, and most are in great hardship and difficulty due to the cramped conditions. Their affairs have been and continue to be looked after by the Afnan. It behooveth everyone to care for them according to their means. Thus hath the All-Merciful commanded, both before and at this time.</p>
<p>They mentioned A. and S. Were he to hear what We have commanded him, he would see what he seeth not today, from One Who is All-Informed, All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Likewise was mention made of the son of the Lesser Martyr. May he, God willing, attain the grace of the True One. The fragrances of love are wafted from him. It behooveth him to beseech God to protect him and make him steadfast in this Great Cause and upon this Straight Path.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about Mosul, Abu’l-Hasan from the land of T., and Samandar from the land of Q., as well as others from other lands, have submitted this matter. We have commanded the servant present to send to the Afnan a copy of what was revealed from the heaven of God’s Will in reply to Abu’l-Hasan, that they may consider it. What the Afnan, upon them be the Glory of God, have done in this regard is acceptable in the presence of God, for they acted for God and in His path. The deeds of each are witnessed and recorded in the Book. Let them give thanks to God for this great bounty. O Mahdi! Praise be to God, through divine grace their mention hath been and continues to be made in the Most Holy Court, and time and again they have been adorned with and have attained the ornament of His favor. The Glory be upon them.</p>
<p>This is a copy of what was revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance in reply to him who is named Abu’l-Hasan: Concerning what you wrote about Mosul, they said it would have been better had they heeded the glad tidings and “give thou good news to the patient ones” after the blessed words “We shall surely test you.” Although drought hath overtaken most lands this year, yet the spreading of such matters by the friends might cause certain incidents. The mention and spreading of such matters should always occur with permission. Verily He knoweth His servants better than they know themselves. He is indeed the Single One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And whosoever desireth with utmost willingness and yearning to pay the Huququ’llah should give it to such as your honor and the trustees, and obtain a receipt, so that whatever transpireth may occur with God’s leave and permission. Verily He is the Teacher, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>=== END BH00542 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00543 ===</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who is glorified with such majesty that before it hath bowed the majesty of the mighty ones, the dominion of the great ones, the power of the strong ones, the authority of princes, the necks of pharaohs among men of creation, and the rulers who show pride before God, Creator of heaven! And praise be to God Who is unified with such oneness that before its dawning the highest unity of beings and the most glorious singularity of all possible things vanish into nothingness. The truly unified one is he who acknowledgeth his nothingness and the nothingness of his unification at the dawning of the Sun of Unity from the Most Exalted Horizon. The true mystic is he who confesseth his powerlessness and the powerlessness of his mystical knowledge to attain unto the station whence appeared the light of mystical knowledge from God, the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below. Verily, he who hath not attained unto this confession is among the most ignorant of the ignorant, even though he be learned in all the sciences of the world. Blessed is he who today, at the appearance of the Most Great Name, the Most Glorious, hath attained unto the greatest steadfastness and held fast unto the Sure Handle which hath appeared and shone forth among the servants by the command of God, Creator of all things. I magnify and give peace unto those whose feet have not slipped because of the intimations of the learned, whose hearts have not been troubled by the veils of the mystics, whose eyes have not been prevented from beholding the Most Glorious Horizon, and whose ears have not been kept from hearkening unto the Call of God which hath been raised betwixt earth and heaven. I testify that these are the true believers, these are the sincere ones, these are the near ones, these are the successful ones, these are the mindful ones, and these are they who have held fast unto the Crimson Ark. Upon them be the glory of God in the hereafter and in the former life.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant hath been honored to receive thy noble letters time and again, and from them I learned of thy mention of the Lord of all beings and thy rising to serve God, the Lord of the visible and invisible. When I became acquainted with them and their contents, I turned and drew nigh until I entered the Most Exalted Paradise, the seat of the throne of our Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious, and I presented all that thou hadst mentioned and related from beginning to end. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which I am unable to mention, nay rather, all the pens of the world and tongues of the nations are powerless to describe it. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Your noble missives from past and present have arrived. Were I to say they brought fresh joy and boundless delight, I would be stating the obvious, and find myself abashed. As for this servant’s condition, he is occupied with writing day and night, and finds not even enough opportunity to gladden or sadden the true friends and those who drink of the spiritual wine with any mention. Therefore, at all times I cling to the cord of grace and universal forgiveness, so that if I do not trouble some with mention of myself, they may not interpret it as lack of love, but rather adorn my negligence and shortcoming with the ornament of forgiveness. In truth, in these days the pen is ashamed and the paper is mortified by what it must record, for it is observed that souls who for years claimed the highest stations of mystical knowledge and certitude were barred by a mere croak from the melodies of the Dove of the Cause, and by a single bray were deprived of the warbling of the Doves of the Bayan. In such case, what can the pen write, what can the tongue utter, and what can the tablet bear? In most of the divine Tablets, from the Pen of the Lord’s Will, the stations of steadfastness and the loftiness of its rank were revealed. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of inner meanings that this evanescent servant had imagined that after the divine loved ones heard and hearkened to the verses that flowed from the Supreme Pen concerning steadfastness and its stations, none would slip, and neither the knowledge of the learned, nor the mysticism of the mystics, nor the eloquence of men of letters, nor ancient tales and latter-day stories would deprive them from the straight path which today is manifest and evident through the Most Great Name. Nevertheless, it is observed that some friends, through satanic whisperings, remained far from the ultimate goal and the furthermost Lote-Tree. In such case, there is no inclination for this servant to occupy himself with mention that might serve to remind the servants. By God’s life! The dried grass of the earth is observed to be more steadfast than such beings. A person whose numerous petitions reached the Most Holy Court, and in all those petitions expressed servitude, evanescence and nothingness, and likewise to this servant who is utter nothingness - nevertheless, after your honor’s arrival in the land of Kirman, he observed that his verbal ornamentations had no luster and no station was forthcoming for him, therefore after believing he turned away and clung to Satan, that perchance he might obtain some leadership from that quarter. Say: By the very breath of the All-Merciful, he neither fattens nor enriches you, O heedless, remote and rejected one! And according to what was mentioned, he deceived Siyyid Abdul-Baqi of Kashan. Wonder of all wonders! Yet the wonder lies not in the calf and its lowing, but rather in those who follow it with evident delusion. At the time of the dawning of the Sun of the horizons from Iraq and the establishment of the Throne in the Land of Mystery and arrival in the Most Great Prison, the Supreme Pen continually informed the people about the croaking of the croakers, the claims of the claimants, the whisperings of satans, and the deceptions of the doubtful ones. Nevertheless, at the caw of the crow of the fig tree they passed beyond the Perspicuous Book and slipped from the straight path. One day, when the horizons of Zawra were illumined by the Most Great Light in the dawn of divine days, He said to this servant: When the Son of Imran returned from Sinai […]</p>
<p>And when he saw the people worshipping the calf, he said: “O my people! I dwelt among you for years, and every day I appeared with compelling divine commands and with manifest signs and clear evidences. Nevertheless, I observed you lingering in the valleys of doubt and uncertainty. How is it that after me you have passed by the Most Exalted Horizon at the lowing of a calf - that is, at the voice of a mere calf - and have clung to it?” Such is the condition of these people. In any case, should you meet the aforementioned Mir, remind him, that perchance he may drink from the cup of steadfastness and regard all save the Friend as non-existent and null. This too was due to his previous love. Verily, He is the Manifestation of Proof and the Guide to the Way.</p>
<p>It behooveth your honor to engage with the utmost diligence and effort in reminding souls, that perchance they may remain protected from the tempestuous winds of the selfish desires of the idolatrous souls. Most astonishing of all is the discord that hath arisen in that land. Your honor is well aware that harm from discord between the loved ones of God reverteth to the root of the Blessed Tree itself. It is more harmful than any harm and more grievous than any grievousness. At all times they must strive with the utmost endeavor to unite and harmonize souls. This discord hath caused some of God’s loved ones to become objects of people’s ridicule, and the harm of this matter hath been and is beyond measure. Where are the detached ones? Where are the fair-minded? Where are those who behold the glory of God, detached from their own glory, who move by God’s will, detached from their own wills? And where are those who speak for God’s sake, who walk in His path, and who act in ways that exalt His Cause, pure in motive? These are indeed among the triumphant, the strivers, the steadfast, the unified, and the sincere ones.</p>
<p>God willing, we hope that henceforth they will be seen as an unbroken circle, regarding the good of all as the good of each and the good of each as the good of all. This servant knoweth not what to say. Where are the souls that bow down before the face of God? Where are the hearts that are humble before God’s command? Whoso truly attaineth unto the fragrance of these days, naught but humility and submissiveness will be manifest from him, for exaltation of station and loftiness of rank have been and shall be manifested through humility before God. From the first mention until this moment, observe how every exaltation hath appeared through humility and every loftiness through submissiveness. Say: Recognize this, O people of vision! Say: Recognize this, O people of understanding!</p>
<p>The loved ones must observe one another with the eye of affection and deal with each other according to the conditions of love. In all circumstances they must be mindful of divine ordinances, for that which is good for all hath been sent down from the heaven of God’s Will. We beseech God to assist all to do that which He loveth and approveth. His honor Aqa Jamal, upon him be 96 [Baha], arose for a mighty cause, supposing it to be in support of the truth. There is no doubt that from this matter no harm will come to the root of the Tree; rather, it will cause the elevation of God’s Cause amongst the people. Nevertheless, since it was contrary to the wisdom revealed in the Tablets, the Most Exalted Pen hesitated to accept it, for all are commanded today to observe wisdom, and no blame attacheth to those souls who did not follow in this matter […]</p>
<p>However, they must not utter unseemly words about such a soul. In these matters they must be silent and patient, for the Cause is in God’s hands - He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth. From time immemorial until eternity, the greatest bounty and salvation of peoples hath been in following the divine commands. To this testifieth every atom and, beyond them, every seeing tongue. But harm afflicteth the very root of the Tree. Say: O loved ones of God and His chosen ones, avoid it! Say: O friends of God and His cherished ones, avoid it! Hold fast unto unity - this is better for you, did ye but know it. In all conditions they must be vigilant over the Cause of God. And convey to all who drink from the cup of steadfastness, on behalf of this evanescent servant, the Most Glorious and Most Exalted Greeting. And whenever those who are united and in harmony gather together and the cups of the wine of the knowledge of the All-Merciful are passed round, let them pour a drop upon the earth in remembrance of this unknown one. Glory be upon you and upon them throughout the everlasting dominion of God, the Lord of all the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Most Wondrous, the Most Glorious, the All-Highest!</p>
<p>O Letter of the Living! Hearken unto the beating of the wings of this Bird that soareth in these heights with wings of ruby, with holy splendors, with feathers of grace, with pinions of authority, and with shoulders of radiant holiness, that thou mayest become aware of the conditions of this singing Leaf that moveth and ascendeth upon this Tree which hath been raised up in truth and under whose shade all worlds have sought shelter, save those whom thou findest in the abode of hypocrisy. Thus doth the Luminary of the horizons impart knowledge unto thee that thou mayest be among those who know.</p>
<p>We had previously sent thee a letter, and before that a letter, and before that yet another letter. And We had previously shown thee from Our Temple a Beauty, and before that a Beauty, and before that yet another Beauty, that thou mightest be among those who are certain. We had manifested unto thee the Beauty of the Primal One in the garment of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, and We revealed it unto thee and unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. And once We revealed Ourself unto thee through one of Our names when We were in Iraq, and none among all creation perceived it. Then We revealed Ourself unto thee through this Beauty by a light from whose lights have shone forth the suns of grandeur, then the suns of bounty, then the suns of infallibility, then the suns of might and power, then the suns of loftiness and strength, that thou mightest recognize thy Lord and be among those who stand firm in His Cause - a Cause wherein none can stand save he who detacheth himself from all things, from his own self and desires.</p>
<p>Thus do We recount unto thee from the true stories that thou mayest follow the command of thy Lord and be among those who attain unto the Beauty which none hath attained save him whose eye God hath opened, whom He hath caused to know His Self, and whom He hath made to be among those who know. Say: Those who are veiled by allusions from Him Who is the Source of all allusions, and who are held back by evidences from Him Who is the Source of all evidences - these cannot move in this atmosphere which God hath made to encompass the East and the West of the earth, and those who are in the heavens and the earth, and those who were behind holy veils in vast and glorious cities.</p>
<p>Beware, beware lest anything hold thee back, even if it be weightier than the creation of the heavens and earth. For verily, if thou dost not cast it from thy back, thou wilt not be able to move in this atmosphere which hath been spread in this court that hath appeared in this Glory, the Radiant, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Cast from thy back every weight and from thy heart all that thou hast laden upon it, then purify thyself from all that thou hast seen, that thou mayest be illumined by this Fire which hath been kindled in the wilderness of knowledge beyond the Mount of grandeur and utterance, and that thou mayest be among the steadfast.</p>
<p>When this Tablet reacheth thee, if thou art seated, arise; if thou art sleeping, awaken; if thou art walking, hasten. Then open thy tongue with power by Our leave and with Our will, and fear no one but place thy trust in My Beauty, the Mighty, the Radiant. Then take this Tablet to those who have hesitated regarding this Cause - a Cause concerning which none hesitate save every deceiver who is peerless in his deceit. Say: Whosoever denieth this hath denied all the Messengers of the past, as evidenced by all that hath been sent down in the Bayan, if ye be of those who perceive.</p>
<p>And if thou seest one with the name of Ha, remind him of what We have sent down unto thee of verses of transcendent glory, then deliver unto him the command of thy Lord and fear him not. If he heareth thy words, the glad-tidings from the presence of the Mighty, the Beauteous, will seize him. And if he denieth thee, he hath indeed denied God, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Say: O servant, fear God Who created thee and fashioned thee, and be not of the ignorant ones. Take hold of the Book of God with the power bestowed by Us. Verily, a single letter thereof is more precious in the sight of God than the creation of the heavens and earth and of all the first ones and the last ones. Days have passed while thou wert lying upon the couch of heedlessness. Therefore, banish Satan from thy soul, then seek refuge in thy Lord, the Bestower, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Glorious. Say: O my Lord! Let me hear Thy melodies wherewith Thou didst sing in the paradise of Thy words, and deny me not that which is therein, and deprive me not of the sanctuary of Thy holy precincts. O my Lord! I am he who secluded himself without leave from Thy presence, and my self and my desires occupied me from recognizing Thy Beauty, the Exalted, the Transcendent, the Holy, the Mighty. O my Lord! Deprive me not of that which is with Thee, then honor me with Thy presence, then enable me to acknowledge Thee and Thy verses, for verily, O my God, I believed not in Thy former Manifestation in the beauty of our Lord, the Most High, except through what was revealed from His presence of Thy mighty and wondrous verses. And as I witness that they descend from the clouds of Thy mercy in inexhaustible measure, thus have We recorded the matter in the tablets of Thy luminous glory. O my Lord! I now testify that were I to deny these verses from Thee, I would have denied all that Thou hast revealed before time immemorial and wilt reveal until the end which none among the last ones can reckon. Therefore, O my God, leave me not to my self, for it indeed commandeth unto evil. I fear lest it cause me to turn away from Thy Beauty after my certitude that were I to deny this grace, I could never claim faith within myself, for in such case everything would deny me, and though my tongue might not confess it, my heart and my innermost being and my spirit would testify to it before all the worlds. For Thou, O my Beloved, hast made no proof among Thy servants save the wonders of Thy verses, and no manifestation among all created things save the manifestations of the lights of Thy Beauty. And now Thou hast revealed them through Thy sovereignty, and none can object to Thee except he who denieth Thy verses and disputeth Thy manifestations and contendeth with Thy Self and warreth against Thy exalted Being at the dawning of the gleaming lights of Thy luminous Beauty. Therefore enable me, O my God, to know Thy Self in these days which none have known save the sincere ones among Thy creatures and the chosen ones among Thy servants. Then I beseech Thee, O my God, not to send me back to my self athirst after Thou hast caused to flow from the clouds of Thy mercy the waters of holy radiance. Then give me to drink, O my God, through Thy grace and Thy mercy, that I may be replenished from this Kawthar which floweth from the right hand of the mighty throne. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Glorious Beauty in the most holy and exalted horizon, that Thou cut me off from all that Thy good-pleasure loveth not. Verily Thou art supreme over that, and Thou art the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Sublime. Thus have We inspired thee and taught thee that thou mayest follow the command of thy Lord and be of those who know.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most High, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Verily He is at this moment living in this luminous and glorious horizon. He witnesseth and seeth and addresseth the Concourse of the near ones: “Blessed are ye, inasmuch as ye have attained unto the presence of God and recognized Him, and have shattered the idols of vain imaginings and desire, and have won the lights of His countenance in these mighty and impregnable days.” Say: Whosoever hath known God hath attained unto His presence and entered the paradise wherein one of its palaces is equivalent to the heavens and earths. Blessed are they who have established themselves upon the Ark of Glory and have detached themselves from those who disbelieved in God, the Most High, the Most Great. Say: Whoso turneth unto Him hath turned unto God and His Messengers, and whoso turneth away from Him hath turned away from His Creator and then from His Messengers. Say: O people, fear God and follow not those who have broken God’s Covenant and turned back upon their heels in rejection. By God, they have bowed their heads in these days in the presence of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Thus was the matter ordained, but the people are in a great veil. He is the One Who hath spoken in all things saying “I am God, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Bountiful,” and Who speaketh now in all things declaring “I am the Beloved of the mystics, the Goal of all worlds, and the Glory of all who are in the heavens and the earth.”</p>
<p>Say: Every word that proceedeth from His mouth verily quickeneth all bodies, would that ye be of them that know. All that ye witness on earth hath appeared by His exalted, transcendent, and wondrous command. When the sun of His name, the Creator, dawneth from the horizon of His mouth, through it are made manifest the arts throughout all ages - this is an indubitable truth. This name riseth upon all things that exist, and through it are revealed the arts through the agencies of the kingdom, were ye of them that are assured. All the wondrous and novel manifestations of craftsmanship that ye behold have appeared from this Name, and there shall appear hereafter that which ye have never heard before. Thus hath it been ordained in the Tablets, and none comprehendeth this save those possessed of penetrating vision. Likewise, when the sun of My name, the All-Knowing, dawneth from the horizon of utterance, every thing receiveth from this Name the wondrous knowledge according to its capacity and measure, and there appeareth therefrom in these days by the command of the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Similarly, observe all the names and be thou assured with certainty. Say: Every letter that proceedeth from the mouth of God is verily the mother of letters, and likewise every word that appeareth from the Source of the Command is verily the mother of words, and His Tablet is the Mother of Tablets. Blessed are they that understand. This is what hath been sent down in the outward sense of the Command, but whoso gazeth upon the inner meaning is assured that in every letter revealed from the heaven of the utterance of your Lord, the All-Merciful, there lieth treasured the spirit of all former and latter generations, and nothing that hath been created between the heavens and earth can equal it.</p>
<p>Thus have We sent down unto thee the verses in truth, for unto thee hath been ordained a station among stations, that thou mayest stand firm in the Cause of this imprisoned Stranger Who hath been confined in this land, and against Whom His weak servants who had believed in Him in His previous Manifestation have risen up. When He appeared in another garment they denied Him - nay, the curse of God be upon the liars! They were wont to conceal their faces in fear of their own selves, but when We made manifest the Cause with evident sovereignty, they emerged from behind their veils and concealment and warred against God, their Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Thus doth God reveal what is hidden in the breasts of those who are in grave doubt and mighty hypocrisy. Be thou a shepherd of God’s flock, then guard them from the wolves of the earth and be not of the heedless, for the wolf howleth behind them and waiteth to find an opportunity. Thus have We made clear the matter unto thee that thou mayest be of the knowing ones. Gather together the servants of God, then protect them from the darts of satans, for soon will their traces and their forms appear in every land. Then shun them and put thy trust in God, the Mighty, the Invincible. Thus did We inform Our servants aforetime, and now inform thee as a grace from Our presence upon thee and upon Our assured servants.</p>
<p>Say: O people! This is ’Ali in truth Who hath come to you with His verses, then with His clear proofs, then with His Most Great and Mighty Proof. He speaketh even as He spoke before, as every fair-minded and perceiving one doth testify. Fear ye God and commit not that which ye have been forbidden in all the Tablets, and dispute not with Him by Whose will ye and the denizens of the highest Paradise, then the dwellers of the pavilions of grandeur and immortality, then the inhabitants of the heavens and earth were created. He hath dawned from the Most Glorious Horizon - glorified be His most exalted Self! From His right hand flow rivers of mighty glory - whoso drinketh but a drop thereof shall never die. This is what hath been inscribed by the Pen of Power on a preserved and mighty tablet.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Deprive not yourselves of that which hath been ordained for you, and be not of the heedless. Say: The Youth desireth naught from you, as every fair-minded and knowing one doth testify. He hath sacrificed His spirit out of love for those who are in the heavens and on earth, that He might purify them from whatsoever preventeth them from ascending unto the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. There hath befallen Him at every moment that which hath not befallen any of God’s Messengers before, as ye would acknowledge were ye to be fair-minded. Say: O people of the Bayan! Sufficient unto Me are the past peoples who opposed Me and visited upon Me at every moment that which caused the eyes of those near unto God to weep. Have mercy, then, upon My soul and upon your own selves. Fear ye God and be not of the wrongdoers.</p>
<p>Arise to promote the Cause through My power and sovereignty, and fear no one even should all created things rise up against thee. Dost thou love thyself more than God? By God! This beseemeth thee not, for thou art of those whose names have been inscribed on the Tablets of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Verily the world shall pass away - it behooveth not My loved ones to turn unto it. Purify thyself from it and be wholly detached. Soar at all times unto My heaven that thou mayest hear My melodies and drink from the fountain of My life-giving waters, and journey through the realms of My companionship and the spheres of My holiness, and become acquainted with the mysteries of My Cause. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen command thee that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and be steadfast in wondrous constancy. Convey My greetings from God unto thy mother and sister, then give them the glad-tidings of the Spirit that they may be among those who receive glad-tidings in a mighty and glorious tablet.</p>
<p>Then commemorate on Our part Our servant al-Ba, and glorify him from thy Lord God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: O servant! Dost thou dwell in thy house while the Beloved is in grievous affliction? Dost thou take thy rest while the Spirit lies beneath the claws of the polytheists? Beware lest thou forget the remembrance of thy Lord, for by His remembrance are kindled the hearts of the sincere ones who have arisen for the love of God and His Cause. By God! They are servants upon whom the denizens of the Paradise of the All-Highest and the angels of the near ones shower their glorification. Say: His victory lies in teaching His Cause. Beware lest ye transgress therein, O people of unity! Those who shed blood are in grievous heedlessness. Say: O people! If ye desire to struggle against God’s enemies, then struggle against your own selves. This is nearer to righteousness, were ye of those who know. If ye are able within yourselves, then quicken Our servants who are dead, that they may arise through the spirit of faith to serve the Cause of God, their Lord and the Lord of their forefathers. Say: O people! Shed not blood, for it hath been forbidden unto you in the Book from the presence of the Mighty, the Wise. Say: God hath sent Me for harmony and unity. Fear God, O people of the earth, and be not of the wrongdoers. Whoso commits evil, the polytheists attribute it to My oppressed and lonely Self. Fear God and commit not that which would bring harm to the Tree of God, the Inaccessible, the Mighty, the Sublime. Be thou at peace through God’s grace and mercy, for His mercy hath preceded all worlds. Whoso remains steadfast in this Cause is among the most exalted of creation in God’s sight, and around him circle the denizens of the highest Paradise. And the glorification of God be upon thy wife that she may praise God her Lord and be of the thankful ones, in a preserved holy tablet.</p>
<p>Then commemorate on Our part Our servant 1454 [104540 Mahdi] that he may rejoice in God’s remembrance and be of those firm in this Cause, whereby all in the heavens and earth were thunderstruck save whom God preserved through His grace, and He hath power over all things. O servant! Arise to serve God’s Cause, for thy arising in His Cause is better for thee than all that hath been created between the heavens and earths. Deprive not thyself of this Kawthar which hath flowed in truth from the finger of thy Lord, the Just, the Ancient. Then drink thereof in Our Most Glorious Name and fear not the polytheists who, when they behold the water of life, drink not thereof, but when they find putrid water they become among those who drink. Purify thyself from what thy Lord God abhorreth, then shun His enemies and hold fast to this firm handle. Make thy purpose what God hath purposed, then be content with what He hath ordained for thee, for He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. Then commemorate on Our part thy wife that she may rejoice within herself in the remembrance of God, the Exalted, the Great. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon her and upon thy son and daughter from the presence of the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Convey the messages of thy Lord in truth and justice, then remind the people of this Most Great and Mighty Announcement, that all may arise to praise their Creator amidst all created things. Thus warbleth the Dove upon the boughs of the Tree of Eternity, that Her melodies may draw you nigh and bring you closer to God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds, and may detach you from all else save God, and enable you to attain unto that station wherein the countenance of the All-Merciful hath shone forth from the horizon of His exalted and mighty Self. Blessed is he who hath attained unto this station and hath heard the verses of his Lord and hath drunk from this Kawthar which floweth from the right hand of the Throne, and from which the detached servants of God shall drink. And the spirit, and glory, and splendor be upon thee and upon those who have detached themselves from all things and soared in the atmosphere of the love of thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p>Praise is befitting and worthy of my Beloved Who hath unlocked the gate of union and meeting through the key of His Most Great Name, and with the most exalted call hath given glad-tidings unto all of the advent of the Most Great Distinction. All good belongeth unto the soul that hath hearkened unto His call and hath arisen to serve Him. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid whosoever hath turned towards Him and placed his trust in Him, and to ordain for him that which the world and all that is therein cannot equal. Verily, He is the Omnipotent, the Almighty.</p>
<p>This evanescent one maketh mention that after completing the response to your earlier letters, another letter dated the fourteenth of Rabi’u’l-Avval was received which brought to mind the days of attainment to His presence. After its perusal and review, it was presented in the Most Holy Court before His countenance. He said: “Praise be to God, again and again they have attained their goal. God willing, may they ever be adorned with the ornament of love for the Beloved of the worlds, be vocal in His praise, soar in His atmosphere, and arise to serve Him. The tongue of My favor calleth him, the glance of My loving-kindness beholdeth him, and My white hand hath written for him that which no earthly things can equal. He must rejoice in My bounty and make mention of Me by night and by day. The glory that hath shone forth from the kingdom of My mercy be upon him and upon his sons and upon My loved ones who have inhaled the fragrance of My luminous garment.”</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about meeting with the friends one day of the week to recite the divine verses, God willing, may you ever be confirmed and assisted. However, by His command, in no matter should you depart from wisdom. In all conditions you must hold fast unto wisdom, for the manifestations of tyranny have ever been, and continue to be, in search of a pretext, whether out of sheer wickedness or specifically to gain advantage. By manifestations of tyranny is meant, in the first instance, those divines who are honored in the name of truth yet have turned away from it. The cawing of heedless divines hath been the cause of opposition against the people of truth in all ages and centuries. Thus hath it ever been[…]</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Sheikh Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God, and his journey to Kermanshah - this was presented before His Presence. He said: Teaching the Cause is and has ever been beloved before God. God willing, may the entire world attain the bounties of the All-Bountiful Lord and drink from the ocean of His knowledge. The presence of teachers is necessary in that land and its surroundings, but the teachers must conduct themselves with perfect wisdom, lest the fire of corruption be ignited and cause the extinguishing of the warmth in weak souls.</p>
<p>This evanescent one begs God, exalted be His glory, to raise up servants specifically for this service and adorn them with wisdom and utterance, that they may guide the diverse peoples of the world to the single point and give them to drink of the water of life. The command is in His hands, and He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant conveys greetings to Sheikh [Muhammad], upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], and gives him the glad tidings of God’s grace and bounty. At this moment, while engaged in writing this letter, being blessed with His presence, the tongue of grace spoke these blessed and decisive words - exalted be His glory: “We, from this station, send greetings to him who is named Muhammad, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. We have mentioned him before and after, and We counsel him to wisdom in the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. He is among those who have attained the presence of the Wronged One and heard what the Tongue of Utterance spoke in His mighty prison. The Glory be upon him and upon God’s sincere servants.”</p>
<p>God willing, may the earth be sanctified and purified through the endeavors of God’s friends from the conditions of self and passion, from conflict and contention, from corruption and the doubts of the divines. And since Sheikh Muhammad has spent his days teaching God’s Cause, we beseech God that he may be assisted in that which befits this divine Day. Today, the purification of souls through the water of wisdom and utterance is beloved, that all on earth may be cleansed by this holy water from unworthy deeds and displeasing character. Blessed are those souls who have recognized this water and been enabled to achieve the purification that comes from God. This is that water with which the son of Zacharias baptized, and which the Son commanded. This is that water which has ever been and shall ever be mentioned with God, and which has been recorded by the Supreme Pen in books, psalms, scrolls and tablets.</p>
<p>Whoever is enabled to teach today must be adorned with wisdom and blessed with patience, tranquility, submission and contentment, so that gradually the fragrance of recognition and acceptance may be diffused among the people.</p>
<p>Know that concerning the children of Khalil and the heirs of Kalim, upon whom be the glory of God, and their enkindlement in divine love and their steadfastness in the Cause, what you wrote was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, and the Sun of favor shone upon all. They stated: “This is the Day of which David gave tidings and Isaiah bore witness. All that hath been manifested concerning the prison, the seat of authority, the lands and dwellings of previous Prophets–of these they gave news and glad-tidings. Blessed is he who hath seen and recognized, who seeth and knoweth.” The Supreme Pen conveyeth greetings and counseleth that which today is the cause of the exaltation of God’s Cause. Know, O loved ones of God, then hearken unto what the Speaker of Sinai uttereth: Know ye, then be assured that weakness appeareth from discord and strength emergeth from unity. There is no human excellence save through fairness, and no power except through unity. God willing, be ye as lamps lit from a single flame–though the forms and vessels may differ, they are united in the diffusion of light. The Cause is in the grasp of God, the Single, the One. God willing, they must be united in word and find rest and repose beneath the Lote-Tree. From this station We send Our greetings to their faces and counsel them to unity and harmony and to that whereby God’s Cause is exalted amongst His servants.</p>
<p>The favor of God, exalted be His glory, hath encompassed them. God willing, may they be aided to attain recognition and to that which hath streamed forth and been revealed from the Supreme Pen. This lowly one conveyeth greetings to them.</p>
<p>As to your mention of the friends in that land, their degrees of devotion, humility, submissiveness, unity and concord, and likewise your request for favor on their behalf–these matters attained the honor of being heard by the Lord of Names. This is what the Tongue of the Intended One uttered, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>He is the Rememberer and the Remembered</p>
<p>O My loved ones in that place! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison. Verily We have remembered you once in My Kingdom, and again in My Dominion, and at another time in this exalted Station, and yet again in a station sanctified above names and remembrances. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed Rememberer. Rejoice in that We have caused you to hear, at one time the rustling of the Lote-Tree of My utterance, and at another the cooing of the Dove of My remembrance, and I am the Compassionate, the Generous. We have sent down to you from the heaven of Our Will that which the tongues of My servants are powerless to mention. Be thankful for this manifest grace. We counsel you to preserve your stations and that whereon ye stand in the love of God, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old. Thus crowed the Cock, and cooed the Dove of the Cause, and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, as a favor from Him, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. Glory be upon you and upon those who have quaffed the choice wine from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the Generous, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>This servant conveyeth greetings to all the friends. God is witness and testifier that he always presents mention of them at the Holy Court and seeks their success that the horizons of hearts may be illumined by the light of unity in such wise that its radiance may illumine the world of being.</p>
<p>And as to the mention made of the noble sons, upon them be the glory of God, all are recipients of God’s favors and mention of them hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur. Special expressions of favor have appeared from the Dayspring of Grace for each one, and this evanescent servant also conveyeth greetings to each one and beseecheth God to keep them beneath the shadow of His favor and that, God willing, they may attain to service to the Divine Cause in their early youth.</p>
<p>As you wrote indicating your intention to send his honor Aqa Muhammad-Rida, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, to Daru’s-Salam after the festival - this matter was presented before His presence. He said that he should proceed with the utmost wisdom, and stated that whatever was said during the days of his presence should be acted upon. God willing, may they be assisted and confirmed in all conditions and be mindful of wisdom. His honor should conduct himself in that land in such a way as to cause the heedless souls to become calm and quiet. God willing, they have been and are successful in this matter, for the enemies are observed to be awaiting tumult and clamor. As the poet of old has said: “They drink wine in secret while denouncing others,” meaning that the wine of divine knowledge must be drunk in secret until the capacity and receptivity of the people of the earth becomes manifest for the recognition of this Most Holy, Most Exalted Station.</p>
<p>And regarding what you wrote about his honor your brother and nephews, may God assist them - kindness and expression of love is most fitting. They know not what news there is. The turbaned ones have deprived the people of the supreme bounty, for truly whoever becomes aware of the station would place his eye upon the path and turn to the greatest vista. Beseech God that He not deprive his honor your brother and nephews from the ocean of knowledge, nor prevent them from the highest horizon, and that He may assist them in such wise that the ornaments of the world and its various colors may not make them heedless of and veiled from the Truth, exalted be His glory. The glory shining forth from the horizon of eternity be upon you and those with you and upon the loved ones of God in those parts, and praise be to God, my Lord and your Lord.</p>

<p>He is the All-Hearing, the All-Answering!</p>
<p>O My Name! Upon thee be My Glory! The Most Great Branch hath appeared before the Face. The letters of the friends written to thee have each been mentioned in the Most Holy Presence and recorded by the Supreme Pen. The letter of Mirza Aqa which he sent to thee attained the honor of being heard. He made mention of the barking ones - from Kerman appeared that which flowed from the Supreme Pen in the Most Holy Book, and that which is now hidden shall be made manifest. Those who in past ages and centuries counted themselves among the righteous and deemed themselves the most learned of the earth’s scholars - on the Day of Manifestation the station and rank of each became clear and evident. By the life of God! The recompense of their deeds seized them and they returned to hell. The deniers among the people of the Bayan cling to the same vain imaginings. Through their attachment to names they have been deprived of the Dawning Place of the lights of inner meanings. The verses have encompassed the world and the evidences have shone forth like the sun from the horizon of the heaven of will, yet still some remain deprived and veiled. Say: This is not a Cause that can be prevented by the cawing of crows or the clamor of divines. Its light hath shone forth from the horizon of proof with such brightness that neither veils can conceal it nor coverings prevent it. Thus hath the Pen spoken when the Ancient Beauty was in the Most Great Prison. Blessed is he who hath heard the call and taken the wine of steadfastness from the hands of power and bounty, and hath drunk, detached from all names. By the life of God! He is indeed of the people of Baha, as hath been testified by the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the throne above and the earth below in this exalted station.</p>
<p>Verily We make mention of him who made mention of thee, as a token of My grace, for I am indeed the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. O Mirza Aqa! Hearken unto the call of Him Who hath been wronged. He hath made mention of thee before, and doth so at this hour, by the command of God, the Lord of all worlds. Thy letter which thou didst send unto My Name, upon him be My glory, hath reached Us. We have seen it and heard thy call, and have answered thee through this wondrous Book. Say: O people of God! Be not grieved by hardship, for after it cometh ease. By the life of God, had people not risen up to deny God’s blessing, His grace would now have encompassed all the world. For blessings have infinite meanings and degrees. Among these is the outpouring of the True Bestower which is manifest and resplendent in His days. In one station, the blessing is God’s verses themselves, which are the food of the spirit, and upon which dependeth the primary education of the servants. In another station it is the love of God, glorified be His majesty - that blessing whose measure and station the pillars of the world are powerless to define. It is the cause of fellowship and the source of unity among the servants, and it is that which guideth people to the most exalted horizon. Were but one of its effulgences to fall upon cities and lands, it would attract all and draw them to the place of sacrifice. It is the transformer and the director by God’s command, glorified be His majesty. It is that which kindleth the fire in hearts and souls, and through it the divine Lote-Tree uttereth the blessed Word. Its description cannot flow from the pen nor be concluded by the tongue. In another station the blessing is virtuous character, an adornment that befitteth all forms. Blessed is the soul that is adorned with this ornament - such a one is accepted before God and beloved among men. Were the Supreme Pen to desire to describe this station as it truly is, numerous volumes would result. We shall be brief, as is the way of the righteous, and make mention of the souls aforementioned, that haply they may drink of the choice wine of utterance and become detached from all else but God. In ages and centuries past they worshipped various gods while considering themselves monotheists. But when the Greatest Light shone forth from the Most Exalted Horizon of the world, it became clear and evident to all that they were idol-worshippers. They martyred the Lord of the world, yet to this day have not become aware. Today is the day of true monotheism. All have been created by God’s Word. The Most Great Infallibility belongeth exclusively to God, exalted be His glory - none shareth with Him in this station. The Letters, whether of the past or future, are all created beings, and the source of all is the Divine Word, and the educator of all is His grace. Blessed is the soul that today attaineth unto the lights of true monotheism and comprehendeth the meaning of the blessed words “Verily there is no God but Him.” Ponder, O people of insight! Reflect, O ye who are endowed with vision, that perchance ye may catch the fragrances of the All-Merciful. Though some veils have been rent asunder by the finger of power, others remain, for were all to be rent at once, the foundations of the world would be shaken and all peoples would be seized with trembling.</p>
<p>O Pen! Set aside these remembrances and mention those whose remembrance one of My loved ones has desired, that he may thank his Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. We make mention of Our loved ones who have gathered in the house of him who was named Husayn, and We remind them of that which befitteth the Day of God, the Lord of the worlds. O My loved ones! One of My servants hath made mention of you, and We have mentioned you in verses which nothing in all creation can equal. Give thanks unto God for this great favor. Rejoice in that your names have flowed from the Most Exalted Pen while the Wronged One was in His manifest prison. By God! The Most Great Announcement, whereof Muhammad the Messenger of God gave glad tidings, and which the Interlocutor foretold aforetime, and concerning which the Spirit of Truth gave tidings, hath made mention of you. Be ye strong in the Cause with a power that the conditions of creation cannot weaken, nor the clamor of the babblers who have violated God’s Covenant and His Testament and have denied Him in Whom they formerly believed render ineffective. The Book of God, speaking from this sublime station, beareth witness unto this. From this station We send greetings to the faces of Our loved ones and give them glad tidings of My favor which hath preceded existence. Blessed is he who standeth firm whom clamor hath not caused to sit, and blessed is the speaker whom the doubts of those who have denied God, the Lord of the seen and unseen, have not silenced. Cast behind you idle fancies and shatter the idols of vain imaginings in the name of your Lord, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Thus hath the squeaking of My Pen been raised and the rustling of My Lote-Tree. Blessed are they who hear.</p>
<p>O My Name! We have made mention of Our loved ones in Kaf. Give them glad tidings of My grace, My mercy, My loving-kindness and My favor which have encompassed all that was and shall be.</p>
<p>And mention was made of Mirza Shukru’llah who hath turned to the Most Exalted Horizon. Blessed is the soul that hath been awakened by the breezes of the Revelation and hath risen from the graves of heedlessness and idle fancies. O Shukru’llah! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee. This is a most great favor. Hold thou fast unto it and be of the thankful ones. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! This is Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden who desireth to drink the choice wine of revelation from the hands of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the fire of Thy love whereby all created things were set ablaze, to enable me to turn wholly unto Thee, detached from all else but Thee. O my Lord! Aid me to stand firm in Thy Cause, then write me down among Thy servants who believe in Thy unity. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Ja’far that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I have turned unto Thee, detached from all else but Thee and holding fast unto Thy cord. I beseech Thee not to deprive me of the heaven of Thy bounty, the ocean of Thy grace and the sun of Thy bestowals. O my Lord! I am the weak one who hath clung to the hem of Thy strength, and the disturbed one who hath turned to the horizon of Thy tranquility and Thy power. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O My Name! We have observed the letter of the beloved one - upon him be My Glory - which he sent in the name of Jud. The fragrance of divine love was wafted therefrom. We beseech God to confirm him and set his affairs aright - that is, whatsoever is in accordance with wisdom. By the Sun of the horizon of proof! He hath ordained and continueth to ordain that which is best for His loved ones. Ask thou God to set His people aflame in those regions. O people of God! Be not grieved. God hath been and will ever be with you. Each one of you must manifest such qualities as will cause the people to turn and be attracted. O dear one! Convey My greetings to the loved ones of God and say: This is the day of steadfastness and the day of service. We beseech God to protect all.</p>
<p>O Ali! Upon him be My Baha! You have ever been remembered and still are remembered. Repeatedly have you been blessed by the Most Exalted Pen. O Ali! You have been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to send down upon you and His party from the heaven of His bounty a blessing from His presence and a grace from His side. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>We make mention of Ibn-i-Shahid, upon them both be My Baha, and bid him to steadfastness. O people of God! You must manifest yourselves in such wise that no opportunity remains for the barking ones - that is, their hopes may be transformed into despair. Say: O Ali-Akbar! Fear God and follow not vain imaginings and idle fancies. This is He but for Whom the Books of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, would not have been revealed. Through Him was every Messenger sent and every Book revealed. The Preserved Tablet in His presence bears witness to this. Fear God and follow not the people of idle fancy. We have previously commanded you to manifest the Greater Steadfastness. With your Lord is the knowledge of all things in a perspicuous Book. Nothing escapes His knowledge. Verily, He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
<p>We convey greetings to the people of God and give them the glad-tidings of God’s favor. We beseech Him to aid all to that which causes the exaltation of His Cause and His Word. Cast behind you all who are on earth and say: Praise be to Thee, O our God, our Goal, and our Beloved, for having made known unto us the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation, the Dayspring of Thine inspiration, and the Manifestation of Thy Self, and for having drawn us nigh unto Thee, and for having caused us to hear Thy call, and for having shown us Thine all-highest horizon, and for having given us to drink of Thy sweetest Kawthar. O Lord! We beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued all names, to make us of those whom neither the allusions of the divines nor the doubts of the theologians have deterred. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>He is the Speaker of Truth</p>
<p>O Muhammad, upon thee be My Glory! The letter from H, upon him be My Glory, which was sent to thee was presented by the Most Great Branch before the Face and was honored to be heard. O Muhammad! There is and has been no doubt that ears and eyes were created to witness and hear in these days, and existence is for the recognition of the Lord of existence. Yet the dust of self and smoke of desire have prevented the people from beholding the Supreme Horizon. In truth, those souls who have attained today are accounted before God as the gems of creation and are mentioned as such. By the life of God! That which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Book concerning these souls hath no likeness or parallel. Soon will its signs and lights become manifest. He is the Expositor, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>In brief, the people of the world are deprived of knowledge and bereft of understanding. For centuries and ages they were worshippers of idols and vain imaginings. They were not and are not worthy to hear this call which is raised from the supreme height. They must cling to one like themselves and remain fixed upon one like themselves. All bear witness to the waves of the divine ocean of utterance which are manifest and visible before all faces, and the Lord of eternity called out without veil or covering and guided all to the supreme horizon. Nevertheless, they have turned away from the Lord of lords and have attached their hearts to the buzzing of flies. Where are the eyes, where are the ears, where is the intellect, where are the hearts? None but penetrating eyes can behold the pearls of the ocean of the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>Today the people of Baha are those souls who see themselves detached and free from all save God. The deniers of the Bayan are observed to be more base than the deniers of the Furqan, for they are occupied with the same names and the same sayings, and they lack the discernment to reflect upon what the fruit of the words and deeds of the previous party was and became on the Day of Retribution. Leave them in their vain discoursing.</p>
<p>We repeatedly make mention of H-S, upon him be My Glory. Praise be to God, he partook of the holy descended feast and attained repeatedly unto the traces of the Supreme Pen. We mention in this station his handmaiden and leaf who was with him, and We give her glad tidings of God’s loving-kindness and make mention of her through His verses. He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. And We make mention of his son Husayn and his brother. We beseech God to make their mention a treasure for them with Him. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who is named Mirza Aqa, whose name was mentioned before the Wronged One in this exalted station. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise and thanksgiving be unto Thee, and mercy and bounty be from Thee, for having given me to drink of Thy sealed wine through Thy name, the Self-Subsisting, and for having remembered me in the Most Great Prison when I was wronged at the hands of the heedless. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen, by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the lights of the sun of Thy wisdom, and by the hearts that have melted in their separation and remoteness from Thee, to make me to hold fast unto Thee and to be detached from all else but Thee. Then I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the dawning-places of Thy verses to ordain for me, through Thy grace and bounty, that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and benefit me both outwardly and inwardly. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Asad - upon him be My glory - that he may be drawn to My horizon, utter My praise, draw near in his heart to My court, and be seized with supreme joy in the days of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. We have heard thy mention, have made mention of thee, and have sent down for thee the verses, and We have expounded them in truth and dispatched them unto thee that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>We speak now in the Persian tongue. Verily, We have, in most instances, changed the eloquent language into the luminous language. He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth. He is the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>All the peoples of the world and the various communities have each clung to some cause, striving with the utmost diligence and effort to exalt it. What wealth they have expended, what lives and honor they have sacrificed for the sake of manifesting that which they have desired! And this Most Great Cause, despite its loftiness, sublimity, glory, ascendancy and power, hath appeared in the realm of Persia, yet until now its people remain heedless of it, save for a few. Not for a moment have they contemplated this Cause with justice and fairness, nor have they ever sought to exalt it. Would that they had been content with this! Every day they strive to extinguish the light of the Manifestation and to quench the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree. This Wronged One hath, through days and nights, dispatched to all regions that which equalleth - nay exceedeth - the previous Books. Verses have encompassed the world and clear proofs have appeared before all faces, yet the ignorant servants - meaning the divines and doctors of the age - have become the cause of preventing the people and the reason for the turning away of the inhabitants of the land.</p>
<p>O Asad! Upon thee be the glory of God, the One, the Single! Arise to aid the Cause. We beseech God to assist thee. He will aid thee and make thee successful and reinforce thee with the hosts of the seen and the unseen. While time remaineth, occupy thyself with mention and praise, that perchance the mention may attract the people of the world and draw them to their true homeland. Verily, He is the Strong, the Triumphant, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Regarding what you asked about the mystery of “the inversion of the symbol of the chief” at the first appearance [of the Manifestation], observe how Sheikh Muhammad Hassan Najafi, who was the pole of Iranian scholars, and other scholars of Najaf and the land of Taff and the countries of Iran, after the raising of the Word and the declaration of the Cause, all were found to be veiled and forbidden. They were deprived of the ocean of the Merciful’s utterance and heedless of the sun of knowledge. Rather, they occupied themselves with cursing and execration from the pulpits. They rejected that Essence of being Whom they had yearned and hoped to meet throughout centuries and ages, and at the mention of Whose name they would say “may God hasten.” Finally they issued the death warrant for His most pure blood. However, some among the common people turned to Him, drank from the ocean of divine knowledge, found their way to the highest horizon, and on the day of the raising of the Most Exalted Pen’s voice were blessed to say “Here am I.” Thus did We make their highest ones lowest and their lowest ones highest. This is the mystery of “the inversion of the symbol of the chief.”</p>
<p>Reflect upon the Son of Mary. Annas, who was the most learned scholar of that age, issued the death warrant, and in the presence of that vile one a blow was struck upon that holy countenance. But the fisherman who was occupied with catching fish - when the Spirit [Jesus] passed by him and said “Come, I will make you a fisher of men” - instantly turned to Him, forsook the sea and fish and all therein. Having never seen a word of knowledge, he ascended to the kingdom of knowledge. Finally he reached such a station that his sweet fragrances perfumed the world. That is from God’s grace - He giveth it to whom He willeth. This same Peter, despite his exalted station, at the end of his days showed that which was unworthy, but in an instant the hand of grace seized him again and he was sustained by the Kawthar of steadfastness. Blessed is he.</p>
<p>None but the Truth Himself, Who possesseth the Most Great Infallibility, hath been or is His partner in this station. All else are created by a word. This is true unity whose light hath shone forth from the horizon of the Supreme Pen’s heaven. Think that thou mayest know. Enter this Most Great Ocean in the name of God, glorified be His majesty, and in its depths a illuminating sun shineth, that thou mayest attain thy goal and find what hath been mentioned.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Face! Though the Supreme Pen speaketh, yet it is silent, for it hath not spoken as it should, and even if it had, it remaineth concealed. Contaminated ears and tired eyes were not and are not worthy to hear and behold. From the dried leaves of earth naught but meaningless sounds have been or are heard. Throughout ages and centuries the Shi’ih sect hath been uttering letters from pulpits and mosques while remaining deprived and forbidden from the Mother Book. We beseech God to grant thee success that thou mayest attain true unity and arise to serve the Cause.</p>
<p>O Lion! Upon thee be My glory! Concerning thy question about the meaning of ‘active’ - it refers to the Universal Lord, though it hath other meanings, and that which returns to the ‘passive.’ Reflect upon the Tablet of Wisdom. In every verse lies concealed an ocean among the oceans. We beseech God that thou mayest be enabled to witness and contemplate that which hath streamed forth from the Most Exalted Pen, both in the past and future. That which hath been sent down from the heaven of Divine Will is such that before it the books of the world have bowed down, yet the peoples remain in evident drunkenness. Out of pure bounty have We given this answer. Fix thy gaze continually upon this verse which was previously revealed in one of the Tablets: “This is not the day for questions. It behooveth everyone, when hearing the Call from the Supreme Horizon, to arise and say: ‘Here am I, O Lord of Names! Here am I, O Desire of the knowing ones!’” We have revealed unto thee that whereby the eyes of the people of the cities of knowledge and wisdom have been solaced. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this manifest grace.</p>
<p>We make mention of him whom thou didst mention, who was named Hasan in the Kingdom of Names. O Hasan! Thy name was present before the Wronged One in the Most Great Prison. From this far-off spot, hear the Call from the direction of ’Akka: Verily, there is none other God but He, the Single, the All-Informed. Say: My God, my God! All praise be to Thee for having enabled me to witness the signs of Thy Most Exalted Pen, and all thanksgiving be unto Thee for having made known to me Thy path, O Lord of all beings! I beseech Thee by the mysteries of Thy utterance and the light of Thy proof to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love in such wise that neither the oppression of them that have disbelieved in Thee and Thy signs, nor the doubts of such as have turned away from Thy horizon and have uttered that at which the dwellers of Thy Paradise and the inmates of the tabernacle of Thy majesty have lamented, shall hinder me. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Impregnable, the Most Great, the Most Exalted!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who is one in His command and single in His judgment. All atoms bear witness that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been alone in His unity, exalted in His transcendence, glorified in His majesty, and unique in His singularity. He hath no partner in His sacred commandments, nor any peer in His revealed ordinances. By His sovereignty He doeth what He willeth, and by His command He ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is indeed the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath spoken through His mighty verses and commanded all humanity to follow that which was revealed therein, and forbidden all from following self and idle fancy. He is verily the Lord of the hereafter and of this world, the Lord of the throne on high and of the earth below. His penetrating Will and His all-encompassing Purpose have embraced all things. The armies of the world cannot frighten Him, nor can the clamor of nations dismay Him. None is to follow save that which hath been revealed in the Books and Tablets. There is none other God but Him, the Powerful, the Most Great, the Most High, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious, the Best-Beloved.</p>
<p>And furthermore, thy letter hath reached this evanescent servant, and I was near to soaring upon the wings of longing when I discovered therein the fragrance of the love of the Best Beloved of all worlds. I opened it and read it, and presented it before His countenance, and laid before God, the Lord of the Day of Separation, that which was contained therein. When the letter was concluded, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which indicated His grace and favors unto you, and His mercy and bounties upon you. It was as though I had, in that moment, drunk from the utterance of our Lord, the All-Merciful, that which no pen can describe. Exalted is His mercy, magnificent His favor, great His beneficence, and all-encompassing His grace. Verily, He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>God willing, through the loving-kindness of the Best-Beloved of the worlds, may ye ever gaze toward wisdom and that which will promote harmony among the loved ones. I express this in Persian that all the honored ones, the beloved ones, and the friends of the Truth may grasp the matter. Although the holy Tablets revealed from the heaven of God’s Will have been sent down in both Arabic and Persian in such wise that they need no expositions from the likes of this servant, yet since certain contrary matters have been heard, it therefore becometh necessary, nay obligatory, upon this servant to set forth that which is right and proper, so that those things which cause tumult and clamor among men may not come to pass.</p>
<p>In most of the Tablets, the Truth, exalted be His grandeur, hath commanded all to observe wisdom and hath forbidden abominable deeds and inflammatory matters that cause strife, conflict, corruption and the perturbation of people. He hath entirely removed the decree of killing, and in the Most Holy Book, which was revealed from the holy Kingdom, He hath commanded that all should associate with the followers of all religions in the utmost spirit of joy and fragrance, that perchance those who have gone astray may turn toward the horizon of the All-Merciful and become free and delivered from darkness, error, and the desires of self and passion.</p>
<p>Observe ye now in what station the Cause of Truth dwelleth and in what wilderness the imaginings of men reside. I swear by the holy Being of Truth that in His most holy court there hath never been, nor is there, conflict, corruption, killing and strife, and He hath forbidden all from these abominable things. He hath even said: “Whoso acteth contrary to that which hath been revealed in My Book from the heaven of My Will, he is not of Me.” How then could there issue forth from the Source of the Cause, or from those related to Him, a decree of killing or aught else that hath been explicitly forbidden in the Book? We seek refuge in God from this! Again we seek refuge in God from this! May God protect us and you from such matters.</p>
<p>How greatly was your non-acceptance of this accepted at the Divine Throne! Today all must look to the horizon of the Cause and to that which hath been revealed in the Tablets. The words of speakers and the imaginings of the doubtful have not sufficed and will not suffice. Ye have witnessed that whenever an abominable thing occurred, it became the cause of harm to the loved ones and the veiling of weak souls. Verily His mercy hath preceded the world, His loving-kindness hath encompassed the world, and His favors have embraced the world. Blessed art thou, then blessed art thou, for having shunned this abominable matter.</p>
<p>If the loved ones were to become aware of the power, might, greatness and all-encompassing nature of the Truth, they would never utter such things nor undertake them, for the Truth is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. Verily He is […]</p>
<p>O Mighty, All-Powerful One! The killing of an unbelieving oppressor is not permissible today, let alone anyone else. Indeed, some simple-minded souls, following their own imaginings, intend to harm any helpless person whom they suspect of opposition, and consider this as support for the Cause. Nay, by God! This was not and is not the support of the Cause. Support today consists of goodly deeds, praiseworthy conduct, and unifying words - this has been and will continue to be so, as revealed and recorded in most of the Tablets. You must surely strive with the utmost effort and care to unite hearts, bring about agreement among souls, and follow what has been revealed in the Book, so that all may dwell in one pavilion and speak with one voice. This that has been stated is what is beloved before God. He Himself suffices as a witness unto Me, He Himself suffices as a witness unto what I say, and He Himself suffices as One who knows what I say.</p>
<p>The honored Observer came to the Holy Land and dwelt in its vicinity. I swear by the Sun of Truth that I never heard from him a word about the aforementioned Mirza except once when he mentioned to this servant that he hoped some favor might be shown so that he might attain to the honor of certitude. This servant presented this same request before the Throne. Moreover, the honored Kalim, may my spirit be a sacrifice for him, would mention his association and meetings with the said Mirza, and I never heard any expression of dissatisfaction from him, let alone anything else. Beyond this, respect for the owner of the place where the said Mirza resides has been necessary, as numerous Tablets were revealed for them from the heaven of divine will in successive years. The details regarding the honored Nabil’s attention to those parts was that after the Observer’s departure from the Most Holy Presence to Haifa, which is located three parasangs from this land, the honored Nabil went to accompany him. Afterward, the Observer wrote a letter to this servant from there saying that it was intended here that he would take Nabil with him, requesting permission from the Source of Authority. This servant presented this, and it was said that this permission is conditional - you must observe wisdom in all conditions. This servant wrote to them accordingly as commanded, and that letter is still available.</p>
<p>This much I submit: causing corruption has not been and is not support for the Cause of God. He aids His Cause through His own Self; verily He is the Helper, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise. The loved ones of God are commanded to teach the Cause, which is true support, and the purpose of this command is that all may attain the exalted station of “whosoever quickens a soul is as though he has quickened all humanity.” I request that some of the loved ones observe this servant’s letter so they may become informed.</p>
<p>Another submission: a Tablet has been revealed from the heaven of will specifically for you and will be sent later. All who circle round the Throne, both residents and travelers, all send greetings to you. The conveying of greetings from this ephemeral one to the loved ones of that land depends upon your love. To the honored and exalted master, the honored Nabil, upon him be the Glory of God, I offer endless greetings. His mention has been and is in the prison. We hope, God willing, that he will ever remain oriented toward service to the Cause and attain to what He loves and is pleased with. The One God is witness that they have not been and will not be erased from view. We beseech God to gather us in one dwelling place and one station. Verily, He has power over all things.</p>
<p>As to your request for permission to attain His presence, when it was mentioned He said: The essence of the Cause today is the recognition of the Manifestation of God Himself. Praise be to God, you have attained unto this. And after that, service to the Cause, which is the mention of God, exalted and glorified be He, and the promotion of His Cause - praise be to God, you have attained unto this as well. Now strive diligently to foster unity among the loved ones of God in that place. This matter is and has ever been most beloved in the sight of the Wronged One, for unity is the cause of the exaltation of God’s Cause, and discord is other than this. We beseech God to assist thee to make mention of Him and to serve His Cause, and to ordain for thee that which shall exalt thee in truth. Verily, He is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing. The Glory be upon thee and upon the sincere loved ones of God.</p>

<p>The Most Holy Branches of the Divine Lote Tree - may my spirit and the spirit of all the worlds be sacrificed for them - conveyed their most glorious and sublime greetings to you.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of Aqa Mirza Muhammad-’Ali, wherein Nabil ruled that the Most Great Branch had said such and such - would that thou hadst been present before the Throne of Revelation and heard the words of God, the Self-Subsisting, addressing the aforementioned Nabil. Among other things He said: “Thou hast made the Branch My partner. By God, the Self-Subsisting! If anyone were to slay one of the Branches, I would not consent to his execution. Thou hast set aside all these divine utterances and accepted the word of the Branch.” Furthermore, upon investigation it became clear that such a ruling had never been made by the Most Great Branch. Should you observe anyone speaking contrary to the divine utterances revealed in the Arabic and Persian Tablets, accept it not, regardless of who they may be or what they may say, especially in matters that cause agitation and disturbance among the people. In all cases, fix your gaze upon the Cause itself, not upon what issueth from the mouths of men.</p>

<p>Tablet to Muhammad-Husayn, upon him be Glory. In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, Who hath adorned the brocade of the Book of Revelation with the letter Ha’ following the letter Ba’, through which the Trumpet was blown and all who are in the heavens and earth were thunderstruck, and through which the path of grace was raised up and the balance of justice established, and through which the limbs of all names trembled and the foundations of those who denied God, Creator of heaven, were shaken, and through which the tribes lamented and the widows cried out, and through which the banner “Verily He is God” was raised throughout all regions of existence and the standards “Truth hath come, the Knower of the unseen” were unfurled. Glorified be He Who hath appeared and made manifest through the Most Exalted Word that which all in the kingdom of creation are powerless to describe. The glory shining forth from the horizon of our Lord, the All-Merciful’s will, be upon those who have cast away vain imaginings, shattered the idols, and hastened with their hearts to the horizon whence the Sun of certitude hath dawned forth and the Kingdom of utterance appeared and the Nightingale warbled upon the branches. The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Light of hearts and Fire of souls! I beseech Thee by Thy Beloved Name, through which the blood of lovers was shed in separation and livers were melted by the fire of longing, to assist Thy chosen ones to stand firm in Thy Cause in such wise that love of life shall not prevent them from drawing nigh unto Thee, O Lord of attributes and Revealer of verses. Then send down upon them, O my God, from the heaven of Thy grace that which befitteth Thy generosity and bounty, that they may abandon all they possess and arise to that which beseemeth their station. O Lord! Thou art the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Hearing, the All-Perceiving. Thou dost witness, see and know what hath befallen Thy trusted servants at the hands of Thy wicked enemies. O Lord! This evanescent servant hath mentioned one of Thy loved ones out of love for Thy Beauty and longing for Thy Cause. I beseech Thee to assist him in Thy remembrance and praise, then inscribe him with the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Tablet, and ordain for him that which shall profit him in this world and the next. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy clear signs, Thy Revelation and Thy power to aid him to stand firm in Thy love. Verily Thou art the Almighty over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter reached Me and the breezes of thy love wafted over Me. When I read and found its purpose, I ascended to the Most Exalted Summit until I attained the presence of the Lord of all beings, and I stood before the Throne, still and silent, observing. Then the Tongue of Grandeur spoke and said: “What is this in thy right hand?” I opened it and presented what was therein. When it was completed and ended, He, exalted be His glory, said: “He is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.”</p>
<p>This is Our mention unto one whose book hath attained unto the hearing of the Lord of Names in this station which hath been named the Luminous Spot, and at other times the Heaven of this Heaven, and by the Most Beautiful Names of God. Verily thy Lord is the All-Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. We have heard thy call and have answered thee that thou mayest render thanks and arise to serve the Cause on this Day whereon the clamor hath been raised from all sides and the Tongue of the Chosen One hath spoken: The Kingdom is God’s, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Soar upon the wings of certitude in the atmosphere of the love of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, that thou mayest hear the warbling of the Bird of Utterance. By the life of God! It will attract thee to a station which the pens of the world are powerless to praise and the tongues of them that remember are incapable of describing. Blessed is the soul that hath not been hindered from the Truth by the conditions of creation and hath rent asunder the veils through His Name, the Powerful, the Mighty. This is a Day wherein the gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of Names hath spoken: Come ye and draw nigh, O people of creation! By God! The Hidden One hath appeared and that which was treasured up and promised in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds, hath been revealed. We counsel the chosen ones of God and His loved ones with that whereby His Cause may be exalted and His virtues manifested among His servants. Verily thy Lord is the Counselor, the All-Seeing. Convey My greetings unto the faces of those whom the conditions of the world have not prevented from the Creator of heaven and who have spoken what they heard from the Truth and acted upon that which they were bidden in His perspicuous Book. How many a servant hath turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and testified to that whereunto God testified before the creation of the heavens and earth, and how many a servant hath turned away by following the dawning-places of idle fancies who cast the Book of God behind their backs and held fast unto that which they possessed. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And how many a servant hath turned toward and then away, and how many a servant hath stood with such steadfastness as caused the mountains to be scattered and every mighty idol to fall. Thus have We mentioned thee and sent down for thee the verses that thou mayest arise to serve the Cause and be of them that are thankful.</p>
<p>Today the Essence of bounty calleth aloud unto all beings with the most exalted call and guideth creation unto the Truth. In such wise, a hundred thousand such as this evanescent one are powerless and incapable of mentioning, expressing, and manifesting the bounty of God, exalted be His glory. What can a drop perceive of the waves of the Most Great Sea, and what can it express? By the Sun of Truth, all who are in earth and heaven have been and are powerless. The Seal of the Prophets and Messengers - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - hath confessed His bewilderment. What then can this servant say and what can he manifest? I seek His forgiveness, I seek His forgiveness, I repent and I repent. Verily He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Bountiful, the All-Pardoning, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Rida, nephew of the late and exalted Haji Zabih, upon both of them be the Glory of God, that his circumstances had not yet been presented at the Most Holy Court - this servant, about a year ago, was present one day at the Most Holy Court when mention of him was made in a letter from one of the friends. He showed favor and established his relationship to one who believed not in Him Who believed and was martyred in His path. He said that God willing, he would be confirmed in preserving this station. Likewise, in a letter which this servant submitted to the beloved Varqa, upon him be the Glory of God and His favor, a Tablet was specifically revealed from the heaven of grace for the aforementioned one, and mention of him whom God had related to Him was detailed from the Supreme Pen. God willing, they will be assisted in preserving the favors of God, exalted be His glory. Today it is incumbent upon everyone to hold fast to that which causes the steadfastness and exaltation of God’s Cause. Whatever they have done in the path of God is remembered before God and they have surely attained and will attain its recompense. Today is such a day that if someone takes a single step for God’s sake, its effects will be reflected in the mirror of knowledge which exists within all creation. How then could pure deeds, goodly words and praiseworthy conduct manifested by someone in God’s path remain without effect? Glory be unto Him, glory be unto Him, above what they describe and exalt above what they mention!</p>
<p>And regarding what you wrote about being in service to the exalted Zabih, upon him be the Glory of God, hoping to attain His presence - this matter was presented at the Most Holy Court. This is what the All-Giving revealed in response, blessed and exalted be His words:</p>
<p>Today the sun of grace is shining and the ocean of favor is surging. The Truth, exalted be His glory, openly and manifestly hearkens to the call of His loved ones and bestows His response. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. The whole world was created for the meeting with God, and all divine Books bear witness to this truth. Nevertheless, in the days of His manifestation all were heedless and turned away, save whom God willed. Today, those who have drunk from the wine of utterance and are gazing toward the horizon of the All-Merciful are mentioned before God as the gems of existence. They must know the value of this most great bounty and supreme gift, and cling to those means which cause and promote the exaltation of the Cause, that perchance the people of the world may not remain deprived of the Most Great Ocean and may attain their ultimate goal. Their names have been inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Book, and He shall write for whomever desired the reward of meeting Him. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. He counsels all to be steadfast and faithful to this Cause whereby the limbs of all names have trembled. Thus has the decree been sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will in this mighty Prison. Prayers, peace and glory be upon those whom vain imaginings have not kept back from God, the Lord of all worlds. And praise be to God, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>O friend! By God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting! The people are heedless and deprived of awareness. Night and day, without cessation, there hath been sent down from the heaven of the All-Merciful’s Will that which the world of creation is powerless to comprehend or reckon. Nevertheless, the opposers have uttered what they have uttered, even though, by His very Self, the Truth, none other than this servant hath been or is aware. In any case, with a hundred thousand lamentations, entreaties and supplications, I beseech the friends of God that they all strive to reform the world, that perchance the vain imaginings of the past may not hereafter emerge and deprive the people of the Dayspring of certitude. Let them arise for God’s sake and speak for God’s sake. Verily, He is the Protector of those who do good and the Lord of those who act.</p>
<p>And now, they had written that his honor Aqa Muhammad-Rida, upon him be 95 [Baha’u’llah], is engaged in a trade in the Land of ?a. This matter is adorned with the ornament of divine acceptance, for all are commanded in this day to pursue a craft, profession or trade, and the work of craftsmen is accounted as worship in God’s Book. Well is it with them and pleasant it is unto them. And God willing, may his honor Mirza Jahangir be assisted in the mention of Truth and the service of Truth. Mention was made of them before the Most Holy Court, and this servant’s hope is that from the friends of God in this springtime of Revelation there may appear such a matter as shall endure throughout the eternity of His Most Beautiful Names. This is not difficult for God. I convey greetings and salutations to those two honored friends and commit them to God, exalted be His glory. May the Glory that is manifest, resplendent, dawning and evident be upon you and upon those who have turned unto His straight Path.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station in wisdom and utterance!</p>
<p>The Preserved Tablet declares: During nights and days We summoned the servants of the earth to the Luminary of inner meanings that has dawned from the horizon of the heaven of utterance. We […] have sent down every proof with truth and made manifest every evidence with justice. By God’s life! The proof calls out, the evidence cries aloud, and the testimony laments, for despite the greatness of these days, the greatness of this Revelation, and the greatness of the proof, all are seen to be heedless.</p>
<p>O Haydar-‘Ali, upon thee be My glory! The letter thou didst send to the Name of Bounty was presented by the Most Great Branch in the Most Holy Court, and this most mighty, most holy Tablet was revealed that perchance the servants might attain, through the traces of the Supreme Pen, the fruits of the Ultimate Tree. Today the Kingdom of Bounty exists and the Sovereign of existence is established upon the throne of bestowal. The realm of the servants’ understanding is narrow and dark, neither was nor is it worthy for the Pen of utterance to move within it. The expanse of creation was and is not worthy - how much less the hearts of the ignorant ones of the earth who are stained with the clay of vain imaginings. Ask of God that He may purify all through the Kawthar of utterance and prepare them to turn toward the supreme horizon.</p>
<p>Concerning Anis, upon him be My glory, thou didst write - his mention hath been and is before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. We beseech God to deliver the sun of knowledge from the dark clouds of the vain imaginings of the ignorant, that He may gather His loved ones beneath the shade of His favor and assign them dwelling places beneath the pavilions of grandeur. Thou didst mention ’Ali-A?ghar - We preceded in mentioning him, and precedence in mercy hath been from God, and the blessed word “My mercy precedeth all things” encompasseth all. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to him and give him the glad tidings of the effulgences of the Sun of grace.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention regarding Aqa Siyyid Mu??afa, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, and his enthusiasm and steadfastness in the Cause of God - all attained the honor of being heard. We beseech God, exalted be He, to make them crushers of the might of the aggressors and promulgators of His Cause, His remembrance, and His sovereignty. Give him My glad tidings and remind him of My verses, that he may soar on the wings of detachment in this atmosphere and be of the thankful ones. Thus hath spoken the Supreme Pen while the Wronged One was in His exalted station.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Convey greetings to the friends of God who are mentioned in the Most Holy Court as the party of God. Say: By My life and My loving-kindness! If ye were to discover the fragrance of this blessed word by which ye are mentioned, ye would be detached from the world and all who dwell therein, and would hold fast to God’s firm cord. Ye have ever been and continue to be mentioned in the Most Holy Court. The mention of these gems of existence hath been recorded by the Supreme Pen in the crimson scroll. Blessed are they at whose mention the Pen of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, hath moved. We are God’s, and to Him shall we return.</p>
<p>Ja’far, whose mention is with God, was the custodian of the Holy Shrine. As for the second Ja’far, My Supreme Pen maketh mention of him at this moment in this Clear Tablet. Say: O Ja’far! Whosoever hath turned to God this day and drunk from the choice wine of recognition, he hath been and is mentioned with God, and there hath been ordained for him that which the understanding and intellects of all on earth cannot comprehend or encompass. Give thanks to the Intended One of the world Who hath turned toward thee in the Most Great Prison and made mention of thee. He is the Hearing, the Answering, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings unto Muhammad Mahdi. A Most Holy Tablet hath been revealed especially for him in these days. We beseech God to aid him to accomplish that which befitteth this Divine Day. The emigrants have made mention of him, and the gaze of loving-kindness is directed towards him. Make mention of him with My verses and My favours, and give him the glad-tidings of My mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. Likewise was revealed specially for the family of the daughter of the Beloved of Martyrs that which testifieth to God’s supreme loving-kindness and Most Great Favour. Blessed is she and joy be unto her!</p>
<p>O Haydar! Make mention, on My behalf, of him who is named Muhammad-’Ali, son of him who soared in My atmosphere and offered up his spirit in My path. Say: Thou hast ever been and wilt ever be remembered. For him too was revealed from the heaven of the All-Merciful’s will […] and sent forth, that he might drink from the cup of utterances of the Manifestation of clear proofs and the Revealer of verses, the water of immortality. Thus did the Pen speak when the Lord of Eternity was seated upon the Most Great Throne in this impregnable fortress.</p>
<p>Thou didst make mention of the wife of ’Abdu’l-Baqi. Verily We have mentioned her before and given her the glad-tidings of My favour, and I am the Compassionate, the Generous. O handmaiden of God! Thou wert remembered in the presence of the Wronged One and hast attained unto the effulgences of the Day-Star of divine favour which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Supreme Pen. This bounty is the sovereign of bounties and this grace is the king of graces. Blessed is My servant ’Abdu’l-Baqi who hath attained unto that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds. Convey My greetings unto Maqsud. Say: Divine confirmations are with thee, and We beseech God to aid thee to preserve that which hath been bestowed, for through its preservation existeth that which is worthy of mention before God, and without it, extinction seizeth and will continue to seize it. O Maqsud! Upon thee be My glory! Thou hast ever been and wilt ever be remembered. God’s favour hath been manifested on thy behalf. Preserve it through My Name, the Protector of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>O ’Abdu’l-Ghani! Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto the traces of the Supreme Pen in these divine days and hast been nourished by the fruits of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. Know thou the value of this favour and guard it from the treacherous ones and the barking ones. Previously a Most Holy Tablet was revealed especially for thee. By the life of God! From the horizon of that Tablet hath shone forth the Day-Star of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. We beseech God to aid thee that thou mayest set His servants ablaze with the fire of utterance and become the cause of the world’s enkindlement. This is not difficult for thy Lord. He manifested Moses with but a staff, and it triumphed over all the swords of the world by His command, for He is the Powerful, the Almighty. Fix thy gaze upon My horizon, speak in praise of Me, hold fast unto My cord, and stand firm in the service of My Cause, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst mention concerning the prisoner, We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid him through the means of the unseen and the visible, to relieve his distress, protect him, help him, deliver him, and enable him to serve the Cause. Verily, He is the Strong, the Triumphant, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. O prisoner! Rejoice within thyself that the Prisoner calleth thee from His Most Great Prison unto God, the Lord of all worlds. He hath indeed come with the truth, sent down His proof, and made manifest His way, yet most of the people are heedless. Thou hast followed Our example in imprisonment. We beseech God to grant thee deliverance, and for Myself I have not desired nor do I desire aught save what He hath desired. He is the One Who is desired in the beginning and in the end, and He is the Preserver, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! I call Myself before My servants, and I am the Manifest Rememberer. Convey My greetings to the loved ones. Say: O people of God! This Day is your day; know ye its value and hold fast unto goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct. The hosts of the True One, exalted be His glory, have ever been and shall ever be goodly deeds and conduct, and the commander of these hosts hath been the fear of God. Blessed are they that act! Blessed are they that attain!</p>
<p>O friends! These days pass swiftly as lightning. Strive that ye may not remain deprived of that which is immortal through that which is mortal. Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the birds of Thy throne and the doves of Thy Cause that warble their melodies, and by the station which hath been honored by Thy footsteps, and by the light that hath shone forth from the horizon of Thy Revelation, and by the fire which Thou didst cause to speak through Thy power and sovereignty, to assist Thy people in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Then make them, O my God, the ensigns of Thy guidance amongst Thy creatures and the standards of Thy sanctification in Thy lands. Moreover, ordain for them through Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of this world and of the world to come. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all creation. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the honored Amin hath lately arrived and hath repeatedly mentioned thee in the Most Holy Court, as well as some of the friends. Blessed is he, well is it with him, and goodly shall be his end. The glory be upon thee and upon them that have believed in God, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful, and upon them that hearken unto thy words and love thee. Verily thy Lord is the Commander, the All-Munificent.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Thou art continuously mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen. No sooner is one station mentioned than another appeareth. This is from thy Lord’s favor unto thee, that thou mayest be of the contented ones. Thou didst mention the land of K and R. The honored Habib hath ascended unto God. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to forgive him through His grace and bounty and to cause him to enter the most exalted station and the highest paradise. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Generous. It is necessary that one of the assured, holy, pure and detached souls should proceed to that land. At first, he must hold fast unto wisdom and establish ties with the notables of that land, both the learned and the rulers, for one named Muhammad from Kazimayn hath gone to that land and is of the hosts of vain imaginings. Outwardly he hath befriended some of the notables of that land, while inwardly he is occupied with leading the people astray. In any case, one of the people of God must proceed to that land and with wisdom and utterance guide the people to the horizon of the All-Merciful. At first, he should not confirm any claimant until the truth becomes manifest from behind the veils. Blessed is he who turneth unto it to serve God, to manifest His Cause, to exalt His Word, and to proclaim that which hath been sent down in His perspicuous Book.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Pure, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down in truth from the heaven that encompasseth all the worlds, from which there descendeth at every moment that which quickeneth the hearts of the servants, if they alter not the grace of God within themselves and remain steadfast upon the straight path. Blessed, then, is he whom the breath of God hath quickened in these days, whom the Spirit hath awakened, whom it hath turned from the left of fear to the right of security, and who hath entered the pavilion that hath been raised in truth through this Name, from whose horizon the suns of holiness have dawned with wondrous splendor. Say: O people! The Cause hath returned in the person of ’Ali, and He hath appeared with a sovereignty that is, in truth, mighty. O people! The holy ascension hath appeared; ascend unto it on the Buraq of detachment that ye may witness what no eye in all creation hath witnessed, and attain unto a station of glory resplendent. Say: The divine Paran hath poured forth in this Most Great Paradise, the station wherein the Face hath been illumined with a light that shineth from the countenance of the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>O Salman! By God the Truth! The Beauty of the All-Glorious hath appeared and been established upon the throne of His name, the All-Merciful. Give thou the glad-tidings to all creation that the sun of thy Lord’s beauty, the All-Bountiful, hath dawned at the midmost heart of all possibility with such a Command as hath caused all who are in the heavens and on earth to swoon away, save them whom God hath protected by the hand of grace and delivered from the depths of idle fancy and desire, preserving them through the sovereignty of His Name, through which were created the Kingdom of Names and the Dominion of eternity. Tarry not in that which thou hast been bidden, and be steadfast upon the straight path. By God the Truth! O Salman! There existeth in My heart naught save the effulgences of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Wert thou to hearken with the ear of thine inmost nature, thou wouldst assuredly hear from this Most Exalted Pen the most excellent and sweetest melodies, and from My fingertips the anthems of the birds of eternity, and from My lips the songs of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and from My very hair the melodies that none can bear to hear - and whoso heareth them would assuredly sacrifice his soul in his longing for the meeting with his Lord, the All-Glorious, the Most Splendid, from Whose raiment the denizens of the highest Paradise perceive the fragrance of eternity, though at every moment the people cast against Him the darts of hatred.</p>
<p>O Salman! Should you pass by the dominions of the All-Merciful and someone ask you about the Ancient Beauty, say: By God, He hath been afflicted among His servants and subjects in such wise that He findeth no helper or champion for Himself. Say: O company of loved ones! Do ye rejoice among yourselves whilst the Eye of God raineth crimson tears and lamenteth, reciting unto all creation the verses of sorrow with a mournful voice? O Salman! Say: O people of the Bayan! Do ye dwell in your homes whilst the Beauty of the All-Merciful hath been exiled through the deeds of every wicked oppressor? Say: They that circled round My Self have been so deluded by the world that they have warred against Me with a sharp and cutting sword. O Salman! The garment of patience hath been rent among the company of the righteous. Say: Ye rest in your houses, heedless of what hath befallen the Beauty of your Chosen Lord at the hands of these wicked ones. Is there any faithful one who will fulfill his covenant and not break God’s pact in these days when every tyrannous oppressor hath opposed God? O Salman! Proclaim amongst the servants, then make mention of what hath befallen the Lord of Creation in the year of tribulation from the manifestations of adversity, and be not silent even for a moment. O Salman! Forget not the remembrance of thy Lord. Remember Me among My loved ones, then weep over My exile, My imprisonment and My trials, that perchance there may arise thereby one who will help Me and ward off with the sword of utterance the evil of every base idolater. O Salman! Remember Me among the servants of the one true God, that I may remember thee in the heaven of holiness among the nigh-approaching angels with wondrous verses of glory. O Salman! Though My tribulations cannot be fully expressed in words, yet mention thou what thou art able. Destroyed be the house wherein My remembrance and praise are not raised at morn and eventide! Mute be the tongue that remembereth not My trials! Blind be the eye that weepeth not over My afflictions and tribulations! And perished be the hearts from which wafteth not the sweet fragrances of resplendent glory! O Salman! Remember Me openly in My land, that I may remember thee in My Kingdom with clear and evident utterance. O Salman! By God, the tears of Mine eyes have appeared in the form of clouds and rain upon all created things, if thou be of them that know. And the fire of My heart hath appeared in the form of the sun, thus doth its heat affect all things, if thou be of them that perceive. Therefore hath the Nightingale of Eternity been prevented from warbling its melodious songs, and the Pen from flowing, and the Tongue from utterance. And wert thou to hear with Mine ear, thou wouldst hear how ’Ali bewaileth My Soul in the Most Glorious Companion, and Muhammad weepeth in the Most Exalted Horizon, and the Spirit smiteth his head in the heaven of destiny by reason of what hath befallen this Wronged One at the hands of every sinful transgressor. O Salman! We have reared thee through months and years, and preserved thee from the harm of every harmful one, and raised high thy mention between the heavens and the earth. Beware lest thou forget My favor and My manifold mercies upon thee, for My favor hath ever been abundant toward thee. O Salman! Transgress not the bounds of justice in regard to Me. We have reared thee for this Day. Rend asunder the veils through the sovereignty of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, and be steadfast in the path. Forget not My love for thee, and withhold not thyself from this Most Great Ocean which surgeth by virtue of its own self, and which no Prophet hath reached save that he paused upon its shore and removed from his feet the sandals of desire and from his heart the remembrance of all created things, then raised his hands unto God in manifest humility and said […]</p>
<p>O Lord! I beseech Thee by this Ocean and what lies concealed therein of the pearls of Thy knowledge and the fishes of Thy wisdom which none hath discovered save Thyself, that Thou wilt not deprive me of turning unto it, of finding tranquility beneath its shade, and of entering into its depths. Thou, verily, hast ever been omnipotent over all things. O Lord! This is a station which Thou hast sanctified from the entrance of every polytheist and the approach of every denier, and hast made it exclusively Thine own and for them who love Thee from among Thy near angels and Thy chosen ones. Then preserve, O my God, its people whom Thou hast associated with Thy Most Glorious Name between earth and heaven, and whom Thou hast made detached from all else save Thee and turned unto Thyself, from the evil of every denier and the wickedness of every stubborn polytheist. Then curse, O God, my Lord, those who have warred against Thy Most Glorious Self, through a drop of Whose ocean of bounty this sea and its dwellers were created, and what was treasured therein of the wonders of Thy wisdom and the pearls of Thy knowledge, and who disputed with Him and usurped His rights and denied His signs. Then, O my God, chastise them with the scourges of Thy might and the fire of Thy wrath. Verily, Thou art He Who doeth what He pleaseth with a sovereignty that encompasseth the Truth.</p>
<p>O Salman! By the truth of God, he moveth not from his place, nor lowereth his hands from their supplication, but that he weepeth over My tribulations, My trials, My sorrows, My exile and My distress, and with him weep all the tribes of the denizens of heaven and those who dwell beyond them among the angels on high and the Cherubim. Thus do We unveil for thee a mystery among mysteries through a hidden sign. O Salman! Were We to find one who hath attained maturity, We would reveal unto him that which would enable him to soar in every heaven beneath this heaven which hath been raised up in truth through this Name that was exalted in the Tablet. But since We find none trustworthy, We have veiled the Cause while the oceans surge within My Being and the suns shine forth from My mystery, and We move among the servants like one of them. Therefore hath the station of God become obscure to the servants, to such degree that they who cannot distinguish their right hand from their left lay claim to this station for themselves, and every day someone raiseth a call. Say: Fear God, O people, transgress not your bounds, and be God-fearing in His religion. O Salman! Inform My servants not to spread corruption in the earth. Say: Hold fast to the cord of servitude, for through it God’s Cause shall be made manifest, your influence shall be exalted among the servants, and the countenance of every sincere seeker shall be illumined. Then know, O Salman, that We desire from Our servants naught but that they speak with pure truthfulness and transgress not the bounds of justice. Thus did We counsel them before, and now counsel through a truthful and trustworthy Pen. Make known unto the people what thou knowest of that which hath befallen Us, in truth. Thus doth the Spirit command thee in truth from the presence of the Mighty, the Powerful. Fear no one, for God will protect thee as He protected thee before, and He watcheth over thee. O Salman! God preserved thee throughout numbered years and protected thee beneath the wings of protection, and thou wert a visitor to the Self of God, circling round His house and attaining His presence before His throne. Blessed art thou, for in every year the glances of God were directed toward thee, and this indeed was a supreme favor founded upon truth. Arise to thy Lord’s bidding, then go forth to the lands with the fragrance of the All-Merciful, that perchance the people may perceive the sweet scents of the garment and arise to promote the Cause and aid this Wronged One with the sword of utterance and repel the swords of opposition from Him and from the people of God in these days wherein the Ancient Beauty hath been established upon the throne of mighty glory. O Salman! Leave the world and whatsoever hath been created therein to its people, then proclaim between earth and heaven that sovereignty on that Day belongeth unto God, in Whose hand is the Kingdom of all things and in Whose grasp is the dominion of exalted might. The melodies of the Spirit have now ended upon thee, and We beseech God to assist thee in His Cause, to purify thee for His sake, to strengthen thee to promote His Cause, to enable thee to speak His praise, to detach thee from all else besides Him, for verily He answereth who calleth upon Him and is nigh unto who seeketh Him. And the radiance which hath shone forth from the direction of Baha be upon thee, upon thy wife, upon thy daughter, and upon whoso hath held fast to the holy and resplendent Ark.</p>

<p>O Siyyid Mahdi! He is the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting!</p>
<p>This is a Book that speaketh the truth and casteth into hearts the mysteries of God, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Mighty. Therein doth the Spirit proclaim a Word such as no ear hath ever heard, at which the heavens and earth would be rent asunder, save whom thy Lord willeth, the Mighty, the Sovereign, the Everlasting, the Peerless, the All-Knowing. Say: Verily He speaketh the truth in the atmosphere of eternity from this Station, wherefrom are severed the hands of the peoples of earth and heaven, save those who have freed themselves from the veils of fancy and have clung to this luminous and radiant Cause. Say: By God! The Hidden Book hath appeared in this ancient Temple. Say: The trial hath come unto you, O peoples of the earth, from every near direction, and the proof of God hath appeared at a station wherefrom are cut off the hands of the mystics. Say: Those who have taken for themselves a protector other than God, these are they whom their wretchedness hath overwhelmed and they are not of those who are guided. Say: By God! The Truth moveth with me even as the shadow moveth with the sun, if ye be of them that know. Say: The Spirit proclaimeth above my head that this indeed is He Who is the Intended One, Who hath appeared in the mantle of holy and gracious sanctity, and He shall not remain among you save for days ordained in the Tablets of mighty preservation. Say: When the idolaters imprisoned Us in this prison, We revealed the Face in truth that they might witness that He is indeed the One Who doeth what He willeth and is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>And thou, grieve not over anything, nor over what hath befallen thee after Me. Be patient, then be steadfast, and be not of them that are perturbed. All that they have stolen from thee was naught but the ornaments of this world, and they befit those who stole them. Be thou in supreme purity - sanctify thy soul, then purify thine essence, then illumine thy heart from all else save God, thy Lord, the Lord of all creation. Ask thou God to grant thee that which cannot be reached by the hands of thieves, that which will not change throughout the eternity of God, will not be followed by extinction, and will not be touched by the hands of the idolaters, even as He hath granted thee in truth His love, His remembrance and His glory, if thou be of them that know.</p>
<p>Verily thy letter hath come before Us wherein thou didst call upon God, thy Lord, with myriads of holy ones. By God! It is sweeter in My sight than all the pearls of mighty and precious glory that have appeared on earth. He whom God hath blessed with such grace will never grieve over anything, even should the harm of all the world befall him. And thou, close thine eyes to what hath befallen thee and place thy trust in God, the Mighty, the Invincible. Purify thy vision from human limitations and turn not thy gaze from this radiant Scene. This was revealed in the previous year from My Pen, if thou be of them that bear witness. Though what was in My house was as My very Self, and they who did this were as though they had betrayed My very Self - and God is witness to this - nevertheless We have forgiven those who did this, should they not repeat such deeds and be of them that repent unto God, with Whom is the knowledge of the heavens and earth and the knowledge of all things. There is no God but Him, the Forgiving, the Generous. Though this deed is in itself a sin greater than the creation of the heavens and earth, yet thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. He forgiveth whomsoever He willeth among His creation, should they return unto Him and […]</p>
<p>Know then that all We have mentioned to thee is thy most exalted horizon when thou ascendest unto God, the King, the Mighty, the Wise. However, in matters of creation, be utterly precise and discerning such that none can take anything from thee. Thus doth the Dove counsel and instruct thee with justice that thou mayest be among those who know. Disclose not thy secret to anyone, nor spread thy cause among the servants, lest any among the sinful become aware of what thou possessest. This is among the wise counsels We inspired in the heart of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, aforetime, and caused Him to speak it in a perspicuous Arabic tongue. Conceal thy gold, thy going forth, and thy religion from those who have taken their idle fancies for their god and were among the treacherous. Know thou moreover that guile towards the guileful is a virtue, and likewise deceit towards the deceitful. Therefore practice thou deceit with every sinful deceiver and guile with every vile trickster. All this is among the characteristics of the believers. We have imparted this unto thee that thou mayest be possessed of great sagacity. O Mahdi! Know thou, know thou that what hath befallen thee is as naught compared to what hath befallen Me. The eyes of the denizens of Paradise would weep at this, and the hearts of them that are nigh unto God would be sorely troubled. By God! Were anyone to become aware of what hath befallen Me, he would dwell in the wilderness and flee from all companionship, would find solace in none and would partake of nothing until he had sacrificed his soul in His love, this resplendent Beauty. All that hath outwardly befallen Me is as nothing, that I might recount it unto you, O concourse of lovers. Rather it is what hath inwardly befallen Me, which the dwellers of the heavens could not bear, nor could all who are in the kingdom together sustain it. By God! I cannot mention a single letter thereof, and were I to mention but one letter, the heavens and earth would be rent asunder. Therefore in this Prison I cry out to my Lord: “Where is Thy grace, O Succorer of the oppressed? Where are the wonders of Thy mercy, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of the worlds?” By God! I have fallen into the pit of tyrannical souls, yet I shall be patient in this even as I was patient before through God’s might and power. Verily He recompenseth the patient. And I say: “Praise be to God, for He is the Lord of all worlds, the Succorer of the oppressed and the Merciful unto the distressed.” Know thou moreover that this is not the first humiliation that hath descended upon My house. It descended before through what the hands of the oppressors had wrought, and there shall descend upon it such abasement as would cause tears to flow from every seeing eye. Thus have We imparted unto thee that which was hidden behind the veils of the Unseen, which none hath known save God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Then days shall pass and God shall raise it up in truth and make it a banner in His kingdom, around which shall circle the company of them that know. He is the Mighty.</p>
<p>The truth is that infinite harm hath befallen that honored one. Be patient even as We were patient, and in all matters be detached–that is, keep in mind detachment of heart. Whatever may come to pass in this Cause hath been and shall ever be most acceptable in the sight of God. If the opportunity arises to leave that land, you are free to do so, but with utmost care. Certain Tablets had been written, and copies of some were inscribed in a special treatise and sent. If you can disseminate these to all lands, no task today is greater than this, yet let copies be made and sent with utmost discretion, lest it become widely known in the city and the leaders thereof, whether governors or others, become aware. In all cases, discretion is beloved, save with those who are guided by the lights of God. The Tablets were written and sent after Salman’s arrival. Let them act as they deem wise. And if you yourself should journey somewhere, keep with you a copy of the treatise, that perchance someone may awaken from slumber and inhale the fragrance of God. Otherwise, the Cause is in God’s hands. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. It appears that none have moved with sincerity with you, all following their own desires, save those of pure nature. In any case, all are and shall be visible before God. Be not grieved in any way. I am much perplexed as to what to mention. In all conditions, trust in God is most beloved of all. Verily unto God do all matters return. It would be well if it reached Jinab-i-Rida in Yazd, and likewise in the Land of Kha and elsewhere. It is surely best to guard yourself from association with certain people, and this is most beloved before God. Act with utmost wisdom. Whatever is destined shall come to pass. A copy of the Tablet of Haji Kamal is in the aforementioned portions. Deliver it to him. Beware that thou grieve not over anything, but put thy trust in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Consider carefully and act upon what was previously sent and this Tablet. This servant hath been struck with utter bewilderment at all these new developments and hath settled in this prison. Perchance God will thereby bring about some matter. I have suspended the sending of the treatise in view of recent developments at this hour […]</p>
<p>A separate Tablet was sent for Haji Kamal and a special Tablet was also sent to the custodian. If you become certain that he will not mention it to anyone, you may give it to him or read it to him, but keep the original. If it becomes known in that land among the rulers that writings are being sent from this land, great harm would befall this imprisoned servant. Salman will explain the details of this matter. In all conditions, utmost concealment is beloved today. A Tablet was written to Mulla Zaynu’l-Abidin and some of the people of Sad, which Salman himself will deliver, and likewise to Kalimiy-i-Fath. However, a Tablet written to Mulla Rida is in your package - deliver it through whomever you deem appropriate. A special prayer was sent for you, but since it mentions some of the friends who have ascended to God in separation, therefore send a copy of it with one circle to the wife of Aqa Muhammad-Rida. Convey sublime mention to all the friends. A special mention has been revealed for all, but we sent copies of some while copies of others are not yet complete, therefore they will be sent later. Mirza Aqa Jan is alone and could not manage it all. Salman will explain the details of this.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be He!</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Say: O people of the earth! Purify your ears for this blessed Word from all that ye have heard, that ye may attain unto that for which ye were created. Today from the blessed Lote-Tree which hath been planted by the hand of divine will in the highest Paradise, this most exalted Word was heard: “By God! That which never appeared since the beginning that hath no beginning hath now been made manifest. Be fair, O concourse of the earth, and be not of the heedless. Arise to attain that which hath passed you by. Soon shall the days pass away and ye shall behold yourselves in manifest loss.”</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Upon thee be My glory! Thou art he who hath united hearts through the Word of thy Lord and hath spoken that which draweth people nigh unto God, the One, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Husayn! We have remembered thee time and again, and have revealed for thee that which consoleth the eyes of them that are nigh. God willing, thou shalt be enkindled with the fire of the love of God and stand firm in service to His Cause. By the lights of the Sun of inner meanings which hath shone forth from the horizon of the prison, in these days man is able to attain an everlasting station, eternal bounty, and perpetual sustenance. The days are passing, and He Who conversed on Sinai is established upon the throne of Revelation. Blessed art thou for having recognized His days, turned to His horizon, and arisen to serve His mighty and glorious Cause.</p>
<p>O Uncle! Fix thy gaze upon the Sun of this most exalted Word which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Supreme Pen: “Whoso is Mine, I shall be with him. There is no doubt in this. The Tongue of Grandeur hath testified to this in this mighty Prison.” Thy mention hath repeatedly flowed from the Tongue. Know thou the station of this most exalted station and preserve it in the name of the Lord of Names. Soon shall that which hath come from nothingness return to nothingness, and those who are nigh shall behold what God, the Lord of all worlds, hath ordained for them. No matter hath ever been or shall ever be hidden from the Most Sublime Vision. Verily your Lord is with you - He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. The reward of every deed is preserved with God. He, verily, is the Preserver, the Strong, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O ’Ata! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens. Some time ago We sent forth from the Treasury of the Supreme Pen precious and sublime pearls that thou mightest rejoice and give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O ’Ata! The Truth, without helper or assistant, is occupied with the remembrance of His loved ones in the Most Great Prison. The hosts which today assist and aid the Cause are goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct, and the commander of these hosts is the fear of God. Say: O servants! Today is the day of mention and praise and the day of service. The ocean of inner meanings is surging, the Sun of Truth is shining - deprive not yourselves. In the name of Truth, shatter the idols of vain imaginings. Strive that perchance ye may attain unto that for which ye were brought from nothingness into being. O ’Ata! Upon thee be My glory! Time and again have We commanded thee to serve the Cause. Arise and say: O people! The Self-Subsisting appeareth before your faces, calling you to the Most Exalted Horizon. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the Most Great Ocean, and beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the Great Announcement. This is the Announcement which the Messenger of God foretold and which He Who conversed with God gave glad-tidings of. Hear My call, then do what thou hast been bidden by the Strong, the Powerful. Thus hath the Tongue spoken, whilst the Wronged One was in evident sorrow.</p>
<p>O Ali! The call of the Wronged One is raised at every hour and the Most Exalted Pen is in constant motion. Beseech the Truth to make ears worthy of this hearing and eyes deserving of beholding these lights. Today, whosoever hath attained unto acceptance is recorded and inscribed in the Crimson Book as one of the people of Baha. The true feast descendeth from the heaven of meanings at every moment, and the everlasting, eternal bounty is manifest before all faces, yet the heedless servants remain veiled and deprived, save whom thy Lord willeth. Give praise unto the Goal of all worlds Who enabled thee to recognize the Hidden and Treasured Name, and beseech Him to assist thee to remain steadfast in this Cause which causeth the limbs of the polytheists to quake and the hearts of the hypocrites to be disturbed. Blessed is the servant whom neither the affairs of the world nor the doubts of the nations have debarred or veiled from the Most Great Name.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Ali! The whole world awaited the Days of God, and all divine Books bear witness unto this truth. Yet when the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of Revelation shone forth from the horizon of the world, all arose in opposition save a few. Even this did not suffice; they pronounced the death sentence upon His most pure blood and uttered from the pulpits of mosques that which caused the eye of justice to weep and the Most Exalted Pen to lament. Reflect upon the words of the former people. They counted themselves the best among all peoples, yet on the Day of Resurrection they were seen as the most debased of all parties. Thus did the Most Exalted Pen raise its shrill voice when the Wronged One was in the evident prison. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Day of God, heard His call, and believed in Him when all on earth turned away, save those whom God protected as a token of His grace - He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who is named Muhammad, who hath quaffed the wine of inner meanings from the hands of bounty and turned unto God when every doubting soul turned away. Verily the fire speaketh in the Lote-Tree and the light speaketh from its horizon, and the Herald calleth betwixt earth and heaven, yet the people are in a strange sleep. The hosts of self and passion have destroyed them, and they perceive it not. Say: O people! Fear the All-Merciful and follow not the imaginings of those who have denied the Day of Judgment. We have sent down the verses and manifested the evidences, yet most of the people remain heedless. Give thanks unto God for this most great favor, that He hath mentioned thee and guided thee unto His straight path. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of them that know.</p>
<p>O Rida! Beseech God to make thee attain unto true contentment. By the Seat of the Most Great Throne! Whosoever attaineth unto that hath attained unto all good. Say:</p>
<p>O my God, O Gracious One, O Merciful One! Thou art that Sovereign by Whose single word existence came into being, and Thou art that Generous One Whom the deeds of Thy servants have not prevented from bestowing, nor held back the manifestations of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee to enable this servant to attain unto that which is the cause of salvation in all worlds. Thou art verily the Powerful, the Mighty, and Thou art indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Hashim! The Most Exalted Pen counseleth and commandeth Its loved ones to that which is the cause of tranquility and peace in the world. Day and night the pearls of wisdom and utterance appear from the treasuries of the Most Exalted Pen. We beseech God not to deprive His servants of this supreme bounty. He is indeed the Bestower, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>O Hasan! Beseech thou the True One to enable thee to build an edifice, whose foundation shall be piety, whose walls shall be divine confirmations, and whose roof shall be fidelity and truthfulness. Every soul who turneth thereunto is remembered in the presence of God and inscribed by the Pen of the Wronged One. Know ye the value of these days and arise to serve His Cause. The grace of God hath seized you and guided you to His right hand. He is the All-Bountiful, Whose generosity hath encompassed the world and Whose munificence hath embraced all who dwell therein.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! The countenance of the Wronged One hath at this hour turned toward thee. Knowest thou Who hath turned unto thee - the Face of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting? And knowest thou Who remembereth thee - He Who was hidden and treasured from time immemorial? The Preserved Tablet of God beareth witness to this. Render thanks unto the Desired One of all worlds, that thou hast attained unto that which no thing past or future can equal. We send greetings unto the loved ones in that land and remind them of the divine verses, that all may attain unto steadfastness and become detached from all else but God.</p>
<p>O Haydar before […] upon thee be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness. In these days the fire of hatred hath been kindled in certain of the people of this city. Whenever the Sun of Divine leave dawneth from the Dayspring of God’s loving-kindness, Ha and Sin […] We grant them leave to proceed together toward the Dayspring of the horizons.</p>
<p>O Name of Bounty! Upon thee be My glory. The letter of ’Andalib - upon him be My glory - which he sent unto thee was presented before the Wronged One and was read by the Most Great Branch, thus attaining the honor of being heard. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid him, to assist him, and to enable him to celebrate His praise and mention, and all that beseemeth His days. Verily, He is the Generous, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Ghulam-’Ali and remember him with Our verses and give him the glad-tidings of Our loving-kindness. We beseech God to aid him in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to open before his face the door of grace and bounty. Verily, He is the Lord of Names and the Ruler of the throne on high and of the dust below. We make mention of his sister and his mother and give them the glad-tidings of God’s grace, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O ’Andalib! We have heard thy call and have answered thee through My perspicuous Book. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Most Sublime Horizon and acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur acknowledged before the creation of the heavens and the earths. Be thou vocal in My Name, soaring in My atmosphere, holding fast unto My cord, and clinging to the hem of My mercy. Thus doth command thee He with Whom is a mighty Book. Beware lest anything whatsoever prevent thee from that which thou hast been bidden by God, the Cleaver of the dawn. Thus hath the ocean revealed the pearls of wisdom and the sun its effulgence and its lights, that thou mayest rejoice and be of them that are thankful.</p>
<p>O Name of Bounty! We have sent down from the heaven of grace and bounty unto every name that was in the books of the righteous ones, as a token of Our favor. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Bountiful. Say:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having turned from the direction of Thy prison toward Thy servants and remembered them with that which nothing whatsoever can equal. I testify that Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Generous. Thy mercy hath preceded all things and Thy grace hath encompassed all. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The glory shining forth from Our presence be upon thee and upon those whom We have mentioned in this wondrous Tablet.</p>

<p>This is what was sent down from the right hand of the Throne to the Name of God, the Most Truthful, the True, the Trustworthy. Upon Him be the Glory of God, the King, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Glorious.</p>
<p>O My remnant! Hear My call from the direction of My Throne, that My fragrances may attract thee to the heaven of My loving-kindness, may detach thee from all else save Me, and teach thee that which is concealed within the scrolls of My knowledge and that which is hidden within the treasuries of My wisdom. By God! Shouldst thou read but one word from the scroll of My Cause, thou wouldst discover the knowledge of all that hath been in the treasuries of My power and all that shall be in the repositories of My might and grandeur.</p>
<p>O thou who bearest My traces! Hear My call and let not the fire of love be quenched in thy longing to attain My presence and thy desire to be united with Me. Be thou so enkindled that the heedless among My servants may be set ablaze and the slumbering ones among My creatures may arise.</p>
<p>O remnant of My family! Hear thou this Call which no one hath ever heard before. By God! None shall ever hear its like hereafter, if thou be of them that comprehend. Know thou that His call unto thee is better for thee than whatsoever hath been created between the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Verily, he that perceiveth not the fragrances of God and remaineth stationary in his place is afflicted with the cold of this world, and thus is he numbered among the patient ones. By My Self and My Beauty, then by My Might and My Grandeur! Whoso perceiveth shall consume himself in love for My sanctified, resplendent, mighty and luminous Self.</p>
<p>We sent thee a garment aforetime, and before that another garment, and through a breath thereof were attracted the realities of the people of the Supreme Concourse and then Our near servants. O thou who bearest My Name! Know that through the fragrances of My garment the Manifestation of the Past arose to praise My Self and sacrificed himself in My path. Look thou in the Bayan that thou mayest find what We have cast upon thee in truth, that the fire of My love may ignite thee, the sun of My beauty illuminate thee, and the winds of My will move thee and bring thee to a station wherein thou shalt not rest save through My remembrance, nor be occupied except with My praise and the proclamation of My Cause amongst all created things.</p>
<p>Hearken unto that which issueth from the mouths of the polytheists who have clung to My words yet were veiled from My Self, who secluded themselves with the names which I created by My word and whereby they objected to Him through Whose will were created the realities of the first and the last ones.</p>
<p>Say: O people, fear God and follow not your desires. Follow your Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Among the idolaters are those who say “This Manifestation hath appeared too soon.” Say: Woe unto you, O concourse of the veiled! And among them are those who say “He is not the Promised One Who was promised to the servants.” This is their transgression against God, the Almighty, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful. Say: If this be not what ye were promised in the Tablets, then wait as did wait the Jews, then the people of the Gospel, then the concourse of the Qur’an. Thus do We make clear unto thee that which shall awaken Our slumbering servants. Say: The Promised One is My Own Self, and were He not My Own Self, by God, He would still circle round Me, and that which hath appeared from Me is My proof, My testimony, and My evidence. Die then in your wrath, O concourse of idolaters! Say: O crimson-clad people, have ye found in the Tablets that if One should come unto you with clear authority, with God’s signs - the Sovereign, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great - and with the clear tokens of God, the Holy, the Most High, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, that ye should not believe in Him? Nay, by His own Self, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate! Naught was revealed in the Bayan save mention of Me, and all that was ordained therein was held within the grasp of My power, as attesteth all that was sent down aforetime unto ’Ali from One mighty and beauteous. Say: Woe unto you, O concourse of idolaters! Ye have denied Him but for Whom the Bayan would not have been revealed, nor would ’Ali have appeared with the truth, nor would the heavens and earths have been created. Say: His purpose was none other than My Self and the dawning of My Manifestation from this luminous and resplendent horizon. Fear God, O people of the Bayan! Oppose not Him Whom all religions have opposed and for Whose grief the denizens of the highest Paradise weep. Ye dwell in your homes while the Ancient Beauty languisheth in a mighty prison. Ye rejoice in that which ye possess while your Lord, the All-Merciful, is in manifest sorrow. Do ye rest in comfort while the Spirit of God is in the hands of His enemies? What aileth you that ye remain at rest? O My Name! God hath not reckoned any more veiled than the people of the Bayan - thus hath His tongue testified from the precincts of His throne of the All-Merciful, that perchance the people may become among the awakened ones. As for thee, purify thyself from all who are in the heavens and on earth, then arise to praise Me and to propagate My Cause. This is better for thee than the worship of both worlds. Beware lest thou overstep the bounds of wisdom and that which thou hast been commanded in all the Tablets, and likewise Our successful servants. Verily, those who spread corruption in the earth and shed blood - these have been heedless of their Lord’s command and are within thick veils.</p>
<p>Say: O people! The Youth hath appeared to bid you unite and to forbid corruption, and thus was I commanded by One mighty and powerful. At the outset of this Revelation We forbade the people to shed blood and then to engage in corruption, yet they cast the command of God behind their backs and committed that which their own selves and desires prompted them to do. By God! They are in manifest error. Say: O people! Whosoever wisheth to oppose anyone, let him first oppose Me. This is dearer to Me, and God is witness to what I say. We have ordained victory through remembrance and utterance; thus was it sent down in the Tablets, were ye of them that know. Soon will the Sovereign come unto you with tablets of fire. Beware thereof and put your trust in God, the Beloved of the worlds. Thus did We inform thee aforetime of the tidings inscribed in preserved tablets of glory, and now We inform thee once again lest thou forget that which thou wert commanded and be of them that are firmly rooted. Arise to the Cause and cast aside all else, for it shall suffice thee against all the worlds. Say: O people! Adorn yourselves with My virtues that the servants may perceive from you the sanctity of My exalted and mighty Self, for through you are manifested the signs of God amongst His servants and the breezes of His Cause waft through the lands. Beware lest ye commit that which would violate the sanctity of God’s Cause among these heedless ones, as committed he whom the concourse of the Bayan took as lord besides God. By God! Through him was the sanctity of the Cause violated, yet he rejoiceth within himself and is of them that perish.</p>
<p>O thou who art named after Me! Be thou enkindled with the fire of God and guide the people through wisdom and utterance to the Law of the All-Merciful. This is a Day the like of which hath never appeared in creation, and wert thou to reflect even less than that, thou wouldst surely testify to that which hath been revealed from the Pen of Glory. Thou art My remnant among My servants. Every possessor of spiritual sense must perceive from thee the fragrance of My garment and enter the divine Egypt. Be not grieved by the grievous trials of this year, for We have, in all the Tablets of protection, foretold the trials of these grievous days, that perchance the servants might not stumble when they appear and be not deprived of the truth. Nevertheless, that which was decreed hath come to pass. Ye must, God willing, remain steadfast in your gaze toward the Cause and be occupied with guiding the people. This is the essence of God’s Cause in this Most Great Day. Blessed are they that attain thereunto! Corruption hath never been, nor shall ever be, loved, especially in this Revelation wherein naught is intended save the unity and concord of the people. Say: O loved ones of God! Your glory hath not been, nor shall ever be, in slaying souls, but rather in quickening souls that are dead. Strive ye that through the incomparable, flowing waters of the Fountainhead of the Everlasting Lord ye may quicken and give life to dead souls. This is the station of them that love God. Beware lest ye transgress beyond it, O concourse of them that are assured!</p>
<p>Then God Himself turned toward your son who was named Ali in Our Most Exalted Kingdom, and addresses him that he may rejoice in the call of his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing: O Ali! Upon thee be My remembrance and My praise and My peace and My mercy, and the glorification of all things at all times. Beware lest thou transgress the bounds of wisdom, for thou art a name among Our most beautiful names in the tablets of mighty glory. Guard thyself, then thy father, for he is My remnant between you and all the worlds. Blessed is he who hears his words in My remembrance and praise, and is guided thereby to the paradise of My Cause and the pavilion of My glory and the tabernacle of My majesty and the Kaaba of My union and the house of My presence and the sanctuary of My grandeur and the mighty, supreme, firm, perfect, transcendent, precious and impregnable fortress of My authority. Blessed art thou, again blessed art thou, for having remained steadfast in a Cause from which all who are in the heavens and earth fled in terror, save those whom God protected through truth and gave to drink from the Kawthar of His knowledge and preserved from the hosts of Satan. Be thankful to thy Lord for this and be in great joy. Then ask Him in all days to aid thee to remain steadfast in His Cause, and this is better than all that hath been and shall be created, wert thou of those who know. And the splendor which hath shone forth from the direction of the throne be upon thee and upon thy father and upon those who are with you among the steadfast handmaidens and servants of God, and praise be to the Beloved of the worlds, Who even now speaketh the truth and uttereth in all things that there is none other God but Me, the Powerful, the Exalted, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>The submission of this servant, the servant of God, is that these verses were revealed from the Kingdom of Command and this is the initial revelation that was sent: O My loved one! Be steadfast in the Cause of the Beloved with such steadfastness as would steady the agitated servants of God. Upon thee be the praise of God and the praise of all things, and the remembrance of this servant, the serving one, the stranger, the imprisoned, the sorrowful. Then upon thy son, whose migration God accepted before his arrival at the court of mighty glory. Upon him be the glory of God and the glory of all the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Comforting, the Compassionate, the All-Forgiving, the Merciful!</p>
<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who hath appeared is verily the Most Exalted Pen, the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, the Most Glorious Horizon, the Manifestation of the Unseen in the Kingdom of Creation, the First Exemplar among nations, the Temple manifested in justice, and the Light shining forth from the horizon of grace. Through Him the ocean of knowledge hath surged in the world, and that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds, hath been made manifest. Blessed is he who hath attained unto this Most Mighty, Most Glorious Day, who hath recognized the Lord of the Beginning and the End, and who hath arisen to serve Him, detached from all else save Him. He is with Me in all My worlds - to this beareth witness My Pen, My Tongue, and the tongues of My commandments and ordinances in this Station which hath been adorned with the lights of the countenance of its Lord, the Manifest, the Luminous, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Thou hast made Me hear thy sighing, thy lamentation, and thy sobs for what hath befallen the loved ones of God and His chosen ones, and thou hast shown Me thy tears for My tribulation and affliction and what thou hast witnessed from My servants whom We created by My Word. O Pen, I testify that thy sorrows in the path of God cannot be reckoned by all the pens of the world nor by the tongues of all nations. Hast thou any joy whereby the hearts of God’s loved ones in His earth and His chosen ones in His lands might rejoice? Tell Me truly, O My Pen, and be not of the silent ones. I testify that thy sorrow in My path is more precious than all joy before God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds, and thy remoteness for My sake was nearer than all nearness - to this testifieth every discerning knower. By thy sighing the Concourse on High hath lamented, and by thy crying out the Maids of Heaven in the Most Exalted Paradise have swooned away. God shall soon bring forth from thy sorrow oceans of joy and gladness. Be thou thankful and among those who praise. Were We to remove the veil from the face of this utterance, thou wouldst behold people hastening toward sorrows in the path of God, the Most High, the Most Great. How many a matter have We concealed as a wisdom from Us, and how many a mention have We withheld the Pen from recording as a grace from Us, and I am verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him whom the heat of God’s love so seized that he became detached from all that he possessed and left his home, making for the Ultimate Goal and the Most Exalted Summit in days wherein agitation had overtaken the dwellers of the Kingdom of Names, and he drank from the cup of hardship and tribulation until he attained the presence of the Lord of all humanity and drank the choice wine of reunion, once in My Name and again in My love and remembrance, and gained the presence of the Wronged One in this Prison which hath been named by the Most Exalted Pen with all names.</p>
<p>O Ali! O thou who gazeth upon My face and circleth around Me! Thou hast heard the gloating of the enemies in My path and witnessed the turning away of the servants in their love for Me. How many an evening wert thou consumed by the fire of separation from Me, and how many a dawn didst thou hear abuse from Mine enemies. I testify that thou didst leave thy homeland and choose exile out of thy longing for My beauty and thy desire to attain My presence. Thou didst journey through the lands of exile - at one time thou wert with Me in the Most Great Prison, and at another time in another land, and from every land through which thou didst pass, all those possessed of a sense of smell could detect the fragrance of thy love for God, thy Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in earth and heaven.</p>
<p>O Ali! Thou didst dwell in Khartoum while the Self-Subsisting remembers thee from the prison with a melody unto which the ears of all things have been attracted. Blessed is he who hath heard the melody of the Wronged One when He makes mention of him who hath turned unto Him, set his face towards His horizon, soared in His atmosphere, circled round His will, submitted to His sovereignty, acted according to what He hath commanded in His Book, attained the streams of wisdom when he presented himself at His gate, and was illumined when gazing upon His countenance. O Ali! How many an eventide wert thou agitated like a fish upon the dust through separation from thy Lord, the Lord of the Final End, and how many a dawn wert thou disturbed like one stung in thy remoteness from the seat of thy Lord’s throne, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. O Ali! Where are thy sighs in separation and where thy tears in yearning? Where is thy standing at the gate and where thy submissiveness and thy call at the final end? Hath the breeze of thy life been cut off from the world, or hath the whistling of the Bird of Inner Meanings attracted thee to the Supreme Companion? Thou didst choose exile out of longing for the All-Glorious Homeland and accepted abasement for the exaltation of thy Lord’s Cause, the Lord of all creation. O Ali! We were with thee in thy journeys until they ended in the land named Khartoum, where thou didst encounter what was ordained for thee by the irrevocable, predetermined decree.</p>
<p>O Khartoum! Know thou the station of him who came unto thee, then honor his resting-place, by command of God, thy Lord. Thus hath the Wronged One commanded, Who speaketh in every condition that there is none other God but Me, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. We testify that thou didst sacrifice thy spirit in the prime of youth and the freshness of life for God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Signs. Blessed is he who hath visited thee and made mention of thee through that which hath been sent down from the heaven of thy Lord’s will. Thou art he whom the affairs of creation did not prevent from the Truth. Thou didst cast away vain imaginings and hasten to the ocean of certitude, the station wherein the Tongue of Grandeur speaketh that whereby every mouldering bone is quickened. Thou art he who turned, who attained, who took and drank the choice wine of immortality in the name of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, when all in the kingdom of creation turned away save whom God, the Lord of the Hereafter and of the former times, did wish. Blessed is he who remembereth thy days and visiteth thy grave through that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of Utterance from God, thy Lord, the Most Merciful. The days and nights shall pass away, and all that is seen and witnessed shall perish, but thy remembrance shall endure in the Book of God, the Just, the Wise.</p>
<p>O Ali! The Lord of creation remembers thee in the prison of Akka that thou mayest hear it in the Supreme Companion with the chosen ones of God and His sincere ones. Thus have My tongue and My Pen remembered thee as a grace from Us upon thee and upon those who heard and answered God, the Lord of the worlds. The glory shining forth from the Most Exalted Pen be upon thee and upon those who remember thee through this Tablet from which the sincere ones perceive the fragrance of My tenderness and My loving-kindness that hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of his father who turned his face toward his Lord and circled round the Throne for successive years, and was named Abdul-Rahim in the presence of God, the Lord of the worlds. O My servant Abdul-Rahim! Rejoice in that the Wronged One remembereth thee in His mighty prison and acknowledgeth for thee that which all the treasures of the earth cannot equal. The Tongue of God, the Speaking, the All-Knowing, beareth witness to this. We have remembered thee and then those whom God hath related unto thee, as a favor from Us upon thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Remember then the handmaiden who turned to God until she came to this mighty, impregnable Prison, and attained the lights of the Throne and acknowledged what was uttered by the Tongue of God, the Mighty, the Wise. Then remember his brother, who was named Muhammad in the Kingdom of Names and turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon, this station from which shone forth the lights of the countenance of his Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. O Muhammad! I bear witness that thou hast turned to the Intended One and attained that which was inscribed in the Scriptures and Tablets by the Pen of God, Lord of the mighty Throne. This remembrance shall be with thee in every world of the worlds of thy Lord. Rejoice thou and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>O My Pen! Bear witness that thou hast remembered the chosen ones of God and His loved ones who circled round the Throne of thy Lord at dawn and at eventide. We bid thee remember his other brother who was named Hussein, to whom was entrusted the polishing of the pages whereon were inscribed, at morn and at eventide, the verses of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. And We bid thee remember his other brother who was named Ahmad, who chose exile that he might engage in that which was commanded in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Thou art in Alif and Sin, and the Wronged One remembereth thee from His luminous station. Then remember his sister who believed and attained the honor of circumambulation in days wherein men and women turned away, save whom God, the Almighty, the Powerful, wished. Blessed art thou and she who is related to thee and he who was named Abdul-Hussein, then those who attained this station and drank the choice wine of reunion from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the Munificent, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O my God, my Lord, my Master and my Hope! I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou didst subdue the servants and all who are in the lands, and through which appeared the ocean of Thy wisdom and wafted the fragrance of Thy loving-kindness and flowed the river of Thy mercy, to pour forth upon them patience from Thee, then ordain for them what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who cast the world behind them, turning unto Thee and hastening to the ocean of Thy bounty. Then send down upon them from the heaven of Thy Will a blessing from Thee and mercy from Thy presence. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp is the kingdom of creation. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>Then behold, O my God, with the glances of Thy loving-kindness, him who was named Abdullah, whom Thou didst send to one who loved Thee that he might be a companion to him in the lands of exile and a helper in times of hardship and distress. O Lord! Inscribe for him the recompense of his deed in the Crimson Scroll wherein was recorded that which was hidden from eyes. O Lord! Aid him through Thy confirmations to act in accordance with that which was commanded during his presence before Thee. O Lord! He is the one who followed Thy binding command and turned toward the prison wherein Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones were imprisoned through that which the hands of the oppressors had wrought, and the heedless made them captives in Thy kingdom and took them until they brought them to that distant place. O Lord! They are the ones who took the cup of tribulation in Thy love and drank therefrom out of longing for Thy beauty. O Lord! Aid them through the manifestations of Thy victory and ordain for them that which shall gladden the eyes of Thy loved ones. Verily Thou art He Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate from that which Thou hast willed through Thy power. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And praise be to Thee, O God of the worlds and Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earths.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>The Kingdom of praise and the Dominion of glorification beseemeth the sovereign Lord Who, neither by the might of the world nor by its pomp and power, was deterred from that which He purposed. Through one Word He gathered all together, and through another Word He distinguished truth from error. Through the blessed Word “I am the Beloved” He attracted the hearts and souls of them that are nigh unto Him and are sincere, in such wise that each one, detached from all else, turned unto the place of sacrifice. And through the Word “I am the Ever-Present” He preserved all, that they might drink from the ocean of reunion and attain unto the Kawthar of His presence. Exalted be His power and magnified His bounty! He is the Source and unto Him shall all return. The beginning of all things hath been from Him, and unto Him shall be the return of all. Well is it with them who, in this Day, are stirred by the breezes of God’s Will, glorified be His majesty, and who submerge their own will in the Will of God, exalted be His glory. This station is and shall ever be the most exalted of all stations.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou in Whose grasp is the Kingdom of utterance and in Whose right hand is the Empire of knowledge! I beseech Thee by the rustling of the breezes of Thy springtime of bounty, and by the murmuring of the waters whereby Thou didst bestow life upon the people of Thy dominion, to ordain from Thy Most Exalted Pen for the people of Baha that which shall gladden their eyes, rejoice their hearts, and tranquilize their souls. And protect them from the arrows of allusions and the darts of doubts. O Lord! Illumine their hearts with the lights of Thy knowledge, then dilate their breasts in Thy days. O Lord! Thou art He Whom nothing whatsoever frustrateth and no affair hindereth. Take Thou, through Thy grace, the hands of all created things, O Thou the Possessor of Names and Creator of heaven! There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter was received and at one time was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Presence. This is what the Tongue of our Lord, the Bestower, spoke in reply, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>He is sanctified above the mention of what hath been and what shall be.</p>
<p>O Hasan! The mention of all the friends hath flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful’s bounty, and all created things have testified and do testify to the grace, loving-kindness and mercy of God, exalted be His glory. He Who is the All-Knowing beareth witness that God’s grace and mercy have at all times encompassed His loved ones. Strive ye now to preserve your stations through the Name of the Lord of Names. Be ye enkindled with the fire of His love and illumined by the light of His countenance. This is the Day of service and steadfastness. Blessed is he who hath sought your presence and attained unto your company. Today and always, teaching the Cause hath been and shall be the paramount duty, that perchance steadfast souls may become the cause of strength and power to those who are weak. Likewise, service to the Cause hath been and is service to the friends of God. It behoveth you to honor their dwelling. God willing, may the loved ones of God and His chosen ones speak for His sake, arise for His sake, and fix their gaze upon Him. By the fragrant breezes of the All-Merciful’s utterance! Were the station of but one steadfast and firm soul to be made manifest on earth, all would be thunderstruck by its greatness and the radiance of its effulgence, save whom God willeth. God willing, may ye spread the wings of detachment and soar in the atmosphere of inner meanings with the melody of the divine Bird. Today, words that are as spirits for books have appeared from the Dayspring of God’s Will; yet all remain heedless save those souls who have turned with the eye of fairness and attained His presence. We send Our greetings upon thee and upon those with thee, and upon My loved ones in those regions who have observed the rights of God and His Cause, and acted according to that which was revealed in His perspicuous and decisive Book. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The tokens of God’s favor, exalted be His glory, are manifest and evident as the sun. Blessed are they who have not deprived themselves and have taken their portion from the ocean of utterance. Likewise, for each of the names mentioned in your letter, decisive verses of God have been revealed. God willing, may all drink from the ocean of knowledge and be illumined by the sun of wisdom. His word, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>In His Name, the Manifest, the Hidden</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Hasan! The Wronged One Who hath come from the heaven of command with the banners of verses remembereth thee, He Who hath called all to the Dayspring of Revelation Who hath appeared and manifested whatsoever He desired with power and sovereignty. Blessed is he who hath cast away idle fancy and followed that which was ordained by God, the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust below. He is indeed of the people of Baha in the Scriptures and Tablets. How many who were standing have sat down in the fear of God, and how many who were seated have arisen in His Name, the Protector of all horizons. This is a Day whereon the breeze of God hath wafted and the fragrance of His mercy hath been diffused amongst the peoples. Beware lest the croaking deter thee from the divine nectar. Leave thou the former and take the latter, through this remembrance before which all necks have bowed in submission.</p>
<p>He is the One dawning from the horizon of Manifestation […]</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali! The Countenance of the Ancient One hath turned toward thee from the precincts of His Most Great Prison and mentioneth thee in such wise as no mind hath comprehended nor eye hath witnessed. Hold fast unto the cord of God’s Cause and take His Book with the strength that proceedeth from Him. Beware lest the company of the malicious hinder thee from God, the Almighty, the All-Loving. We have sent down the verses and manifested the evidences, yet the people do not understand. They have cast the Book of God behind their backs, following every heedless and veiled one. We have at all times called all men unto God; among them are those who turned away from Us, and those who objected and pronounced judgment against Us with such injustice as caused the dwellers of the highest Paradise to lament, yet most of the people know not. We call them to the Water of Life, while they hasten toward extinction; We send down for them the heavenly table, while they turn to every dead thing. Thus have their souls enticed them, and they are numbered among the dead in the Book of God, the Subduer, the Self-Subsisting. Glory be upon thee, upon thy spouse, and upon all who have turned toward God, the Lord of existence.</p>
<p>He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing</p>
<p>O Abu-Talib! The Desired One hath come for the salvation of the world, yet the peoples have turned away and disbelieved in God, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Known One hath appeared, yet every learned one hath denied Him, violated God’s Covenant and His Testament, and cast aside His perspicuous Book. By God! The Recognized One hath come, yet every mystic hath turned away from Him, following vain imaginings and doubts like every immoral doubter. This is the Day wherein the Most Great Book speaketh and summoneth all unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. O people of Baha! Rejoice that the Lord of Names remembereth you with verses that surpass all that the kings and rulers possess. Cling to the hem of your Lord’s loving-kindness and hold fast to His firm cord.</p>
<p>He is the Helper, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O Zaynu’l-’Abidin! We counsel thee and My loved ones with that whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds, may be exalted. We enjoin upon you trustworthiness, which God hath made the crown of all deeds. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Through truthfulness shall your stations be made manifest among the peoples, as attested by Him Who possesseth a mighty Book. Blessed is he who hath cast away vain imaginings and attained unto that which was commanded by God, the One, the All-Seeing. O loved ones of the All-Merciful in all lands! Hearken unto the scratching of My Pen and that which My Tongue uttereth in My Kingdom. Verily, it will draw you nigh unto God, the Lord of this resplendent Day. Cast away what the people possess and take what is with God, thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Mulla Rida of Qamsar</p>
<p>He is the Proclaimer between Earth and Heaven</p>
<p>O Rida! The Wronged One hath heard thy call and hath turned toward thee, mentioning thee with that which shall immortalize thy name as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. Say: O peoples of the earth! Beware lest the breezes of chastisement prevent you from this sweet and flowing Water, this mighty and beloved Stream. Cast behind you the barkings of the dogs and take what ye are commanded by God, the Manifestation of what was and what shall be. O Rida! Convey to the people of Baha that which the Lord of Names hath uttered, that it may attract them to the praiseworthy station. We counsel them to manifest supreme steadfastness in this Cause, whereby the limbs of humanity have trembled, and We give them glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for them in My preserved Tablet. The Glory shining from the horizon of the will of the Creator of Heaven be upon thee and upon those whom the gestures of creation have not hindered from the Truth, who have cast aside what the people possess, hoping for that which is with their Lord, the Possessor of the Seen and Unseen.</p>
<p>He is the Expositor, the All-Wise</p>
<p>O Zaynu’l-Abidin! The Day of Judgment has come, yet the people have turned away from God, the True Sovereign, the Manifest, the Just. They have broken the Covenant and denied this Dawning Light - verily, they are among the losers in a mighty Book. We came for their salvation, yet they have pronounced judgment against Us with such tyranny as caused the sighs of the Prophets to ascend and the tears of those near unto God to fall. We make known to them that which profits them, yet they have risen to harm Us - to this testifies every discerning sage. Grieve not at anything, but put thy trust in God, the One, the All-Informed. Soon shall the world and all that is therein perish, and sovereignty shall remain with the Strong, the Mighty. Blessings be upon the people of Baha who have acted in accordance with that which they were bidden by the Ancient Commander. We make mention of My maidservants who were not deterred by the clamor of the people - they heard and responded to the Lord of this mighty, exalted Cause. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The praise be to God that the friends of God have attained unto the sweet savors of the utterances of the All-Merciful. God willing, may they occupy themselves with the remembrance of God in perfect unity and harmony, and arise to that which will exalt His Cause. This evanescent servant conveys greetings and salutations to all, and gives them the glad-tidings of God’s grace, exalted be His glory. No bounty is greater than this bounty - this is the heavenly feast which is reserved for steadfast and upright souls. Blessed is he who has attained on this Day of God, and woe unto him who has turned away from Him. Glory be upon you and upon them and upon every sincere and faithful seeker. Praise be to God, the Lord of this mighty Day.</p>

<p>In His Name, exalted be His glory, Wisdom and Utterance!</p>
<p>O people of the Caucasus! The Sacred Vale hath flowed, and the Most Exalted Horizon hath shone forth. By My life! The countenance of the Hijaz hath beamed with joy, for the Tabernacle of Glory hath been raised upon God’s holy mount, and the Luminary of Manifestation hath shone forth from the horizon of the Divine Will, after the veils of majesty were rent asunder by the Finger of Power. This is the Day wherein all contingent beings have been intoxicated by the wine of divine utterance. Rejoice and be glad, for the divine fragrance hath wafted, the Call hath been raised, and the luminous Standard hath been hoisted upon the Crimson Spot. The Temple of Knowledge hath been established upon the Throne of Utterance, summoning all unto God, the Lord of Religions. Ye have attained unto the Day foretold by God’s Messengers and His chosen ones, and promised in the Books of God, the Lord of lords. No Messenger hath there been who hath not spoken His praise, and no Prophet who hath not mentioned Him at morn and eventide. This is the Day wherein all things have been attracted by the Call of God, the Lord of Names, and have spoken that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken: “The Kingdom is God’s, the One, the Chosen!” He that hath ears is he who hath heard and responded, and he that hath eyes is he who hath beheld the Most Great Sign when the horizon of the Manifestation was illumined, and the limbs of all beings trembled with fear of God, the Lord of Creation.</p>
<p>O people of the Caucasus! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He hath turned toward you and remembered you with verses that cause bodies to take flight. The ocean of bounty surgeth before the faces of the world and its peoples, yet they remain heedless and astray, save those whom the hands of power have rescued from God, the Lord of all men.</p>
<p>O concourse of divines! Fear ye God, and deny not Him Who hath come from the heaven of grace and bounty with verses that all the treasures of earth cannot equal. To this beareth witness the Mother Book from its most exalted station. Be fair in your judgment by God, and follow not idle fancies and vain imaginings. This is the Day wherein the veils of glory were rent asunder by the Finger of Power, and that which had been hidden from eternity was made manifest.</p>
<p>O concourse of divines! Hear ye the call of the Wronged One. He remindeth you, for the sake of God, of that which will draw you nigh unto Him. He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. He desireth naught from you. He proclaimeth among you with the most exalted call and remindeth you of this Day wherein mankind hath arisen for their Lord, the Lord of all beings. We have appeared and made manifest the Way, and have opened the gate of the Most Exalted Paradise. Draw nigh with radiant hearts. Thus doth He counsel you Who hath come with the truth from the kingdom of utterance with the standards of verses.</p>
<p>O concourse of men! The Most Great Vision hath appeared and the Lord of Destiny is established upon the throne of His Most Great Name. Fear ye God and follow not every heedless doubter. We have spent what We possessed and have borne all hardships for your ascent by the ladder of detachment unto the Lord of Creation. Such tribulations and afflictions have befallen Us as the pens are powerless to recount. The world hath been adorned with the sweet savors of revelation while the people are in a wondrous sleep. When Power displayed its standards and the Manifestation unfurled its banner, the people objected. Some said He hath fabricated a lie against God, while others arose in opposition that caused the earth to lament and the mountains to crumble. By God’s life! We have desired naught save to draw the servants nigh unto that which will profit them and adorn them with the ornament of virtuous deeds. We have, in all circumstances, held fast the reins of the Pen and have revealed from its treasures only in due measure. Sanctify your souls through that which hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen, and adorn them with trustworthiness, chastity, justice and patience.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of divines! Do ye reject Him Who hath come from the heaven of divine command with the hosts of wisdom and utterance? He desireth naught but to purify hearts and sanctify them from the fire of rancor and hatred. Thus have We been assailed by that whereat even stones have cried out. This is the Day wherein the earth and heaven were shaken by the breezes of revelation, and all things have spoken as did speak the Tongue of Grandeur in the beginning of days.</p>
<p>O people of the Caucasus! There hath come unto you one named ’Abdu’l-Karim who hath informed you of this Mystery, through whose mention hearts have been attracted and through whose departure livers have melted. He had indeed held fast to the cord of My providence and clung to the hem of his Lord’s mercy, the Lord of all mankind. Beware lest the people’s doubts keep you from My Self-Subsisting Name, or the world’s might frighten you in this Cause whereby the hearts of the wicked have been agitated. Deprive not yourselves of the Most Great Ocean which surgeth before the faces of the world, and deny not Him through Whom the Spirit of God hath wafted and proclaimed: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the All-Forgiving!” By God! This is the Day of ears, for they were created to hearken unto My call, and the Day of eyes, for they were formed to behold My horizon wherefrom the lights have shone forth. Beware lest the clamor of the world withhold you from the Ancient Lord. Cast away what the people possess, turning unto the lights of your Lord’s countenance, the Lord of Return. By God! The Light hath shone forth from the horizon of Revelation, and He Who conversed on Sinai hath spoken, and the mountains have passed away like the passing of clouds.</p>
<p>O concourse of divines! Fear ye God and withhold not the servants from the Euphrates of wisdom and utterance. Judge with fairness concerning that which hath appeared through the truth, and follow not every bloodthirsty oppressor. The teeth of utterance have smiled with proof, and knowledge hath spoken: “The All-Knowing One hath come with power and sovereignty!” Cast away your learning, for the Luminary of Knowledge hath dawned from the horizons of scriptures and tablets. This is a Day wherein the Call hath been raised from all directions, for the sacred lands have been honored by the advent of Him Who hath come from the heaven of grace with wisdom and utterance. Thus have We adorned the heaven of knowledge with the stars of proof and tablets through the ornament of My Most Exalted Pen, whose cry, when raised, caused the Lote-Tree of the uttermost boundary to proclaim: “Glory be to God, the Lord of dominion over all who are in earth and heaven!”</p>
<p>Hear ye the call of the Lord of Names in the Persian tongue in its sweetest melody. He is the Living Waters and He is the Breath of the All-Merciful that guideth them who turn unto Him to the Most Exalted Paradise and assigneth them their station and abode beneath the pavilions of grandeur. Blessed is the ear that hath not been deprived of hearing the call, and blessed is the eye that the veils of the world have not prevented from beholding.</p>
<p>O people of the Caucasus! Hearken unto the Voice of the Wronged One. This is that Voice for the hearing of which the peoples of the world have been brought into being from nothingness. Today the rustling of the Most Exalted Pen is raised, and the Divine Lote-Tree hath appeared with its delicate, precious fruits. Deprive not yourselves of the celestial feast of God. Strive that ye may perchance attain in this transient world unto stations that are everlasting. The lamp of the world is knowledge, and its light is understanding. Beseech ye God that He may enable you to achieve that which will exalt the Word of God. Glory be to God! Some who account themselves foremost in knowledge and wisdom are found to be utterly bereft of that which is meet and proper. The purpose of knowledge is that which leadeth to the preservation, development, reformation and benefit of the peoples of the world. Sciences, crafts and arts are the fruits of the human tree; without the tree no fruit can be found. The manifestation of these cometh after its existence. Blessed is the soul that is not content merely to hear, that doth not accept every speaker, and is not assured by every newcomer. Should anyone, concerning any party, say or write that which would cause abasement and harm, even if he were an ocean of knowledge, he would possess neither worth nor station in the eyes of them that see. A place wherein naught but goodness hath been manifested - concerning it they have uttered that which is unworthy to mention.</p>
<p>O people of the world! The fruit of the human tree is justice and fairness. If it be devoid of this fruit, it is worthy of the fire. Pride hath blinded their eyes and their insight. The world is in need of two things: order and justice. Verily, kingdoms have need of a system to protect them and justice to cultivate them. Thus doth the Wronged One teach you from the precincts of the prison, a command from His presence - and He is the Truth, the All-Knowing of the unseen.</p>
<p>O people of learning! Know your own selves and vaunt not yourselves over mankind. Be not like those who exchanged the favor of God for unbelief and led their people to the abode of perdition. Learn ye that knowledge which will preserve you from rancor and hatred, from greed and passion, and will lead you to supreme joy. The noblest, most excellent, most eminent and greatest of all things in the world is knowledge - knowledge that giveth salvation, not destruction. This knowledge is the most precious of all things in the world and the most glorious thereof. To this testifieth He Who speaketh that He hath come with the truth and guided all to the straight path of God.</p>
<p>The honored Abdul-Karim was a sign of this Most Great Revelation and like the morning breeze wafted from the direction of divine favor. He was, of his own accord, set ablaze with the fire of love for this Revelation, and from the ocean of knowledge a portion was bestowed upon him. This was from God’s grace upon him. However, from some of his utterances the purpose was not clear, meaning some of the friends did not gain full understanding therefrom. Thus hath spoken the Ocean of Utterance from the presence of the All-Merciful in the city of Akka, which was named aforetime the White Spot, and by the most beautiful names in the days of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O people of the Caucasus! In conclusion We counsel you to observe trustworthiness, godliness, chastity, truthfulness and fidelity. In this day, the hosts of God have ever been and are goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. By these hosts give victory to the Cause of God and conquer the citadels of hearts. The sovereign of these hosts is the fear of God. The Truth is aware and knoweth well that this Wronged One hath at all times exhorted God’s loved ones with counsels that lead to success and are the cause of prosperity. He sufficeth as Witness and as Knower. We beseech confirmation for you that ye may discover the sweetness of the warbling of the Most Exalted Pen and be sustained by the fruits of the Ultimate Lote-Tree. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty be upon the people of Baha, through whom the Crimson Ark did sail upon the sea of names - such servants upon whom the Concourse on High and the dwellers of Paradise shower their prayers both at eventide and at dawn.</p>

<p>His Eminence Aqa Siyyid ’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God</p>
<p>5 Jamadi’l-Avval 1300</p>
<p>He is God–exalted be His station, the Most Great, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>All praise be unto God alone, and blessings be upon Him after Whom there shall be no Prophet. Praise befitteth the Desired One of the world and the Lord of all nations, Who illumined the world of existence with the Muhammadan Light. He is the Herald of the meeting with divine manifestations on the Day of Resurrection, and He is the Manifestation of the infinite names and attributes. In truth, the knowledge of the world is but a trace of His knowledge, and the understanding of nations is but a fruit of the Tree of His understanding. The appearance and continuance of the world hath been and is through His blessed existence. Who is capable of describing Him as He deserves to be described, and who can praise Him as befitteth His station? The manifest blessings from the horizon of God’s grace be upon Him and upon His family and companions, through whom the throne of Islam was established and the world attained the light of faith. God hath described them in His words: “No fear shall be upon them, neither shall they grieve.”</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter of that beloved one, who thirsteth in separation, bestowed the water of reunion, and granted the cup of nearness and presence to the seeker of His meeting. Praise be to God, the bounty of love hath flowed and descended from the heaven of the grace of the friends of Truth. God willing, may this grace remain eternal and enduring. After its reading and review, when presented before Him, He said: “We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to cause the streams of His knowledge to flow through them, to manifest through them that which will awaken His creation, to ordain for them every good thing which He hath sent down in His Book, to protect them from His enemies, and to aid them to perform pure deeds as He aided them before. He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.”</p>
<p>In all conditions they are remembered and are visible before Our eyes. In the nights and days, one must beseech God, exalted be His glory, to protect His religion and preserve the radiant Faith from the evil of enemies. The darkness of oppression hath encompassed the world of justice. The domains of Islam are observed as a lifeless body fallen upon the earth. Each day a limb thereof is severed by an oppressor or an idolater, and these matters are the fruits of deeds.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseeches the True One, exalted be His glory, and likewise those gentlemen should beseech, that perchance He may grant victory to the oppressed and bring the oppressors to their due requital. He is, verily, powerful and mighty over all things. I convey greetings to the friends of that land and implore confirmation and success for each one. God willing, may they be illumined by the light of harmony and unity, and be ever gazing toward the highest horizon. All are remembered before His Presence and are sustained by His special favors. Happy are they! Praise be to God, the path is clear and the field is vast. The horsemen in the arena of love, fellowship, kindness and unity may gallop as they please. This is the Day of utterance; we must make up for what was lost - that is, whatever was delayed and prevented by numerous obstacles. May the Spiritual Luminary shine forth from the heaven of acceptance and inner meanings, adorning the world of gloom and sorrow with the lights of joy. Though indeed the letter of that beloved one was like a swift-winged bird, seemingly moving with the wings of yearning or the pinions of eagerness and attraction, accompanied by a world of gladness and joy - its joy enabled this subdued one to offer praise and thanksgiving. If the people of the world were to discover the station of true love, by the life of the Intended One, all would engage in this trade, and its profit would fill the treasuries of earth and heaven. What benefit is there when they are heedless and submerged in the sea of regrets, cares and sorrows? The wonder is that even their abundant wealth has become the cause of their distress and anxiety. Their wealth is their enemy, yet day and night they strive to acquire this enemy, unaware. Were they to receive but a particle of the lights of spiritual manifestations, they would behold themselves at all times, in this world and the next, in the highest paradise. Their desires have prevented them from witnessing the lights, and their ornaments have occupied them from recognizing the mysteries. In any case, I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to awaken all and make them aware, that they may attain to that which is befitting.</p>
<p>Your beloved one’s attention to the region of Egypt has yielded desirable results, for that beloved one turned from this direction - indeed you were a gift to the friends of that land and crystal water for the saplings of the spiritual garden. The mention of that honored one’s journey and hardships, from the acquisition of the palm tree and its details, and the visitation of God’s saints - all were presented before His presence. This is what the Tongue of Utterance hath spoken. In the Name of God, the Helper, the Single, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>We send greetings to the friends in that land and seek confirmation for them, and we beseech God to grant them all a share from the incomparable pure water of the Kawthar of divine knowledge and bestow upon them a portion from the ocean of utterance. Praise be to God, the door of His grace has ever been and will forever remain open, and His straight path is clear and manifest, though hidden from unseeing eyes. Today an eye is needed that is sanctified from the veils of men and purified from the dust of vain imaginings, and an ear is needed that is detached from the world and the clamor of the peoples, that it may hear the call of the true Nightingale and behold the horizon of the manifestation of God’s names and attributes. No ocean can equal a drop of the recognition of this Day, and no works of past ages can compare with an atom of deeds performed therein.</p>
<p>How excellent is the state of one who has raised the banner of trust in God and emptied his heart of all remembrance save that of God. Every hour, every minute, nay every moment, it proclaims in most eloquent utterance: “O friends on earth! Know ye my station and recognize my worth. Strive that ye may not lose that which ye would be powerless to regain. Hold fast to the cord of grace and cling to the hem of justice. Should there come upon you at times that which causes grief and sorrow, be not dismayed, and soil not the luminous heart with the dust of sadness. Whatever the All-Wise Wisdom requires is pure good and sheer bounty. Ere long that which has flowed from the Pen of counsel of the Wronged One shall become evident and manifest.</p>
<p>The whole world has been created for the Most Great Luminary, that is, God, exalted be His glory, and all tongues confess and acknowledge this truth. Nevertheless, all are heedless save whom God willeth. Heedlessness has reached such a stage that an ignorant one among the ignorant of the earth has exerted his utmost effort to extinguish the light of divine knowledge and quench the fire of the divine Lote-Tree. He is not the first to arise to extinguish the Light. Reflect upon the earliest ages - the manifestations of tyranny and pride have ever endeavored to extinguish the light, but God made manifest what He desired despite their opposition, and made them among the most lost in His perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>The oppressor seeks victory over Us through the force of hosts, while We seek victory over him through the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the Almighty. That which caused sorrow has befallen some of the friends in that land - let them not be saddened. Soon will they witness the favor of their Lord and attain what they have missed. To this testifies He Who has acknowledged the oneness and singleness of God and has spoken in all conditions that there is none other God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Out of wisdom We have not mentioned names - soon will God open the doors of good things to the faces of His loved ones. Verily, He is the Answerer of prayers. There is none other God but Him, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>O loved ones of the All-Merciful! Soar in the atmosphere of the love of God. Beware lest anything deter you. Cast away that with which the people are occupied and take what ye have been commanded by an All-Wise Ordainer. And peace and blessings be upon the Messengers, and praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>The services rendered by that honored one and the attention of that beloved one have been and will continue to be accepted deeds, and their reward rests with God, exalted be His glory. Moreover, you yourself have a share in that small plot. In every place and location where a sapling or tree is planted, God is witness that it has been and continues to be planted with the intention of the loved ones, in remembrance of the loved ones, for the sake of the loved ones, for the joy of the loved ones, and for the gaze of the loved ones. It is known and evident that there is no purpose other than this. The crown of deeds is that which is performed for God and His loved ones.</p>
<p>You had written that one day when we received the envelope from the post office and were going to visit the honored Munis-i-Ruhani, the sealed wine was still in the ruby. Such a state overtook me that I said to Munis, “If the government were to arrest the truly intoxicated ones, we would all be in prison every week.” Would that this blessed intoxication might be attained by souls and they might dwell in prison their whole lives! This cup is not destined for everyone, and not every soul is worthy of this station. However, we beseech God’s grace and His infinite bounties that He may intoxicate the whole world with the Kawthar of recognition and make them known and recognized in the gathering of the world by the name of God, exalted be His glory. Though there is a profound difference between the station of creation and this station, nothing is difficult for the generous ones.</p>
<p>The mention of the honored Mirza Hamshirah-zadih, upon him be God’s peace, brought joy. God is witness that he and the other gentlemen are ever before my eyes. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for the good of this world and the next for each one of them. Verily, He has power over all things. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings.</p>

<p>O honored one, his eminence the Afnan, the venerable Haji Mirza Buzurg, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, may he take note.</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified beyond mention and utterance, befitteth the Lord of all possibility, Who from agitation brought forth tranquility, and from tumult created assurance. He illumined the horizons of the world with the light of His Revelation and adorned it with the ornament of His grace. He is the Speaker on Sinai, the Hidden Secret, and the Treasured Mystery mentioned and recorded in the divine Books of the past and present. In the midst of tribulations He raised the standard of utterance, and in the center of hardship and adversity He hoisted the banner of steadfastness. Before the faces of the world, without veil or covering, He summoned all to the Lord of all beings. He rent asunder the veils and tore away the coverings until the eyes of those who were ready beheld His presence and the hearts of the knowing ones were adorned with the ornament of wisdom. Glorified be His majesty, mighty be His proof, and exalted be His utterance! He guided the lost and bestowed the Kawthar of knowledge upon the ignorant. The world’s abasement diminisheth not His glory, nor can the might of nations hold back His will. But today the seeing one attaineth, and the informed one witnesseth, even as He hath said: “Verily, those who have been given insight from God, these are they who see with His eyes and witness what God Himself hath witnessed before the creation of the heavens and earth.”</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Mystery of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen! I bear witness that through Thy most exalted Word the ocean of utterance surged within creation, and through Thy Will the Dove of Paradise warbled upon the highest branches, declaring that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Thou hast ever been sanctified beyond the remembrance of those who remember, the praise of those who praise, and the description of those who describe. Thou wert hidden from the sight of Thy creation and concealed from the eyes of Thy servants. Then, when Thou didst desire to manifest Thyself, Thou didst shine upon the world with a light from the lights of the Orb of Thy Cause, according to a determined measure. Thereupon, the lovers throughout the lands were seized with ecstasy and sought to attain Thy presence and reunion, and the people of the Covenant hastened forth - they whom neither the world’s tribulations nor the oppression of nations could deter. I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, by them and by those who cast aside treasures and riches, seeking Thy most exalted station and Thy loftiest summit, to assist Thy chosen ones to achieve such steadfastness as cannot be shaken by the clamor of the deniers nor the murmuring of the polytheists. O Lord! Thou seest and knowest that this servant desired to make mention of Thy Afnan, whom Thou didst choose for Thy recognition, establish in Thy service, acquaint with Thy path, and distinguish among Thy servants for the exaltation of Thy Word. Thou didst give him to drink from the Kawthar of Thy love and honor him with attaining Thy presence. Praise be to Thee, O my God, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Beloved and my Heart’s Desire, for having ordained for him that which tongues are powerless to recount and enumerate. I beseech Thee to send down upon him from the heaven of Thy bounty, at every moment, a new mercy from Thy presence and a fresh benevolence from Thy side. There is no God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the Hearing, the Answering.</p>
<p>May my spirit be a sacrifice for your steadfastness, your firmness and your service. In these days mention of your honor has repeatedly been made in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, and at this moment these sublime words have been revealed from the Dayspring of special favors for your honor. Blessed and exalted be His Word: “O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory, My favors and My mercy.” My Name Mehdi, upon him be My glory and My favors, was present and made mention of you, and sought bounty and mercy from the Dawning-Place of generosity of the Sovereign of existence. Praise be to God that the ocean of grace is surging and the effulgences of the Sun of favor are manifest and visible. The gaze of the Wronged One has ever been directed towards the Afnan. In days when the world was in upheaval and the fire of hatred and animosity was ablaze in the hearts and souls of the nations, He summoned the servants to the fear of God and to that which would profit them unto all eternity. He mentioned, in clear statements and evident, kindly utterances, those qualities that are the cause of the salvation and exaltation of the servants, that all might hold fast unto them and be preserved from the abasement of self and passion and its evil. Nevertheless some forgot the counsel of God and regarded His Cause as insignificant. Soon shall they behold the recompense of their deeds in this vain life. They shall call for help but none shall help them. They abandoned that which they were commanded to observe and practiced that which was forbidden them. The praiseworthy attributes - their source, their origin, their influence, their operation, and their glory and exaltation - have repeatedly flowed from the Supreme Pen. These exalted words were revealed in one of the Tablets addressed to one of the friends: Say: O My loved ones in My lands! Hearken unto the counsel of Him Who counseleth you for the sake of God. He verily created you and manifested for you that which exalteth you and profiteth you, and taught you His Straight Path and His Mighty Announcement. O Jalil! Counsel the servants to fear God. By God! It is the greatest commander amongst thy Lord’s hosts, and its troops are praiseworthy deeds and an upright character. Through them have the cities of men’s hearts been opened throughout the ages and centuries, and the standards of triumph and victory been raised upon the loftiest poles. We make mention unto thee of Trustworthiness and its position with God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. One day We repaired unto Our Green Island. Upon Our arrival, We found its streams flowing, and its trees luxuriant, and the sunlight playing in their midst. Turning Our face to the right, We beheld what the pen faileth to describe; nor can it set forth that which the eye of the Lord of Mankind witnessed in that most sanctified, that most sublime, that blessed, and most exalted Spot. Turning, then, to the left We gazed on one of the Beauties of the Most Sublime Paradise, standing on a pillar of light, and calling aloud saying: ‘O inmates of earth and heaven! Behold ye My beauty, and My radiance, and My revelation, and My effulgence. By God, the True One! I am Trustworthiness and the revelation thereof, and the beauty thereof. I will recompense whosoever will cleave unto Me, and recognize My rank and station, and hold fast unto My hem. I am the most great ornament of the people of Baha, and the vesture of glory unto all who are in the kingdom of creation. I am the supreme instrument for the prosperity of the world, and the horizon of assurance unto all beings.’ Thus have We sent down for thee that which will draw men nigh unto the Lord of creation.</p>
<p>O Afnan! Upon thee be My Baha and My loving-kindness! In the watches of the night and throughout the days, the Pen of the Lord of all names hath been engaged in admonition and counsel, yet these utterances and words - each like unto a sun in the heaven of existence - have been forsaken, and men cleave instead to their own vain imaginings, each of which is but a gate to abasement and loss. I pour out My grief and sorrow unto thee. Were they, in truth, to observe with the eye of justice and fairness the pearls and gems of counsel that have been revealed from the Treasury of the Most Exalted Pen, they would forsake the world and all that is therein and turn unto these counsels. The days pass like lightning, nay swifter still, while they rejoice in them, heedless and unmindful of the eternal realms. I beseech God to grant the world of existence understanding, that all may become aware of that which harmeth them and that which profiteth them, and that they may hold fast unto the divine commandments and ordinances which are the cause and means of protecting existence, preserving souls, exalting the Word, and elevating their stations.</p>
<p>The Afnan too must, in all conditions, awaken some of the heedless souls. To enjoin what is right beseemeth the Afnan who are adorned with the ornament of distinction. However, this must be done with wisdom, lest the clamor of every malicious enemy and every stubborn polytheist be raised. We have ordained that every matter be resolved through consultation, and this binding decree hath repeatedly flowed from the Most Exalted Pen in Scriptures and Tablets. Nevertheless, some act without consultation, rather in mere obedience to self and passion, doing that which hath been and is the cause of grief to God’s loved ones. The True One hath ever loved the name “Concealer”; despite His knowledge and all-encompassing awareness, He concealeth and will conceal. He is the Concealer. He hath commanded all to observe sublime concealment, and He is the All-Patient, and hath commanded His servants to practice beautiful patience.</p>
<p>Let your honor beseech God to aid His servants in that which pleaseth Him. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Praise be to God! From the earliest days thou wert blessed to attain and didst arise to serve the Cause. This testimony of the Most Exalted Pen is preserved and immortalized in God’s Book. By the life of God! Were this most exalted station to be unveiled, all would sacrifice their lives in pursuit thereof. To this doth testify He with Whom is the Mother Book. The Glory that is manifest, evident, and shining from the horizon of the heaven of God’s Will be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who love thee and hearken unto thy words concerning this Most Great Cause and Mighty News.</p>
<p>It is ended. His is the praise and the glory, and His is the laudation and the splendor. His grace hath encompassed His Afnan, and the Sun of His bounty hath so brilliantly shone forth that its light hath taken hold of the world. In each of His verses there is concealed an ocean, and from every letter floweth a river. This evanescent servant ever beseecheth the Self-Subsisting One to ordain for each of your honor’s deeds and remembrances a treasure, that your remembrances and traces may endure throughout the dominion of the Kingdom. Though in truth these bounties have already been answered before being asked, and there hath descended from the heaven of the bounty of God, exalted be His glory, that before which every mention boweth down and every station is humbled. I beseech God to illumine the hearts and souls of His servants with the lights of the Day-Star of His knowledge, and to open the doors of His grace that all may attain and none remain deprived. However, the heedlessness and misguidance of the leaders have prevented and deprived the people. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those who are with you and who love you and who do not oppose you and who hearken unto your words concerning the Cause of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne. And praise be unto Him, for He is the God of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>

<p>Praise be to the Goal of all the worlds, Who at all times hath caused to be revealed and made manifest from the Most Exalted Pen the mention of His loved ones and chosen ones. In these days ye have surely heard what hath befallen the Choice Wine through the tyranny of the aggressors and the calumnies of the slanderers. By the life of our Lord and the Lord of the Throne and earth! They have exchanged truth for falsehood, trustworthiness for treachery, acceptance for rejection, justice for tyranny, and fairness for oppression. Through this every fair-minded one hath lamented, the sighs of every assured one have ascended, and the tears of every seeing one have fallen. I beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist them to return unto Him, to turn in repentance at the door of His bounty, and to stand before the throne of His justice. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. And this is what was revealed for him who was named ’Ibadu’llah. His word, exalted be His glory and abundant be His favors:</p>
<p>O ’Ibadu’llah! By the life of God, the Wronged One is in manifest grief. My grief is not for My imprisonment and what hath befallen Me from Mine enemies, but from those who claim to love Me yet have wrought that which hath caused My sighs to ascend, My tears to fall, and the Tablet and the Pen to lament. The clear Book of God beareth witness unto this. We have manifested the Cause and sent down the verses, yet most of the people are heedless. Those who denied God’s proof and evidence have fallen, and violated His covenant and testament. We beseech God to assist them to return. Verily, He is the Forgiver, the Generous. The Herald hath called from every direction, yet most of the people are transgressors. Blessed art thou for having found the fragrance of revelation and recognized Him Who was mentioned in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. In the establishment of Him Who conversed on Sinai upon the throne of Revelation, and the arrival of the Glory in the prison of ’Akka are signs for those who are discerning.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of men! Cast aside what the people possess and take My Choice Wine, sealed with My Self-Subsisting Name. Then drink thereof despite every ignorant remote one and every doubting learned one. Thus hath the light of utterance dawned from the horizon of the heaven of thy Lord’s mercy, the All-Merciful, that thou mayest rejoice and be among the thankful ones.</p>
<p>O Hasan, son of Mirza! Behold what hath appeared and shone forth from the horizon of God’s will, the Lord of this exalted station. Then hear what hath been raised from this Most Sublime Horizon and say: O Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven! I beseech Thee by the cries of those near unto Thee in their separation from Thee, and the lamentations of the sincere ones in Thy days, and by the ocean of Thy verses and the dawning-place of Thy revelation and inspiration, to strengthen me in such steadfastness as shall not be shaken by the hosts of the heedless nor the ranks of the oppressors. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I desire naught but to serve Thy Cause. I beseech Thee by the lights of the dawn of Thy Manifestation not to disappoint me and Thy loved ones in what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones in Thy perspicuous verses. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward the horizon of Thy Cause and holding fast to the cord of Thy grace. Ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto the court of Thy glory and the carpet of Thy holiness. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest through Thy Most Exalted Word. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Bashir-Muhammad in luminous language. Verily thy Lord doeth what He willeth, and He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Glory be to God! He hath believed and continueth to believe. His likeness is as one who occupieth himself with a drop while the ocean itself existeth. It is not known by what proof and testimony he hath believed in the Primal Point and, before Him, in the Prophets. By My life! He hath not recognized the fragrance of the Day of God. The Primal Point, with utmost helplessness, proclaimeth with His most exalted call: “O people of the Bayan! On that Day be ye not veiled from Him by the Bayan and its verses, and commit not that which the people of the Furqan committed.” Today the Divine carpet is spread forth and the people of Baha are engaged in praise and glorification with utmost joy and gladness. We beseech God that He deprive not those who have turned towards Him from the waves of the ocean of mercy, and withhold them not from the lights of the Luminary of proof which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of will. Take hold of the hem of grace with the hands of supplication and say: “Unto Thee be glory, O Lord of earth and heaven! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Self-Subsisting, through which the backs of the manifestations of idle fancies and vain imaginings were broken, and by Thy Command, whereby what was and what will be were subdued, to ordain for me the reward of those who heard Thy call, hastened to the door of Thy bounty, and quaffed the choice wine of utterance from the hand of Thy bestowal. Thou seest, O my God, what hath befallen Thy loved ones, Thy chosen ones, and Thy trusted ones in Thy lands. The oppressors have hamstrung Thy crimson She-camel and devoured Thy sheep, O Lord of all beings, and have committed that which hath caused justice to lament and equity to cry out. O Lord! Thou hearest the sighing of the sincere ones and beholdest what hath befallen them at the hands of the oppressors. I beseech Thee by Thy power which encompasseth all created things to protect Thy loved ones from the mischief of Thine enemies. Then guard them with the hosts of Thy justice. Verily Thou art the Almighty Whom neither the power of the world nor the strength of nations can withhold. Then I beseech Thee, O my God, to forgive me and my son, and whosoever hath held fast to the cord of Thy bounty and clung to the hem of Thy grace. Verily Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.”</p>
<p>O Pen of Eternity! Make mention of him who hath been named Haydar-’Ali, that the sweet savors of utterance may draw him unto a station wherein he shall behold naught save the sovereignty of God, His grandeur, His glory and His power. Thus have We sent down the verses and set them forth in truth, and He is the Mighty, the Commander, the Powerful.</p>
<p>We have verily witnessed thy devotion and heard thy call. We have summoned thee to the right hand of the Garden of Paradise that thou mayest hear and see that which the learned of the earth and its mystics have been prevented from beholding, save whom God hath willed, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>None should hesitate today regarding this momentous Announcement. It behooveth every soul, upon perceiving the divine fragrances and hearing the Call from the direction of the Throne, to say: “Here am I, here am I, O Thou Goal of the mystics and Beloved mentioned in the hearts of the sincere!”</p>
<p>I beseech Thee by Thy radiant Light and Thy pervading, resplendent Cause to assist me in that which will exalt Thy Cause and the station of Thy Word. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, and I desire naught save the wonders of Thy grace. Thou art He by Whose will the Supreme Pen moved and that which was hidden and treasured in the hearts of the chosen ones was revealed. I beseech Thee by Thy Lamp which the winds have encompassed, and by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued all names, to enable me to arise to serve Thee and to aid me in Thy remembrance and praise in such wise that neither the onslaught of hatred nor the roaring of enemies shall deter me. O my Lord! Ordain for me through Thy bounty that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and make me a champion of Thy Cause and a guardian of what Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O Isma’il! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Remember what My Herald hath uttered in remembrance of Me and of My station, saying: “I have written a gem in His remembrance - verily He cannot be known through My allusion nor through what hath been revealed in the Bayan.” With utmost clarity doth that Sovereign of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen declare that He cannot be known through My allusion nor through what hath been revealed in the Bayan. Time and again have We mentioned this verse and other passages that have flowed from the Pen of the Herald. Nevertheless, those who have turned away from the Bayan do at the very first instance seek to adduce proofs from the Bayan […]</p>
<p>O Muhammad Qabl-i-’Ali! The Supreme Pen at this moment speaks these exalted words: O people of Ta! He Who was recorded in the Books, inscribed in the Scrolls, and mentioned in the hearts, has come. We beseech God to aid Him through you and through your steadfastness. Verily, He hears and answers, and He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>These days have no likeness or similarity. Strive that perchance ye may attain to that which is the cause of the guidance of creation. Today the Path calls out and the Balance counsels all with justice and equity. Blessed are they who have attained unto hearing and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, for He hath made mention of thee in His Most Great Prison in such wise that thy mention and thy name shall endure in the Book of God, the Lord of this glorious station.</p>
<p>O Sadiq! Truthfulness and uprightness have ever been among the great divine attributes. Blessed are they who have clung fast thereunto. Such calumnies have reached Us as have caused the Spirit to lament and every trustworthy and truthful one to cry out. I do not complain of My grief and sorrow. I am patient in tribulation and render thanks unto God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. I have borne afflictions in His path and witnessed that which none other hath witnessed. To this testify all fair-minded ones possessed of knowledge and all the learned that are endowed with insight.</p>
<p>Trustworthiness, religiosity, chastity, truthfulness and purity are the distinguished garments of God, exalted be His glory. Blessed is he who adorns his temple therewith. He is indeed among the successful ones in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who was named Muhammad-i-Qabl-i-Baqir and give him the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Mighty, the Beautiful. O Muhammad-i-Qabl-i-Baqir! Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having made known unto me the Source of Thy commandments and the Dayspring of Thy laws, Whom Thou hast established as Thy station in Thy land. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by the lights of Thy Throne, and by the Scroll which none hath known save Thyself, and by the showers of the springtime of Thy grace, and by the mysteries of Thy Books, Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets, to make me so firm in Thy love, so steadfast and resolute that neither the oppression of the idolaters, nor the clamor of the heedless, nor the onslaught of those who have disbelieved in the Day of Judgment may move me. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I acknowledge my heedlessness and hesitation in Thy days. I beseech Thee to enable me to make good what hath escaped me, then ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen the recompense of one who hath quaffed the choice wine of revelation from the hand of Thy bounty. Verily Thou art the One Who hath power to do what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Glorified be He Who hath sent down His Command and revealed the Book, Who hath spoken without veil or barrier, and hath caused all things to proclaim that there is none other God but Him, the Ruler in the Final Return. And glory and splendor, praise and thanksgiving be upon the chosen ones of God, His loved ones and His friends, who have turned towards the Ancient of Days, detached from all else, and have quaffed the sealed wine named after the Self-Subsisting. These are servants who have arisen, spoken, uttered and testified to that which God had testified before the creation of earth and heaven - that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant hath been blessed with thy noble utterance and exalted letter, from whose horizon hath shone and gleamed the sun of the love of God, our Lord and your Lord, our Goal and your Goal, and the Goal of them that know. When I perceived its fragrance and became aware of its contents, it was as though I had soared on wings of longing to a station which God hath sanctified above all horizons - a station neither of the east nor of the west, neither of the south nor of the north, neither of the horizons nor of directions. When I arrived and attained unto His presence, I presented its contents after receiving permission, and after it was blessed to be heard, the Tongue of the Lord of Names spoke that which caused the fragrance of utterance to be diffused between earth and heaven. His word, exalted be His majesty and mighty be His proof:</p>
<p>In My Name that is sanctified above all names […]</p>
<p>O thou who drinkest from the chalice of My loving-kindness, who turnest thy face toward My countenance, and who hast set thy face toward Mine all-highest horizon! Hearken unto the Call of the Lord of Names, again and yet again. He hath remembered thee before, and calleth thee in this station with a call whereby bodies have taken flight, let alone spirits. Verily thy Lord is He Who causeth the dawn to break; there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of creation! By God, He Whom the Messengers of God have heralded hath appeared, and He Who was hidden in God’s knowledge and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books and Tablets hath come. Say: Fear God, O peoples of the earth! Dispute not the verses of God after their revelation, and deny not the favor which, when sent down, caused the idols to swoon. Say: This is the Day whereon mysteries have been unveiled and lights have shone forth, yet the people remain in heedlessness and behind a veil.</p>
<p>Say: O company of divines! Come, that I may show you the ocean of knowledge and its waves, and that which casteth forth, at all times, the pearls of wisdom and utterance from God, the Lord of Lords. Fear ye the All-Merciful, then judge with fairness in His Cause. He hath come with the truth, with the hosts of revelation and the standards of verses. Cast away vain imaginings, then hearken unto that which the Speaker of Sinai uttereth in the heaven of manifestation. He guideth you unto the Most Great Name and directeth you to the straight path. Leave behind you the dawning-places of fancy, then advance with illumined hearts and radiant faces unto the Most Glorious Ark, the station which God hath sanctified from all forms and likenesses.</p>
<p>Say: O company of the wise! Come, that I may acquaint you with that which ye have neglected […] with that which shall profit you throughout ages and centuries. Know ye that the Kingdom is My station, and the Realm of Might circleth round Me at eventide and at dawn. Thus hath the Lote-Tree of the Extremity quivered from the breeze of the Will of the Lord of Names, and there hath fallen from its leaves the dew of revelation and inspiration. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee, upon thy children, upon those of thy household who are with thee, and upon those who hearken to thy word concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of creation.</p>
<p>O My beloved! The fragrances of verses have perfumed all regions. Strange it is that the heedless, negligent, and outcast souls have neither been awakened by the cry nor become aware through the call. The All-Merciful hath spoken of them in the Qur’an - exalted be His Word - “As though they were hollow trunks of palm-trees.” Evil deeds have debarred mankind from the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted, and worldly manifestations have occupied and veiled those souls. God willing, thou wilt arise to serve the Cause with perfect wisdom and utterance, and educate the souls in that land, that perchance all may attain unto that which He loveth and with which He is well-pleased.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst mention of Haji Siyyid Ahmad and Haji Siyyid Husayn, upon them be the Glory of God, it was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, and a wondrous Tablet was revealed from the heaven of grace and sent specifically for each. God willing, may they receive their portion from His heavenly food and everlasting bounty. This is what was revealed for Haji Siyyid Ahmad, upon him be the Glory of God. His words, exalted and glorified be He:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Speaking, the Trustworthy</p>
<p>O Siyyid Ahmad! Praise be to God, thou hast, by His glory exalted be His glory, attained unto this most wondrous, most holy, most manifest, most hidden Revelation, and hast recognized Him in this luminous garment. All the Prophets gave mankind the glad tidings of this wondrous Day, saying “Lead the people out of darkness into light and give them the glad tidings of the days of God.” All sacred Books and Scriptures bear witness and testify to the Revelation of Truth. Nevertheless, most people remain heedless and veiled. The Cup-bearer of knowledge standeth with the chalice of life-giving waters before all faces, yet few turn unto Him - nay, such are rarely to be found. Today the Most Great Ocean proffereth at every moment the pearls of knowledge and wisdom unto all the peoples of the world, yet vision is lacking. Beseech ye God that He may make the people aware and guide them to the supreme horizon, that they may not be deprived of the outpourings of God’s Speaking Book, which is adorned with the seal “Verily I am God.” Verily, He is powerful over all things. He who loved Me hath mentioned thee, wherefore have We remembered thee that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Knowing Remembrancer. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy wife. Give her glad tidings from Me and glorify her with My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Blessed is the man who hath believed, and the woman who hath believed, and woe unto them that are heedless, both men and women. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for his honor Haji Siyyid Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God. He, blessed and exalted be He, saith:</p>
<p>In My Name, the One manifest in the highest horizon</p>
<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath appeared is verily the Mystery that was hidden and treasured from all eternity. Through Him the Greatest Sign appeared and the Most Exalted Summit was revealed, and the Cry was raised and the Balance was set up. He hath come from the heaven of Command, with the standards of the Bayan on His right and the hosts of revelation and the banners of divine knowledge on His left. Blessed is he who hath heard His call and turned unto Him, and woe unto him who hath denied God and turned away from the Path. O Siyyid Husayn! Rejoice that the Wronged One hath turned toward thee and remembered thee with a remembrance which, when sent down from the heaven of grace, caused the kingdom of utterance to bow down before it. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord’s loving-kindness and give thanks unto Him in all conditions. Verily He is with His devoted servants and aideth them as He pleaseth by His command. He is the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Make mention of My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad tidings of that which hath been sent down for them from God, the Lord of all mankind. The Glory shining from My horizon be upon him who mentioned thee, and upon thee, and upon those who have believed in God, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for the leaf, the wife of his honor Haji Siyyid Ibrahim, upon both of them be the Glory of God. He, exalted be His majesty, saith:</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed […]</p>
<p>O My handmaiden and My leaf! Blessed art thou for having hearkened unto the call of the Wronged One and turned unto Him, when the handmaidens of the earth and its men turned away, save whom God willed. This is a Day wherein He saith: “They have eyes with which they see not.” All are endowed with eyes, and eyes were indeed created for this blessed Day, for the Greatest Scene hath been honored by the gaze of the Lord of Destiny. Yet they remain deprived and veiled from His presence and recognition, while thou hast attained unto this through the wondrous favor of God. Know thou the worth of this station and preserve it through the Name of the Beloved of the worlds. We testify that thou hast attained unto that which most men have failed to attain. Convey My greetings to the believing handmaidens and gladden them all with the bounty and favor of God, exalted be His glory. Should all handmaidens offer up themselves and all they possess in the path of their Beloved, it would not equal the words “O My handmaiden.” Recognize thou the favor of thy Lord - verily He is the All-Forgiving, the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Generous. Reflect upon God’s favor - how many were the divines, mystics, and jurists who deemed themselves to be treasuries of knowledge and sources of divine ordinances, yet today remain heedless and veiled from their Purpose; nay, they have become so deluded as to pronounce death sentences against God, exalted be His glory. But thou hast attained a station wherein thy mention hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur. Give thanks unto God for this, verily He heareth and answereth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that through the favors of God, exalted be His glory, these souls have attained unto divine bounties and partaken of the rain from the heaven of mercy. Well is it with them and pleasant it is unto them. O ye gentlemen and friends of God, exalted be His glory, despite the heedless ones, drink ye cup after cup in the name of the Cleaver of the Dawn. They are still awaiting the Promised One, even as the Jews awaited before.</p>
<p>As for the Huququ’llah, it was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. According to His command, you should collect it: half to be sent to the Holy Presence and half to be given to the poor of that land. The names of those who have been blessed to pay the Huququ’llah should be sent to the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. Blessed is he whose name is mentioned before the Throne, and joy be unto him who hath attained and will attain unto God’s Tablet and His traces. This is the perfection of His favor that He hath shown unto His servants. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of the bounty of our Lord and your Lord, our Beloved and your Beloved, our Purpose and your Purpose, be upon you and upon your families and upon those who have attained unto this mighty Cause.</p>

<p>He is the Most Mighty, the Most Wondrous, the Most Eloquent, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>God beareth witness to that which thou didst testify at the beginning of thy book, that there is none other God but Him. No partner hath He, nor any minister, nor any peer, nor any equal, nor any opponent. He hath ever been sanctified above all names and their dominion, and above all similitudes and their sovereignty. He, verily, is the Ever-Living Who dieth not. In His grasp is the kingdom of all things. He createth whatsoever He willeth, and He, verily, is powerful over all things. But the most exalted testimony is that which God Himself hath borne to His own Self, by His own tongue, before the creation of all things and before the manifestation of attributes and their sovereignty, and of names and their dominion. And this it is: Bear thou witness unto it after My Cause, for before the Cause the testimony of no one shall be accepted in those days, that thou mayest be of them who have testified to that which God hath testified and who are recorded in the Tablets of God among the believers. God testifieth that there is none other God but Him and that the Primal Point is His servant and His Baha, and by this hath He taken a covenant from all atoms, if thou be of them who know. But today the people of the Bayan do not bear witness as God hath borne witness, for the testimony is not complete except through the mention of His Baha, and these people have paused in this matter with a mighty pause. Even should their tongues speak this Most Great Name, it would not profit them unless they believe that His Baha is the Baha of the heavens and of the earth, Who hath appeared in truth with manifest sovereignty. Whoso halteth in regard to this Name hath indeed halted in regard to all names, and his testimony shall never be accepted by God; rather, he hath been recorded by the Pen of Command in the holy Tablets among the idolaters.</p>
<p>Beware, beware, O servant, lest thou join any name with this Name, or ascribe to it any likeness, or similitude, or equal, or opposite, or direction, or sign, for by it hath God created all things and sustained all things, and hath sent down from the holy clouds showers of wondrous glory. Then purify thy heart from the allusions of those who were given the Qur’an - thus have ye been commanded in all the Tablets from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise - for they moved not except as their desires moved them, and they spoke not except through the promptings of their own selves. Therefore did they believe in God on the Day when the clouds were cleft asunder and the Beauty of the Cause came with manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>Know then that thy letter hath come before Us and We have taken note of the words and allusions contained therein. If thou wouldst hear from Me, efface from thy heart all of that, that it may become pure and luminous and that the lights of thy Lord may be reflected therein, that it may tell of Him. Thus doth the Beauty of the Cause command thee. Act thou according to what thou hast been bidden by One All-Knowing, All-Informed. For He Who was named Ali aforetime and Who came to you with God’s signs is verily alive and abiding through His word exalted: “Verily I am living in the Most Glorious Horizon.” After the manifestation of God and His sovereignty, it behooveth no one to turn to aught else beside Him or to occupy himself with any other. This indeed is the truth which hath shone forth from the horizon of a luminous morn. Should thou turn to the words thou possessest, thou wouldst be like those who, when the Sovereign of the Cause came to them with manifest and clear signs, occupied themselves with words that were current among them. Thus did they deny and turn away from Him for Whose meeting they were created. This indeed is a grievous wrong. Know thou God by God and by that which proceedeth from Him, for all else beside Him is created by His command and brought into being by His Will. He cannot be known through aught else; rather, all else is known through Him, and He is wise over all things. When the Sun shineth at its noontide zenith, doth it befit anyone to inquire about a lamp and what pertaineth thereto? Nay, by God’s Self, if thou be of them that know! After the appearance of the Ocean and its waves, doth it befit anyone to speak of a pool of water? Nay, by Him Who created all things by His command, and He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Beware, beware lest names hold thee back from Him through Whose command the names and their kingdom were created. Let God, thy Lord, suffice thee, then detach thyself from all the worlds. Forget all names, then look with the eye of the beginning toward Him Who, by God the Truth, were He to take a handful of clay and desire to generate therefrom all names and their kingdom, and all attributes and their dominion, and all that was and will be, is able to do so through His Name which is supreme over the Truth. Beware lest thou cling to a name other than the Name of thy Lord through Whom appeared the oceans of names. Exalted is God above this Name through which the faces of them that have recognized His unity are illumined and the face of every sinful polytheist is darkened. Through it God separateth this day between light and darkness, and between the felicitous and the wretched. Thus hath the decree come down from the heaven of destiny, and the matter hath been decided by One mighty and powerful.</p>
<p>Look at what thou hast seen in the Tablets of God wherein He hath described His servants. This description was not confined to any one person to the exclusion of others. Rather, We have described all who have arisen to praise their Lord. Behold thou the Tablets that thou mayest be illumined with clear vision. This description is true of whoso is steadfast in his faith, assured in God, and turned towards Him. But after his turning away and deviation, this description is withdrawn from him by a sovereignty that encompasses the truth. Consider, for example, a mirror: as long as it faces the sun, thou wilt find therein its reflection, its image, and its effulgences. But after turning away, it is bereft of all these and returns to its original state. Thus have We expounded this matter in detail that thou mayest stand firm in the Cause. Verily, he whom ye call the father of evil - God hath described him in His Book with the most exalted description, if thou be of them that know. God addressed him in His Book, saying “O Manifestation of Oneness!” and besides this, called him by His most beautiful names. Return to the Book that thou mayest witness this in the traces of thy Lord and become endowed with true vision. His praise reached such heights that none had ever attained to such mention of his Lord. Despite this, the people of the Bayan, both great and small, revile him. Have they any proof for this? Nay, by My Self, except that they say he turned away from God. When he turned away, his deeds became as naught and all his attributes, until he returned to the station that was written in the Mother Book. Likewise, observe that all names and all descriptions are true of those who believe in God and His signs, but without this, the decree of infidelity and polytheism descends upon them from the presence of the Self-Subsisting, the Supreme.</p>
<p>Hast thou not heard what God hath revealed in the Bayan? How many a tree of affirmation in the subsequent Revelation is transformed into a tree of negation! Reflect, then, upon that which was sent down from the heaven of eternity aforetime, and that which hath been revealed in these days, that thou mayest be numbered among those who are endowed with insight in the Mother Book. Know thou that every tree bearing lofty fruit, should it hesitate in this Cause, becometh counted among the trees of negation. This is a revelation from One Who is mighty and wise. Likewise every exalted, renowned and luminous name, should it hesitate in the Cause of its Lord, becometh accounted among the lowliest of names, even should it be among the most elevated. Thus do We teach thee the essence of knowledge, that thou mayest be well-pleasing in the religion of God.</p>
<p>Say: All matters lie within the grasp of His Will, and all names stand in awe of His might. He raiseth up whatsoever He willeth through His command, and bringeth down whatsoever He desireth through His authority. He shall not be questioned of His doings, and He, verily, encompasseth all things. Were He at this moment to pronounce the word of affirmation for all who are in the heavens and on earth, all would become His witnesses; and were He to pronounce upon them the word of negation, all would return to the fire. Thus do thou witness thy Lord’s power and be among those who bear witness to the Cause.</p>
<p>Know thou that between God and any soul there is no kinship. Whoso turneth unto God, belongeth unto Him, though he be from the people of the farthest West; and whoso turneth away is not of Him, though he be at His very side. Thus have We informed thee of the truth and taught thee through Our grace, that thou mayest be mindful within thyself and remind the people in these days wherein the Sun of might and glory hath shone forth and stood at its zenith with wondrous lights. Be not of those who, when God came unto them overshadowed by the clouds of His Cause, turned away from Him and sought to adduce proofs based on words related by someone from one of the names of old, and thereby went far astray. For through God’s existence, all things can dispense with all things, and through His sovereignty, He sufficeth all who are in the heavens and on earth, while nothing in creation can suffice in His stead. He Himself is the Truth, a witness unto what I say.</p>
<p>Purify thine ear that it may hearken to My melodies, then thy tongue that through it may flow praise of My Self, then thine eye that it may behold My countenance, from which all who are in the heavens and earth have been illumined, save those who have disbelieved, denied, and openly rejected the signs of God - these shall have no portion of this cup today. Cast aside all cups from thy hand, then take the cup of eternity in thy right hand and drink therefrom the crystal-pure wine in My Most Glorious Name. Then speak forth betwixt earth and heaven that which the Spirit hath spoken through mighty and glorious verses. Know thou that We have previously revealed unto thee a tablet and sent it to thee, and it shall be a testimony from Us unto all the worlds. When it reacheth thee, place it upon thy head, then render thanks unto God with gracious gratitude. And glory be upon thee if thou dost mount the Ark of Glory through Our steadfastness and spirit, sever thy gaze from all else besides God thy Lord, and remain upright upon the holy path, in truth and by the truth.</p>

<p>O Nabil, upon whom be the Glory of God, the Most Great, the Most Bountiful! How many a loved one have We found to be but a bubble on water, and how many a friend has turned apostate, having followed his passions, heedless of his Ancient Lord! Say: O people, follow not your idle fancies, but follow true guidance. Verily, He hath appeared with a light that hath illumined the heavens and the earth. Be steadfast in the Cause, then summon the people to this Most Great Name.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of princes! Take from the mighty the rights of the weak, and let not the rich exercise dominion over the poor. Thus doth command you the Lord of Names. He, verily, is the Knower of all things. Blessed is the rich one whom riches have not kept back from the Creator of earth and heaven, and whom the world hath not hindered from submitting unto them that are the people of Baha. By My life! He is of the people of the Crimson Ark. The denizens of the Concourse on High glory in him. How excellent is this most exalted station! Honour him, O people of truth, for he is among the choicest of creation. Thus hath it been decreed in justice by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of divines! Judge with justice amongst My servants. Beware lest anything prevent you from turning toward the poor. Look not to the right, but to the manifest truth. We are with you in all conditions. We hear what issueth from your mouths and behold what ye do. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Turn away your eyes from the left; be ye of them on the right hand who judge with pure justice for the sake of God. These, verily, are of the sincere ones. Blessed is the divine who judgeth with truth. He is of the people of this noble station. From him We perceive the fragrance of the All-Glorious, and We bless him with this Tongue that hath spoken that there is none other God but He, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Follow those divines from whose faces ye perceive the radiance of the All-Glorious. They are as eyes unto bodies. Thus hath decreed the Most Merciful Who created all possibility by His binding command, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of men of letters! By God, your cryptic verses and intricate riddles, your enigmas and palindromes, will profit you nothing this Day. Cast them aside in My Name, then take what your Lord of all worlds commandeth you. Hold back the reins of your pens, for the Pen of God moveth in the arena of the Tablets with wisdom and utterance. This is the source of prosperity, did ye but know. Adorn your speech with the mention of the All-Merciful and with verses for the Revealer of verses. Thus doth command you the Lord of attributes, Who hath come from the kingdom of proof with manifest sovereignty. Restrain your tongues from satire, for ye were created for praise. This is His Day, were ye but endowed with insight. Can mention of tresses and locks profit you? Nay, by the Lord of Power! Turn ye unto the Most Sublime Vision, this radiant station. Say: The eloquent one is he who hath conveyed My Cause, and the articulate one is he who hath spoken forth when questioned about this momentous News. Blessed is the poet who hath perceived in the days of God and from whose words hath wafted the fragrance of his Lord’s love throughout all creation - he is indeed of the triumphant. Woe unto the poet who hath brandished the spear of satire amidst the concourse of creation and hath remained heedless of this wondrous Remembrance. Remember the favour of God in having made your tongues the keys of treasures and the means to wisdom and mysteries. Fear God and be not of the heedless ones. This is the Day of praise wherein the Creator of the heavens hath come with the kingdom of your Lord, the Mighty, the Most Praised.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of the followers of Moses! The discourse of the Fire hath returned by the command of your Lord, the Chosen One, and from its roaring ye hear: “There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Gracious.” O followers of the Son! The Kingdom hath been adorned with My Name and the Realm of Power with My sovereignty, and the Spirit lamenteth by reason of that which hath befallen Me at the hands of the oppressors. Verily, the Temple beareth witness unto the Lord of all causes, yet most of the peoples are among the silent ones. It was built through piety, not through idle fancy, were ye of those who perceive. It was raised by the hand of the Divine Will, and none knoweth it save every discerning one possessed of insight. This is He through Whom the Spirit hath spoken, and through Whose mention both the Torah and the Gospel have been adorned. Every mouldering bone hath been quickened by the breeze of Revelation, yet the people, for the most part, are among the dead. Arise from the graves of heedlessness and desire, in the name of the Creator of heaven, then turn ye toward the horizon of the Cause through this glorious Name. This is the Righteous One Who was in heaven and of Whom Christ gave you tidings. He hath come with His mighty glory. The Most Great Law hath appeared–that which was mentioned in the scriptures of the Messengers. Fear God and follow not your desires. Follow ye the Truth to which the Most Exalted Word hath testified and wherewith the Kingdom of Names hath been adorned. Turn ye unto Him with illumined hearts and be not of them that turn aside. Say: O people of the Qur’an! By God, the All-Merciful Spirit lamenteth because of your deeds, when He came from the heaven of utterance with clear sovereignty. Ye have denied Him by Whose leave all things were created, and turned away from Him unto Whom every radiant countenance hath turned. Say: He hath appeared in such wise that none can deny Him save those who are veiled by the clouds of hatred and wrapped in the shrouds of desire, and are among the most lost. Have mercy upon yourselves and break not God’s Covenant and His Testament, and be of the equitable ones. Your turning away harmeth Me not, even as your turning toward Me profiteth Me not. Verily, He is independent of all the worlds.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of the Bayan! This is the Best-Beloved of all possible worlds, Who hath come with the Kingdom of verses, yet ye remain heedless. Was this Revelation made conditional upon any conditions, and doth the Cause rest in your hands or in the hand of God? Consider well, and be not of the ignorant. If the Cause be in God’s hand, then He hath raised me up and sent me forth, and caused me to speak by His will. He, verily, is the Ordainer of whatsoever He pleaseth. He hath manifested me with a proof round which circle the proofs of all the Messengers. By my Self have I raised the standards of power, which none denieth save every malicious sinner. Were the Cause in my hands, I would not have uttered a word amongst you. I kept the Cause hidden until His irrevocable and firm decree came. His will hath prevailed over my will, and He hath manifested me despite the arrows of the polytheists that have pierced me. And if the Cause be in your hands, why do ye denounce as unbelievers the people of the Gospel and the Torah, and the followers of the Friend? They say what ye say. They have clung to their vain imaginings and idle fancies, and have turned away from the Dayspring of certitude and my most luminous horizon. Ye are in the greatest of veils, and these are but tales of the ancients that persist among you. He knoweth what is in your breasts and what hath prevented you from this noble horizon. Ye are deaf, by the Lord of the mighty Throne! And ye are blind, by the Lord of the exalted Seat! The earth and heaven have been illumined by the light of the countenance of your most glorious Lord, yet ye see not. Clear proofs have appeared, yet ye know them not. Verses have been sent down, yet ye comprehend them not. All things have testified to the Lord of Names, yet ye hear not. The Pen is ashamed to recount what ye have uttered concerning me, though ye were commanded not to allude to this holy, exalted, inaccessible and forbidden station. Ye have embraced him whom We cast into the sea, and have clung to his vain imaginings. Do ye know by what authority ye turned to him and turned away from Him by Whom the horizon of your Lord’s power, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, was illumined? And did ye recognize Him? Nay, by the Self of the Beloved! We testify that ye worship idle fancies and are unaware. Thus have We recounted unto thee the tale of the people who today shall find no helpers. O thou who hast turned to God! Leave them and what they possess, then stand firm in this irrevocable Cause.</p>
<p>The seal of the Wine of Mysteries hath been broken by the fingers of might. Blessed are they who are free, who have drunk in the name of their Chosen Lord on this Promised Day. We have sent down from the heaven of bounty that which shall gladden faithful servants. When thou hast attained unto the Tablet of God and found from it the fragrance of verses, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Source of clear evidences. I testify that Thou art the Omnipotent over what was and what shall be. Blessed is he who has remained steadfast in the Cause and was not hindered by the intimations of those who disbelieved in God when He came with His name, the Self-Subsisting. Remember those on whose faces thou findest the radiance of Baha. Say: Rejoice in that ye have been mentioned by the Pen of Revelation. By My life! Ye are the triumphant ones. Let not what hath escaped you grieve you, for He is the Mighty, the Forgiving. Let not the affairs of creation disturb you. Verily, the Truth is with you; this sufficeth you, did ye but know. Say: Read ye the verses of God, then ponder upon them that ye may know what hath befallen Us. Within them is revealed every hidden matter. Afflictions have encompassed Me which none can reckon save God, Knower of the unseen and the seen. The polytheists have gathered against Me from every direction with tyranny, to this bear witness honored servants. Every harm hath been ordained for My person and every affliction for My beauty, yet the people understand not. We, in all conditions, summon the servants unto the Mighty, the Loving. What befalleth Us deterreth Us not, even as what befell Us in the past deterred Us not, and thy Lord is witness to what I say. Be thou as steadfast as thy Lord, that the words of those who have disbelieved in God and believed in falsehood may not deter thee. Thus doth the Pen of Knowledge teach thee from the presence of the Truth, the All-Knowing. Take what thou hast been given by the power of thy Lord, then remember Him in thy days. This is better for thee than what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I know not by what fire Thou didst kindle the lamp of Thy sovereignty in the midst of Thy lands, nor by what light Thou didst manifest Thy countenance in Thy realms. The more the waters of opposition were poured upon the former, the more its radiance increased; and the more the veils of the heedless obscured the latter, the more its gleaming and effulgence grew. Thus dost Thou see, O my God, the lamp of Thy Revelation among the people of darkness and rebellion, and Thy abiding Face among the people of loss. I beseech Thee by Thy name, the All-Merciful, through which the breaths of life were wafted over all who are in the heavens and on earth, to raise up from among those possessed of power one who shall arise to aid Thy Cause, exalt Thy Word, and establish Thy laws among Thy servants. Then strengthen through him, O my God, Thy loved ones who have turned unto Thee and sought the sanctuary of Thy presence. Though Thou hast strengthened them in Thy kingdom, yet I desire their exaltation in the realm of creation, by Thy glory, O Creator of the heavens and Lord of all names! There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>In The Name of Him Who is Mighty to do as He Willeth!</p>
<p>This is a Book from the Wronged One to him who hath clung to learning, that he may rend asunder the greatest veil and turn towards God, the Lord of destiny, and be of the fair-minded. Shouldst thou hear the melodies of the Dove which warbleth upon the twigs of the Tree of Utterance, they would so transport thee that thou wouldst find thyself detached from all the worlds. Be fair, O servant! Is God the One Who doeth what He willeth, or is it other than He? Make clear thy position and be not of the silent ones. If thou sayest it is other than He, thou hast not been fair in this matter - to this testifieth every atom and, beyond them all, thy Lord, the Speaker, the True, the Faithful. And if thou sayest that He is the One Who chooseth, then indeed He hath manifested me in truth, sent me forth, and caused me to speak verses that have struck terror into the hearts of all who are in the heavens and on earth, save those who have been seized by the breathings of revelation from thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Can any decree stand before His decree? Can anyone prevent Him from what He willeth? Nay, by His Self, if thou be of them who know!</p>
<p>Consider the people of the Torah - why did they turn away when the Dayspring of verses came with manifest sovereignty? Were it not for thy Lord’s protection, the divines would have put Him to death on the very first day He spoke in the name of His Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Then consider the people of the Gospel - why did they object when the Sun of the Cause shone forth from the horizon of Hijaz with lights that illumined all in the worlds? How many a learned one hath been debarred from the All-Knowing, and how many an ignorant one hath attained to the source of all knowledge! Ponder and be of the assured ones. The shepherd believed in Him while the divines turned away. Thus was the matter decreed, if thou be of them who hear. Then observe how, when Christ came, the most learned divine of the age pronounced His death sentence, while he who caught fish believed in Him. Thus doth He Who God hath sent inform thee by His binding, mighty Command.</p>
<p>The learned one is he who hath recognized the Known One, hath won to the lights of His countenance and is of them who have drawn nigh. Be not of those who say “God is our Lord,” yet when He sent forth the Manifestation of His Cause with clear proof, they denied the All-Merciful and gathered to slay Him. Thus doth the Pen of the Cause counsel thee, after God hath made it independent of all the worlds. We make mention of thee for the sake of God and impart unto thee that whereby thy remembrance shall endure in the Tablets of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praised. Cast aside learning and its aspects, then hold fast to the Name of the Self-Subsisting, Who hath dawned from this luminous horizon. By God! I was sleeping when the breathings of revelation stirred me, and I was silent when my Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, caused me to speak. Were it not for His Command, I would not have revealed myself. His Will hath encompassed my will, and He hath established me in a Cause whereby the darts of the idolaters have assailed me. Read thou what We have sent down to the kings, that thou mayest be assured that this servant speaketh by the command of One Knowing, Informed, and mayest witness that tribulations have not prevented Him from making mention of the Lord of Names. He hath called all unto God, and the might of the oppressors hath not frightened Him.</p>
<p>Hearken unto what the Dayspring of verses calleth thee from One Mighty, All-Wise. Arise to serve the Cause through God’s power and strength, detached from those who have objected to God after He came with this momentous announcement. Say: O concourse of divines! Take hold of your pens, for the Supreme Pen speaketh betwixt earth and heaven. Then be silent that ye may hear what the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth from this noble prospect. Say: Fear ye God and refute not the truth by what ye possess. Follow Him to Whom all things have testified and be not of the doubters. This day shall not profit you […]</p>
<p>Say: That which ye have is destined to perish, whereas that which is with God shall endure, did ye but perceive it. Say: O people of the Qur’an! He Who was promised unto you in the Book is come. Fear ye God and follow not every sinful idolater. Verily He hath been manifested in such wise that none can deny it except those who are veiled by the shrouds of fancy and are accounted among the rejected ones. Say: The Word hath appeared, at which your divines and your learned men have fled. This is what We foretold you aforetime. He is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. The learned one is he who hath acknowledged the One Who is the Object of all knowledge, and he who turneth away is not worthy to be called a learned one, though he may have mastered all the knowledge of the ancients. The mystic is he who hath recognized the One Who is the Object of all mystical knowledge, and the man of distinction is he who hath turned unto this bounty which hath appeared through a wondrous command. Say: O people! Drink ye of the choice wine which We have unsealed with the hands of might. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Almighty. Thus have We counselled you, that haply ye may abandon your own desires and turn unto divine guidance, and be numbered among those who are assured.</p>
<p>Hear ye in the Persian tongue, that perchance ye may discover the sweet-scented breezes of the merciful Divine Robe which are wafting today, and hasten to the path of the One True Friend. Ponder ye what caused the peoples, in the days of the manifestation of the Repositories of Divine mercy, to keep their distance and rise up in opposition and objection. Were the people to ponder this matter which hath flowed from the Pen of Command, all would hasten to the everlasting Divine Law and would testify to that which He hath testified. However, the veils of idle fancies have prevented and continue to prevent mankind in the days of the manifestation of the Daysprings of Divine Unity and the Dawning-places of eternal glory. For in those days the Truth appeareth as He willeth, not as the people will, even as He hath said: “Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what your souls desired not, you grew arrogant? Some you called impostors and others you slay.” Indeed, had those sacred Beings appeared according to the vain imaginings of men in former times and ages past, no one would have denied them. Yet though all were engaged day and night in His remembrance and stood in prayer in the temples, they remained deprived of the Daysprings of Divine verses and the Manifestations of heavenly proofs, as is recorded in the books and as you are aware of some instances.</p>
<p>For example, at the appearance of Christ, all the divines of that age, though awaiting His manifestation, turned away. Annas, who was the most learned of the divines, and Caiaphas, who was the chief judge, pronounced Him an infidel and issued His death warrant. Likewise, when the Apostle appeared - may all else be a sacrifice unto Him - the divines of Mecca and Medina rose up in the early years in opposition and objection, while those who were entirely unlearned attained to faith. Consider how Bilal the Ethiopian, who had not read a word of knowledge, ascended to the heaven of faith and certitude, while Abdullah-i-Ubayy, who was among the learned, arose in hypocrisy. The shepherd perceived the fragrances of the verses and found his way to the court of the Beloved, joining the Lord of all nations, while the possessors of knowledge and wisdom remained deprived and veiled. This is why He saith: “The highest among you shall become the lowest, and the lowest shall become the highest.” The essence of this utterance hath appeared in most of the Divine Books and the statements of the Prophets and Chosen Ones.</p>
<p>In truth I say the Cause is of such magnitude that father fleeth from son and son from father. Witness this in Noah and Canaan. God willing, ye should not in these spiritual days remain deprived of the divine breezes and the bounties of the Divine Springtime. Rise up in the name of Him Who is known, detached from all learning, and raise the call. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of the Cause that in that moment ye shall witness the river of Divine knowledge flowing from the heart, and shall behold without veil the lights of Divine wisdom. If thou shouldst find the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful, thou wouldst surrender thy life and sacrifice thyself in the path of the Friend.</p>
<p>It is most evident that this servant had and hath no ulterior motive, for his Cause transcendeth all outward conditions, as he findeth himself a lonely exile in the Most Great Prison, and hath not found nor will find deliverance from the hands of the enemies. Therefore whatsoever he speaketh is purely for the sake of God, that perchance the people may cleanse themselves from the veils of self and passion and attain unto the knowledge of God, which is the most exalted of stations. Their rejection harmeth Me not […]</p>
<p>Their acceptance profits Me not. We summon them only for the sake of God. He, verily, is independent of all the worlds. I pray that thou mayest be so enkindled, by the fire of the love of thy Lord - which is none other than light itself in this Manifestation of the All-Compelling God - that the whole of creation may be moved and stirred by its warmth, and turn unto the Truth. Glory be unto him who hath attained unto the lights of guidance and recognized God, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Say: Glory be unto Thee, O Creator of the heavens and Possessor of all names! I beseech Thee by the revelations of Thy signs and the hidden tokens of Thy favor to make me one of them who have turned unto Thee and turned away from all else save Thee, who have acknowledged Thy singleness and confessed Thy oneness, and who have soared in the atmosphere of nearness to Thee until they became captives in Thy domains and abased among Thy creatures. O my Lord! I have laid hold on the cord of Thy bounties and clung to the hem of Thy generosity. I beseech Thee not to shut me out from Thy gate which Thou hast opened unto all who dwell in Thy heaven and on Thy earth. Then grant me, O my God, that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and written down for Thy loved ones. Aid me, moreover, to serve Thee in such wise that the denial of them that have turned away from Thee shall not keep me back from observing Thy right, nor shall the assault of the oppressors prevent me from proclaiming Thy Cause. Wilt Thou, O my God, withhold me from drawing nigh unto Thee after Thou hast called me to Thee? Wilt Thou drive me from the dawning-place of Thy signs after Thou hast summoned me to the horizon of Thy grace? O Lord! This is one who thirsts for the river of Thy bounty, and an ignorant one who seeketh to draw near to the ocean of Thy knowledge. Teach me, O my God, from Thy hidden knowledge whereby Thou didst give life to what was and what shall be. Make me, moreover, to circle round Thy good-pleasure, to be submissive to Thy command, and humble before Thy loved ones who have sought Thy presence and attained the light of Thy countenance, and entered the city wherein the sweet savors of Thy revelation were wafted and the fragrances of Thy inspiration were diffused. Thou art, verily, powerful to do what Thou willest. I testify that Thou art the Sovereign over all who are in earth and heaven, and the Almighty over all things. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>O Nabil, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Most Great, the Most Bountiful! How many a beloved one have We found to be but a bubble, and how many a friend hath turned into a heretic, having followed his desires, heedless of his Ancient Lord. Say: O people, follow not your desires; follow instead divine guidance, for it hath appeared with a light whereby the heavens and earth were illumined. Stand firm in the Cause, then summon the people unto this Great Name.</p>
<p>Say: O assemblage of princes, take from the mighty the rights of the weak, and suffer not the rich to rule over the poor. Thus doth command you the Lord of Names, verily He is the All-Knowing. Blessed is the wealthy one whom riches have not kept back from the Creator of heaven, and whom the world hath not deceived from showing humility before the people of Baha. By My life! He is of the people of the crimson ark; the denizens of the Supreme Paradise glory in him. How wonderful is this noble and exalted station! Honor him, O people of truth, for he is among the choicest of creation. Thus hath justice decreed from the presence of the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Say: O assemblage of divines, judge with justice amongst My servants. Beware lest anything prevent you from turning toward the poor. Look not to the right, but to the manifest truth. We are with you in all conditions, We hear what issueth from your mouths and behold your state. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Turn away your eyes from the left; be of those who look to the right, who judge with pure truth for the sake of God. These, verily, are of the sincere ones. Blessed is the divine who judgeth with truth; he is of the people of this noble scene. From him We perceive the fragrance of Baha, and We bless him with this Tongue which hath spoken that there is no God but Me, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Follow those divines from whose faces ye perceive the radiance of Baha. They are as eyes to the body. Thus hath decreed the Most Merciful, Who created all possibility through His binding and wise command.</p>
<p>Say: O assemblage of the learned! By God, neither your intricate verses, nor your embellished words, nor your riddles and enigmas, nor your palindromes will profit you this Day. Cast them aside in My Name, then take what your Lord of the worlds commandeth you. Hold back the reins of your pens, for the Pen of God moveth in the field of Tablets with wisdom and utterance. This is the root of prosperity, were ye to know. Adorn your tongues with the mention of the All-Merciful, and your verses for the Revealer of verses. Thus commandeth you the Lord of Attributes, Who hath come from the Kingdom of proof with manifest sovereignty. Restrain your tongues from satire; ye were created for praise. This is its day, were ye of the discerning. Will mention of tresses and locks profit you? Nay, by the Lord of Power! Turn ye unto the Most Great Vision, this radiant station. Say: The eloquent one is he who hath conveyed My Cause, and the articulate one is he who hath spoken forth when asked about this Mighty News. Blessed is the poet who hath perceived in the days of God and from whose utterance hath wafted the fragrance of his Lord’s love throughout all possibility. He is assuredly among the triumphant. Woe unto the poet who hath brandished the spear of satire amidst the concourse of creation and remained heedless of this wondrous Remembrance. Remember the favor of God in making your tongues the keys of treasures and the locks of wisdom and mysteries. Fear God and be not of the heedless ones. This is the day of praise, wherein the Creator of heaven hath come with the kingdom of your Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of the followers of Moses! The discourse of the Fire hath returned by the command of your Lord, the Chosen One, and from its roaring ye hear: “There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Gracious.” O people of the Son! The Kingdom hath been adorned with My Name, and the Dominion with My sovereignty, and the Spirit lamenteth by reason of that which hath befallen Me at the hands of the oppressors. Verily, the Temple beareth witness unto the Lord of all causes, yet most of the denominations remain silent. It was built through piety, not through fancy, could ye but perceive it. It was fashioned by the hand of the Divine Will, and none knoweth it save every discerning one possessed of insight. This is He through Whom the Spirit spoke, and by Whose mention both the Torah and the Gospel were adorned. Every moldering bone hath been quickened by the breeze of Revelation, yet most of the people are as dead. Arise from the graves of heedlessness and desire, by the Name of Him Who is the Fashioner of the heavens, then turn ye unto the horizon of the Cause through this glorious Name. This is the Righteous One Who was in heaven and of Whom Christ gave you tidings. He hath come with His mighty glory. The Most Great Law hath appeared - that which was mentioned in the scriptures of the Messengers. Fear God and follow not your desires. Follow ye the Truth to which the Most Exalted Word hath testified and wherewith the Kingdom of Names hath been adorned. Turn ye unto Him with illumined hearts, and be not of them that turn aside. Say: O people of the Qur’an! By God, the All-Merciful Spirit hath lamented because of your deeds when He came from the heaven of utterance with clear sovereignty. Ye have denied Him by Whose leave all things were created, and turned away from Him unto Whom every radiant countenance hath been directed. Say: He hath appeared in such wise that none can deny Him save those who are veiled by the clouds of hatred and wrapped in the shrouds of desire, and are among the most lost. Have mercy on yourselves and break not God’s Covenant and His Testament, and be of them that are just. Your turning away harmeth Me not, even as your turning towards Me profiteth Me not. Verily, He is independent of all the worlds.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of the Bayan! This is the Best-Beloved of all created things, Who hath come with the kingdom of verses, while ye remain heedless. Was this Revelation made conditional upon any stipulation? Was this Cause in your hands or in God’s hand? Be discerning, and be not of the ignorant ones. If the Cause be in God’s hand, He hath raised me up and sent me forth, and caused me to speak according to His will. He, verily, is the Ordainer of whatsoever He pleaseth. He hath manifested me with a proof around which circle the proofs of all the Messengers. Through my being have the standards of power been raised up, which none deny save every malicious transgressor. Had the Cause been in my hands, I would not have uttered a word amongst you. I held the Cause in reserve until His binding and mighty Command came. His Will hath prevailed over mine, and He hath manifested me in such wise that the arrows of the idolaters have assailed me. And if the Cause be in your hands, why do ye reject the people of the Gospel and the Torah, and the followers of Abraham? They say what ye say. They have clung to what they possess of idle fancies and vain imaginings, and have turned away from the Dawning-Place of certitude and my most luminous Countenance. Ye are wrapped in the most great veil, which is naught but the tales that were current amongst you from the imaginings of the ancients. He knoweth what is in your breasts and that which hath prevented you from this glorious Perspective. Ye are deaf, by the Lord of the mighty Throne! And ye are blind, by the Lord of the exalted Seat! The earth and heaven have been illumined by the light of the countenance of your Lord, the All-Glorious, yet ye see not. The evidences have appeared, yet ye know them not. The verses have been sent down, yet ye understand them not. All things have testified to the Lord of Names, yet ye hear not. The Pen is ashamed to mention that which ye have uttered concerning me, after ye were commanded not to allude to this holy, exalted, inaccessible and forbidden Station. Ye have taken him whom We cast into the sea, and have clung to what he possesseth of idle fancies. Know ye by what authority ye turned unto him and turned away from Him through Whom the horizon of the power of your Lord, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting, was illumined? And did ye recognize him? Nay, by the Self of the Beloved! We testify that ye worship vain imaginings and perceive it not. Thus have We recounted unto thee the tale of the people who today shall not be helped. O thou who hast turned towards God! Leave them and what they possess, then stand firm in this irrevocable Cause.</p>
<p>The seal of the Wine of Mysteries hath been broken by the fingers of might. Blessed are they who are free, who have drunk in the name of their Chosen Lord on this promised Day. We have sent down from the heaven of bounty that which bringeth joy to sincere servants. When thou attainest unto the Tablet of God and findest from it the sweet fragrances of verses, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Source of clear evidences! I testify that Thou art the Omnipotent over what was and what shall be. Blessed is he who remaineth steadfast in the Cause and is not hindered by the signs of those who disbelieved in God when He came with His name, the Self-Subsisting. Remember those on whose faces thou findest the radiance of Glory. Say: Rejoice in that ye have been mentioned by the Pen of Revelation. By My life! Ye are the triumphant ones. Let not what hath escaped you grieve you, for He is the Mighty, the Forgiving. Let not the affairs of creation disturb you. Verily, the Truth is with you; this sufficeth you, did ye but know. Say: Read ye the verses of God, then ponder, that ye may know what hath befallen Us. Therein hath been revealed every hidden matter. Afflictions have encompassed Me which none can reckon save God, the Knower of the unseen and the seen. The polytheists have gathered against Me from every direction with tyranny, to this do honored servants bear witness. Every harm hath been ordained for My person and every affliction for My Beauty, yet people do not understand. In all conditions We summon the servants to the Mighty, the Loving. That which befalleth Us preventeth Us not, even as what befell Us in the past prevented Us not, and thy Lord is witness to what I say. Be thou steadfast in the path of thy Lord in such wise that the words of those who have disbelieved in God and believed in falsehood shall not deter thee. Thus doth the Pen of Knowledge teach thee from the presence of the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Take what thou hast been given by the power of thy Lord, then make mention of Him in thy days. This is better for thee than what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I know not by what fire Thou didst kindle the lamp of Thy sovereignty in the midst of Thy lands, and by what light Thou didst manifest Thy countenance in Thy domains. The more the waters of opposition were poured upon the former, the more did its radiance increase, and the more the veils of the heedless obscured the latter, the more did its gleaming and its rays increase. Thus dost Thou see, O my God, the lamp of Thy Revelation amidst the people of darkness and rebellion, and Thy abiding Face amidst the people of loss. I beseech Thee by Thy name, the All-Merciful, through which the breaths of life were wafted over all who are in the heavens and on earth, to raise up from among the powerful ones him who shall arise to aid Thy Cause, to exalt Thy Word, and to elevate Thy laws amongst Thy servants. Then strengthen through him, O my God, Thy loved ones who have turned unto Thee and have sought the sanctuary of Thy presence. Though Thou hast strengthened them in Thy kingdom, yet I desire their strengthening in the world of creation, by Thy might, O Fashioner of the heavens and Lord of all names. There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>The Pen calleth out amidst the world and giveth glad-tidings unto the peoples through the Most Great Name, whereby hath flowed the Kawthar of life throughout all contingent being, and whereby there hath gushed forth from the impenetrable rock the sweet-flowing waters of the All-Merciful’s love. By the life of God! This Day is His Day, wherein He turneth at one time to the right, calling out to the companions of the right hand and summoning them unto God, the True Sovereign, the Manifest; and at another time He walketh before the faces of the servants, giving them glad-tidings of that which hath dawned forth and shone from the horizon of the will of the Lord of creation; and at yet another time He speaketh from the highest branches of the Tree of existence, warbling and singing with the most melodious of tunes, whereby the wine of recognition hath intoxicated the servants of the All-Merciful. Of them are they who hastened unto the Dayspring of sacrifice between earth and heaven, and of them are they who sacrificed themselves by their own hands in the path of God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. By the life of God! Were it not for the decree of wisdom sent down from the heaven of the will of our Lord, the All-Merciful, the sincere ones would surely hasten to attain that which the martyrs have attained. The command is God’s, inasmuch as He hath forbidden all from this and enjoined upon them composure and dignity, and the preservation of their souls in private and in public. Verily, He is the All-Choosing, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>May my spirit and my soul be offered up for that which belongeth to Him and to it in the path of your love, O thou who hast arisen with thy whole being to serve God and to aid His Cause. Several days ago, as commanded, a brief petition was submitted to your presence. God willing, it will have arrived. In your previous letter you had made mention of Manekji Sahib. The answer to his petitions had been revealed through God’s bounty and favor some time ago, but due to certain matters and divine wisdom it was not sent, and likewise the answer to Mulla ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, and several others whose petitions were brought by Mirza Muhammad-Husayn, the physician, upon him be the Glory of God, was not sent, until in these days from the Dayspring of favors the Sun of permission arose and the answer to the aforementioned gentleman’s petition was sent. The original Tablet in the handwriting of the Most Great Branch - may my spirit and being be offered up for the dust of His most mighty footsteps - was sent and should reach that person, and a copy in this servant’s hand was sent so that any of the honored ones and friends of God who wish to make a copy may do so from this servant’s handwriting, that the original Tablet may reach its owner safe and unblemished. Although that which hath been revealed from the heaven of divine Will in answer to them hath been revealed according to the requirements of the time and in consideration of the condition of the seeker, yet I swear by the beauty of the Beloved that were all who are on earth to be fair-minded and attain unto the perusal of that Tablet, all would enter the goodly City and behold the heavenly bounty with their outward and inner eyes, and be delighted thereby. My soul and the souls of all else be a sacrifice for His utterance and for His mention.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! This servant is at all times bewildered and thoughtful, for he sees heedlessness encompassing most of the people of the world to such an extent that pen and tongue are powerless to describe it. Observe how the ocean of inner meanings is surging, the Sun of grace is shining, and the heaven of utterance is raised high; yet the people remain heedless and veiled to such a degree that they are counted among the dead. Soon, however, will the Divine Word encompass all and all shall turn toward the supreme horizon, save those souls who are utterly devoid of spirit - their judgment is as ashes. Blessed are the loved ones of God and His chosen ones - may my soul be a sacrifice for them - who have directed their hearts to the ultimate goal and turned their radiant faces to the supreme horizon, and have drunk the choice wine of life from the hands of bounty on this Day when the vibration of the Manifestation has seized all things. Blessed is the ear that hath heard its call and the eye that hath witnessed its ways. All souls observe with their outward eyes the passing of one another and the changes of circumstances and days, yet they are seen to be far from the gathering-place of nearness and heedless of the Sun of knowledge which shineth at the zenith. They have neither ears nor eyes - they are like cattle, nay more astray.</p>
<p>From His blessed letters it was understood that after learning of the conditions in the Land of Purpose and its constraints and the events occurring therein, they have become distressed and saddened. This servant submits that although the events occurring in this land are just as some of the friends have reported to them, yet God willing the hand of divine destiny shall protect. Yes, since God has ordained means for every matter, they look to the means and all are commanded to this station, but after the prevention of the appearance of outward means, assuredly the conquering power and the prevailing sovereignty will be made manifest and will effect the transformation of all that is visible. He is, verily, the Omnipotent, the Almighty. I swear by the Sun of wisdom that shineth from the horizon of the heaven of utterance that were this servant to describe this station as it truly is, all on earth would be bewildered, nay, thunderstruck by the greatness of the Cause. May my soul be a sacrifice for thy detachment and may my life be offered up for thy service. In truth, tongue and pen fall short of mentioning thy struggles, efforts and endeavors in service to the Cause, and to this every person of insight bears witness and every hearing ear testifies. Praise be to God, then praise be to God, that thou hast attained to this exalted, supreme station which is today visible among the people of the earth. However, according to the blessed command, thou must conduct thyself with perfect wisdom and protect thyself as much as possible for the sake of serving the Truth. The Truth, the Inaccessible, has thus far preserved Himself for the salvation of the people, the freedom of the people, and the maturity of the people. But in these days, due to the ingratitude of the people, We are somewhat hesitant as to what We should will and what command We should manifest.</p>
<p>O My Name Ha! By thy life, We have desired the survival and salvation of creation, yet at every moment they strive for My extinction. Say: By the life of God! He shall never perish, but rather He loveth to veil His countenance from your eyes, O heedless ones. His are worlds beyond worlds, and realms which none hath known save He Who speaketh the truth and converseth with thee from this remote station. O My Name Sin! Hearken unto My most sweet call. He remembereth thee, and giveth thee glad tidings, and confirmeth thee in thy love for God, the Lord of all worlds. My Most Exalted Pen beareth witness to thy sincerity, thy service, thy steadfastness and thy gracious mention. The Wronged One restraineth Himself from mentioning that which hath befallen Him in this manifest spot. We have named it the Most Great Prison. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Informed. That which hath appeared therein befitteth to be concealed in a preserved tablet. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Wise. Grieve not at this, but put thy trust in God. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>God willing, may you ever be blessed through the mercy of the All-Merciful. Your mention hath been made in the Most Holy Court, thy call hath been heard, and thy love witnessed. The servant present at this moment, when the meal was served, requested that a portion of this food be bestowed upon the Name of Ha, and at this moment he arose and engaged in visitation on thy behalf. We gave him leave for this, that he might be numbered among them that visit. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen make mention of thee and give thee glad tidings of that which hath appeared at this moment.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst write concerning the Most Great Leaf, the honored sister - upon her be the Most Glorious of all Glory and the Most Excellent of all Praise - yes, this servant once heard from the blessed tongue that they said if one succeeds in paying the Huququ’llah to the extent of paying debts and expenses allocated to them, this is beloved before the Throne. Until this year, this servant always heard these words from the tongue of Grandeur regarding the Huququ’llah, saying that no one should demand Huququ’llah from anyone, as this depends on the success and pleasure of the servants themselves to pay with complete contentment and submission. However, this year, in view of current affairs and apparent conditions, they said that each of the loved ones of God upon whom Huququ’llah has become binding must pay it. We beseech God that all may be enabled to do this, as this matter is truly the cause of preservation and purity of wealth and of blessing, and has ever been so. And they said that were it not for these outward circumstances, never would such words have been uttered from the tongue of Grandeur, but the matter is decreed, and perhaps good will come of it.</p>
<p>I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to give His loved ones to drink, at all times, from the wine of steadfastness and to confirm them in the wisdom that hath been sent down. He, verily, is the Generous Giver. I request of thee to convey expressions of sincerity from this evanescent one to the brethren and to those whom God hath related to thee, one and all, and likewise to the friends. I beseech God to enable them, to assist them, and to draw them near unto Him in all conditions, and to make them aware of this world and its transience and its passing, that none may grieve at its loss nor rejoice in its existence. By the life of the Beloved! It shall perish, and naught shall endure save what hath been ordained for every soul by God, the Lord of all names. The glory of God be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and love thee and upon the assured ones among the loved ones of God. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>This is the Call of the All-Glorious which is proclaimed from the Supreme Horizon in the Prison of ’Akka</p>
<p>He is the Expounder, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>God, the True One, testifieth and the Revealers of His names and attributes bear witness that Our sole purpose in raising the Call and in proclaiming His sublime Word is that the ear of the entire creation may, through the living waters of divine utterance, be purged from lying tales and become attuned to the holy, the glorious and exalted Word which hath issued forth from the repository of the knowledge of the Maker of the Heavens and the Creator of Names. Happy are they that judge with fairness.</p>
<p>O people of the earth!</p>
<p>The first Glad-Tidings which the Mother Book hath, in this Most Great Revelation, imparted unto all the peoples of the world is that the law of holy war hath been blotted out from the Book. Glorified be the All-Merciful, the Lord of grace abounding, through Whom the door of heavenly bounty hath been flung open in the face of all that are in heaven and on earth.</p>
<p>The second Glad-Tidings</p>
<p>It is permitted that the peoples and kindreds of the world associate with one another with joy and radiance. O people! Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship. Thus hath the daystar of His sanction and authority shone forth above the horizon of the decree of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The third Glad-Tidings concerneth the study of divers languages. This decree hath formerly streamed forth from the Pen of the Most High: It behooveth the sovereigns of the world�“may God assist them�”or the ministers of the earth to take counsel together and to adopt one of the existing languages or a new one to be taught to children in schools throughout the world, and likewise one script. Thus the whole earth will come to be regarded as one country. Well is it with him who hearkeneth unto His Call and observeth that whereunto he is bidden by God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>The fourth Glad-Tidings</p>
<p>Should any of the kings�“may God aid them�”arise to protect and help this oppressed people, all must vie with one another in loving and in serving him. This matter is incumbent upon everyone. Well is it with them that act accordingly.</p>
<p>The fifth Glad-Tidings</p>
<p>In every country where any of this people reside, they must behave towards the government of that country with loyalty, honesty and truthfulness. This is that which hath been revealed at the behest of Him Who is the Ordainer, the Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>It is binding and incumbent upon the peoples of the world, one and all, to extend aid unto this momentous Cause which is come from the heaven of the Will of the ever-abiding God, that perchance the fire of animosity which blazeth in the hearts of some of the peoples of the earth may, through the living waters of divine wisdom and by virtue of heavenly counsels and exhortations, be quenched, and the light of unity and concord may shine forth and shed its radiance upon the world.</p>
<p>We cherish the hope that through the earnest endeavours of such as are the exponents of the power of God�“exalted be His glory�”the weapons of war throughout the world may be converted into instruments of reconstruction and that strife and conflict may be removed from the midst of men.</p>
<p>The sixth Glad-Tidings is the establishment of the Lesser Peace, details of which have formerly been revealed from Our Most Exalted Pen. Great is the blessedness of him who upholdeth it and observeth whatsoever hath been ordained by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The seventh Glad-Tidings</p>
<p>The choice of clothing and the cut of the beard and its dressing are left to the discretion of men. But beware, O people, lest ye make yourselves the playthings of the ignorant.</p>
<p>The eighth Glad-Tidings</p>
<p>The pious deeds of the monks and priests among the followers of the Spirit1�“upon Him be the peace of God�”are remembered in His presence. In this Day, however, let them give up the life of seclusion and direct their steps towards the open world and busy themselves with that which will profit themselves and others. We have granted them leave to enter into wedlock that they may bring forth one who will make mention of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of the Exalted Throne.</p>
<p>The ninth Glad-Tidings</p>
<p>When the sinner findeth himself wholly detached and freed from all save God, he should beg forgiveness and pardon from Him. Confession of sins and transgressions before human beings is not permissible, as it hath never been nor will ever be conducive to divine forgiveness. Moreover such confession before people results in one’s humiliation and abasement, and God�“exalted be His glory�”wisheth not the humiliation of His servants. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Merciful. The sinner should, between himself and God, implore mercy from the Ocean of mercy, beg forgiveness from the Heaven of generosity and say:</p>
<p>O God, my God! I implore Thee by the blood of Thy true lovers who were so enraptured by Thy sweet utterance that they hastened unto the Pinnacle of Glory, the site of the most glorious martyrdom, and I beseech Thee by the mysteries which lie enshrined in Thy knowledge and by the pearls that are treasured in the ocean of Thy bounty to grant forgiveness unto me and unto my father and my mother. Of those who show forth mercy, Thou art in truth the Most Merciful. No God is there but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Lord! Thou seest this essence of sinfulness turning unto the ocean of Thy favor and this feeble one seeking the kingdom of Thy divine power and this poor creature inclining himself towards the daystar of Thy wealth. By Thy mercy and Thy grace, disappoint him not, O Lord, nor debar him from the revelations of Thy bounty in Thy days, nor cast him away from Thy door which Thou hast opened wide to all that dwell in Thy heaven and on Thine earth.</p>
<p>Alas! Alas! My sins have prevented me from approaching the Court of Thy holiness and my trespasses have caused me to stray far from the Tabernacle of Thy majesty. I have committed that which Thou didst forbid me to do and have put away what Thou didst order me to observe.</p>
<p>I pray Thee by Him Who is the sovereign Lord of Names to write down for me with the Pen of Thy bounty that which will enable me to draw nigh unto Thee and will purge me from my trespasses which have intervened between me and Thy forgiveness and Thy pardon.</p>
<p>Verily, Thou art the Potent, the Bountiful. No God is there but Thee, the Mighty, the Gracious.</p>
<p>The tenth Glad-Tidings</p>
<p>As a token of grace from God, the Revealer of this Most Great Announcement, We have removed from the Holy Scriptures and Tablets the law prescribing the destruction of books.</p>
<p>The eleventh Glad-Tidings</p>
<p>It is permissible to study sciences and arts, but such sciences as are useful and would redound to the progress and advancement of the people. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Ordainer, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The twelfth Glad-Tidings</p>
<p>It is enjoined upon every one of you to engage in some form of occupation, such as crafts, trades and the like. We have graciously exalted your engagement in such work to the rank of worship unto God, the True One. Ponder ye in your hearts the grace and the blessings of God and render thanks unto Him at eventide and at dawn. Waste not your time in idleness and sloth. Occupy yourselves with that which profiteth yourselves and others. Thus hath it been decreed in this Tablet from whose horizon the daystar of wisdom and utterance shineth resplendent.</p>
<p>The most despised of men in the sight of God are those who sit idly and beg. Hold ye fast unto the cord of material means, placing your whole trust in God, the Provider of all means. When anyone occupieth himself in a craft or trade, such occupation itself is regarded in the estimation of God as an act of worship; and this is naught but a token of His infinite and all-pervasive bounty.</p>
<p>The thirteenth Glad-Tidings</p>
<p>The men of God’s House of Justice have been charged with the affairs of the people. They, in truth, are the Trustees of God among His servants and the daysprings of authority in His countries.</p>
<p>O people of God! That which traineth the world is Justice, for it is upheld by two pillars, reward and punishment. These two pillars are the sources of life to the world. Inasmuch as for each day there is a new problem and for every problem an expedient solution, such affairs should be referred to the Ministers of the House of Justice that they may act according to the needs and requirements of the time. They that, for the sake of God, arise to serve His Cause, are the recipients of divine inspiration from the unseen Kingdom. It is incumbent upon all to be obedient unto them. All matters of State should be referred to the House of Justice, but acts of worship must be observed according to that which God hath revealed in His Book.</p>
<p>O people of Bahá! Ye are the dawning-places of the love of God and the daysprings of His loving-kindness. Defile not your tongues with the cursing and reviling of any soul, and guard your eyes against that which is not seemly. Set forth that which ye possess. If it be favorably received, your end is attained; if not, to protest is vain. Leave that soul to himself and turn unto the Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord and strife. The hope is cherished that ye may obtain true education in the shelter of the tree of His tender mercies and act in accordance with that which God desireth. Ye are all the leaves of one tree and the drops of one ocean.</p>
<p>The fourteenth Glad-Tidings</p>
<p>It is not necessary to undertake special journeys to visit the resting-places of the dead. If people of substance and affluence offer the cost of such journeys to the House of Justice, it will be pleasing and acceptable in the presence of God. Happy are they that observe His precepts.</p>
<p>The fifteenth Glad-Tidings</p>
<p>Although a republican form of government profiteth all the peoples of the world, yet the majesty of kingship is one of the signs of God. We do not wish that the countries of the world should remain deprived thereof. If the sagacious combine the two forms into one, great will be their reward in the presence of God.</p>
<p>In former religions such ordinances as holy war, destruction of books, the ban on association and companionship with other peoples or on reading certain books had been laid down and affirmed according to the exigencies of the time; however, in this mighty Revelation, in this momentous Announcement, the manifold bestowals and favors of God have overshadowed all men, and from the horizon of the Will of the Ever-Abiding Lord, His infallible decree hath prescribed that which We have set forth above.</p>
<p>We yield praise unto God�“hallowed and glorified be He�”for whatsoever He hath graciously revealed in this blessed, this glorious and incomparable Day. Indeed if everyone on earth were endowed with a myriad tongues and were to continually praise God and magnify His Name to the end that knoweth no end, their thanksgiving would not prove adequate for even one of the gracious favors We have mentioned in this Tablet. Unto this beareth witness every man of wisdom and discernment, of understanding and knowledge.</p>
<p>We earnestly beseech God�“exalted be His glory�”to aid the rulers and sovereigns, who are the exponents of power and the daysprings of glory, to enforce His laws and ordinances. He is in truth the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful, He Who is wont to answer the call of men.</p>

<p>He that is mentioned in the heart of Baha!</p>
<p>The mention of thy Lord’s mercy unto His servant, that he may be established in the Cause in such wise that the call of every remote polytheist shall fail to perturb him. Blessed art thou, O servant, for having freed thyself from the depths of vain imaginings and attained unto the recognition of thy Lord, while most of the people remained veiled therefrom, and for having drunk from the Kawthar of recognition, a single drop of which purifieth every pure and sound heart.</p>
<p>Verily, they who have denied God in these days are those whom the Names have deluded, after We had bidden them to detach themselves therefrom when God would come with a wondrous Cause. We had revealed in the Bayan and enjoined upon its followers that they should not associate any partners with God when He would come with the truth in sublime beauty. Yet when He appeared in truth, they denied Him and rose up against Him with a tyranny that was grievous in its oppression.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Reflect upon that which befell Him Who came with the name of ’Ali in truth and appeared with a radiance manifest to all the worlds. The divines rose up against Him with such opposition as severed from it all likeness and similitude, and God is witness to this. They advanced arguments based on words which they attributed to the verses of the Furqan, then objected thereby to Him Who created them by His command, being utterly unaware of this and remaining steadfast in their opposition.</p>
<p>Among them were those who clung to the notion that what al-Baqir had related concerning the signs of the Manifestation had not appeared, and likewise what a?-?adiq had uttered they had not witnessed. Thereby did they deprive themselves of all good and stood at the brink of the pit of polytheism, bereft of truth. And among them were those who said: “It hath been established with us through multiple transmission, as set forth by the Imams of religion and the Four Gates, that the Qa’im will not be born but is living and will appear when God wisheth and willeth. But he who hath appeared was born, and we shall not believe in him even if he should bring forth every sign or manifest a matter that would render all worlds impotent.”</p>
<p>He Who came upon clouds of light saith: O people! Fear God and dispute not concerning the signs of God after their revelation, nor follow every sinful polytheist. Purify your ears from all that ye have heard, that ye may hearken unto that which is revealed unto Me from the sublime heaven of mighty glory. Look not unto that which is with you, but look with the Most Great Vision, for this is better for you, did ye but know. O people! The sun hath risen from its setting place; therefore shall no soul’s faith profit it. Fear God and be God-fearing in His religion. O people! Were ye not promised in all the Tablets the Day of God? Lo, it hath appeared in truth, and therein hath the Ancient Beauty been established upon a mighty throne of glory. After His manifestation, nothing shall profit you, even should ye cling to all the Manifestations, and this is a truth like unto the existence of God, were ye discerning in the matter.</p>
<p>Verily, they to whose words ye cling were created by My word, and none comprehendeth this save every sagacious one possessed of knowledge. Therefore are they all within Our grasp of power; We do with them as We please, and verily We have power over all things. That which is with you shall not profit you this Day; what shall profit you is that which proceedeth from Me, and I am the Powerful over whatsoever I will, with a sovereignty that encompasseth all the worlds. By God the Truth! Were We to take a handful of dust and desire to create the like of these, We would be able, were ye possessed of penetrating vision. Have ye not witnessed, O people […]</p>
<p>Behold how We ordained the Stone to be the object of adoration for all the servants from every direction, and exalted its mention amongst all, both small and great. Then when its appointed time was fulfilled, We removed from it the garment of acceptance. Can anyone say “why” or “wherefore”? Nay, by My Self, the Truth, were ye but possessed of knowledge concerning the mysteries of the Cause. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, doeth what He willeth in His dominion and shall not be asked of His doings. He hath ever been powerful over whatsoever He willeth. And was this glory inherent in this Stone itself? Nay, by Him Who caused the Spirit of Eternity to speak forth in the breast of Baha, rather was it from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Wise.</p>
<p>By God, O Our servant ’Abdu’r-Rahim! Mine eyes weep and My frame trembleth because of those who witness God’s favor in its utmost perfection, yet deny it and comprehend not God’s utterance. They object to God and justify their turning away by the same arguments used by the people of the Furqan, imagining themselves to be in the right while they are in error before God. Why do they not perceive in God’s Cause even as much as the husk of a date stone? I take God and His angels and His Messengers as witnesses that I have not failed in counseling them and in proclaiming this Cause which was witnessed at the right hand of the Throne.</p>
<p>Would that they had never heard My words nor opposed My Self! By God, O Rahim, in every moment there hath befallen Me from these people that which hath caused the hearts of the denizens of Paradise to burn, yet We have concealed it and been patient until God shall bring about His purpose, for verily He watcheth over all worlds. Ponder thou upon what hath been revealed unto thee, that perchance thou mayest draw forth from this ocean precious pearls of sanctity, and become acquainted with that which hath been concealed from most of the servants, whereby God may loose thy tongue to make mention of this Remembrance Whom the transgressors have imprisoned in this well, and that thou mayest aid this Wronged One Who hath no helper on earth save God, Who strengthened Him with the truth and sent Him unto all worlds with a manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>Say: O people, fear God and contend not with Him Whom God hath made to stand amidst His enemies as a proof unto all who are in the heavens and on earth, how much less against the verses revealed unto Him which cause every possessor of exalted knowledge to be bewildered at their revelation. Say: O leaders of the Bayan, do ye deny Him through Whom your realities were created and your names were exalted? Fear God and be steadfast in the Cause.</p>
<p>By God, the Truth! Were God to desire to adorn the bodies of all created things with the robe of Divine authority in one hour and remove it from them in another, He is able to do so, and this would not be difficult for God. Be ye ashamed before God and war not against His Self, deny not His power, dispute not His verses, and take not your idle fancies as objects of worship besides Him. Among these are those who love not the Day because their souls have grown accustomed to the Night, and when the Day appeareth it obliterateth its traces and radiance until no vestige thereof remaineth visible. Observe thou the stars - they shine in the night and glory in their radiance, seeing themselves as manifest, yet when the Day appeareth and the Sun shineth forth, their light and radiance are obliterated as though they had never existed, and to this every person of insight beareth witness. Despite this, how can the Day […]</p>
<p>Say: The Day hath appeared and the Sun hath shone forth from the horizon of Manifestation, obliterating thereby the traces of every exalted grace save whom thy Lord hath willed, and He was, at that moment, in the most exalted Paradise, by God’s leave, filled with joy. O servant! By God, they who have not attained today to the recognition of God and His good-pleasure - these have no light. Rather, darkness itself fleeth from them and seeketh refuge with God from their darkness and unbelief. And thy Lord is, to what I say, a witness.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Be not proud before God, nor let names beguile you from turning unto Him through Whose command the suns of names have shone forth from a holy and wondrous horizon. And We complain unto God of the mirrors that behold not My beauty except through their own colors, imagining in themselves concerning God that which beseemeth them not. Thus have We informed thee with truth that thou mayest stand firm in the Cause in these days wherein the feet of every mighty man have slipped from the Path, save him whom the hand of grace hath seized and delivered from the darknesses of fancy, causing him to dwell beneath the shade of a sublime and lofty Tree.</p>
<p>O Rahim! Have mercy upon thyself, then upon the souls of the servants. Verily, thy mercy towards them is to teach them the Cause. Arise then, and tarry not for even a moment. Open thy lips in remembrance of thy Lord in such wise that shouldst thou be opposed by all who are in the heavens and on earth, thou wouldst behold them as though no one among them were worthy of mention. Rend asunder all veils, then speak between earth and heaven that wherewith the Spirit will aid thee from the presence of One mighty and wise.</p>
<p>Soon will Satan come unto you with that which will prevent you from the remembrance of God and His sovereignty. Then turn away from him and face God with a radiant countenance. This is of the tidings of the unseen which We have revealed unto thee that thou mayest be clear-sighted in the Cause.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Is there any doubt concerning God after He hath appeared with all signs? Fie upon you, and upon your sight, and upon your minds! Ye have emerged from one fancy only to be afflicted with a greater one. Then shall ye find no helper for yourselves in God. Hear My words and take not God in mockery, nor His Cause in vain. By the True One! There is no refuge today for anyone from God’s Cause and His proof. All things proclaim this, though none hear it save those endowed with wondrous hearing.</p>
<p>O servant! Rend the veils asunder through the power of thy Lord, the Chosen One, and pay no heed to the idolaters and what issueth from their mouths, for they have disbelieved after having believed. Therefore do all atoms curse them, and behind them a truthful and knowing tongue. Remember from Our presence those servants who are there, who have taken today for themselves a path unto God. And glory be upon thee if thou remainest steadfast in thy Lord’s Cause and art illumined with the lights of His countenance.</p>

<p>He is the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting! Blessed and exalted be His station!</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the One Who stands without decline, Who endures without transition, Who transcends all description and utterance, Who is sanctified from all peers and likenesses. The essence of His being cannot be comprehended by minds, nor can His reality be attained. The sun of His power is exalted above setting, and the sovereignty of His Cause is sanctified from decline and obscurity. He it is through Whose Most Great Name the world has been conquered and through Whose most perfect and complete proof the nations have been encompassed. None can resist His bidding, none can stay His judgment, none can frustrate His decree, and none can oppose His will. He has illumined existence with the lights of knowledge and understanding, and has kindled within the visible world the lamp of wisdom and utterance. Through this has He guided His servants to the source of guidance, and transformed them from the left hand of rancor and opposition to the right hand of fellowship and unity. His power has ever been triumphant, His might ever-subduing, His dominion ever-manifest, and His glory ever-resplendent. He ordains whatsoever He willeth and decreeth whatsoever He pleaseth. He is the Mighty, the Peerless.</p>
<p>O my God, my Lord, my Support, my Hope and my Trust! How can I make mention of Thee, when I behold Thee sanctified above all remembrance? How can I describe Thy power, when I see Thee exalted above all minds and thoughts? How can my feeble cry ascend to the court of Thy mighty power, and how can my weak, abject praise rise to the heaven of Thy sovereign strength? What befits me in my weakness and poverty to describe Thy Being, O Master of the Kingdom of might and power, or to define Thy Self, O Sovereign of the Realm of glory and grandeur? With what tongue shall I invoke Thee that it may be worthy of the court of Thy supreme majesty, and with what utterance shall I describe Thee that it may befit the threshold of Thy grandeur and power? I am bewildered, and the knowers are bewildered; I am perplexed, and those who describe Thee are perplexed; I am astonished, and those who praise Thee are astonished. By Thy glory, O my Hope, before the kingdom of Thy power I see in myself naught but sheer impotence, and in the face of the sovereignty of Thy permanence, utter evanescence. My mention of Thee and my rising to praise Thee are but in obedience to Thy command and in submission to Thy decree. Otherwise, what am I in my poverty to stand forth in remembrance of Him Whose name is exalted above all mention, and Whose command transcends all description and thought?</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and King of the secrets of the seen and unseen, to manifest in the contingent world that which shall rend asunder the veils of the veiled, remove the imaginings of the doubters, and transform through might the weakness of the wavering ones, and through assurance the agitation of the fearful ones. Thou hast, O my God, revealed Thy Cause, sent down Thy decree, made clear Thy path, and set forth Thy proof in such wise that were anyone to be fair, he would find no refuge save in turning to Thee, and would see no shelter save in entering Thy presence, in acknowledging Thy oneness and confessing Thy singleness. Yet due to the weakness in the hearts of Thy servants and their fear of the malice of the oppressors and the antagonists, none have turned to Thee save those whose hearts Thou didst create from the tablets of power and assurance, and whose heads Thou didst adorn with the crowns of knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee by Thy hidden Name and Thy treasured Secret to lift from all eyes the veils of doubt and suspicion, that every seeing one may behold Thee seated upon the throne of glory and grandeur, and every discerning one may see Thee established upon the seat of power and loftiness, and may perceive the signs of Thy manifestation in Thy days, and may know the mysteries of Thy Cause in Thy time, and may follow Thee in that which Thou hast commanded through Thy grace in Thy firm Book and decisive Speech. Strengthen, O God, Thy loved ones who have turned to the horizon of Thy Cause, who have detached themselves from all else but Thee, and who have arisen to serve Thee in such wise as to exalt their stations in Thy dominion and kingdom and to elevate their remembrance in Thy realm and heaven. Preserve them, O God of existence and King of the seen and unseen, from the evil of those who have forgotten Thee and have removed themselves from the precincts of Thy nearness, and adorn them every day, nay every moment, with the robes of Thy grace and the mantles of Thy bounty, and give them to drink of the pure water of nearness and reunion, and the sweet spring of meeting and attainment in the day of return. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>O thou who art immersed in the ocean of love and who hast ascended unto the atmosphere of the knowledge of thy Lord, the Possessor of all creation! There hath reached this servant that whose exterior was adorned with the traces of ink and whose interior with the subtleties of love and unity. From its hidden allusions I perceived the degrees of thy turning unto thy Lord, the Lord of all creation, and from its veiled symbols I recognized the stations of thy humility and lowliness before the presence of the Divine Unity. Blessed art thou and blessed is he whose pen hath moved in such wise as to diffuse the fragrance of sincerity and of turning unto his Lord, the Mighty, the Most Exalted. And blessed be the spirit of him who hath arisen to serve the Cause of his Lord, the Lord of Names, and who hath conveyed unto the seekers that whereby they have attained the shore of immortality, detached from the vicissitudes of the realm of mortality. By thy life! I behold nothing more exalted than teaching the Cause, nor do I witness any bounty sweeter than it. Would that my Lord, the Most Glorious, might enable me to raise aloft the standards of His Cause among all created things, and would that I might turn towards the lands to spread the signs of my Chosen Lord and to guide the seekers unto the paradise of the knowledge of God, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. God knoweth that I have never ceased to beseech Him for success and confirmation in this righteous Cause, and I implore Him to facilitate all affairs and remove the obstacles that have arisen from the deeds of the evil ones. The Cause is in His hands - He ordaineth whatsoever He willeth for whomsoever He pleaseth, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O thou who art beloved! When I beheld thy letter and pondered thy words, I presented myself at the Court of Glory and mentioned thee before the countenance of thy Bountiful Lord. Thereupon the ocean of grace surged and the fragrance of generosity was wafted, and there issued forth from the Source of Bounty that whose fragrance hath perfumed the world. His Word, exalted be His utterance and magnified His favor:</p>
<p>He Who is established upon the Throne of Proof</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto the splendors of the lights of presence and hast dwelt for a time beneath the pavilions of grandeur. At every moment the Supreme Pen is engaged and occupied in counsels and admonitions. The ocean of utterance is surging and the sun of proof is shining and manifest before all faces. Nevertheless, the people remain lost in the dark dust of idle fancies and are deprived and forbidden from the outpourings of the Day of God. Idle fancy is a dust that preventeth the eye from beholding, and vain imaginings are a barrier that hindereth from the truth. We beseech God that He may, through the hands of might, remove that which hindereth in these days. Through wisdom and utterance - by thy life - the hosts of wisdom have been and ever shall be victorious. We beseech God to confirm the loved ones of that land in that which is befitting. Today all must gather up the carpet of their own desires and hold fast unto the Will of God, and fix their gaze upon that which will cause the elevation and exaltation of God’s Cause. After thy return, numerous Tablets were sent, and in every Tablet were concealed the oceans of grace and loving-kindness, of knowledge and wisdom. Blessed are they that drink therefrom, and woe unto the heedless. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Aid Thy loved ones in that which will cause Thy Cause to be exalted, and ordain for them from the wonders of Thy bounty that which will attract them unto Thee and draw them nigh unto Thy court and remind them of Thy verses and kindle them with the fire of Thy love. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Convey the greetings of the Wronged One to the friends and illumine all with the lights of God’s grace. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who hearken unto thy words concerning this Cause, whereby the hearts of all things were troubled and the pillars of all beings were shaken, save those who cast the world behind them and turned unto God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Great, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, thou hast in all conditions been the recipient of the favors of the Beloved, the Most High, and hast been honored by His grace. It behooveth thee to thank Him at all times and to arise to mention and praise Him amongst the peoples of the world.</p>
<p>Regarding the answers to the questions which thou hadst written about: Some days after thy departure, one copy of the aforementioned questions, together with the answers to thy questions, was sent in the handwriting of Zein, upon him be the Glory of God and His grace, for thy sake. Surely it must have reached thee and thou must have perused it. Likewise, certain other questions were submitted and answers were revealed; a copy of these also will be sent - append them to the previous parts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, mention and glorify Haji M.H., upon him be the Glory of God, who attained the presence with thee, with wondrous and sublime remembrances from this servant. We beseech God to strengthen him at all times and to ordain for him that which is best with Him. Verily, He is the Generous, the Bestower.</p>
<p>As for the Bookbinder who was engaged in service in this land for about a year, and was blessed with divine bounties and was granted permission to return - it was decided that he would occasionally write and send news of conditions. A letter was received from him after his departure, but after his arrival in the land of T, no further letter from him has been observed. An answer to that letter was sent, but its receipt is not yet known. Remember and glorify him with wondrous remembrances from this servant, and inquire about his circumstances. His services and labors are ever before our sight and remembered. We beseech God to ordain for him every good thing He has promised to His loved ones in His Book.</p>
<p>Regarding the volume of Persian Tablets thou hadst written about, its sending depends upon permission and will. The copy of the Blessed Tablet which thou hadst requested will certainly be sent if it is found. Finally, remember and glorify the friends with wondrous and sublime remembrances. We beseech God to ordain for thee every good thing decreed in His Book and to protect thee beneath His shadow from the evil of the wicked among His creatures. The Spirit and Glory be upon thee, upon thy family, and upon the steadfast servants of God. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Jalal, upon whom be the Glory of God! He is the Dawning-Place from the horizon of the heaven of utterance!</p>
<p>Praise befitteth the most holy and exalted Court of the Almighty Who was not deterred by the opposition of the opposers, the denial of the deniers, the tyranny of the oppressors, and the chains of the deceivers from His purpose. Through His Most Great Word, He guided the people of the mortal realm to the supreme horizon, made manifest the mysteries of the Resurrection and the signs of the Hour, and illumined those who have turned towards Him and are fair-minded with the lights of the Kingdom. Glorified be His power, exalted be His majesty, manifest be His proof, perfect be His favor, and complete be His testimony! Blessings and peace be upon the Hands of His Cause among His creatures, whom neither names prevented from drawing nigh unto the ocean of His bounty, nor the ornaments of the world from beholding His signs. These are the servants who have quaffed the choice wine of revelation and the Kawthar of immortality in His days - blessings from which waft the sweet savors of His generosity and munificence.</p>
<p>O Jalal! Some time ago that which was revealed especially for the loved ones, from whose fragrance the decayed bones were stirred and from whose breezes the realities of existence were moved and adorned. The loved ones in diverse lands each attained unto the ocean of divine utterance and were illumined with the light of recognition. The honored Siyyid ’Ali-i-Akbar appeared before Us and made mention of the loved ones in the land of Nun and Ya and other regions, and each was blessed with the Kawthar of the utterance of the Most Merciful and the sealed wine. His grace hath encompassed all and His mercy hath preceded all. We beseech God to aid the loved ones in those regions that they may detach themselves from the ladder of names and ascend unto the heaven of inner meanings. The companions of this Revelation have been and are such souls as were not deprived of what is with the Lord of the Beginning and the End by what is with the parties, and turned from what is with the peoples to what is with God. These are the dawning-places of divine power and the daysprings of heavenly steadfastness. Thy letter hath once again in these days arrived and attained unto the gaze of favor and audience.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-i-Aqa! Praise be to God that thou hast been illumined by the lights of the recognition of the Desired One of the worlds and hast quaffed from the Kawthar of utterance. Know thou the station of this bounty and say: Thine is the glory, O Lord of bounty, and Thine is the favor, O Master of all beings! I testify that Thou hast manifested that which was hidden in the treasury of infallibility and concealed from all creatures, and Thou hast guided this servant of Thine to Thy Most Great Announcement whereby the hearts of the nations were stirred. I beseech Thee not to debar me from the gate of Thy generosity and bounty and from the ocean of Thy verses. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-i-Hasan! The deeds of some have become the cause of grief. Today the helpers of the Cause of God are goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct. Repeatedly hath this exalted word been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen: The harm to this Wronged One came not from the chains and fetters of the land of Ta, nor from the oppression of the tyrants of the land of Mim, but rather from those souls who claim to love Him and count themselves among the people of Baha, yet are found to be enslaved by self and passion. Today the loved ones must be illumined with the light of righteousness and set ablaze with the fire of detachment. This is the counsel of God - glorified be His majesty - both in the past and future. Well is it with them that act accordingly.</p>
<p>Render thanks unto the Desired One Who hath made mention of thee on this night and hath revealed in thy name that whereof every letter is a brilliant lamp and a shining light for the people of the earth. When thou attainest unto this bounty, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom of heaven and earth and Sovereign of might and glory!</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who is named ’Abdu’l-Karim, that he may give thanks to his Lord, the All-Bountiful, Who hath come with His mighty Command, despite every perfidious sinner and accursed enemy. The fire of treachery and hatred hath been kindled in the great city. One who claimed to love hath shut the eye of justice and opened the eye of tyranny, and another joined with him. They have committed that which hath caused the hearts of the detached to lament and wail. For the sake of wealth they turned away from the Self-Sufficing Lord. This Wronged One hath come for the sanctification and purification of souls, and hath accepted countless afflictions for the exaltation and advancement of His loved ones. Ask thou God, thy Lord, to assist them to return and to perform deeds whereby the station of God’s Word and His Cause may be exalted. Thus have We sent down the commandments and ordinances from the heaven of thy Lord’s utterance, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Blessed art thou for having turned unto Him and attained that which the near ones have attained.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of My loved ones in Shin, from whose soil wafteth the fragrance of love and fellowship through the appearance of the Lord of creation, Who gave tidings unto all of the Sovereign of all paths and took their covenant before His own. Thus may they give thanks unto their Lord, the Ever-Mindful, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Qasim! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee in this remote prison, that thou mayest know and be of the thankful. Say: O people of God! Aid your Lord through purifying yourselves. By My life! It behooveth every servant to abandon self and desire, and to hold fast unto righteousness and godliness, as bidden by God, the Creator of all things and the Lord of the kingdom of names. Today the enemies wait to observe unseemly deeds and to cast upon the servants that which preventeth them from turning unto God’s path and the tidings mentioned in His divine Books. Goodly deeds are the cause of the servants’ drawing nigh unto their Source. Repeatedly hath this exalted word been uttered by the Lord of all being: One pure deed will cause the essence of earth to transcend the heavens and reach the Dayspring of Revelation. O people of God! Strive! O people of God! Endeavor! that perchance the idols of self and desire may be destroyed through the power of detachment, and godliness may be established upon its throne. Soon shall extinction seize the world and all that is therein. One must prepare for God’s everlasting realms and become worthy of attaining His presence. This is His irrevocable decree. Blessed is he who holdeth fast unto it, and woe unto every heedless remote one.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Husayn! In these days complaints have come from every direction, and the Hands of the Cause have related strange tales concerning certain teachers which were and are unseemly. In truth I say, from whomsoever appeareth the fire of desire and passion, he is not of the Truth, and never shall be. The teacher must be adorned with the ornament of detachment, godliness, trustworthiness and piety. This is the command of God, before and after. Blessed is the servant whom desire hath not kept back from the Lord of all being. In the Hidden Words We said: O thou who art fair in appearance yet inwardly defiled! Thou art like unto clear but bitter water, which to outward seeming is crystal pure but of which, when tested by the divine Assayer, not a drop is accepted. The sun’s reflection is visible in both dust and mirror, but know that the difference between them is as vast as the distance from the highest star to the earth, nay, immeasurably greater. The influence of words hath ever depended and shall depend upon sanctification of self. Blessed art thou, for My Pen hath moved to make mention of thee in My prison, at a time when sorrows have encompassed Me from all directions through those who follow their desires and attribute themselves to this hallowed, mighty and wondrous station.</p>
<p>O Abbas! Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having enabled me to hold fast to Thy sure handle and to cling to the hem of Thy garment. I beseech Thee by Thy greatness and Thy sovereignty, and by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge, to make me so steadfast in Thy love that neither the doubts of the hypocrites may hinder me from drawing nigh unto Thee, nor the whisperings of the froward keep me back from turning to the lights of Thy countenance. O Lord! Strengthen my heart through Thy power, and illumine my sight with the light of Thy countenance. Thou, verily, art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and Who is the Supreme Ruler over all who are in earth and heaven. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Most Bountiful.</p>
<p>O My Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Haji Mirza, that he may drink from the Word of God the Kawthar of immortality and may recognize the station of this Announcement through which the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath been wafted throughout all possibility. Cast away what the people possess and take what We have revealed unto thee with a power that the oppression of the wicked cannot weaken. We have made mention of Our loved ones, both before and after, in such wise as hath illumined the horizons. O people of Baha! Beware lest the veils of names withhold you from God, the Revealer of mysteries. All must arise with complete dedication to serve the Lord of mankind. This is My counsel. Blessed is he who hath heard and acted upon that which hath been commanded by God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O Jalal! Repeatedly hast thou been blessed to hearken unto the divine call. We beseech God to aid all to perform such deeds as would attract hearts and exalt His Word. Today, goodly deeds and character, together with divine wisdom, are the helpers of His Cause. The events that transpired in Muharram in Iraq have caused upheaval and clamor, and likewise in another place, for the people know not that a different matter hath occurred and conditions have changed due to a new development. Therefore, those who have drunk from the wine of wisdom must observe wisdom and refrain from that which causeth shock and perturbation of hearts and minds, until such time as God shall bring about His purpose and reveal its hour. Likewise, words that cause flight and denial are not permitted. The servants must be educated like children - first with gentle nourishment until they progress to meat and its like. Convey My greetings to the loved ones. The handmaidens of God and those related to thee have been and are remembered. Give glad-tidings to all from Me. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Glory be upon My loved ones and My handmaidens, and upon all who are steadfast and upright.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>Praise and glory befit the friends of God, exalted be His majesty, who, detached from all else, have arisen to serve the Cause with such steadfastness that no sitting was seen in their standing - nay, even in their repose they stand upright. Exalted are their stations and sublime their ranks in the presence of God, their Creator, their Fashioner, their Quickener, their Slayer, their Strengthener, their Revealer, and their Guide. These are the men who have ever championed the Cause in the arena of utterance. The heroes of the world are as sparrows before them, and the clamor of the nations in their glorious presence is but as a croaking. These are the horsemen of the field and the helpers of the Purpose of all worlds. With the finger of certitude they have rent asunder the veils of idle fancies and shattered the idols. The chains of vain imaginings of the world’s peoples did not hold them back from the Most Exalted Pen. They have attained true understanding and are adorned with spiritual perception. These are the servants of whom He says they are the treasures of the earth and its repositories, for they are the pearls of wisdom and utterance and the trust of the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who recognizes them, attains their presence, serves them, and turns his face toward their countenances.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of both the seen and the unseen, Who art established upon the throne of grandeur in Thy praiseworthy station! I beseech Thee by the light of Thy countenance through which all lights have shone forth, and by the breathings of Thy love among the chosen ones, to assist Thy loved ones to mention Thee before the faces of all religions with wisdom and utterance. O Lord! Prevent not Thy chosen ones from turning to the horizon whence the sun of Thy presence hath shone forth, and deprive them not from arising before the door of Thy bounty and generosity. O Lord! Thou seest them turning toward the direction of Thy prison and holding fast to the cord of Thy grace. Ordain for them through Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of both this world and the next. Then write down for them the reward of attaining Thy presence, O Thou Who art the Lord of all names and the Creator of heaven. There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letters of that spiritual friend arrived repeatedly. Some were answered as time and opportunity permitted, while others were delayed due to the abundance of the revelation of divine verses, until some time ago when the beloved of the heart, His Holiness the Name of Bounty, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, sent a letter to the Most Holy Court. This servant presented it before His presence and it was honored to be heard, yet its answer was also delayed until these days when repeatedly my beloved, His Holiness the Name of Bounty, upon him be God’s grace and favors, beseeched from the heaven of the will of the Lord of all beings for a response. On this day, which is the last day of the revered month of Rajab, that letter was honored to be heard before the Throne, and afterward the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these sublime words, blessed and exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Speaker, the All-Knowing […]</p>
<p>O Abdu’l-Husayn! The Wronged One of the world proclaims: Today the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree is raised on high, and the Most Exalted Pen speaks from the highest horizon of the world. The earth is changed to another earth and the heaven to another heaven, yet the people of the world remain heedless and veiled. The dwellers of the graves have arisen at the breath of revelation of the Self-Subsisting Lord, while the living souls are seen as if dead. The intoxication of pride and heedlessness has encompassed the world and deprived it of the Ancient Lord. Blessed are the party of God, the people of Baha, who are like unto the surging ocean and like unto the sun, radiant and luminous. The darkness of the people of the Bayan does not hold them back from the light, nor do the doubts of the people of allusions deprive them of the horizon of the All-Merciful. Their hearts are sanctified from rancor and hatred. They hold fast to the cord of grace and cling to the hem of justice. The clamor of the vain ones has not prevented them from the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. They stand for God, speak for God, and turn their gaze toward God.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the friends in those regions on behalf of the Wronged One and give them the glad tidings of the favor of the Desired One of the world. Say: O party of God! Today the fragrance of divine revelation is diffused throughout the world and the spiritual breeze wafts at dawn. By the life of God, it imparts awareness and bestows eternal life! Say: Deprive not yourselves and veil not yourselves from the Lord of all possibilities through the idle fancies of the people of the Bayan. Reflect upon the former party and their utterances - what they proclaimed from their pulpits, what claims they made, and what became manifest from them on the Day of Reckoning. If you become aware of the deeds of those heedless souls and their fruits, you will remain steadfast on the divine path in such wise that names will neither prevent nor deprive you from the Lord of inner meanings.</p>
<p>O Abdu’l-Husayn! Repeatedly have you been blessed with the grace of God, exalted be His glory. We beseech God to aid you in that which befits His Cause and is worthy of His days. Convey greetings to the handmaiden of God. Say: Praise be to God that you have been blessed with the mention of the Wronged One, both before and after. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the new handmaiden. Blessed is the handmaiden who has turned, heard, and attained to the knowledge of God, the Lord of the worlds. O handmaiden of God! The whole world has been created for the knowledge of the Ancient Lord and has been brought from nothingness into being. Yet in the divine days and the manifestation of the Eternal Beloved, all were found heedless and veiled save a few. Praise the Ancient Lord Who guided you, aided you, and bestowed guidance upon you. Since you have attained and possess the pearls of divine love, guard them from thieves and betrayers. This is the counsel of the Wronged One of the horizons. Know thou the station of the party of God, both men and women, and be occupied with praising and thanking the Lord of all beings.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever been, or is now, capable of recording the divine grace? Nay, by His own Self, the One Who dominates all who are on earth and in heaven! Every name that has attained the honor of hearing has been adorned and distinguished by the verses of God. Who is that lost one whom His grace has not sought? Praise be to God that those souls mentioned in that spiritual friend’s letter have attained the verses of God. This evanescent servant beseeches the Eternal Truth to aid them to remain steadfast in His Cause and to grant them their portion and share from the oceans of inner meanings that lie treasured and hidden within the Words of God. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets, in Arabic and Persian, were revealed specifically for his honor Aqa Siyyid ’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God. As commanded, this servant wrote and sent them. God willing, they will attain unto them. And regarding their request to sell their possessions and turn toward the Most Exalted Horizon, after this was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, these manifest verses were revealed from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful’s utterance. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>The sale of possessions is not permitted. We beseech God to aid him to serve the Cause and to record the recompense of attainment unto His presence with the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book. Verily, He has power over all things. O Siyyid-i-Qabil-’Ali! Say: My God, my God! Deny me not the breezes of Thy days, and deprive me not of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. O Lord! Thy separation and remoteness have destroyed me, and the fire of Thy love and affection has consumed me. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Signs, by the rustling of the Sadratu’l-Muntaha, and by the squeaking of Thy Most Exalted Pen, to ordain for me in each world of Thy worlds that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and benefit me through Thy bounty and favors. O Lord! Thou knowest what is in my heart, my soul, and my being, while I know not what is with Thee. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. I lay before Thy presence that which none of Thy chosen ones has uttered: My Lord! Leave me not alone, for Thou art the Best of inheritors, or manifest through me that whereby my remembrance shall endure through the eternity of Thy Best Names and Thy Most Exalted Attributes. Verily, Thou art the Almighty Whom nothing can frustrate and no matter can hinder. Thou doest what Thou pleasest and ordainest what Thou willest. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>His is the grace and bounty, and His the bestowal and justice! The world hath been illumined by the splendors of the Sun of utterance of the All-Merciful, yet most hearts remain in their own darkness. This servant is bewildered in all conditions. Indeed, the recompense of their deeds hath prevented all and deprived everyone of their due recognition of the Intended One. This servant conveyeth greetings and glorification to the honored Siyyid, upon him be the glory of God, and likewise to the honored Khan, the host, upon him be the glory of God, and to the other friends. Blessed are they who today have been designated by the Most Exalted Pen as the party of God and have attained this most great kinship. All must recognize the worth of this supreme bounty, this eternal blessing and everlasting table. They must remain firm and steadfast in the Cause of the Lord of the Day of Judgment with perfect unity and accord. O friends of Truth! The people are without fairness and are worshippers of idle fancies. For years they have worshipped and bowed down before the idols of vain imaginings. I beseech the True One, the Mighty, the Powerful, to protect His party and grant them the heavenly water of reality, that all may become intoxicated with the wine of knowledge and occupied with the remembrance of the Peerless Friend. The Command is in His grasp, and He is the All-Knowing, the Powerful, the All-Wise, the All-Judicious. A Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath also been revealed from the heaven of the will of the All-Merciful, specifically for the honored host. God willing, they will attain unto it and drink from its oceans of inner meanings. Peace and praise and remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon all who are steadfast and firm, and all who are constant and trustworthy. The Servant. On the first day of the month of Sha’ban the Great, 1303.</p>

<p>He it is Who hath moved all creation by the finger of His command!</p>
<p>A remembrance from the Remembered One to him who hath turned with his heart, confessed with his tongue, heard with his ear, and arisen with his feet to the remembrance of God and the service of His Cause in days wherein the Herald hath called out in all directions: “The Self-Subsisting hath come with the Kingdom of verses and His sealed nectar!” Beware, O people of the earth, lest ye deprive yourselves of the most pure nectar which the hands of the bounty of your Lord, the Ordainer, do proffer. Draw nigh with radiant faces, then drink thereof in His Name, the Mighty, the Loving. Thus hath the ocean of proof surged before all religions when the Pen of God, Lord of what was and what shall be, moved. Say: Fear ye God, O people, and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who hath come to you with the Tablet of proof and the Kawthar of utterance, then drink thereof through My remembrance, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>O Zein! Upon thee be the Glory of God, His mercy and His loving-kindness. The Most Great Branch hath appeared before the countenance of the Lord of mankind and mentioned thee. We have remembered thee with that whereby the hearts of the Concourse on High were attracted, and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise and the Supreme Heaven. Blessed is he who hath heard and recognized, and woe unto every heedless and veiled one.</p>
<p>O Zein! By My life and My Cause, every letter revealed from My Most Exalted Pen proclaimeth with the most loud voice in the kingdom of creation: “O concourse of earth and heaven! Open your eyes, for the Chosen One hath come with a sovereignty before which the sovereignty of the world cannot stand, and with a Command which the hosts of the nations cannot withhold.” To this testifieth every fair-minded one and every just one who hath spoken the truth concerning this Cause, whereby the limbs of all names have quaked and the heart of every heedless one who hath denied God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, hath been convulsed.</p>
<p>O Zein! There hath come before the Wronged One a leaf sent by one of My servants who heard My call and turned toward My direction. He was named Hassan by the tongue of Grandeur in this praiseworthy station. Give him glad tidings from Me and remind him of My verses. Say: O Hassan! Rejoice that thy mention hath flowed at this moment from the Pen of God, the Lord of the worlds. He hath sent thee from the palm tree of utterance the fresh dates of knowledge, and from the Tree of the Mount the melody of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Beloved. By My life! If thou wouldst hear with thine ear, it would cry out and say: “O people of earth and heaven! By God, the regions have been perfumed by the fragrance of utterance wafted from God, the Lord of existence. Cast the rejectors behind you and turn to the Word which, when it shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the Pen, caused those at the Mount to swoon upon the ground of extinction, save whom God willed, the Lord of the Frequented House.”</p>
<p>O Hassan! Behold and then mention what the tongues of the rejectors have uttered in this Promised Day. The Most Great Announcement hath come unto them, whereby the Books of God, both past and future, were adorned with verses that have filled the horizons and with evidences that have erased the traces of discord, yet most of the people perceive not. They have cast the sea behind them, sporting with the pond, and they understand not. Say: O people of Baha! Counsel the servants through deeds and character. This is what ye were commanded aforetime by God. Fear God and be not of those who see and deny. Say: Hear the call of God with your ears, then behold the Light shining from the horizon of the Cause with your eyes, nay rather with the eye of God, the Lord of the unseen and the seen. Verily, My Herald - upon him be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy - commanded all to look upon My verses with My eye, yet the people turned away from what he said and took for themselves a path to tyranny.</p>
<p>We have desired at this time to mention those whom thou didst mention, that the attraction of this remembrance might seize them in such wise that neither the ornaments of the world nor the wealth of kings and subjects shall withhold them.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! We have turned toward thee at this hour and make mention of thee in truth, as thy name was present before the Wronged One. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of My utterance from the direction of My prison, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thy call hath attracted me, Thy grace hath guided me, Thy bounty hath given me to drink, and Thy generosity hath encompassed me. I beseech Thee, O God of the world and Creator of nations, by Thy Most Great Name through which the fire of hatred was kindled in the breasts of the deceivers while the light of the Cause shone in the hearts of them that know, and by the Word at whose appearance all the books of the world submitted to it, to ordain for me through Thy All-Knowing Pen that which shall remain with me in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all affairs.</p>
<p>We make mention at this moment of thy brother as a grace from Us, and verily We are the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. The glory from Our presence be upon thee and upon him and upon thy spouse and upon them that are with thee among the people of Baha who were not hindered by the intimations of the heedless nor by the power of those who disbelieved in the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>We make mention at this moment of him who was named Siyyid ’Ali, that the breezes of My revelation may attract him and draw him nigh unto My glorious and wondrous Kingdom. O ’Ali! Hear the call from the direction of ’Akka. Verily it hath been raised in truth from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. We beseech God to inscribe for thee the reward of attaining His presence and standing before His countenance and arising to serve His wondrous Cause, and to aid thee in that whereby thy mention and thy name shall endure in His perspicuous Book. By the life of God! The Wronged One loveth to meet His loved ones, but the oppressors have intervened between Me and them and have committed that which hath caused the Faithful Spirit to lament. When thou drinkest the choice wine of My praise from the hand of My bounty, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! The wine of Thy utterance hath intoxicated me and the Kawthar of Thy knowledge hath attracted me. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the Speaker of the Mount spoke forth and the decree of resurrection appeared and the people of the graves arose, and by Thy standing and sitting, and by the breezes of Thy revelation and the sending down of Thy verses, to ordain for me the reward of those who have sought Thy station and circled round Thy throne and hearkened unto Thy call and beheld Thy horizon. O Lord! Thou seest the poor one hath sought the ultimate goal and the wronged one the manifestations of Thy justice, O Lord of all being and Sovereign of the throne on high and of the dust below. I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which shall make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love and acting according to what Thou hast sent down in Thy Books. Verily Thou art the Powerful One Who, when Thy power is manifested, doth erase the traces of the world’s power, and when the Sun of Thy Will doth shine forth, the wills of all nations are struck dumb. There is no God but Thee, the Powerful, the Mighty, and worthy to answer prayers.</p>
<p>He is the Compassionate from the horizon of the Prison.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! The letter of the honored Siyyid Muhammad, upon him be Baha, was presented before the Wronged One and was granted audience. Praise be to God that he hath repeatedly attained unto the divine verses. Today every word that appeareth from the Dayspring of God’s Will concerning His sincere ones and those near unto Him shall endure for as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endureth. O Muhammad! God willing, thou shalt hold fast unto wisdom and utterance and occupy thyself with teaching the Cause of God. Today the ocean of verses surgeth, and the heaven of proof is adorned with the stars of evidence, and from the heaven of the All-Merciful’s grace the rains of utterance and meaning have descended in such measure that those who circle round are unable to reckon them. Nevertheless, the deniers have spoken that which no oppressor hath ever spoken, to such extent that in Our presence one occupied himself with leading astray a heedless soul from the straight path. Thus do We recount unto thee what hath befallen Me at the hands of the heedless ones.</p>
<p>Say: O deniers! Like the former people, deprive not yourselves of the effulgent lights of the Dayspring of Revelation. Rend asunder the veils in the name of Truth and shatter the idols of vain imaginings with the arm of certitude. How long will ye worship fancy and until when will ye pursue vain imaginations? Today the breezes of God are wafting and the fragrances of revelation are diffused, and the tongue of utterance speaketh before the faces of all who are in the realm of being. Leave and take up - leave that which is with the people and take up that which cometh from the horizon of the heaven of God’s bounty. Today the fruits of the furthermost Tree are visible, the Mount is speaking in praise of the Lord of Revelation, and the Tree circleth round the House. Blessed is he who is fair in the Cause of God, and woe unto them that hesitate.</p>
<p>We make mention at this hour of him who is named Ali, that he may give thanks unto God, the Lord of the mighty throne, and We make mention of Our loved ones in Kha and Ra, and verily I am the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! We have made mention and continue to make mention of all the loved ones, and We counsel them to manifest supreme steadfastness. For twelve hundred years the people of Persia prided themselves over other religions through mention of the Successor, yet when the Dayspring of God’s Will and the Dawning-Place of divine light - through Whose word the realm of mystical knowledge, successorship and imamate was and is created - shone forth from the horizon of purpose, all assailed Him with the spears and arrows of hatred and rancor, and at last martyred Him. Until now they have not understood the station of the Day of God. Say: By the life of God! This is the Day wherein the Primal Point uttereth “I am the first of the worshippers” and the seat of the Throne is the point round which circle the Concourse on High. Say: Have mercy on yourselves and choose not eternal torment through love of fancies and idle imaginings. For the sake of God have We spoken and continue to speak, and for His sake do We summon all to the supreme horizon. Say: O people! Know with clear certainty that until ye pass beyond the river of names, ye shall not attain unto the ocean of meanings. This is a word that was hidden in the treasuries of My Most Exalted Pen, and We have revealed it in truth and sent it forth with justice. Blessed is he who hath heard and said: “I believe in God, the Possessor of the seen and unseen.”</p>
<p>Repeatedly hath this word flowed from the tongue of grandeur: “Blessed are the people who understand.” We beseech God to assist His loved ones that they may remind the people through their deeds and character, and guide them to the momentous News. The glory from Us be upon him who hath heard the call and said: “Yea, yea, O Lord of Names! Yea, yea, O Lord of mankind! Here am I, here am I, O Master of the Throne and earth, and Sovereign of the hereafter and the former days!”</p>

<p>He is the One Who stands through grace and speaks through justice!</p>
<p>Can anyone through My power and sovereignty set aside that which is other than Me and take up that which is commanded in My Book - the Book at whose revelation from the heaven of My Will the Mother Book itself bowed down in submission? Is there any that hath ears to hear My most sweet call raised from the Most Exalted Horizon in the Prison of ’Akka? Is there any wielding power and dominion who can, by My command, take My Tablet through a sovereignty that hath encompassed existence and a power that hath encompassed all created things?</p>
<p>O Husayn, upon thee be My glory! This is the day of supreme joy, for the Mount of God hath become a resting-place and Sinai hath been blessed to hear the utterance of the Lord of the Manifestation. Say: O people! The pavilion of Divine glory hath been raised in the most exalted station, and the banner of “Verily I am God” hath been hoisted upon the highest mountains. Deprive not yourselves! The sources of idle fancies and vain imaginings have ever, throughout the ages and centuries, brought upon the Daysprings of Revelation and the Dawning-places of the Cause that which is recorded and inscribed in the Books. Blessed are they that perceive and blessed are the fair-minded! Say: O people! Fear God and follow not the doubts of the suspicious ones. This is the day of the blessed word “the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.” This is the day when the chosen ones and the pure in heart weep and lament at His separation, while all beseech to attain His presence from the Peerless Bestower of Bounties. Know ye the value of this supreme bounty. He is the heavenly sustenance and the true Promised One Who was heralded and promised in God’s Book, both before and after. Behold the sea and its waves, the light and its effulgence, the sun and its radiance, and the Tree and its fruits! By the life of God! I have had no purpose save your guidance. From the earliest days until now I have been encompassed by countless afflictions, and all who are on earth bear witness to what hath been mentioned. Yet the deeds of the heedless souls have deprived them of sincerity and purity. O Husayn! Thou hast ever been blessed with grace. We beseech God to assist thee to become a manifestation of sanctity and holiness, that thou mayest efface the books of idle fancies and vain imaginings through the counsels and admonitions revealed in the Tablets. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Withhold not Thy servants from the ocean of Thy bounty, nor from the effulgences of the light of the Sun of Thy grace in Thy days. O Lord! They are Thy servants and Thy creation. If Thou shouldst chastise them, none can say “Why?” or “Wherefore?”, and if Thou shouldst forgive them, verily Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful, and Thou art the Compassionate, the Bountiful, the All-Generous, the Mighty, the Gracious.</p>
<p>Let fragrant breezes from the revelations waft upon the friends and gladden them. All are remembered in the presence of the Wronged One and are recipients of His grace. That which is essential and binding today is unity and harmony. We beseech God to unite their hearts, to draw them nigh unto Him, and to acquaint them with that which will exalt them in all the worlds of His worlds. Verily He is the Lord of the world and the Master of nations. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth as He pleaseth. There is none other God but He, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those who have laid hold on the Book of God with such strength as the hosts of the heedless and the cawing of the calamitous could not weaken. Praise be to God, the True King, the Manifest.</p>
<p>We wish to make mention in this exalted station of him who was named Farajullah, that this remembrance and utterance may draw him to the station of true knowledge and bring him near unto God, the Lord of all worlds. O thou who art mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One! We have manifested the Cause and revealed verses in such measure that pens are powerless to reckon them and souls are incapable of comprehending their limits. We have made known to all that which shall preserve and profit them. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear ye the All-Merciful. He hath come through Whose name the gates of grace, bounty and bestowals were opened before the faces of all who are in earth and heaven. Fear God and follow not the oppressors who have denied God’s proof and evidence, disbelieved in His signs, remained heedless of His sovereignty and turned away from His holy and glorious countenance. Take thou the cup of My utterance from the hand of My bounty, then drink from it in My Name, the Self-Subsisting over all who are in the heavens and on earth, and say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me to the Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Dayspring of Thy clear tokens, and for having sent down for me that which endureth through the everlastingness of Thy dominion and Thy realm. I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty which hath encompassed all created things and by Thy command which hath surrounded all existence to make me steadfast and firm in Thy love and Thy Cause. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Qa’im-ud-Din! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Lord of all worlds. Cast aside what the people possess and take what hath been revealed in My perspicuous Book. Verily it will preserve thee, aid thee and bring thee near unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say: O people! Judge fairly by God concerning that which hath appeared in truth and be not of the heedless ones. He Who was promised in the Book of God hath come, Who was hidden in knowledge and concealed from the eyes of those who denied the Day of Judgment. Arise to serve My Cause by My command and be not of them that hesitate. We have opened before thy face the gates of knowledge with the key of utterance that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>By the life of God! The Glory (Baha) desireth naught but that which profiteth the servants. The Lord of creation beareth witness unto this. Blessed is he who hath inhaled the fragrance of the garment and hath attained to the recognition of this resplendent and luminous Light. When thou art seized by the rapture of utterance say:</p>
<p>Praise be to Thee, O my Lord, the All-Merciful, for having turned toward me from the direction of Thy Prison and remembered me with that which nothing that changeth or perisheth can equal. I testify that Thy favor hath encompassed existence and Thy mercy hath preceded the seen and the unseen. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Wise, the All-Knowing. My God, my God! Illumine my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and brighten my sight with the splendor of Thy countenance. Then inscribe for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which befitteth Thy grace and bounty and beseemeth Thy manifestation in Thy days. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Bounteous.</p>
<p>O Pen of Eternity! Make mention of him who hath been named Shaykh-before-Muhammad, that he may inhale the sweet savors of the utterance of his Lord and be numbered with them that have prospered. O Shaykh! By the life of God! The eye of creation hath not witnessed the like of this Day, wherein the Lord of the worlds hath ascended the Most Great Throne and hath spoken that which hath enraptured Sinai, saying: “Blessed be the spot of earth that hath been ennobled by Thy footsteps and adorned by Thy mighty throne.” O Muhammad! Reflect upon the party of old. For years they prided themselves before all people in making mention of the Successor and the like. Yet when the light of Revelation illumined the horizon of the Bayan, they all rose in opposition and committed that from which all peoples of the world would dissociate themselves. Now again, similar parties have emerged who cling to names while being cut off from their Source, their Sovereign, their Sender and their Quickener. Thus have their souls enticed them to that which hath caused every discerning soul to lament. Say: O people of the Bayan! We were formerly of the Shi’ih. Now ye should reflect upon its fruits and consequences. Yea, when the Just Imam appeared, the pen of that treacherous and deceitful party was manifest, and on the Day of Judgment both high and low - that is, the learned and the ignorant - all gave the verdict to shed His most pure blood, and now too they occupy themselves with cursing and reviling the Truth from their pulpits. Say: O people of the Bayan! It is incumbent and obligatory upon every soul to protect the servants of God from former suspicions and fancies, lest perchance such parties raise anew the standard of tyranny in the land. Say: Fear God, O people, and be not of the wrongdoers. Cast aside suspicions and fancies, and turn ye unto this resplendent, gleaming, manifest and brilliant Light. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen warbled in this luminous thicket, from God, the Lord of all men. Blessed is he who hath heard and seen, and woe unto the heedless. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon them who have cast away all else save God and have turned unto Him, the Object of the knowledge of the mystics.</p>
<p>O Yahya! The Book hath come. Take hold of it with the power given thee by Us, in spite of every obstinate tyrant. Verily We have manifested that which was hidden from time immemorial and stored in the knowledge of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Say: O concourse of men! The Day hath come wherein He Who conversed with God hath seated Himself upon the throne of Revelation and the Herald hath called out from every direction: “Dominion and Kingdom and Power and Glory belong to God, the Lord of the mighty throne!” Say: O people of the Bayan! The horizons have been filled with the signs of your Lord, the King of the Day of the Covenant. Fear ye the All-Merciful and be not of them that hesitate. Arise to serve the Cause and be not of the ignorant. Those who have turned away from the Countenance are indeed in manifest loss. Blessed art thou, O Yahya, inasmuch as the Lord of the Kingdom of Names hath made mention of thee in the prison of ’Akka, a bounty from His presence, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Upon thee be the Glory of God! We have, on this blessed day when the realities of all things are in joy and delight through their encounter with the Lord of Names, made mention of the loved ones. Give them the glad-tidings of My remembrance of them, then recite unto them in such melodies as will draw unto them the hearts of the world. Verily thy Lord is the Speaker, the Rememberer, the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Make mention of My loved ones on My behalf, remind them of My verses, and illumine them with the lights of the kingdom of My wondrous utterance. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to draw them nigh unto Him, to aid them in exalting and raising high the Word amongst His servants, and to record for them in His mighty Book the recompense of those who are sincere. The Glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon My loved ones who have not cast behind them My covenant and My testament, and whom names have not prevented from turning toward the heaven of My recognition. Verily thy Lord is the Giver, the Munificent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>In the Name of the One True God! O friends of God in Sh and H! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One in luminous speech. He hath indeed mentioned you before in eloquent language, and He is the Omnipotent, the Mighty. The peoples of the world have been debarred from the Lord of Names by the doubts and intimations of the leaders, and have been deprived of the effulgent rays of the Sun of Revelation. Had the servants but witnessed with their own eyes and hearkened with their own ears, they would have attained unto that which hath been and ever shall be the cause of exaltation. This Wronged One counseleth you to fear God and to that whereby His Cause, the firm, the impregnable, may be uplifted. Put not your trust in every speaker, nor be assured by every visitor. Conquer the citadels of hearts with the hosts of deeds and character. God, exalted be His glory, hath relinquished sovereignty unto the kings, and hath made hearts the dawning-place of the radiant lights of the Sun of Revelation. This is His practice in this Cause, and ye shall never find any change or variation in His practice.</p>
<p>We beseech God to aid His Majesty the sovereign in protecting His flock and safeguarding them from the wolves of the earth. A just sovereign possesseth a great station in the sight of God and occupieth an exalted rank. By the life of God! The most excellent garment for the temple of sovereignty is the garment of justice. It is the supreme adornment and the most resplendent robe.</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Adorn the temple of the sovereign with the ornament of justice and his head with the crown of equity, that the horizons may be illumined by his light, his station, his manifestation and his effulgence.</p>
<p>One pearl of utterance revealed from the treasury of the Pen of the All-Merciful is greater, more precious, and more valuable than all the treasures of the earth and its jewels. Every person of insight beareth witness, and every person of hearing is aware of that which hath been mentioned. Implore ye God to aid and strengthen the sovereign. On several occasions he protected the oppressed from the wickedness of the oppressors in the lands of H and M and K and T. Were they to become aware of the purpose of this Revelation and the will and desire of God, exalted be His glory, they would arise to aid the Cause. This is the truth, there is no doubt therein. The Most Great Book of God beareth witness to this in the most exalted station.</p>
<p>O people of God! Defile not your hearing with unseemly utterances, and preserve your sight from the ophthalmia of vain imaginings. The unjust ones of the world have assailed this Wronged One from behind the veils like unto wolves, and with the sword of falsehood and calumny have sought to attain unto a station which God, exalted be His glory, hath sanctified from their comprehension. They have appeared with the utmost tyranny and injustice, and are occupied with misleading the hapless creatures. But for the Glory (Baha), who would arise before all faces? But for Him, who would raise up the Cause of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting? But for Him, who would proclaim with the most great call betwixt earth and heaven? Have they not beheld the waves of the ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance, or have they not heard the Most Great Word from the most exalted horizon? At all times the call hath been raised and the divine testimony hath appeared before all faces, and yet they are debarred from the Self-Subsisting Lord by their vain imaginings. This is that momentous news the mention of which hath been revealed from the heaven of God’s will in all former and latter Books. Well is it with the people who have recognized its station, who have attained unto its days, and who have aided His Cause with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Woe unto them that have turned away, unto the heedless, and unto the forsakers.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Light of the horizons and Illuminator of hearts and minds on the Day of Separation! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy most exalted horizon, by the manifestations of Thy grandeur amidst all beings, by the sighs of them that are nigh unto Thee, and the tears of the sincere ones, and by Thy Cause through which Thou hast subdued the nations, and by Thy sovereignty which hath encompassed the world, to ordain for Thy loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Thee, and to write down for them from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which befitteth the heaven of Thy bounty, the ocean of Thy grace, and the sun of Thy generosity. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who is named Ibrahim, that he may hear Thy most sweet melody and be of them that render thanks. O Ibrahim! Hearken unto the call of God, the True Sovereign, the Just, the Manifest. Verily it hath been raised up in truth from this most exalted Station, as a command from the presence of an All-Wise Ordainer. In each letter thereof lieth concealed an ocean of meanings and utterance. Blessed is he who hasteneth and draweth nigh, and taketh therefrom a cup in My Most Glorious Name, detached from the kingdom of creation, and drinketh thereof at one time in remembrance of Me and at another through My Name whereby the limbs of the polytheists have quaked.</p>
<p>O Ibrahim! Behold, then make mention of him who was named Kazim when he sought the place of sacrifice, yearning to attain the presence of the Lord of Names, and offered up his spirit, his body and his wealth in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. Then remember him who severed his own head, moved by the rapture of the Divine Call when he was present in Baghdad before the countenance of the Lord of all beings. He sacrificed his life to exalt the Word of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O Ibrahim! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. How many souls have offered up their spirits, their glory, their wealth and their comfort in the path of the One True Friend, while the heedless servants have concealed the mention of the deeds of these holy souls and these knights of the field of knowledge, wisdom and understanding, and instead make mention from their pulpits of the sacrifice of the previous Dispensation, taking pride therein. Say: O heedless ones! How long will ye remain deprived of the lights of the sun of justice and prevented from the waves of the ocean of equity? Beware lest these fleeting days withhold you from everlasting bounties, and beware lest this world occupy you from the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven. Say: Cast aside the people and what they possess, and take what hath been given you from the presence of God, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Ibrahim! Reflect upon the Most Great News and its grandeur, and likewise upon the heedlessness of those who have turned away among the people of the Bayan. Verily, he who stood before the Divine Countenance they have taken as a lord for themselves besides God. Lo! They are among the most lost in My perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>O Ibrahim! Convey My greetings to the loved ones in that land on behalf of the Wronged One, and illumine them with the light of the manifestations of the Luminary of Divine Command. Today the tree walketh and maketh mention with eloquent speech; the man standeth still while the mountain moveth; from water appeareth fire, and from fire floweth the Kawthar of utterance. What a world this is! God knoweth. We beseech God to assist you to turn unto Him in all conditions. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>The glory from Our presence be upon thee and upon thy family and thy children. Verily, We give them the glad-tidings of that which hath been sent down for them from the heaven of will and bounty, and ordained for them from My Most Exalted Pen. He is verily the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Muhammad, illumine him with the lights of My utterance and remind him of My verses. Then send down unto him that which will enable him to soar in this holy, mighty and wondrous atmosphere. O Muhammad! We have made mention of thee before, and at this hour through a perspicuous Tablet. We beseech God to assist thee and enable thee to do that which He loveth and is pleasing unto Him. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The people of Baha possess, in the sight of God, another station and another bounty, for they behold all besides God as non-existent and as naught. Names deter them not, nor do the doubts and intimations of the peoples of the earth become a barrier unto them. With celestial might have they set their faces toward the Most Glorious Horizon and have hearkened unto the most sweet rustling of the Supreme Pen. The clamor of the world is, to them, more contemptible than the croaking of frogs and the chirping of ants. They have passed beyond that which pertaineth unto the world and fix their gaze upon that which is with God.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! The oppressors have made God’s Cause the object of their derision, their sport and their play. They are occupied with their own desires, turning away from the dawning-places of the lights of the Day-Star of certitude. Thus have their souls deluded them with vain imaginings, and today they are numbered with the dead. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou hast rent asunder the veils, despite the people of idle fancies, and hast attained unto My choice sealed wine through My Self-Subsisting Name. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing. The splendor from Our presence be upon thee and upon thy children and thy kindred. God will soon raise up from among thy descendants one who will arise amidst the servants and remind them of God’s signs at the beginning and at the end.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Khanlar, that the fragrances of remembrance may draw him to the horizon wherefrom hath shone forth the Day-Star of God’s loving-kindness, the Goal of them that have knowledge. Say: O people! By God, the Day hath come and the Self-Subsisting calleth aloud from the Most Exalted Horizon. Draw nigh and be not of the heedless. Beware lest the books of men debar you from the Lord of creation, or the doubts of the nations from the Most Great Name. Fear ye God and be not of the wrongdoers. That which hath been sent down in truth cannot be compared with the books of the world. He Who calleth between earth and heaven beareth witness unto this. Blessed is he who hath heard and responded, and woe unto the heedless ones. Say: O company of the opposers! Fear ye God, then judge fairly in this Great Announcement. Through Him Who calleth amidst mankind hath appeared God’s Cause, His sovereignty, His Manifestation and His power. Were it not for Him, who would summon the people unto the Truth, and who would guide mankind unto His straight path? The splendor from Our presence be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and thy kindred, whose hearts God hath illumined with the light of His knowledge and whose faces with the lights of His manifestation. Verily, He is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>We have made mention of, and continue to mention, the loved ones of that land, and We counsel them with that which conduceth to the exaltation of the Word of God. The adornment of man hath not been and is not through the riches of the world, but rather through praiseworthy character, goodly deeds, loftiness of purpose and nobility of nature. We beseech God to adorn all with the ornament of steadfastness and to illumine them with the light of detachment. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and He is the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the One, exalted be His majesty!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath manifested Himself through a point from the Most Great Book upon the leaves of the world, whereupon appeared the Books, the Scrolls, the Psalms and the Tablets. Then He manifested Himself through a light from the lights of inner meanings upon the world of utterance, whereupon the horizon of divine knowledge dawned and the morn of the Cause shone forth through the luminary of grace and prosperity.</p>
<p>O My Name Mehdi! The letter from the Afnan Alif and Ha, upon him be My glory, was presented by this servant before the Throne. God willing, may he ever drink from the choice wine of inner meanings in this luminous day and offer it to them that are worthy. We have verily aided him to serve the Cause, and thus have We bestowed Our favor upon him and upon the chosen ones among My servants. Verily thy Lord is the All-Giving, the Generous. We give him glad tidings of a mercy from Our presence and make mention of him in such wise as hath brought joy to the hearts of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>O Mehdi! We have commanded all the friends to observe wisdom, and the divine Tablets bear witness to this truth. Nevertheless, some engage in teaching the Cause without any veil or covering. Although they act for the sake of Truth and make mention of His Name, yet this is not acceptable in the sight of God, for they act contrary to that which God hath willed. Some have exceeded the bounds of moderation out of fear and trepidation, while others, out of eagerness and enthusiasm, proclaim the mention of the Beloved of the worlds from the pulpits. Glory be to God! As to the fearful souls - what have they perceived, and from what do they seek to preserve and conceal themselves? By the Sun of Utterance which shineth from the horizon of the Prison, even should they hide beneath the layers of the earth and seek to preserve themselves through all means and causes, they shall find no escape from the claws of death, nor shall they ever find it. God willing, may the trees of being not remain [without fruit and yield], and may they not deprive themselves of the water of life for the sake of these fleeting days. In all things moderation is beloved. Some time ago this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed from the Supreme Pen. His exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the All-Wise Book […]</p>
<p>O people! Hold fast to the Strong Cord, for verily it will profit you on earth from God, the Lord of all worlds. Take hold of justice and equity, and reject what every remote ignorant one hath commanded you - they who have adorned their heads with turbans and pronounced judgment against Him through Whom every wise decree hath been made manifest. Through My Name their stations were exalted amongst the people, yet when I revealed Myself they pronounced judgment against Me with manifest injustice. Thus hath the Pen spoken in truth, while the people remain heedless. Verily he who holdeth fast to justice doth not transgress the bounds of moderation in any matter and is endowed with insight from the All-Seeing. The civilization extolled by the learned exponents of arts and sciences will, if allowed to overleap the bounds of moderation, bring great evil upon men. Thus doth the All-Knowing inform you. If carried to excess, civilization will prove as prolific a source of evil as it had been of goodness when kept within the restraints of moderation. Meditate upon this, O people, and be not of them that wander distraught. The day is approaching when its blaze will consume the cities, and the Tongue of Grandeur will proclaim: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Almighty, the All-Praised!” Thus observe all things, then render thanks unto thy Lord for having mentioned thee in this wondrous Tablet. Praise be to God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne!</p>
<p>If a soul were to truly ponder what hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen and find its sweetness, he would surely become detached from his own will and desire, and would move according to the Will of God. Blessed is he who hath attained unto this station and hath not been deprived of this most great bounty. Today neither the fearful who hide themselves nor those who openly proclaim are beloved. All must act with wisdom and engage in service to the Cause. It behooveth everyone to reflect upon the condition of this Wronged One. From the beginning until now, We have been manifest among both friends and foes, and even in times when calamities and tribulations surrounded Us from all sides, We summoned the people of the earth to the Most Exalted Horizon with utmost power. The Supreme Pen desireth not to mention Its own afflictions in this regard, for this would surely cause grief to those who are near, to the sincere ones, and to them that are devoted. Verily, He is the Speaker, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. Most days We were in the hands of Our enemies, and now We dwell among serpents. These sacred lands have been described and mentioned in all divine Books, and most of the Prophets and Messengers appeared from these lands. This is that desert wherein all the Messengers cried “Here am I, O my God, here am I,” and the promise of the appearance of God was to be in these lands. This is the Valley of Decree, the White Land, and the Luminous Spot. All that is manifest today was mentioned in previous Books, but the people thereof were declared unacceptable in all divine Books, to such extent that in some instances they were described as the offspring of serpents. And now this Wronged One, dwelling among the offspring of serpents, calleth out with the most exalted call and summoneth all to the ultimate goal, the most sublime summit and the highest horizon. Blessed is he who hath heard what the Tongue hath uttered in the Kingdom of Utterance, and woe unto every heedless and remote one.</p>
<p>Beseech ye God that He may enable all His friends to do that which is acceptable in His sight today. Should anyone succeed in performing even a single pure deed today, he shall be mentioned and recorded among those near to God in the divine Book. In all matters, hold fast to the cord of consultation. This exalted word was previously revealed in the Crimson Tablet. The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with two luminaries: consultation and compassion. In matters take ye counsel together, for consultation is the lamp of guidance that leadeth the way and bestoweth understanding. Thus doth the All-Informed apprise you, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O people of Baha! Know ye the value of this most mighty, most holy Day and arise to that which beseemeth you and is worthy of it. Guard yourselves by the name of God, exalted be His glory, from the cawing of the ravens and the croaking of the deniers. By the life of God! The opposers among the people of the Bayan appear more veiled than all other peoples. They have returned to the first step. They speak according to their desires and by them seek to prove their case against God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. They have failed to perceive the fragrance of the Divine Day. Say: This is the Day of God; it beseemeth no one to make mention of aught else or to turn unto any other than Him. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken from His glorious station.</p>
<p>We make mention once again of the Afnan at the end of the Book, that he may give thanks unto the Lord of all beings Who hath appeared and revealed what He desired through His all-compelling Will over the worlds. Thou art he who hath heard the call of thy Lord and turned unto the Supreme Horizon, and wert of them that responded. Say: O peoples of the earth! By God, that which ye possess will profit you not. Leave it behind in My Name, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Say: O concourse of divines! Cast aside what ye possess of veils and allusions. Hearken unto that which the Supreme Pen calleth you to in this wondrous Day. Through your injustice the Concourse on High hath lamented, as have the denizens of Paradise and those who have proclaimed there is no God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The world hath been darkened by your idle fancies, and the hearts of them who are nigh unto God have been troubled by your cruelty. Fear God and be of them that are fair-minded. O concourse of rulers! Your ornaments and that which ye possess have preoccupied you. Soon shall the breezes of annihilation seize you from every direction. Then shall ye see yourselves in manifest loss.</p>
<p>From this station We send Our greetings to My loved ones and counsel them with that which We have counseled them before, and I am the All-Wise Counselor. Say: Beware lest the doubts of those who have left your lands prevent you, or the conditions of the heedless veil you. We counsel them again and again with the wisdom that hath been sent down in the Tablets of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne.</p>
<p>That which was mentioned in the blessed spot hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance by One Who is Compassionate, All-Knowing. If it be realized in spirit and joy, it is well-pleasing. God assisteth the souls that are steadfast and assured, and He hath commanded and doth command to what is right. Blessed is the soul that hath succeeded in serving in the path of God. Verily, it is of the people of the highest Paradise in My gracious Book.</p>
<p>O My Afnan! We bear witness that thou hast acted righteously in that which thou wast bidden by the All-Knowing Commander. God willing, mayest thou ever be assisted in that which causeth the exaltation of God’s Cause. Minutes, hours, nights and days all swiftly return to extinction, and that which endureth and lasteth is what appeareth in the love of God and His path. How many souls there were who yearned and hoped for this station, yet today are seen to be heedless and veiled. O My Afnan! Say: […]</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O God of all created things and Object of all creation! I beseech Thee by the Dayspring of Thy mighty signs, whereby the Most Exalted Horizon was illumined and the Call was raised betwixt earth and heaven, to aid Thy loved ones and chosen ones to stand firm in this Cause–the Cause by which the idols have lamented and the edifice of creation hath been shaken. O my Lord! Thou beholdest what the hands of the oppressors have wrought and hearest the cawing of the ignorant ones who have turned away from Thy sealed wine when it appeared through Thy Self-Subsisting Name. O my Lord! Illumine their eyes with the light of Thy knowledge and their hearts with the effulgences of the light of Thy countenance. All things have testified to Thy power and might. I beseech Thee not to disappoint Thy servants from the rustling of the Pen of Thy Revelation, nor to debar them from turning unto the ocean of Thy mercy. Thou art He Whom the affairs of creation cannot frustrate, nor can the might of them that have denied Thee and Thy signs strike fear into Thee. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>

<p>O Fath-i-A’zam, upon thee be the Glory of God! In the Name of God, the Most Impregnable, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Mighty, the Most High!</p>
<p>O Fath-i-A’zam! By God, the True One, today is thy day! Arise to promote the Cause amidst the heavens and earth, then sing and warble with My most glorious melody amongst the concourse of creation. Say: By God, the True One, O people! There hath come to you the proof before which, at its manifestation, every proof and evidence hath bowed down. Beware lest thou be perturbed by the intimations of those who have openly denied God and have not understood the root of the Cause, and from whom the breezes of the All-Merciful have been withheld. Soar with the wing of certitude in the atmosphere of wisdom and utterance, then subdue the cities of the hearts of the peoples of the world through the sovereignty of thy Lord. Thus doth the Pen of the Most Merciful command thee at an hour when it hath ascended above all who are in the heavens and earth and become established upon the pole of Paradise.</p>
<p>By God, the True One! The idolaters have cast Us into the well of envy and hatred, then raised an outcry amongst themselves to cause doubt in the hearts of those in whom thou findest no steadfastness in the Cause of God, and who dwell in uncertainty and loss. Say: God shall soon raise up a people who shall cast behind them all who are in the kingdom and shall stand firm in the Cause with power and sovereignty.</p>
<p>If thou desirest to know what hath befallen Us, know that We have been afflicted with tribulations the like of which have never appeared in creation. By My life! They cannot be mentioned in words and utterances. Know then that the clamor hath been raised from the direction of the hearts of the deniers, and intoxication hath seized the dwellers of the heavens and earth save those whom the hand of grace hath taken and delivered from the hosts of those who have denied and associated partners with God, and whom the melodies of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful, have attracted.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear God and cleave not unto those whom every atom denounceth, for they have denied the proof whereby their faith in God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Praised, would be established. Reflect thou upon what they who have denied My Self have attributed unto Me, and what thou hast witnessed from Me and what hath appeared through Me, that thou mayest become aware of what hath befallen Me from the hosts of Satan.</p>
<p>By God, the True One! The tablets that have been written in rejection of God and His Cause - were anyone to have insight, he would witness from what hath been inscribed therein the falsehood of those who wrote them with the fingers of polytheism and who have calumniated God without clear proof or evidence. Cast thou these words behind thee, then stand firm in the Cause in such wise that the servants who have denied God from time immemorial and whose names have been written among the heedless may be shaken by thee.</p>
<p>By My life! He who was unable to speak in My presence, when he witnessed his own powerlessness in what he desired, attributed to this Beauty - to Whose sanctity the realities of all things bear witness - what his self and passion commanded. Then he whom God had made an example to all servants, and from whom the people of hell-fire flee, wrote a tablet rejecting God and His sovereignty, for the fire had been kindled in his heart. God hath decreed for every soul that he should write in refutation of whoever hath rejected God according to what the Spirit inspireth him. Thus hath the matter been ordained by this Beauty, through Whom the hearts of the followers of all religions have been shaken.</p>
<p>O Fath-i-A’zam! Say: From the first day when the Sun of Baha shone forth, pure essences and holy realities have ascended to a station wherein they have rent asunder veils whose greatness and majesty caused the hearts of the chosen ones and the minds of the people of understanding to tremble. Thus do thou witness the power of thy Lord, how He hath raised up hearts wherein was naught but the revelation of […]</p>
<p>Through His grandeur He established them in the seat of authority in less than a moment. Indeed thou wert present before Us and didst hear My melodies and witness My composure and dignity, then My tranquility and patience and forbearance. Therefore ponder within thyself, O Most Great Victory, what hath moved Me to cry out between the heavens and the earth, that thou mayest know what hath befallen God, thy Lord, from these who disbelieved and associated partners with Him - they whom the peoples of both worlds denounce as infidels. By God! All things weep at My oppression, yet I, despite My power and might, showed forbearance toward him who sought My death and withdrew from among these people. Yet he was not content in his soul and fabricated words against Me which every person of insight and certitude would deny.</p>
<p>Then know that when We found the one named Ali-Akbar who was there immersed in the depths of fancy and desire, We sent down from the heaven of divine will a tablet and sent it to him by the hand of Salman, and We have now sent a copy of it to thee that thou mayest read it and convey it to him, that perchance he may reflect within himself and sanctify himself from the doubts that were in his heart and be purified from the uncertainties of the age. Verily he objected in his inmost heart against thee. Say: O servant! We know what thou art engaged in, and with Us is the knowledge of all things and the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and naught in all the worlds can be hidden from thy Lord’s knowledge. Arise to serve God and aid His Cause, then witness the Cause with thine own eyes, not through the eyes of any of the servants, for We have manifested Ourself with all proofs, signs, tokens and revelations, any single one of which would suffice all who are immersed in the depths of names and attributes - yet none comprehend this save those who have drunk from the chalice of certitude. Say: Hast thou not heard what was revealed from My previous Manifestation? Beware, beware lest thou be veiled at the time of the Manifestation by the Vahid of the Bayan, for that Vahid was created by Him. Beware, beware lest thou be veiled by what was revealed in the Bayan, for these were the words of His previous Manifestation. Hast thou not heard what thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, hath said: “Say: O God! Thou art the God of Gods! Thou givest sovereignty to whom Thou willest and takest it from whom Thou willest.” Thus was the command revealed from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Merciful. Yet thou hast hesitated because of the hesitation of a mere name among names, though thou hast not understood it or its fundamental cause, and thou art perturbed regarding Him Who hath dawned from the horizon of the Cause with God’s grandeur and His manifestations, and God’s power and His might. Fear God Who created thee by His command, and be not of those who said “God is our Lord” but when He appeared with the truth they arose in denial. Say: By Him Who hath caused all things to speak in praise of My Self! Thou hast not understood the Cause wherein thou art, nor hast thou comprehended him whom thou hast taken as thy lord besides God. If thou art in doubt about this, then it behooveth thee to present thyself before the Throne and witness what the eyes of creation have not witnessed in manifest revelation. Hast thou not heard of God’s power and sovereignty? Hast thou not seen how He hath appeared in truth from the axis of all horizons? Say then: O ye two parties! Which of the signs of your Lord will ye deny? Fear God by Whose command every atom moveth, then act according to what thou art commanded in the Tablet, that God may forgive thee through His grace. Verily He is the Powerful over all things - He punisheth whom He willeth and bestoweth upon whom He willeth among His servants the sweet fragrances of forgiveness. And thou, O Most Great Victory (Fath-i-A’zam), deliver the messages of thy Lord and fear no one. If thou findest in anyone’s heart a light from the lights of thy Lord, associate with him; otherwise, avoid him and his like, and draw nigh unto God thy Lord. Verily He will suffice thee against all who are in the heavens and earth at all times. Thus have We cast upon thee from the verses of the Spirit and expounded them for thee that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and be steadfast in this Cause from which have slipped the feet of every hypocrite who hath associated partners with God and followed the paths of the people of tyranny and […]</p>
<p>The Glory be upon you and upon whosoever has detached himself from all that has been created in the kingdoms of existence and possibility, and has held fast to the Sure Handle in these days when the breezes of sedition have wafted from all directions. Such harm has befallen My station as transcends description, and God indeed takes account of all that has come to pass. God willing, after meeting Salman, you shall become acquainted to some degree with what has transpired both secretly and openly. Tablets were revealed and sent down from the heaven of divine will in response to the objections of the people. God willing, you shall observe them. Send copies of these two Tablets to the Land of Sad, that perchance the people may reflect within themselves and become of those who are assured. For today, as is evident, most of the servants have turned away from the King of manifest existence and clung to vain imaginings. Were you to observe carefully, you would find the veils of this group to be thicker than those of the followers of the Qur’an, to such an extent that from the leaders and followers of this group you hear naught but the words of the people of the Qur’an. All have returned to the delusions of the past and cling to vain fancies, save him whom God has purified from all that the people possess and has washed in the ocean of sanctification and delivered from the depths wherein many creatures have drowned. We hope that you will, at all times, arise with wondrous steadfastness and regard those who turn away from the Cause as cattle, nay, more contemptible still, for the cattle have not denied Him at Whose finger’s motion all things move, from a beginning that hath no beginning, and at Whose glance’s bidding all beings were raised up, before a before that hath no before. But these people have denied God and associated partners with His proof and warred against His Self and disputed His signs, and yet they imagine within themselves that they are of the doers of good. Say: O crimson company! God shall soon seize you with a chastisement from Him and wrath from His presence, and shall return you to the lowest of the low. Show kindness to the family of Mulla Husayn, who has ascended unto God, for this is among the most meritorious deeds in the sight of God.</p>

<p>Sorrowful is He at My sorrows. OMaryam! The wrongs which I suffer have blotted out the wrongs suffered by My First Name from the Tablet of creation. The clouds of divine decree have at every moment rained down upon this manifest Beauty the showers of tribulation. My banishment from My homeland was for the sake of none but the Beloved; My exile was in no other path save that of His good-pleasure. In the midst of heaven-sent trials I glowed bright as a candle, and in the face of divinely ordained afflictions I stood as firm as a mountain. In manifesting the outpourings of His grace I was even as a bounteous cloud, and in laying hold on the foes of the peerless King I was even as a burning flame. The clear tokens of My power roused the envy of My foes, and the compelling evidences of My wisdom stirred the hatred of the malevolent: Not a single night did I repose in peace; not a single morn did I awake in tranquillity. I swear by the beauty of God that Husayn shed tears of anguish at the wrongs I suffered and Abraham cast Himself into the flames for the sake of the afflictions I sustained. Wert thou to gaze with discernment, thou wouldst behold the Eye of Grandeur weeping sore beneath the tabernacle of sanctity, and the Essence of Majesty lamenting within the realms of loftiness. Unto this beareth witness the Tongue of truth and glory.</p>
<p>O Maryam! From the land of ?a, after countless afflictions, We reached ’Iraq, at the bidding of the Tyrant of Persia, where, after the fetters of Our foes, We were afflicted with the perfidy of Our friends. God knoweth what befell Me thereafter! At length, abandoning My home and all that was therein, and renouncing My life and all that pertained thereunto, I retired alone and companionless. I roamed the wilderness of resignation, travelling in such wise that in My exile every eye wept sore over Me, and all created things shed tears of blood because of My anguish. The birds of the air were My companions and the beasts of the field My associates. In such wise did I, even as the flash of the spirit, pass over this fleeting world. For two years or rather less, I shunned all else but God, and closed Mine eyes to all except Him, that haply the fire of hatred may die down and the heat of jealousy abate.</p>
<p>O Maryam! To divulge the heavenly secrets would be unbefitting, and to disclose the celestial mysteries would be unseemly. By “secrets” is meant naught other than the treasuries enshrined within Mine own Being. By the righteousness of God! I have borne what no man, be he of the past or of the future, hath borne or will bear.</p>
<p>Since this text is already in English, and appears to be a complete passage, I will simply return it as is:</p>
<p>During this period of retirement none, whether among My brothers or any other soul, sought to investigate the matter, let alone to grasp its significance, though its import surpasseth the creation of earth and heaven. And yet, I swear by God, every breath drawn in the course of My journey was better than the service of both worlds, and My very retreat was the mightiest testimony and the most perfect and conclusive evidence. Yea, true vision is needed, if one is to behold the Scene of transcendent glory, inasmuch as the blind one is deprived of beholding his own countenance, much less the Countenance of eternal holiness. How can a mere shadow comprehend the One Who casteth it? How can a handful of clay grasp the subtle reality of the heart?</p>
<p>At last the divine decree prompted certain spiritual souls to remember this Canaanite Youth. Armed with a number of petitions, they searched in every place and enquired from every person, until they found in a mountain cave a trace of this traceless One. He, verily, guideth all things unto the Straight Path. I swear by the Day-Star of eternal truth that the arrival of these souls so astonished and amazed this poor and exiled Soul that My pen is powerless to describe it. Perchance a steel-sharp pen will emerge from the realm of eternity, rend the veils asunder, and reveal these secrets with perfect truth and absolute sincerity; or haply an eloquent tongue will speak and bring forth the pearls of the spirit from the shell of silence. And this indeed would not be hard of accomplishment for God. In brief, the hand of Him Who is the Unconstrained broke the seal of the mysteries–this, however, none can perceive save them that are endued with true understanding, nay rather, them that have severed themselves from all things.</p>
<p>So it was that the Luminary of the world returned to ’Iraq, where We found no more than a handful of souls, faint and dispirited, nay utterly lost and dead. The Cause of God had ceased to be on any one’s lips, nor was any heart receptive to its message. This lowly Servant arose then with such vigour to protect and promote the Cause of God that methinks a new resurrection was ushered in. The glory of the Cause became manifest in every town and its fair name exalted in every city, to such an extent that all the rulers treated it with tolerance and benevolence.</p>
<p>O Maryam! The determination evinced by this Servant to withstand the onslaught of His foes from every sect and kindred so deepened their rancour that it can scarcely be depicted or imagined. Thus was it ordained by the Lord of might and power.</p>
<p>O Maryam! The Pen of the Ancient of Days proclaimeth: Among the foremost duties prescribed is to cleanse one’s heart of all but God. Sanctify then thy heart from aught save the Friend, that thou mayest be made worthy to enter the court of communion. O Maryam! Free thyself from the fetters of blind imitation, that thou mayest gain admittance into the blissful realm of detachment. Sever thy heart from the world and all that is therein, that thou mayest attain to the sovereign rule of faith and be not debarred from the Sanctuary of the All-Merciful. Through the power of renunciation, rend asunder the veil of idle fancy and enter the hallowed retreats of certitude. O Maryam! Though a tree be laden with a myriad leaves and fruits, a gust of autumnal wind sufficeth to obliterate them all. Remove not, then, thy gaze from the very root of the Tree of Divinity and the branch of the Lote-Tree of celestial glory. Consider the ocean, how serene it lieth, how majestically it reposeth within its bed. Yet the winds of the will of the eternal Beloved cause countless ripples and innumerable swells to appear upon its surface, each wave distinct and divergent from the others. All the peoples of the world today are preoccupied with the ebb and flow of these waves, and are oblivious of the stupendous might of that Sea of seas whose every movement layeth bare the signs of Him Who is the Unconstrained. Commune, O Maryam, with the Spirit of the All-Merciful and, shunning the company and kinship of the Evil One, seek shelter within the inviolable protection of the Lord of bounty, that haply the hand of His loving-kindness may deliver thee from the path of selfish pursuits and direct thy steps towards the realm of transcendent glory. Abandon these fleeting shadows, O Maryam, and turn towards the Day-Star of unfading splendour. Every shadow oweth its existence and motion to the presence of the sun; for were the latter to withhold its grace for a single moment, all things would sink beneath the veil of non-existence. How sad and regrettable indeed that one should occupy oneself with the transitory things of this world and be debarred from the Dayspring of eternal holiness! O Maryam! Appreciate the value of these days, for erelong thou shalt no longer behold the Celestial Youth in this contingent realm, but shalt perceive the signs of grief in all created things. Soon shall ye bite your fingers’ ends in remorse, for ye shall fail to find this Youth, even were ye to search out the reaches of earth and heaven. Thus hath the decree been sent down from the realm of transcendent glory. Yea, erelong thou shalt behold all existence biting its fingers in bereavement over this Youth, and, search as it may through the entirety of every earth and every heaven, yet will it fail to attain His presence.</p>
<p>In brief, matters have come to such a pass that this Servant hath resolved to retire alone from the midst of this wretched people. Apart from the women of the Household who must needs remain with Me, I shall admit no one else to Our company, not even the attendants of My consort. Let us see then what God hath purposed. I depart, whilst My companions are the tears I shed and Mine associates the sighs I utter; My solace is My pen and the delight of My soul is Mine own beauty; My hosts are My reliance upon God and Mine armies are My trust in Him. Thus have We imparted unto thee a measure of the mysteries of this matter, that thou mayest be of them that apprehend.</p>
<p>O Maryam! All the waters of the world and its rivers have flowed from the eyes of this Youth, which, even as the clouds, have rained down their tears at the wrongs He hath suffered. In short, We have ever offered up Our life and soul in the path of the Beloved, and We are thankful and content in the face of whatever may befall Us. At one time My head was raised aloft on a spear, and at another it fell into the hands of My deadly enemy. At one time I was cast into the fire, and at another I was suspended in the air. Such indeed hath been the treatment that the ungodly have meted out to Us.</p>
<p>O Maryam, We have called this Tablet “the choicest of lamentations” and “the vernal shower of tears”. We have dispatched it unto thee that thou mayest weep, at thy heart’s ease, and share in the agonies and afflictions of the Ancient Beauty.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>All praise that is sanctified above the comprehension of all who dwell on earth befitteth the most holy and exalted court of the Desired One, Who was not deterred by the might of the wicked or the clamor of the evil ones in these days when the fire of tyranny and oppression blazeth on all sides. At all times doth He, with the finger of His Will, with the tongue of His Purpose, and with the motion of His Eye and Brow, summon all unto the straight path which is illumined with manifest light. He is the Peerless One Whom neither the multitudes of the idolaters, nor the gathering of the deniers, nor the abundance of the atheists could hinder. In times of hardship He proclaimed “Verily I am God,” and in the midst of tribulation He declared “There is none like unto Me.” At all times His glance of loving-kindness hath been directed toward His loved ones. By the life of our Beloved and the Beloved of all who dwell on earth and in heaven! In times when the leaders of the earth, both rulers and divines, arose with utmost determination and power to extinguish the light, the Luminary of utterance was seen to shine more resplendent and manifest from the horizon of divine knowledge. Thus, every letter of the verses that were revealed in the latter days in the Land of Mystery and likewise on the way, doth in itself proclaim and testify. Yet these veiled people were not worthy to hear even a whisper, much less to hearken unto the Call that was raised from the Kingdom of utterance. Exalted is the Cause of our Lord, and glorified the Word of our Desired One and the Desired One of all who dwell in the heavens and the earth!</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of existence, both seen and unseen! Through Thy Name was the seal of Thy choice sealed wine broken. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Kingdom and the revelations of Thy Dominion, and by the effulgent rays of Thy countenance which the eyes of them that are nigh unto Thee have not beheld, and unto whose precincts the birds of inner meaning and utterance have not attained, to send down from the heaven of Thy will that which will draw Thy chosen ones nigh unto Thee. O my Lord! Ordain for them to attain unto Thy presence and to stand before the gate of Thy grace, and to hearken unto that which the Son of Imran heard on the Sinai of Thy bounty and the Sinai of Thy mercy. O my Lord! Aid them to enter the Most Great Scene that they may witness and behold that which no mortal eye hath seen. Thou art He Whom the will of the nations cannot frustrate, nor the manifestations of the world deter. Thou ordainest for whomsoever Thou willest the good of the world to come and of this world. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all creation. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>May my spirit and my soul be offered up for your steadfastness and your constancy! The servant was sitting still and silent when suddenly he was stirred as though he had found the fragrance of the garment that had been diffused aforetime. Then did one of them that circle round enter with your noble letter. I took it, broke its seal and read that which the nightingale of your loving-kindness had warbled upon the branch of faithfulness, and I beheld the waters of sincerity that flowed from the fountain of remembrance and praise. When I had drunk and heard, I betook myself to that station which cannot be described by the descriptions of the world nor mentioned by the utterances of the nations, until I entered and attained the presence of my Desired One and the Desired One of all who dwell on earth and in heaven, and I laid before His countenance that which had streamed from your pen. The Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which, were it to be cast upon the dust, would cause the realities of spirits and minds to arise therefrom until a Day that hath no end and no termination shall overtake it. Exalted be His utterance, glorified His station, and magnificent His proof! He spoke, in My Name that speaketh from the horizon of the world […]</p>
<p>O Afnan! Upon thee be My Glory and My Loving-kindness! Thou art he who hast attained unto the warbling of the doves of My knowledge upon the branch of Mine utterance, and whom the rapture of My Call hath seized and the sweetness of My remembrance hath attracted on a Day whereon My servants and My creatures have turned away from Me, save whom God, the Lord of Lords, did will. Thou wert standing firm in My service and speaking forth My praise when intoxication had overtaken all the dwellers of the earth - to this testifieth He with Whom is the Mother Book. We have remembered thee once in the Prison, and again in the castle built upon a mountain, and yet again in this Castle which hath quivered when moved the Pen of God, the Lord of the Day of Creation. There hath befallen you in the path of God that which befell Me from the Daysprings of polytheism and the Dawning-places of dissension. We make mention of thee and of the Most Exalted Leaf, through whose grief sorrows have encompassed Me from every direction. Verily thy Lord is He Who speaketh the truth and observeth with justice on this Day which hath been named the Day of Return. We testify that she sacrificed her spirit in the love of God, the Lord of all mankind. We have, time and again, made mention of thy mother, and at this moment when the Tongue of Glory proclaimeth: The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Lord of all Religions! Blessed art thou, and blessed is she, and blessed is thy son whom thou didst mention in thy letter. We had made mention of him before thy mention, as attested by the Tablets of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon her and upon those who are with thee and who love thee and hearken unto thy word concerning this Cause whereby feet have slipped.</p>
<p>A hundred thousand thanks unto the Goal of all existence! Each day His favor is manifest and His grace evident, to such an extent that were all who are in earth and heaven to occupy themselves forever in His praise, they would fall short. However much the people of the world may strive and advance in this station, they find themselves at the first step. At one time this exalted word was revealed from the Dayspring of Revelation and the Dawning-place of inspiration - exalted be His utterance: “God hath ordained for His Afnan that which, were less than a needle’s eye thereof to be disclosed, would cause all beings to swoon away.” Though at present some may be affected by grief through the deeds of the idolaters, or be touched by abasement through the actions of the transgressors, soon shall the sun of glory shine forth and make the world aware of their station. Whatsoever groweth from the earth or descendeth from the heavens hath been and is destined for the loved ones of God, and the Afnan occupy the foremost rank in the world. It behooveth thee to beseech God to strengthen them in preserving that which hath been ordained for them by My Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book.</p>
<p>Blessed are they who have attained unto the hearing of the Word and who perceive the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful. Heedlessness hath so seized the world that every living soul is bewildered. How many souls have been observed whose song was raised at one hour, while at another their lamentation and wailing was heard. Are they assured by the fidelity of the world? How can this be when it declareth at all times and confesseth its transience, and showeth forth its changes and variations? The wine of vain imaginings hath so seized them that even after witnessing and understanding they are seen to be heedless. Soon shall they behold that which they have been promised. The servant beseecheth his Lord to guide them unto His path and His balance, or else to cleanse the earth from their defilement. Verily our Lord is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>As regards what you wrote concerning Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’r-Rasul, upon him be God’s loving-kindness, his petition was at one time presented before His Presence, and a Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet was revealed especially for him from the heaven of the favor of the Best-Beloved of the worlds and was dispatched. God willing, may he be illumined by the effulgent rays of the Sun of divine utterance and drink from the ocean of inner meanings. This servant conveys his greetings to him and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to aid him in that which diffuseth the fragrance of eternity. Verily He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>And concerning what they wrote about the Aqa-Zadih, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory of God, mentioning his expulsion and what befell him, and afterwards expressing thanks and praise - after this matter was presented, the Temple of the Throne arose, walking and speaking that which this servant is unable to mention, until He said, exalted be His grandeur: “Blessed is My Afnan, and joy be unto him! He hath spoken that which beseemeth the Days of God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech God to aid him, to grant him success, and to send down upon him from the heaven of His grace that which beseemeth His sovereignty, the Protector of all who are in the heavens and on earth.”</p>
<p>This servant and his like are assuredly powerless to mention that which floweth from the Tongue of Grandeur. The drop is incapable of describing the surging of the sea, and the shadow was not and is not worthy to enumerate the rays of the sun. All dependeth upon His grace, favor and assistance. If He willeth, we have been and are enabled to render any service, otherwise we are indeed powerless. We are God’s and unto Him do we return.</p>
<p>To their eminences, the revered Afnans, upon them be all the Most Glorious Glory of God, I express my nothingness and convey greetings and salutations. The letter of his eminence, the honored Aqa Siyyid M, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory of God, reached this servant and was presented before His Presence, and wondrous and exalted Tablets were revealed. At present there is a delay in making copies. God willing, they will be sent in these days. This servant beseecheth his Lord to quicken the earth through His signs and His sweet savors. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Glory and praise and honor be upon you, upon your first and your last, your outward and your inward, and the mercy of God and His blessings.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>29th of Dhi’l-Hijjih al-Haram 1301</p>
<p>At this moment I was present in the Most Pure and Most Luminous presence of the Two Most Great Branches - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - and likewise before the Pavilion of Infallibility I presented mention of your praise and glory. Each one expressed special mention, special praise, special greetings and salutations and glory, which this servant should convey. May my spirit be sacrificed for their favors and my being for their tenderness.</p>

<p>My spirit be a sacrifice for Thy love! The noble and exalted letter, which was a treasury of fragrant meanings and the dawning-place of sufficient and healing utterance, illumined the eyes of this evanescent servant and enlightened the heart. Indeed, boundless joy was experienced, for its outward expressions were sweet and its inner meaning indicated faithfulness and firm establishment in the Cause of the Beloved of the worlds. Praise be to God that at all times the breezes of the mention of the Desired One of all things waft from thy heart, tongue and pen in constant succession, appearance and manifestation. Well is it with thee and with us! That which thou hadst written concerning the distribution of verses and their dispatch to the known place is understood. Thou hast not shown, nor dost thou show, any laxity in service to the Cause, but rather carriest it out to the extent of thy capacity, nay beyond that. Again, well is it with thee and pleasant it is for us!</p>
<p>As for what thou hadst written about the person who came from Europe and who had inquired about the nature of the claim, the laws, and the primary purpose of this community, it was presented at the Throne. He - exalted be His glory - saith:</p>
<p>O physician! The laws were indeed revealed in those days, but We did not send them forth, in Our wisdom, nor is it permissible that he whom thou hast mentioned in thy letter should be apprised of them. We verily see the days in travail. He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. When the time cometh, We shall send them forth in truth as a grace from Us to all the worlds. And as for what he asked thee about the foundation of the Cause, say: Thou wouldst not hear from me even if thou hadst an attentive ear. Turn with it to the rock and thou wilt hear from it in the loudest cry: “By God! That which was hidden in the treasuries of inviolability and power and in the repositories of might and mysteries hath appeared with such sovereignty as cannot be hindered by the veils of the evil ones nor by the imaginings of the heedless!” Then turn to the thickets and thou wilt hear from them: “The All-Possessing, the Most High hath come!” Then hasten to the mountain peaks and they will say: “The Lord of all possibility hath come!” Thus do all things speak, if thou be of them that hear. Hast thou not heard that the Spirit said that if these were to hold their peace, the very stones would cry out? Thus doth He inform thee, with Whom is the Preserved Tablet. Dost thou inquire about the sun after its appearance at high noon, and seek after Him Whom the very essence of understanding is ashamed to be associated with? Wipe thine eyes with the fingers of submission, then look, and thou wilt see Him at the center of possibility, speaking in the name of God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: This is He Who was promised to you in all the Tablets of God, and of Whom Isaiah informed you. Return thy gaze to the Torah and the Gospel that thou mayest know the decree of this Day and detach thyself from what thou hast, turning to the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. This is not the day of questioning. The Beginning hath appeared in the End with the sovereignty of grandeur and majesty, calling all to the Dawning-Place of the evidences of your Lord, the Powerful, the Most High, the Mighty, the Great. Beware lest thou be of those who awaited the days of the Messiah, but when He came with the truth, they pronounced His death sentence and were of the most lost. The Dove, beneath the talons of the enemies, calleth out at the highest pitch in such wise that the hosts of heedlessness cannot frighten It, nor can what hath befallen It from the wrongdoers prevent It. Reflect thou upon It and what hath befallen It from the people of hatred, and what It uttereth in the heaven of creation, that thou mayest leave creation behind thee, turning to the Dayspring of lights, and say: “I believe in God, O Thou Who art imprisoned and estranged!”</p>
<p>O physician! The mention of such remembrances is not permissible today. It must have been evident to you that the Supreme Pen has not yet moved according to its own motion, for it has ever been mindful of people’s weakness and the need to be gentle with them. Nevertheless, observe how great is that which hath been sent down from His presence, and what lieth concealed in the heaven of thy Lord’s will. Yet these unjust people, despite these manifest proofs, sacred conditions, firm manifestations, clear signs, and all-encompassing evidences, are still intoxicated. The vain imaginings of people have been forbidden from the Most Exalted Horizon, and the person mentioned was not truthful. His purpose was merely to send news, for European travelers are greatly desirous of new information to boast about in their own lands. Indeed, there are groups specifically assigned to travel to various regions and send back new reports - this was his intention. In any case, give him no document, for he will publicize it in that very land. In truth, this response that was revealed was out of kindness to you, not specifically for the inquirer.</p>
<p>This servant submits that one of the leaders of this group, who is very well-known, sent a petition to the Most Holy Court, and a specific response was revealed for him, a copy of which was sent. If deemed advisable, you may show it to him, but interpretation is not permitted - let him understand whatever he will. Be very vigilant regarding the Cause, for protecting the Cause is today more necessary than all else. For many times such persons have come specifically to investigate, having no purpose except to discover what is hidden and then object to it after gaining knowledge. In all circumstances be watchful, for the malevolent ones have been and are engaged in sedition. In all conditions, keep your eyes on wisdom. He is our Protector and your Protector in this world and the next. There is no God but He, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote concerning your brother, upon him be the Glory of God, this is what was revealed for him from the heaven of grace and favor: “O physician! The mention of thy brother hath been made before the Throne…” to the end of His mighty and exalted Words.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the land of Kerman, God willing, a specific Tablet will be sent for the person mentioned. However, it is incumbent upon the loved ones in that land and elsewhere to strive themselves in such matters. In one instance, these exalted words were revealed from the heaven of will: “The loved ones must move like the arteries in the body of the world. They must not remain deprived from serving the Cause for a moment, nor be heedless of any of its members.” We beseech God to give all to drink from the Kawthar of steadfastness in such wise that the winds of the doubts of the polytheists may not move them, and to purify the earth from the defilement of those who have denied God and followed every ignorant rabble. They are indeed the most lost of all creatures before God, the Most High, the Great.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about constantly instructing the companions not to admit strangers or inform them of matters, yet they neither listened nor listen - you are right, for firm decrees have repeatedly been revealed from the Source of the Cause regarding this matter. Nevertheless, some of the loved ones have not heeded and have been deceived by the ignorant. We beseech God to aid them to follow that which they have been commanded.</p>
<p>As to what was written about the wife of Aqa Muhammad, what his honor has done is certainly meritorious and appropriate. The Book of Laws was revealed in the language of verses in this land, and likewise some were revealed in Persian in the Land of Mystery. However, permission for their dissemination has not yet dawned. Since mention of the aforementioned wife was made twice in his honor’s letter, this servant presented it at the Most Holy Court, and afterwards extracted and sent those verses concerning marriage from the Book of Laws. God willing, they will reach their destination, otherwise the laws are available. In any case, this is the decree as has been revealed in detail from the heaven of the All-Merciful’s will. Blessed are they who act upon them.</p>
<p>Since it was arranged that whatever is mentioned should be responded to point by point in its entirety, it is therefore submitted that his honor’s letter dated the 10th of the month of fasting was received. The petition of Sassoon and mention of Khudadad and other letters and their contents were all presented before the Throne. This is what was revealed for Sassoon and Khudadad from the Lord of Creation: “Blessed are they for having attained unto that which they were commanded in the Tablets of God…”</p>
<p>As to what was written in the previous and subsequent letters that news had arrived of the Ancient Beauty’s intention to proceed to Iran - yes, this matter is essentially correct. Several consultative meetings were held and such was their intention. This news caused alarm among the clergy, but they soar on the wings of their own desires and are occupied with their conjectures. The Command is in God’s hands - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. In any case, this news has spread widely in Iran itself, reports have come from all directions mentioning this matter, and someone specifically came and gave details. If the incident of Badi’ (upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God) had not occurred and they had intended it, the Ancient Beauty would certainly have proceeded, for He explicitly stated so in that Tablet. However, after this incident the matter appears difficult - the Command is in God’s hands. We shall see what God wills and what He ordains.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the petition of his honor Mustafa (upon him be the Glory of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Most Glorious) which contained mention of the loved ones of God and verses of Master ’Abu’l-Hasan was presented at the Most Holy Court and was accepted. They said its reply would be sent after the second news.</p>
<p>They said to convey to all wondrous, sublime, most wondrous and most glorious greetings from the True One. Soon We shall send down for them from the heaven of Will that which their Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Compelling, hath desired.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious! Upon thee be the Glory of God and His remembrance, and the praise of all created things between earth and heaven, in every age, before time and after time. My spirit, my soul and my heart be a sacrifice unto thee! How can I make mention of thee through utterance when thou art remembered throughout all existence? Sedition hath appeared in every city, whereby the loved ones of the All-Merciful have been prevented from the sweet-scented breezes that waft among them in remembrance of God, the Creator of all possibility and the Fashioner of all worlds. By God! O Beloved of my heart, verily my heart doth melt, the eye of my inner being weepeth, and my every limb maketh mention. Would that I might attain thy presence, or be blessed by that which is diffused from the fragrance of thine ink and shineth forth from the direction of thy heart. I beseech God that He may hear my call and answer that for which I have beseeched Him, for verily He is near and responsive.</p>
<p>May I be a sacrifice unto thee! Countless centuries have passed during which this evanescent bird hath not been blessed with the wondrous melodies and exalted traces of that Nightingale of Divine Love and that Sacred Dove of spiritual paradise. Although at all times the sweet-scented perfume from the garment of the All-Glorious hath wafted, and still wafteth, from that Beloved of heart and soul, yet this ephemeral one hath outwardly been deprived thereof. We beseech God that He may remove that which hath come between us and gather us upon the shore of the ocean of His nearness and give us to drink from the fountain of His presence and the choice wine of His reunion. Verily, He is the One Who judgeth with justice, Who ruleth with grace, Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth and Who doeth as He pleaseth.</p>
<p>And as to other news of the prison and the condition of the prisoners, praise be to God and thanks to His grace, all are confined in the ruined city of Akka in a most mighty and impregnable fortress which appears to be built entirely of stone, surrounded by troops. Yet such joy and gladness prevails that it is as if we were reveling in a paradise of delights, for the more severe the outward tribulations have become, the brighter burns the lamp of God’s Cause and the more manifest becomes the dawning radiance of the Most Great Luminary amidst the nations. Exalted then be His power which has transcended all worlds and His will which has conquered all who dwell in the heavens and on earth! Would that your honor had been present in the Most Great Prison during this supreme affliction and most great upheaval to witness the power and tranquility of the Ancient Beauty during that greatest of commotions. A brief account from the time of occurrence until now is submitted: For some time we, these servants, in view of what had been revealed in God’s Tablets, had been expecting this tribulation of the Day of Adversity until the appointed time arrived. At the eighth hour of the day, the friends of God who were in the market were all arrested, and suddenly soldiers surrounded the Most Pure House and likewise stood guard at the doors of other homes of the friends, and conditions became so severe that women and children were prevented from entering or leaving, and that night most went without food. Outwardly it was not at all clear what they intended. Some said we would be sent to the Sudan toward Abyssinia, some said we would be drowned in the sea, and there were various other claims. What was announced by the government was that they were ordered to take us to Gallipoli and then await further instructions, and they were extremely rushed to depart. Yet the Most Exalted Beauty paid no heed whatsoever. Eight days passed from the occurrence until departure, each day bringing a fresh upheaval. Everything was plundered in the name of auction, and with each hour the oppression of those cruel people grew more severe. One day there was fear they would storm the sanctuary and forcibly remove the Ancient Beauty. The Most Holy, Most Exalted Being remained seated with such composure, dignity and calm that it was as if these surrounding people were not enemies but had all come with acceptance and devotion to the Truth. God is Most Great in His grandeur, His glory, His tranquility and His power! At a time when affairs had reached the utmost degree of difficulty from every direction, four people of the Christian faith came into His presence and submitted that if He so commanded, they would that very moment remove the soldiers gathered around the house and deal with the government. The Tongue of God declared: “I have come for the salvation of all the world and have sacrificed My soul for the purification and life of the world, and these tribulations are inevitable.” This servant is incapable of relating all that was revealed from the Tongue of God in that instance. Afterwards the consuls of various governments and others came, but He spoke only of absolute independence. And before the occurrence, when outwardly there was no mention of it yet, someone came before the Most Great Countenance and submitted that if it was His blessed will and He gave permission, they would take Him wherever He wished […]</p>
<p>By God, besides Whom there is none other God! Were I to be slain a thousand times each hour, it would be dearer to me than to accept, for the sake of my own comfort and protection, any matter wherein is observed the slightest harm or degradation to the Cause of God. All were astonished and bewildered at the independence of the Beauty of the All-Glorious, and returned perplexed until the appointed time of rest ended and the preparations for departure began. The events of that time reached such a pass that Muslims, Jews and Christians, both men and women, wept, while the Divine Beauty spoke alone with verses of grandeur and majesty, manifesting such sovereignty that the officers accompanying Him were willingly or unwillingly submissive. Along the way, divine verses were continuously revealed upon all the trees, mountains and stones past which He proceeded, and when they came before the eye of God, decisive utterances were issued and the Chosen Tongue spoke words which all tongues and hearts are powerless to mention or comprehend. Soon shall be manifested through His power that which He hath deposited in the treasuries of all things, even as hath been revealed in the Tablets of glorious might.</p>
<p>What else can be related of the tribulation of Gallipoli? In truth, the tribulation was this: after arrival, an officer named Omar, who had come from Istanbul with several men, presented himself and submitted his commission. God is Most Great! What a commotion arose at that moment among the family of God and His kindred! Some were determined to drown themselves in the sea, while others resolved to take their own lives, for he had submitted that he was to separate this company and the members of the household from the Ancient Beauty and send them to the great city, while the Most Holy Exalted Beauty was to be sent to this prison - though even this was not explicitly clear, which was the cause of greatest dismay. During that supreme earthquake, the like of which cannot be conceived in all creation, the Beauty of God appeared in such wise and sat upon the throne of grandeur and majesty that none save His most sacred and exalted Being could comprehend it, while in every moment verses of power descended like unto an ocean. Exalted, exalted be God’s dominion and His might, God’s grandeur and His glory, God’s manifestation and His splendor in those days!</p>
<p>The officer who had accompanied from the Land of Mystery arrived at the threshold of the gate and submitted his request to attain the presence and receive permission to return. After attaining the Most Great Presence, the Most Pure Tongue spoke and related all the events that would appear thereafter. God willing, I hope there will be a day of meeting when each of these occasions may be related face to face. After completing these sublime utterances, He spoke with power and might, addressing him thus: “What I say, God says, and it hath been revealed in the Book.” And that person, humbly and submissively before the face of God’s grandeur, confirmed this, while the effects of humility and submissiveness from the descent of divine revelation were evident from all his limbs and members, nay, from that entire chamber of the house and all things within it, until he received permission to depart from the Source of Command and returned. After the passing of some days, the Divine Temple embarked upon the ark and traveled upon the sea. Exalted be all His conditions, manifestations and effects in every state of His states! Exalted was God, manifest, speaking, uttering that He is God, the King, the Sovereign, the All-Compelling, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>While traversing the seas, when the celestial Ark halted before one of the great cities, one from among the Christian people came across a book that had been presented by one of their priests, wherein was written that which caused the trees of Sinai to move, and every delicate fibre of each leaf therein proclaimed that there is none other God but Him. Exalted be the Hand of Power that, in the innermost mystery, nurtures such servants at whose creation even the sincere servants marvel! I swear by the Educator of the world that His creation is a thousand times greater than the creation of the heavens and earth, were men to comprehend. The events of this migration are too momentous to be mentioned or described, and none can comprehend them except the All-Merciful Himself. As the purpose was but a brief mention, We shall not elaborate further. Let it be known that whatsoever hath come to pass from the beginning of this wondrous Cause until now, in all its aspects, serveth as God’s testimony unto all the worlds, and His most perfect proof unto all who dwell in the heavens and on earth.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, Exalted be His Glory, His Grandeur and His Power!</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali! Thieves lurk in ambush and traitors lie in wait, whereby the path of divine knowledge is barred and the fragrance of the All-Merciful is cut off. Beseech the True One to unlock, through His mighty hand, the gates that are shut, and to guide His true loved ones to the court of His glorious oneness. Thy letter was received and the servant present laid it before His face. The sweet savors of love were inhaled therefrom. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid thee in that which will cause the exaltation of His Word. Summon the people unto God with wisdom and utterance, and remind them of His signs and clear evidences, that perchance they may break asunder the chains of idle fancies through the Name of the Lord of all beings, and turn with heart and soul to the Most Exalted Horizon.</p>
<p>Say: O people! The divine promises have been adorned with the ornament of fulfillment, and whatsoever was announced in the heavenly epistles hath become manifest and evident. Deprive not yourselves. This is the Day for the revelation and manifestation of goodly character, deeds and words. Hold fast unto wisdom and plant in blessed, hallowed, and receptive soil that which is meet and seemly. Be not grieved at the oppression of the oppressors. By the Sun of the horizon of Revelation! All shall soon perish and return to nothingness, except that which hath been uttered by the Supreme Pen. All mention, description, color and deed shall be seized by extinction and annihilation, but the divine Word which hath been sent down from the heaven of the Will of God concerning every soul shall endure for as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven shall last.</p>
<p>Say: Strive that perchance ye may attain unto the Word and be freed and delivered from the fetters and tribulations of this darksome world. This is the counsel of Him Who is wronged in all horizons unto the loved ones of God. Well is it with him who hath clung fast thereunto and acted in accordance therewith. He, verily, is of the people of this glorious station.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Muhammad-’Ali in thy most eloquent language and thy sweetest utterance, that he may render thanks unto his Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Speaking One. We have desired to rain down upon him from the heaven of utterance the showers of wisdom and knowledge, that the rapture of the Call may so seize him that neither the insinuations of the divines nor the whisperings of the scholars who have denied God’s right and turned away from His straight Path may sadden him.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-’Ali! The Countenance of the Ancient of Days hath turned toward thee from His Most Great Prison, and hath made mention of thee in such wise as the world and all that the nations possess cannot equal. To this beareth witness the Mother Book which hath appeared in truth and speaketh forth in this glorious and exalted station. We have caused those near unto God to hear the verses of thy Lord, and have shown unto them that recognize His unity that which the Beloved beheld when He ascended to the most sublime Summit and the highest Horizon - the station whereon the All-Merciful revealed Himself in the light of His holy, mighty, and luminous countenance. By God’s life! Were We to unveil that which We have concealed from eyes, thou wouldst see the people struck down. Thus doth He Who speaketh in every matter make mention unto thee, that there is none other God but Me, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>We have heard thy call and perceived the fragrance of thy love. We have answered thee with a Tablet from whose horizon shineth forth the Day-Star of thy Lord’s utterance, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thus have We sent down upon thee from the ocean of forgiveness a mercy from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the realm of dust! By God, the Lord of the Kingdom hath come with a sovereignty before which no faction among all factions, nor all the hosts of earth and heaven can stand, if ye be of them that are assured. He hath come with the truth and hath rent asunder the veils with manifest sovereignty. Fear ye the All-Merciful, and follow not the manifestations of idle fancies who have broken God’s covenant and His testament, and have changed God’s favor after it was sent down through grace. These are indeed among the most lost in God’s Book, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>We have manifested that which lay hidden in thy Lord’s knowledge and was recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Tablet. To this every discerning scholar beareth witness. Among the people are those who have denied God’s proof and His testimony, and among them are those who have heard and turned toward their Lord and answered Him when every heedless doubter turned away, and among them are those who have sacrificed their souls and their wealth for love of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath fulfilled God’s covenant and His testament, and hath done that which he was bidden in the Book. He is assuredly among those brought near unto God in His mighty and praiseworthy Tablet.</p>
<p>Gladden thou on My behalf My loved ones with My tender mercy and My compassion which have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. Say: This is God’s Day, did ye but know it, and this is the day for deeds, were ye but doers of them. Cast aside all else through My Name and take what ye have been given by One mighty, powerful, and ancient. Thus have We adorned the temple of utterance with the robe of thy Lord the All-Merciful’s loving kindness. When thou hast attained and beheld, arise and say: “Thine is the praise, O Thou the Goal of the world! And Thine is the glory, O Thou the Beloved of those who dwell on earth and in heaven! And Thine is the splendor, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all things! I testify that Thou hast manifested that which was hidden from time immemorial. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Wondrous.”</p>
<p>We have sent down for each one mentioned in thy letter that from which the fragrance of thy Lord’s gracious and bountiful favor is diffused. We beseech God to confirm them in that which He loveth and which pleaseth Him, and to manifest through them that which beseemeth His days. He is indeed the Almighty, to Whose sovereignty all created things have testified, and to Whose power all things possible have borne witness. There is none other God but Him, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>We make mention of the friends of God in that land who, upon hearing the call, soared on the wings of certitude to the atmosphere of the love of the All-Merciful. These are servants unto whom God hath testified in His Books which He sent down to the Prophets and Messengers. O friends of the All-Merciful! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He counseleth you to observe trustworthiness and godliness, patience and forbearance, and that whereby the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Wondrous, may be exalted. Let not the doings of men sadden you, nor the oppression of those who have wronged you without clear proof from God, the Object of the knowing ones. We counsel you with wisdom as We have counseled you and Our friends before, lest the fire of hatred be kindled in the breast of every ignorant and remote one. Rejoice in My mention of you, then give thanks to your Lord Who speaketh at every instance that there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Praiseworthy. Thus have We expounded the verses and sent them down in truth as a grace from Our presence, and I am the Wronged One, the Revealer, the Stranger. By God! We have spent what We possessed on the first day whereon the scratching of My Most Exalted Pen was raised between earth and heaven, but most of the people are among the ignorant. They have cast away their God and taken the calf for themselves as lord besides God. Verily they are among the most lost in My perspicuous Book. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who have held fast to My strong cord.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali time and again, then send down for every name that was in his book that which will solace his eyes and gladden his heart. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Rajab-Qabli-’Ali! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He maketh mention of God in the Most Great Prison and summoneth the people to His luminous horizon. We beheld thy name in the book of one who loved Me and have made mention of thee with verses that equal not what the kings and rulers possess.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Muhammad and counsel him with that whereby the Cause of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, may be exalted. Give thanks to thy Lord at all times. He maketh mention of thee with that whose fragrance shall never be cut off. To this testifieth He Who proclaimeth that there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Loving. Rejoice thou in My mention of thee, then assist thy Lord with the hosts of deeds. Thus hath the matter been decreed from before God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>We make mention of the Noble One and counsel him with that wherewith We have counseled Our friends. By God! This is the Day of deeds, yet most of the people comprehend not. This is the Day of mention and praise. Blessed are the people who know. O Noble One! Make mention of thy Lord in the nights and days, at eventide and dawn. He is with His servants, hearing and seeing, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
<p>O David! He Who made mention of Me hath made mention of thee, and We make mention of thee as a grace from Us, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Sovereign of all sovereigns. Let not the doings of men sadden thee. Cast aside what the people possess, holding fast to the cord of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who desired the countenance of God and was named Muhammad-Qabli-Ibrahim, and convey unto his face greetings from the Wronged One, Who proclaimeth with the most exalted call in the prison of Akka that sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Lord of the Promised Day. Give thanks unto God Who hath aided thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of His signs and the Dayspring of His evidences, and hath caused thee to hear My sweetest call when most of the people were as the dead. We have made mention of thee that thou mayest arise to aid the Cause of thy Lord through virtuous character and that which beseemeth this Day wherein all things proclaim: “Blessed is he who hath heard the call and answered his Lord.” He is among the most exalted of servants in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Mirza Kuchik, of whom the servant present before Us made mention, and verily I am the All-Knowing Remembrancer. We have heard thy call and have answered thee, and have heard thy name and turned toward thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. We counsel thee with that which We have sent down in the Book from the presence of an Ancient Revealer. Hold fast to the Book of God and say: O my God and my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy days and Thy signs and Thy clear tokens and the sweet savors of Thy Revelation, to aid me in that which befitteth Thy bounty and Thy grace. Verily Thou art the Almighty over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the All-Conquering, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The glory from Us be upon Our loved ones there who have cast away whatsoever is with the world in hope of that which is with God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the name of the Beloved of the worlds! This Day is God’s Day, and all else beside Him testifieth to His being, His grandeur and His might. Some have recognized and borne witness, while others bear witness but know Him not. There can be no doubt that all things were created in their primal reality for the knowledge of God. He that hath attained this station hath attained unto all good – a station so exalted that were its greatness to be fully revealed, all the pens in the realm of possibility and all the pages of creation would not suffice to exhaust its description. Blessed is the soul that hath, in God’s Day, attained unto the recognition of the Manifestation of His Cause, the Dawning-Place of His verses, and the Dayspring of the revelations of His bounty. Such a one is numbered among the sanctified, the near ones, and the sincere, even though this station be so hidden within him that he himself perceiveth it not. Yet its revelation hath its appointed time. Observe how many ascetics have remained deprived of the Lord of all worlds, and how many who had renounced the world have attained this mighty grace. As ye have heard of former times, how the date-seller attained the presence of the Chosen One, while the learned one who counted himself among the elect and the divines remained deprived. Ponder for a while the words of Him Who hath revealed the verses, that ye may drink of the pure wine that lieth concealed therein. How many sinners have been purified and sanctified by the breezes of the All-Merciful’s mercy as they wafted past them, and how many of those who acted and strove, clinging to their selfish desires, remained forbidden and deprived from the court of His unity. The Cause is in the grasp of the power of the sovereign Almighty. We beseech God to aid all to achieve that which He loveth and is pleased with. Observe the divines of the Shi’ih sect, who considered themselves more exalted, mightier, more glorious and more perfect than all other peoples, yet when the winds of tests blew and the Beauty of the All-Merciful was made manifest, they remained distant from the hiding place of nearness and reunion, and drank not from the fountain of His manifestation and attainment. They counted themselves the best among all creatures, yet were accounted as the lowest thereof in the sight of the Truth, and still they perceive it not. Well is it with him who hath been cleansed, through the Word of God, from his own will and desire, and hath attached himself to the will of Him Who is the Desire of all worlds. He is indeed accounted among the gems of creation in the sight of the Almighty.</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned towards God! Some among the servants have been and are worshippers of desire, and some are worshippers of utterances. Thus it was observed how many books they wrote to prove the truth, and how they occupied themselves with His remembrance throughout the nights and days. Nevertheless, they comprehended not a single letter of the utterances of Truth and attained not a drop from the ocean of the All-Merciful’s knowledge. Know thou the value of these days. By My life! The eye of creation hath not seen their like. Behold thou the Truth as sanctified above all things. He is manifest in all and yet sanctified above all. This is the essence of unity - that ye should behold the True One alone as all-prevailing over all things and manifest in the mirrors of all created things. Know ye all things to be sustained by Him and drawing their essence from Him. This is the meaning of unity and the purpose thereof. Some deluded ones have, in their imaginings, made all things partners with God, and yet consider themselves people of unity. Nay, by His very Self! Such souls have been and shall ever remain the people of blind imitation, limitation and restriction. Unity is to know the One as One and to consider Him sanctified above numbers, not to regard two as one. The essence of unity is to recognize the Manifestation of Truth as one with the Unknowable and Inaccessible Essence, meaning that thou shouldst regard His acts, deeds, commands and prohibitions as being from Him, without separation or connection, mention or indication. These are the ultimate stations of the degrees of unity. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto and is among those who are firmly grounded.</p>
<p>In these stations, countless utterances have streamed forth and been revealed from the Supreme Pen. Ye should strive, God willing, to collect to the extent possible the Arabic and Persian utterances that have been revealed in this Divine Manifestation from the Dawning-Place of Divine verses, and observe them. By My life! From each word will be opened unto thy heart a door of knowledge and wisdom. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Therefore hath this brief tablet been revealed. This is from His bounty unto thee. Be thou grateful unto thy Lord in thy days for this sublime bounty.</p>
<p>Those souls who have drunk from this cup and attained unto this most exalted station and most glorious horizon are not affected by the words of people, nor do selfish intimations prevent them from the shore of the sea of oneness. And if some have stumbled and do stumble at trials and tests, such souls have not in truth attained unto this station. For instance, if one truly heareth the cooing of the dove, he will surely not be deterred by the croaking of animals.</p>
<p>In this station We impart unto thee a word from the Source of grace and the Dawning-Place of supreme mercy, that thou mayest not be held back from the path of oneness by the opposition and heedlessness of the servants and the people of the land, by the tests of divine decree and newly-arisen tribulations, and that thou mayest remain firm and steadfast in the Cause and love of the Lord of the Kingdom throughout the duration of the realm of names and attributes. And that word is one which hath ever been, both outwardly and inwardly, in the divine Books, and it is this: “God doeth what He willeth, and ordaineth what He pleaseth.” If a soul attaineth unto the recognition of God and truly knoweth Him as “He who doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth,” he will never be prevented by any trial nor disturbed by any occurrence. Such a one is the drinker from the cup of assurance and the attainer unto the station of certitude. Blessed is he who hath drunk and attained, and woe unto those who are far removed.</p>
<p>Meditate a while that thou mayest drink from the crystal stream of the utterance of the Lord of the Beginning and the End. Then, like a spiritual bird, thou wilt become light and soar in the holy, divine atmospheres. If any soul attaineth not unto this station, he hath not been and shall never be accounted among the people of truth. Attainment to this station is, through God’s grace, easy and simple; nevertheless, most have not attained it, save whom thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, willeth. Thus it hath been observed that certain souls have claimed knowledge and outwardly have attained unto the days of God and knowledge thereof, yet through some matter have returned to the lowest of the low. By My life! He who heareth My call and findeth therein the sweetness of My utterance shall not be deterred by the might of kings, nor by the signs of those on earth, nor by the veils of the worlds. Behold thou the bounty - it hath reached such a degree that while thou dwellest in thine abode, the Truth, in the Most Great Prison, amid countless afflictions, is occupied with thy remembrance, lest thou be deprived of His favors and denied His grace. After recognition of God, the greatest of all things is steadfastness in His Cause. Hold thou fast unto it and be of the steadfast. No deed hath been or is greater than this - it is the king of all deeds, by thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. As for the deeds thou didst inquire about, their mention is not permitted in tablets such as these, due to the weakness of the servants. However, the deeds and actions of God are manifest and evident, as revealed and inscribed in all the heavenly Books - such as trustworthiness, truthfulness, purity of heart in remembering God, forbearance, contentment with what God hath ordained, satisfaction with what He hath decreed, patience in tribulations - nay, rather gratitude for them - and reliance upon Him in all conditions. These matters are among the greatest of deeds and are foremost in God’s sight. The remaining subsidiary ordinances have been and shall be under the shadow of what hath been mentioned. God willing, they shall reach that honored one, and he shall act according to what hath been revealed in the Tablets. More than this cannot now be mentioned. Whatever ordinances you have heard from trustworthy ones or have observed in the divine Tablets, act upon them that ye may attain unto the rest. The spirit of the heart is the knowledge of God, its adornment is the acknowledgment that He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, its robe is the fear of God, and its perfection is steadfastness. Thus doth God explain for whomsoever He desireth. Verily, He loveth him who turneth unto Him. There is no God but He, the Forgiving, the Generous. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Convey sublime greetings from the Wronged One to His Honor, my brother, upon whom be the Glory of God. Say: Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Qiblih of the worlds. There hath been ordained for you the reward of one who hath attained His presence and appeared before His mighty throne. In this case, return to your homeland is best, that perchance through your return the fragrances of love may waft over some souls, and God willing, they shall be confirmed through God’s confirmations in teaching His Cause. When a heart is connected to the Most Great Sea, surely rivers shall flow forth from it. Due to the agitation of this land and the wretchedness and heedlessness of its people, We have not, outwardly, given permission for arrival, but We have written for you the reward of those who arrive. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O My Name! Render thanks unto God for having made thee the showers of grace upon that which We have sown in blessed and goodly soil, and for having made thee the spring of loving-kindness for that which We have planted of wondrous and lofty trees. This is a bounty wherewith nothing created in the realm of possibility can compare. We have given thee to drink of the choice wine of utterance from the chalice of the favors of thy Lord, the All-Merciful - this sanctified Mouth which, when opened, causeth all created things to quiver, all beings to move, and the Dove to warble. This is the Living Waters for all who dwell in creation. Time and again have We wafted unto thee the fragrance of the All-Merciful from this Branch, moving upon the riding-beast of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. By God, the True One! Were all existence, both seen and unseen, to turn towards it, they would behold it soaring to the Ultimate Goal, that Station wherein the Lote-Tree of the Uttermost Boundary proclaimeth: “There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.”</p>
<p>Blessed art thou for having journeyed through God’s lands and for having been a sign of joy and assurance unto the people of Baha who have detached themselves from all else save Him and have turned with their hearts toward this Spot wherefrom the horizons have been illumined. There hath been showered upon them that which hath showered upon thee from the waves of this Ocean that hath encompassed all who dwell in the worlds.</p>
<p>Thou art he who hath recognized the victory of God and hast arisen to achieve it through wisdom and utterance. Say: My victory is the proclamation of My Cause. Thus have the Tablets been filled. This is God’s decree, from first to last. Say: Know ye, O people of insight, that they who have abandoned wisdom have failed to recognize God’s victory as revealed in the Book. Fear ye God and spread not corruption in the land. Take hold of that which ye have been commanded by your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. He knoweth victory and hath taught you through an utterance that no imaginings of those who wander in the wilderness of doubt can ever cloud.</p>
<p>O My Name! Give thou the contingent beings to drink once again from this chalice whereby the seas have been caused to surge. Then kindle within their hearts the fire that blazeth and flameth from this crimson Tree, that they may arise to offer praise and thanksgiving amidst the followers of all religions. Various letters from thee have reached the Throne. We have read them through Our grace and have revealed for every name mentioned therein that which hath transported minds and caused spirits to soar. We have made thee hear, time and again, the warbling of the leaves and the singing of the nightingales upon the branches. Thus hath the Pen of God moved to make mention of thee, that thou mayest remind the people through this utterance which God hath made the Dayspring of His signs.</p>
<p>Blessed is the land wherein the remembrance of God hath been raised, and blessed are the ears that have attained unto that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Counsel the servants with that which We have counseled thee, that they may restrain themselves from that which they have been forbidden in the Mother Book. They who commit that which giveth rise to mischief among the people have indeed strayed far from God’s victory and His Cause. They are assuredly among the mischief-makers in the Tablet which God hath made the Dayspring of all Tablets.</p>
<p>Say: Were We to will it, We would assuredly give victory to the Cause through but one word from Us. He is, verily, the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling. Were God to will it, He would cause to emerge from the den of might the lion of power, who would roar with a roar like unto the pealing of crushing thunder in the mountains. But since Our mercy hath preceded all things, We have ordained complete victory to consist in mention and utterance, that Our servants throughout the earth might thereby attain. This is of God’s grace unto them. Thy Lord, verily, is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>Say: Fear ye God, and commit not that which would grieve My loved ones in the kingdom. Thus doth this Pen command you, the Pen from which the Most Exalted Pen hath moved in the arena of wisdom and […]</p>
<p>O ’Irfan! Convey My greetings to the faces in which thou findest the radiance of Baha, then remind them with this remembrance whereby the eyes of the righteous have been solaced. Verily, the Glory be upon thee and upon those who hold fast to the cord of God, the Revealer of verses.</p>
<p>O My Name! Some people have not grasped the meaning of assistance, as it is observed that good and evil are still unknown to some - that is, they have not distinguished between them. In most Tablets, they have been explicitly forbidden from corruption, conflict, contention and matters that cause sedition and tumult among the people. Nevertheless, they have risen to pursue matters that have caused disturbance to minds and hearts.</p>
<p>It is said that one of the Arab kings said to one of his companions, “Is it possible for someone to have never eaten faloodeh and not know what it is?” The companion submitted that indeed, there are many who have never eaten it and do not know it. One day an Arab came before the king. The companion suggested that this might be one of those who had never experienced faloodeh and didn’t know what it was. The king said if this proved true, he would give him a purse of gold. Then he ordered a feast to be spread with all manner of foods. They placed the faloodeh before the Arab, who began to eat. From his manner of eating, they realized he did not know what it was. The companion asked him what it was. He replied, “In the Qur’an, God, exalted be His glory, mentions date palms and pomegranates. We have date palms in our land; I assume this must be pomegranate.” The companion said, “O king, you should give me two purses of gold, for he doesn’t know pomegranate either!”</p>
<p>[…] This story was related without its beginning and middle, as we have mentioned what was relevant to the point. In any case, forbid all the people in the lands from provocative matters, corruption, conflict, and conditions that give rise to sedition. What is desired today is the teaching of the Cause. For example, if those who have risen and continue to rise with certain notions in mind would instead arise to teach the Cause, soon all the people of that land would attain to the robe of faith.</p>
<p>A verse was revealed in the Tablet to Nabil of Qa’in - if one attains to the sweetness of that verse, he will understand the meaning of assistance: “Say: Utterance is a substance that seeketh penetration and moderation. As to penetration, it is conditional upon refinement, which in turn is dependent upon hearts that are detached and pure. As to moderation, this is commingled with wisdom as recorded in the Tablets.”</p>
<p>O My Name! Utterance seeketh penetration, for if it penetrateth not it will not be effective, and its penetration dependeth upon pure breaths and detached hearts. Likewise, it seeketh moderation, for without moderation the hearer will not bear it and will at first turn away. And moderation is the combining of utterance with the wisdom that hath been revealed in the Books and Tablets. When utterance possesseth these two qualities, it becomes the effective substance that is the universal cause for the transformation of being. This is the station of complete assistance and divine victory. Whosoever attaineth unto it is empowered to teach the Cause of God […]</p>
<p>O My Name! The Sun of utterance hath dawned from the horizon of divine revelation in such wise in the scriptures and tablets that the kingdom of expression and the heaven of explanation are in a state of expansion, vibration and effulgence through Him. Yet most people understand not.</p>
<p>That the station of triumph and victory hath repeatedly flowed and continueth to flow from the Pen of destiny signifieth that the loved ones of God must not arise to engage in matters which give rise to mischief and corruption. All must endeavor to promote the Cause of God in the manner described. This is of His grace, specially bestowed upon His loved ones, that all may attain unto the station of which He saith: “Whoso quickeneth a soul hath verily quickened all mankind.” Outward dominion hath been and shall ever be beneath this station, and for it there is a time appointed in God’s Book. He verily knoweth and will manifest it through His sovereignty. He is, in truth, the Powerful, the Subduing, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The sanctified souls must ponder and reflect upon the methods of teaching. From the divine holy Books they should memorize phrases and passages bearing on various instances, so that in the course of their speech they may recite divine verses whenever the occasion demandeth it, inasmuch as these holy verses are the most potent elixir, the greatest and mightiest talisman. So potent is their influence that the hearer will have no cause for vacillation. I swear by My life! This Revelation is endowed with such a power that it will act as the lodestone for all nations and peoples. Let a man but ponder upon that which hath been revealed, and he will be assured that no greater means for the promotion of unity and concord exists than that which God hath provided. The Kitab-i-Aqdas hath been revealed in such wise as to attract and embrace all the divinely-appointed Dispensations. Blessed are those who peruse it! Blessed are those who apprehend it! Blessed are those who meditate upon it! Blessed are those who ponder its meaning! So vast is its range that it hath encompassed all men ere their recognition of it. Erelong will its sovereign power, its pervasive influence and the greatness of its might be manifested on earth. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O My Name! Hearken unto My Voice from the direction of My throne. He desireth to make mention of thee at all times, inasmuch as He hath found thee steadfast in celebrating His praise amongst men. Thy Lord loveth faithfulness as found in the realm of creation, and hath placed it ahead of most other qualities. He is verily the Mighty, the Powerful. Know thou moreover that We have heard thy supplications raised before God, thy Lord, the Most High, the Great. Blessed art thou for having confined thine affairs to this irrevocable, mighty and wise Cause. We beseech God to make thy call even as a magnet to attract the names in the kingdom of creation, that all beings may hasten towards it unintentionally and unwittingly. He is verily the Almighty over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most August, the Most Glorious, the Most Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!</p>
<p>All praise, sanctified above comprehension and imagination, befitteth that Self-Subsisting Lord Who, through His conquering might and overwhelming power, hath raised the banner of “Verily He is God” to the most exalted station of the world, and unfurled the standard of oneness upon the supreme horizon of the hearts of them that have recognized His unity. The banner hath been interpreted as the Seal of the Prophets, and the standards as the Manifestations of His names and attributes - exalted be His glory, elevated be His power, magnified be His sovereignty; there is none other God but Him.</p>
<p>O Aqa Khan! Upon thee be the peace of the All-Merciful. Hearken unto the call that hath been raised in the Most Exalted Paradise from the Divine Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Do that which the Wronged One commandeth thee and leave the mud-workers to their mud. Soar on the pinions of certitude to the atmosphere of thy Lord’s mercy, the All-Merciful, and say: O people of the realm of possibility! By God, the gate of heaven hath been opened, and the Lord of the Kingdom of Names hath come with power and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Thou wert with Me and didst hear My call and witness the heaven of My wisdom and the light of My Cause whereby the horizons were illumined. Beware lest the calumnies of men debar thee from the Most Great Prospect. Leave behind what the people possess and take what the Wronged One commandeth thee from God, the Lord of all beings. Behold the ocean - how it surgeth before the face. Then hearken to what the Dove of Utterance warbleth upon the highest branches. When the kawthar of My remembrance and the choice wine of My utterance take hold of thee, arise and say with wisdom and utterance: O people of the realm of possibility! He desireth naught from you save justice and fairness in this Cause whereby faces have been darkened and hearts melted, except for those whom God, the Lord of creation, hath willed.</p>
<p>I was silent. He caused Me to speak by His command and made Me manifest among His servants. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Can leaves remain still when winds blow? Can anyone have choice in the face of God’s Will, the Lord of all men? Say: Be fair, O people, then turn unto Him when His signs which have spread throughout the lands have come from God, the Revealer of verses.</p>
<p>We have made mention of his honor Jim while thou wert in the presence of the Wronged One and desired his remembrance. We have remembered him in such wise as no remembrance can equal. We beseech God to assist him to be just, that he may behold what hath appeared with his own eyes, not through the eyes of others. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to make him a standard of His remembrance among the people and an ensign of His Name in all lands, and to enable his honor Alif and Ha to rend asunder the veils of the servants with the finger of trust and power. Thus have the fragrances of utterance been diffused and the regions illumined by the light of wisdom and exposition.</p>
<p>Let not the doings of the aggressive sadden thee, nor the doubts of the baying ones prevent thee from God, the Cleaver of the daybreak. By God’s life and His Cause, in the early days there was none possessed of power to call the servants, nor of strength to arise for the Cause, nor of sovereignty to guide people to the straight path. We arrived in Iraq and manifested that which the All-Merciful had revealed in the Qur’an through His words “and the trumpet shall be blown a second time.” Thereupon the light shone forth and the lands were illumined. Thus doth the Divine Lote-Tree make thee hear its call, and the Mount its revelations, and the Light its radiance.</p>
<p>We beseech God to strengthen thee to serve His Cause, that thou mayest arise with thy whole being for the reformation of the world and the refinement of the souls of the nations. He is, verily, the Counselor, the Mighty, the Bestower. We have set aside eloquent language and desired to converse with thee in the luminous tongue.</p>
<p>Hear thou in the Persian tongue the Call of the Wronged One, and hold fast to that whereby the light of justice, equity, chastity, trustworthiness and grace may shine forth among men. This cannot be achieved except through the fear of God, and the fear of God appeareth not save through the divine religion. It is the impregnable fortress for the protection of the world of being and a manifest shield for the temple of existence. Most of the servants have suckled at the breast of heedlessness, and the training of such souls dependeth upon the rod of divine threats. Among the requirements of divine wisdom recorded in the Books of the past and by the Most Exalted Pen are the mention of promise and warning. May thou be aided to accomplish that which will cause the upliftment of souls and attraction of hearts. Some words are the source of the immortal Kawthar and the water of life - they bestow life and grant a new spirit, purifying existence from the defilement of doubts and fancies. Others are like the messenger of death whom neither armies nor fortresses can repel, seizing the spirit. The fruits of that tree are life, vitality, joy and gladness, while the fruits of this tree are death, extinction and sorrow. The purpose of what hath been and will be mentioned is that through the endeavors of those possessed of high resolve, strife, corruption and conflict may be erased from the pages of the world, and its horizons, cleansed from the darkness of discord, may be illumined with the light of unity. May the fire of hatred and animosity hidden within the hearts and minds of various peoples be quenched by the Kawthar of divine counsel and the rain of the mercy of the All-Merciful. We have previously stated that religious hatred consumeth the world. Perchance through the efforts of true men and spiritual heroes the world may be adorned with the ornament of unity. This is not difficult for thy Lord. That which causeth the unity and harmony of the world hath appeared today, but the tyranny of oppressors and the clamor of the barking ones have prevented the Most Luminous Pen from its mention. Beseech thou God to make the world ready for the appearance of that which will adorn it with the ornament of justice and illumine it with the light of unity. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee with the hosts of wisdom and utterance and with that which beseemeth His generosity and grace. He is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. And now this Wronged One beholdeth Himself before God and offereth this prayer […]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Thou seest mine eyes gazing toward the horizon of Thy grace, and the hands of this poor one raised toward the heaven of Thy generosity. Whenever I contemplate, O my God, Thy justice, my limbs tremble, my heart is troubled, my joints quiver, my sighs ascend and my tears fall; and whenever I contemplate Thy grace and bounty and Thy dealings with Thy loved ones, my spirit soars, my heart is assured and my soul finds rest. By Thy glory, O my God, Lord of Names and Creator of heaven! My liver is melted from shame and my very being is aflame with the fire of my sorrow. I have done in my days what Thou didst forbid in Thy Books and through the tongues of Thy Messengers. I acknowledge, O my God, my transgression against myself. I have forsaken what was meet and proper, and committed that which hath caused the dwellers of the cities of Thy justice to lament. O my God, my God! My sins have prevented me from turning to the lights of the Orb of Thy grace, and my trespasses have come between me and the revelations of Thy names and attributes. O Lord! Thou seest the sinner seeking the ocean of Thy forgiveness, and him that is far removed yearning for the court of Thy nearness. I beseech Thee by the waves of the sea of Thy bounty and the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of Thy giving, and by Thy Prophets and Messengers whom Thou hast made the lamps of guidance among Thy creatures and the daysprings of piety amidst Thy beings, to aid me in Thy remembrance and praise and in that which Thou hast commanded in Thy Book. I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned to Thee, detached from all else but Thee, acknowledging Thy unity and oneness, assured of Thy grandeur and sovereignty, and confessing Thy might and power. Alas, alas! My heedlessness hath destroyed me and my disobedience hath worn me out. I know not, O my Goal and my Adored One, with what face to turn toward Thee, with what heart to approach Thy most exalted horizon and supreme height, and with what tongue to offer excuses before the manifestations of Thy justice, O Lord of all being! My sin hath prevented me from drawing nigh unto Thee, and my deeds have come between me and Thy bounty and generosity. I have done what Thou didst forbid and neglected what Thou didst command. Alas, alas! I am he who cast aside the ordinances of Thy Book and took up the book of his own self, and committed that which hath deprived me of the pearls of the sea of Thy knowledge and forbidden me from the sweet waters of Thy mercy and bounty. Behold, O my God, my evil plight, my distress and my perturbation. O my God, my God! My hope is in Thy grace and my desire in Thy generosity. The ocean of disobedience hath turned to the ocean of Thy forgiveness, and the mountain of error to the heaven of Thy pardon and bounty. If Thou keepest afar him who draweth nigh unto Thee, and if Thou deniest him who calleth upon Thee - by Thy power, O King of the seen and unseen realms and Sovereign of grandeur and might! I find for myself no helper besides Thee, no supporter apart from Thee, no one merciful other than Thee. The fire of heedlessness and passion hath consumed me - where is the river of Thy mercy, O Goal of them that know Thee? The hosts of fancy and vain imagining have removed me far from Thee - where is the light of Thy nearness, O God of all in the heavens and earth? The thirst of disobedience hath destroyed me - where is the ocean of Thy forgiveness, O Thou Who art remembered in the hearts of them that have drawn nigh unto Thee? I beseech Thee, O God of earth and heaven, by the Ark that sailed by Thy command upon the sea of knowledge, and by Him through Whom the breezes of Thy Revelation were wafted and the heavens of Thy sky were honored by His advent, and by those through whom Thy traces were spread abroad and Thy standards were raised up and Thy commands and laws appeared and the horizons of Thy realm were illumined, that Thou disappoint me not of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones. O Lord! Thou seest the weary one seeking the kingdom of Thy utterance, him that is far removed yearning for the precincts of Thy mercy, and the sinner desiring the ocean of Thy bounty and forgiveness. Verily Thou art God, the One, the Alone, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O God! Send Thy blessings upon Thy Messengers and Thy chosen ones, and upon Thy loved ones who supported Thy Cause and raised the standards of Thy Faith and strove until they sacrificed their spirits in Thy path. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>

<p>Praise, sanctified from all mention and thought, befitteth the Lord of the world, Who brought the non-existent into being and adorned existence with the ornament of everlasting life. Great is His power, exalted His might, sublime His Will and all-encompassing His Purpose! And blessings and peace be upon the Manifestations of His most excellent names and most exalted attributes, then upon Him through Whom were opened the gates of inner meanings and utterance in the contingent world, and through Whom appeared that which draweth people nigh unto the Lord of all religions, and upon His kindred and companions, whose proof He made the sharpened swords and upraised spears, and through whom the foundations of the idolaters were shaken and the limbs of the aggressors made to tremble - they whom the All-Merciful hath described in the Qur’an as honored servants who speak not until He hath spoken, and who act by His command.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God and the God of the world! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy utterance and the mysteries that were hidden in the hearts of Thy chosen ones to aid Thy servants to act with justice and equity and to that which guideth unto the path of righteousness. Verily, Thou art the Lord of creation and the One Who speaketh in the beginning and the end.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter from that honored beloved one arrived some time ago. Praise be to God, it bore witness to service, steadfastness, attention, receptivity and sincerity. After its reading and hearing, it was taken to the Sacred Presence and presented before His countenance. He said:</p>
<p>O physician, upon thee be My peace! Thou hast ever been and art still remembered. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to confirm thee in that which shall cause the turning of souls unto Him and the unity and fellowship of hearts. God willing, rely wholly upon Him and resign thyself completely to His will, detached from all else. Strive at all times that perchance the tyranny of the world may be transformed into justice and the oppression of nations into equity. This Wronged One hath, from the earliest days until now, called upon them that are near unto Him to partake of the river of divine mercy, and the rebellious to the ocean of God’s forgiveness. The purpose was that all might be adorned with the ornament of sanctity and be aided to manifest such deeds and character as would exalt the people of divine unity. However, the matter became obscure to the rulers and divines of the earth, and they imagined otherwise. For this reason the idolaters are seen to prevail and triumph. We beseech God to aid first the people of divine unity to achieve unity and concord, and then to grant them strength that they may preserve their rights and be protected from the oppression of the aggressors and the tyranny of the idolaters.</p>
<p>O Physician! My greetings be upon thee! The appearance of these unseemly matters hath been and is the consequence of deeds. They attribute the ocean of knowledge to ignorance, and pure justice to tyranny. God is witness and aware that from the first days this Wronged One hath had no purpose except the exaltation of the people of unity, the glorification of the Book of God, the reformation of the world and the education of the peoples. For thirty years or more We have dwelt in the realms of the sublime State - may God preserve it from the evil of creation - and not so much as a mustard seed of any matter contrary to the Law of God hath appeared from these servants. Nevertheless, according to the people of Iran, they sent Us in utmost abasement to this land. God knoweth what befell Us upon Our first arrival. That which the people of Baha have sought and continue to seek in the nights and days hath been and is the unity of the two governments and the concord of the two peoples, that perchance through this there may be manifested that which is now concealed.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and to Thy grandeur and Thy sovereignty and Thy power and Thy might. I beseech Thee by the Most Great Ocean and the mysteries of eternity and by Thy Will through which Thou hast subdued the world, to ordain for us that which will draw us nigh unto Thee and will aid us in Thy remembrance and praise and in acting according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. O Lord! Fear of Thine enemies hath encompassed us; transform it into assurance from Thee and tranquility from Thy presence. Weakness hath seized us from all directions; transform it through Thy power. Thou art He Who hath detailed from the Point sciences which none hath known save Thyself. The conditions of Thy creation and the transgressions of Thy servants have not hindered Thee. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou desirest. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, that beloved of the heart hath ever been favored with grace and is mentioned in the prison. If this servant sometimes delayeth in sending letters, this is due to the trust I have had and continue to have in your honor, and likewise due to the multitude of mine own occupations. That beloved one is himself witness and testimony; no testimony from any soul hath been or is needed. Praise be to God, the strong ones are steadfast and successful. The weak ones must be considered. When a child appears in the realm of existence, it continuously seeketh milk and must be given it. In these days a letter hath arrived from the people of Iraq with many complaints. After it was presented before Him, He said:</p>
<p>Write to the Physician that whatsoever hath been entrusted to you must spread its fragrance like unto the fragrance of roses amongst the servants. We wrote before and now say again that your honor must satisfy the heirs of the deceased and must act in such wise as to cause souls to turn towards and be enkindled by the fire of love and affection. Today what is necessary for your honor is this: to act in whatever way possible that which will strengthen the cords of love. Whosoever acteth for the sake of God will assuredly be assisted by the effulgences of the lights of divine grace and will be aided. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Concerning the small house located at the head of the alley where previously the friends of that land maintained a bakery, you wrote that you have purchased it and that beloved one’s intention was to present it in service to our Master His Holiness the Most Great Branch (may my spirit be a sacrifice for the dust of His holy steps), and it was requested that He accept it. After these matters were presented before His presence, He said to inform the Most Great Branch, and after informing and presenting it, He accepted it. Well done to you and congratulations.</p>
<p>You wrote that you have made some repairs which have preserved the rooms and then rented them out so that the expenses may be recovered. After presenting this matter, He said: “You have acted very well, for We are embarrassed before Alif and Ha in this matter. The less burden placed upon them, the more beloved and acceptable it is before the Wronged One, and We beseech God to grant you too a reward.” End quote.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the joy of Jinab-i-Amin Effendi (upon him be God’s peace), God willing it is blessed. This evanescent one beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to assist him to be steadfast, wise and of service. I convey greetings to him. The servant asks his Lord to confirm him in all conditions in that which will preserve him and ordain for him the good of the hereafter and this world. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Another matter to present is the marriage of the elevated brother of the Imprisoned One (upon them both be God’s peace and mercy). God willing it is blessed. We beseech God to unite hearts and assist His loved ones in what He loves and is pleased with. Verily He is the Generous, the Kind.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the house of the late Shaykh (upon him be God’s favors), it was presented before the Intended One. He said: “It befits Jinab-i-Tabib (upon him be My greetings) to conduct himself in such a way that all are pleased with him. The world and all within it was not and is not worthy. We have regarded and regard his station and rank, and it is hoped this station will remain preserved by God’s will.” End quote.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! It is very clear and evident that whatever is mentioned is intended to preserve that beloved one’s station. This servant beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to assist that honored one in what causes the elevation of station, the exaltation of glory and the upliftment of rank. This blessed word was once uttered from the Tongue of Utterance:</p>
<p>“Since the Countenance of the Ancient One is turned toward other worlds regarding the sincere ones and near ones, therefore outward means have been delayed in fulfillment. Otherwise all the world’s good things, wealth and blessings have been and are directed toward the loved ones, and surely these stored bounties and favors will become manifest.” End quote.</p>
<p>The intention is that in such matters, whatever comes to pass - if it is agreeable, the purpose is achieved; otherwise that beloved one has been and is more worthy to bear hardships, for that beloved one must ever be focused on matters that cause the exaltation of the Cause and elevation of station.</p>
<p>I convey greetings to the loved ones of that land and offer praise. God willing, may they attain to the station of unity and harmony, and be adorned with such conduct and deeds as will cause the exaltation of souls and the advancement of humanity. This servant beseeches his Lord to assist them in that which will raise them up among the peoples. Verily He is powerful over all things and worthy of answering prayers. Peace and praise be upon you all and upon those with you and upon God’s righteous servants, and all praise belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the name of our Lord, the Most Invincible, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>Immeasurable praise and glory befit the Lord of Names, Who hath quickened all created things with the waters of utterance. This indeed is that Water mentioned in all previous Books. Its source is the Supreme Pen, and its streams are the hearts and souls of them that are pure in spirit. The life of all being dependeth upon it. It is the wellspring of the life of the world and the cause of its continuance, and it is that Living Water which the chosen ones and loved ones of God strove to attain. In most excellent language hath it been mentioned by the All-Merciful in the Qur’an, where He saith, exalted be His utterance: “By means of water have We given life to everything.” It sustaineth and nourisheth all the waters of the world. Were its sustenance to be withheld for less than a moment, all things would return to nothingness. Glory be unto Him Who hath adorned it, exalted it and made it manifest!</p>
<p>Whoso hath on this day attained unto this Water through the divine chalice of His words is accounted among the living, and whoso hath failed to attain unto it is reckoned among the dead. Should the true followers of the Bayan, from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end, seek to praise and glorify this most holy, most exalted, most resplendent, most pure, and most sanctified Water, they would surely find themselves powerless to do so. If the end of existence cannot be known, how then can the end of that which encompasseth all things be reckoned? Glorified be the Creator and glorified be He Who hath manifested and revealed His purpose. He, verily, is the One Who ruleth in truth and judgeth with justice in both the beginning and the end.</p>
<p>I offer salutations, peace, and glorification upon His loved ones and chosen ones, the Manifestations of His utterance, the Daysprings of His laws, the Sources of His Cause, and the Rising-places of the suns of His knowledge–they who have cast away the world in their haste to reach the Most Great Ocean, that station wherein the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the Peerless, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed!”</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou before Whose remembrance and praise the very essence of knowledge standeth abashed, and the kingdom of utterance findeth itself ashamed to describe Thy station! For all besides Thee hath been created by Thy Will and through the movement of Thy Most Exalted Pen. How then can that which was created by a movement from Thee comprehend Thy manifestations, Thy attributes, and the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and wisdom?</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Lord of Kings and the Merciful One to all who are possessed! I beseech Thee by the leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree and the Manifestations of Thy bounty in the Most Exalted Paradise to ordain for him who hath turned unto Thee that which beseemeth the heaven of Thy grace and the ocean of Thy generosity. Thou, verily, art the Almighty to do as Thou pleasest, and in Thy grasp are the kingdoms of all names. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O Lord! Illumine all faces with the lights of Thy countenance and all hearts with the effulgences of the Sun of Thy knowledge. Thou art He at Whose most sweet call the Concourse on High hastened to Thy Most Glorious Horizon, and through Whose Most Great Name the world was set ablaze. I beseech Thee by Thy Command, Thy pervading influence, and Thy sovereignty, to draw nigh unto those who have desired Thy nearness and Thy presence. Then write down for them the reward of those who have attained unto Thy presence and have hearkened unto Thy verses.</p>
<p>O Lord! Thou art He Whose power and might every tongue hath testified to, and Whose sovereignty and authority every possessor of utterance hath acknowledged. There is none other God but Thee, the Expositor, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>In My Name which is sanctified above all words and mention</p>
<p>O Musafir! The Wronged One remembers thee and calls to mind the days when thou didst stand at the gate and sit in the presence of His countenance, hearkening unto that which the Speaker of Sinai uttered in the Land of Manifestation and beholding the face of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Blessed be thine eye for what it hath beheld, thine ear for what it hath heard, and thy tongue for having uttered the praise of God, the Lord of the worlds. We bear witness, even as We bore witness before, that thou didst leave thy homeland, turning unto God, until thou didst arrive at the Prison and attain that which was recorded in the Books of the Messengers. Thou didst attain My presence and drink the Kawthar of reunion from the hands of My bounty. Thou didst enter the Prison by leave of Him Who is the Source thereof and departed therefrom by His command. Verily, He recordeth the deeds of every steadfast believer. The servant in attendance hath presented thy letter before the Wronged One. He hath heard and answereth thee through this Tablet, the mighty, the wondrous. We have inhaled the fragrance of thy love, heard thy call, and witnessed thy devotion. We turn unto thee from the precincts of the Prison. Verily thy Lord is He Who ruleth as He pleaseth and ordaineth what He willeth.</p>
<p>From this spot We make mention of My loved ones in that place who have taken hold of the Book of God with the power granted by Him and have clung to His luminous hem. Convey My greetings unto them and remind them of My days, My verses and My clear proofs which have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. We also make mention of the children of the Friend and the heirs of Him Who conversed with God, whom the affairs of men have not prevented from the Most Great Vision. They heard, responded, and hastened with their hearts unto the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. These have testified to that which God testified before the creation of earth and heaven: that there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The world hath been illumined by the Most Great Light, yet the people do not comprehend. Blessed are ye, O children of the Friend, in that the Glorified One maketh mention of you, appearing resplendent in this hour while seated upon the Throne of Grandeur in this exalted Station. Beware lest the signs of the people prevent you from the Lord of this Day. Leave behind what is with the people, turning unto God, the Possessor of the visible and invisible.</p>
<p>O Nabil, O My Musafir! Give them the glad tidings of My mercy, My loving-kindness and My favor which have encompassed all created things. The Glory shining forth and dawning from the horizon of the Forehead be upon thee, upon those with thee, upon them, and upon those who have attained the recognition of God, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that you have attained unto that which was recorded and inscribed in the divine Books of former and latter times. God willing, may the friends of God in that land who are adorned with the ornament of steadfastness engage in the mention and praise of the Beloved of the worlds with utmost joy and fragrance, with wisdom and utterance. Wisdom hath been beloved in all conditions. Blessed is he who holdeth fast unto it and acteth in accordance with what hath been ordained in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant conveyeth his utter nothingness and greetings to each one, and declareth: Praise be to God that ye have attained unto the most great bounty and the supreme gift, and have recognized this mighty Day whose greatness hath been revealed by the Supreme Pen in former and latter scrolls. Now preserve this most great station in the name of the Lord of Eternity. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of inner meanings that all the treasures and riches and wealth and bounties of the world cannot equal the station of a single one of the friends of God. This evanescent servant hath heard such utterances from the Tongue of Grandeur concerning these stations that were they to be revealed, some might perish from joy and gladness. God willing, may all be aided to do what God loveth and be enabled to achieve the good-pleasure of the Peerless Friend.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about His Holiness Ismu’llah Jamal, upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God, it was submitted to the Most Holy and Exalted Presence. He said: “For God’s sake hath he chosen to travel. God willing, may he be successful in serving the Cause of God, that is, in teaching His Cause. We have mentioned him before and at this time, as a token of Our grace, for verily I am the All-Bountiful, the Generous.”</p>
<p>And likewise concerning the son of Ismu’llah Asdaq, upon both of them be the Glory of God, and regarding Aqa Mirza Haydar-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, you wrote. In these days their letters have reached this evanescent one and I am engaged in preparing replies. Mention of them was also made in the Most Holy and Exalted Presence. His exalted Word: “They have moved by God’s command, traveling in His name, speaking His praise, and known for His love. They have especially chosen to travel for the purpose of teaching according to the Command. God willing, may they attain unto that which is today beloved and acceptable.”</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Aqa Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, one Most Holy and Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed for him and sent. God willing, may he attain unto it and receive his portion from the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful. The blessed fragment is also available and will be sent when appropriate.</p>
<p>Concerning your mention of meeting with Nabil, upon him be the Glory of God, in the land of Ta [Tehran], and likewise the mention of the honored beloved Mirza Varqa, upon him be the Glory of God and His light - all were submitted before the Divine Throne of Grandeur and were blessed with the rays of the Sun of Providence. This evanescent servant in all conditions beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, for their confirmation, that all may drink successively from the ocean of divine bounty in this most mighty, most holy, most exalted Day. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Forgiving, the Generous. Praise be unto Him for He is the Goal of all the worlds. Glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon your family and upon those whom God hath related unto you and upon the friends of God, the steadfast, the firm, the well-assured, the unshakeable.</p>

<p>Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! The tongues of all created things testify to Thy sovereignty and Thine omnipotence, and proclaim mine own poverty and my wretchedness when face to face with the revelations of Thy wealth. Look, then, O my God, upon this sinner whose gaze hath, at all times, been fixed upon the source of Thy forgiveness, and whose eyes have been bent upon the horizon of Thy grace and Thy gifts.</p>
<p>Ever since the day Thou didst create me at Thy bidding, O my God, and didst arouse me through the gentle winds of Thy tender mercies, I have refused to turn to any one except Thee, and have, through the power of Thy sovereignty and Thy might, arisen to face Thine enemies, and have summoned all mankind unto the shores of the ocean of Thy oneness and the heaven of Thine all-glorious unity. I have sought, all my days, not to guard myself from the mischief of the rebellious among Thy creatures, but rather to exalt Thy name amidst Thy people. I have, thereby, suffered what none of Thy creatures have suffered.</p>
<p>How many the days, O my God, which I have spent in utter loneliness with the transgressors amongst Thy servants, and how many the nights, O my Best-Beloved, during which I lay a captive in the hands of the wayward amidst Thy creatures! In the midst of my troubles and tribulations I have continued to celebrate Thy praise before all who are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth, and have not ceased to extol Thy wondrous glory in the kingdoms of Thy Revelation and of Thy creation, though all that I have been capable of showing forth hath fallen short of the greatness and the majesty of Thy oneness, and is unworthy of Thine exaltation and of Thine omnipotence.</p>
<p>I swear by Thy glory, O Thou Who art the one alone Beloved! I find myself to be only nothing before the habitation of Thy great glory. Every time I attempt to extol any one of Thy virtues, my heart restraineth me, for naught but Thee is able to soar into the atmosphere of the kingdom of Thy nearness, or reach up to the heaven of Thy presence.</p>
<p>Thy might beareth me witness! I am well aware that were I to bow myself before a handful of dust, from now until the end that hath no end, in acknowledgement of its relationship to Thy name, the Fashioner, I would still find myself far removed from that dust, and incapable of approaching it, and would discover that such an adoration can in no wise befit it, nor transcend the limitations to which I myself have been subjected. And were I to arise to serve one of Thy servants, and to wait at his door so long as Thine own kingdom endureth and Thine omnipotence will last, as a sign of my acknowledgment of the tie that bindeth him to Thy name, the Creator, I would, likewise, – and to this Thy glory beareth me witness – have to confess my complete failure to do him adequate service, and my deprivation of what can truly befit his station. And this for the reason that I recognize in them naught else except the bond that bindeth them to Thy names and Thine attributes. How can, then, such a man succeed in befittingly extolling the One through a motion of Whose finger all the names and their kingdom were called into being, and all the attributes and their dominion were created, and Who, through yet another motion of that same finger, hath united the letters B and E (Be) and knit them together, manifesting thereby what the highest thoughts of Thy chosen ones who enjoy near access to Thee are unable to grasp, and what the profoundest wisdom of those of Thy loved ones that are wholly devoted to Thee are powerless to fathom. I swear by Thy glory, O Beloved of my soul! I am bewildered when I contemplate the tokens of Thy handiwork, and the evidences of Thy might, and find myself completely unable to unravel the mystery of the least of Thy signs, how much more to apprehend Thine own Self. I beseech Thee, therefore, O my God, by Thy Name through which Thou hast caused all such as love Thee to soar in the atmosphere of Thy will, and hast guided all them that yearn after Thee into the Paradise of Thy nearness and Thy presence, to waft from the heaven of Thy loving-kindness the fragrance of certainty upon the needy among Thy loved ones, in these days when the tempest of trials have compassed them on every side, and so grievously assailed them that the souls of men have been troubled and the foundations of all beings have trembled at what hath been sent down unto them from the heaven of Thine irrevocable Purpose. They were so shaken that the lamp of their love for Thee and of their remembrance of Thee was ready to be extinguished in the recess of their hearts. Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou, in truth, art the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>This text is already in English and therefore does not require translation. It appears to be a prayer revealed by Baha’u’llah, translated by Shoghi Effendi.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Look Thou upon this wronged one, who hath been sorely afflicted by the oppressors among Thy creatures and the infidels among Thine enemies, though he himself hath refused to breathe a single breath but by Thy leave and at Thy bidding. I lay asleep on my couch, O my God, when lo, the gentle winds of Thy grace and Thy loving-kindness passed over me, and wakened me through the power of Thy sovereignty and Thy gifts, and bade me arise before Thy servants, and speak forth Thy praise, and glorify Thy work. Thereupon most of Thy people reviled me. I swear by Thy glory, O my God! I never thought that they would show forth such deeds, aware as I am that Thou hast Thyself announced this Revelation unto them in the Scrolls of Thy commandment and the Tablets of Thy decree, and hast covenanted with them concerning this youth in every word sent down by Thee unto Thy creatures and Thy people.</p>
<p>I am bewildered, therefore, O my God, and know not how to act toward them. Every time I hold my peace, and cease to extol Thy wondrous virtues, Thy Spirit impelleth me to cry out before all who are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth; and every time I am still, the breaths wafted from the right hand of Thy will and purpose pass over me, and stir me up, and I find myself to be as a leaf which lieth at the mercy of the winds of Thy decree, and is carried away whithersoever Thou dost permit or command it.</p>
<p>Every man of insight who considereth what hath been revealed by me, will be persuaded that Thy Cause is not in my hands, but in Thy hands, and will recognize that the reins of power are held not in my grasp but in Thy grasp, and are subject to Thy sovereign might. And yet, Thou seest, O my God, how the inhabitants of Thy realm have arrayed themselves against me, and inflict upon me every moment of my life what causeth the realities of Thy chosen ones and trusted ones to tremble.</p>
<p>I entreat Thee, therefore, O my God, by Thy Name through which Thou hast guided Thy lovers to the living waters of Thy grace and Thy favors, and attracted them that long for Thee to the Paradise of Thy nearness and Thy presence, to open the eyes of Thy people that they may recognize in this Revelation the manifestation of Thy transcendent unity, and the dawning of the lights of Thy countenance and Thy beauty. Cleanse them, then, O my God, from all idle fancies and vain imaginations, that they may inhale the fragrances of sanctity from the robe of Thy Revelation and Thy commandment, that haply they may cease to inflict upon me what will deprive their souls of the fragrances of the manifold tokens of Thy mercy, that are wafted in the days of Him Who is the Manifestation of Thyself, and the Day-Spring of Thy Cause, and that they may not perpetrate what will call down Thy wrath and anger. Thou well knowest, O my God, that I was regarded as one of the people of the Bayan, and consorted with them with love and fellowship, and summoned them to Thee in the daytime and in the night season, through the wonders of Thy Revelation and Thine inspiration, and sustained at their hands what the inmates of the cities of Thine invention are powerless to recount. I swear by Thy might, O my Beloved! Every morning I waken to find that I am made a target for the darts of their envy, and every night, when I lie down to rest, I discover that I have fallen a victim to the spears of their hate. Though Thou hast made known unto me the secrets of their hearts, and hast set me above them, I have refused to uncover their deeds, and have dealt patiently with them, mindful of the time which Thou hast fixed. And when Thy promise came to pass, and the set time was fulfilled, Thou didst lift, to an imperceptible degree, the veil of concealment, and lo, all the inmates of the kingdoms of Thy Revelation and of Thy creation shook and trembled, except those who were created by Thee, through the fire of Thy love, and the breath of Thine eagerness, and the water of Thy loving-kindness, and the clay of Thy grace. These are they who are glorified by the Concourse on high and denizens of the Cities of eternity.</p>
<p>I give praise to Thee, therefore, O my God, that Thou hast preserved them that have acknowledged Thy unity, and hast destroyed them that have joined partners with Thee, and hast divided the one from the other through yet another word that hath proceeded out of the mouth of Thy will, and flowed down from the pen of Thy purpose. Thereby have Thy servants, who were created through the word of Thy commandment, and were begotten by Thy will, caviled at me, and so fiercely opposed me that they repudiated Thee, and have rejected Thy signs, and have risen up against Thee.</p>
<p>Thy glory beareth me witness, O my Beloved! My pen is powerless to describe what their hands have wrought against Him Who is the Manifestation of Thy Cause, and the Day-Spring of Thy Revelation, and the Dawning-Place of Thine inspiration. For all this I give praise to Thee. I swear by Thy glory, O my God! My heart yearneth after the things ordained by Thee in the heaven of Thy decree and the kingdom of Thine appointment. For whatsoever befalleth me in Thy path is the beloved of my soul and the goal of my desire. This, verily, is to be ascribed to naught except Thy power and Thy might.</p>
<p>I am the one, O my God, who, through the love I bear to Thee, hath been able to dispense with all who are in heaven and on earth. Armed with this love, I am afraid of no one, though all the peoples of the world unite to hurt me. Oh, that my blood could, this very moment, be shed on the face of the earth before Thee, and Thou wouldst behold me in the condition in which Thou didst behold such of Thy servants as have drawn nigh unto Thee, and those of Thy righteous creatures as have been chosen by Thee!</p>
<p>I give Thee thanks, O my God, that Thou hast decided through the power of Thy decree, and wilt continue to decide through Thine irrevocable appointment and purpose. I entreat Thee, O my Beloved, by Thy Name through which Thou didst lift up the ensigns of Thy Cause, and shed the splendors of the light of Thy countenance, to send down upon me and upon such of Thy servants as are wholly devoted to Thee all the good Thou hast ordained in Thy Tablets.</p>
<p>Establish us, then, upon the seats of truth in Thy presence, O Thou in Whose hands is the kingdom of all things!</p>
<p>Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Most Merciful.</p>

<p>O My Name! Upon thee be My glory! The letter from Samandar–upon him be My glory–which he wrote to thee was presented before the Face. He made repeated mention of Andalib–upon him be My glory–and the friends of that land. Praise be to God, all are adorned with the ornament of steadfastness and are firm and steadfast in the Cause of God. The Supreme Pen hath made mention of the loved ones of the land of Qaf in such wise that it would be difficult for those who would enumerate to reckon it. Blessed are they, and theirs is a goodly retreat.</p>
<p>Mention hath been made of Nabil-i-Akbar–upon him be My glory. He hath turned toward the land of Kha for the purpose of teaching the Cause of God. We beseech God to assist him to make mention of Him and to praise Him, and to serve His mighty and exalted Cause. Convey greetings on behalf of the Wronged One to the rest of them who are in that land. In truth, Samandar hath been and continues to be vigilant over the loved ones. We beseech God to illumine all hearts with the lights of the Day-Star of His Cause. This is that which hath ever been loved and accepted before God. The darkness of the world shall be dispelled through the light of unity, and dispersion shall be changed to gathering, rejection to acceptance, disbelief to faith, and waywardness to supreme guidance.</p>
<p>They made mention of Ibn-i-Abhar–upon him be My glory. We beseech God to assist him and to set him ablaze with the fire of love, that perchance the servants on earth may be enkindled and turn from abasement to glory, and from the realm of extinction to the realm of immortality. O My Name! Although all that was to be said hath been said and all that was hidden hath been revealed, yet it hath profited the servants nothing. All are wandering in the wilderness of heedlessness and error, save whom God willeth. The existing peoples were not and are not worthy to turn to the Countenance of Glory. Throughout ages and centuries they have worshipped and continue to worship the calf. Such is the state and station of most of them.</p>
<p>Mention hath been made of Mirza Aqa–upon him be My glory–and his namesake, and an answer hath been sent down from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful’s utterance. Not an atom’s weight escapeth His knowledge, and He is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Convey greetings on behalf of the Wronged One. We beseech God to assist them to do that which is befitting this triumphant day. The loved ones must consult together by night and day, and hold fast to that which is conducive to the betterment of the world and to unity, harmony and the reformation of the world. What carpet hath not been rolled up, what edifice hath not been destroyed, what glory hath not come to an end, and what sun hath not set! While time remaineth, they must count it as a treasure and arise to serve the Cause of God. Though it is observed with absolute certainty that the existing ears are incapable of hearing, and likewise the eyes are not worthy of beholding. The people have become familiar with vain imaginings and idols. Consider the people of Persia: for one thousand two hundred years they spoke of vain imaginings, clung to vain imaginings, and held fast to their hem. And after the manifestation of their ignorance and heedlessness on the Day of Judgment, again the people of Bayan cling to and utter the same vain imaginings. Glory be to God! They remain heedless of that which they have witnessed with their own eyes. What, after all, was the fruit of that people’s deeds, and what became of them? The world of knowledge is bewildered at the ignorance of those souls. They came from the world of ignorance and unknowing, and to the world of ignorance and unknowing do they return. Beseech ye God that perchance in this world of darkness–that is, the world of such souls–a star might dawn forth, that they might see and find.</p>
<p>Concerning what was mentioned about dear Sharif - before the exaltation of the Cause, the laws of the Apostle of God (may my spirit be a sacrifice for His sake) remain valid and binding, except for such deeds as would cause commotion. Convey on behalf of the Wronged One greetings to that soul and give him glad tidings that his deed hath been accepted and confirmed in the Most Exalted Horizon. Well is it with him, happy is he.</p>
<p>We make mention of Khalil, upon him be My glory, and We recall the days when he attained Our presence, heard the Call, beheld the Most Exalted Horizon, and dwelt in the vicinity until the irrevocable decree came for his departure to the land of Qaf. We testify that he attained that which was hidden in knowledge and inscribed in the Books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>His nephew and other relatives have all been and continue to be remembered before the Wronged One. We have mentioned them in verses and given them glad tidings of My loving-kindness and mercy which have encompassed all existence, both seen and unseen.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Jinab-i-’Abdu’l-Husayn and the handmaiden of God, upon her be My glory. Several months ago a decree was revealed from the Supreme Pen regarding this matter, and apparently it has not yet arrived. Praise be to God, before the arrival of the decree, that which was befitting was done. Jinab-i-Ismu’llah J, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, presented the details before the Most Holy Court. Blessed is he and joy be unto him.</p>
<p>The loved ones, especially those adorned with the distinction of rank, should strive to the extent possible to assist in the affairs of the friends and their completion. We beseech God to aid them and grant them success in that which they have been commanded in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Mention of Jinab-i-’Andalib, upon him be My glory, was made at first from the Supreme Pen. Now, as he was mentioned again at the end of the letter, We make mention of him. By the life of God, We have previously mentioned him in terms that no thing can equal, nor any treasure among treasures - nay, all the treasures of the world. We beseech confirmation and success for him, that he may attract the dejected souls in the dusty earth through the mention and praise of the Lord of Names, and teach them to soar.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Jinab-i-Haji Baba Kulih-Darrih, upon him be My glory. We heard mention of him and turned toward him that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones. O Baba, the people of the Bayan are seen to be more lost than the previous faction. They have regarded the divine counsels as if they never existed. That which was revealed in the Persian Bayan and which all were commanded to follow, they have attributed to corruption. They possess neither sight nor hearing of their own, although in most passages the Point (the Bab) states “Look upon Him with His eyes and hear with His ears” - and this passage specifically refers to this Manifestation. Yet with the transgressors it has been abandoned and rejected. O Baba, convey greetings to the friends of the village on behalf of the Wronged One and give them glad tidings of God’s loving-kindness. Verily He is with His accepting servants and with His steadfast servants.</p>
<p>That which was written concerning ?akim Ilya was observed. That which was revealed specially for him and the other friends of the letter Ha and Mim was such as caused decayed bones to quiver and bestowed eternal life. Let us see what will appear from the people of that land and what fruit it will yield. Make mention of the teacher and his associates and all the members of the household on behalf of the Wronged One, that they may drink from the chalice of remembrance and be set ablaze with the fire of the love of God. Thus have We sent down the verses and expounded them with truth and dispatched them unto thee that the servants of the earth may be mindful thereof. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Munificent. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you, O My friends, and upon them that have quaffed the cup of faithfulness before the faces of men and have drunk therefrom in My Name, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. The Cause is in God’s hands, the Lord of what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>O My leaves and My handmaidens! The letter that was sent hath twice been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One, and the glances of His loving-kindness have been directed towards you. Praise be to God, ye have partaken of the waves of the ocean of the Merciful’s utterance and have been illumined by the effulgences of the Sun of Manifestation. Ye have heard that for the hearing of which the world was brought from nothingness into being. Know ye the value of your stations. I swear by the Sun of Truth which hath shone forth from the most exalted horizon of existence, there hath been ordained for those men and women who have turned unto God, who are devoted and are attracted, that which the descriptions of the people of the world and the mentions of nations fall short of and are powerless to recount. Well is it with you and pleasant is it for you. We beseech God to assist all to occupy themselves with the mention of the Goal of all the worlds with the utmost joy and fragrance, and to transform separation into the light of unity and accord, that the hearts of His servants may be adorned with the holy words “We are God’s.” The world is deprived while ye are triumphant. In its primary rank, poison hath destroyed all in the inmost essence, yet they perceive it not. We beseech God to illumine hearts and souls with the lights of the Day Star of love and unity. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>We make mention of Our loved ones there and give them the glad-tidings of that which hath appeared for them from the treasuries of My Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto the heedless. O My loved ones! The Wronged One maketh mention of you through verses the like of which cannot be found, and We mentioned you before in such wise as to attract the hearts of them that are nigh unto God. A letter hath come to hand in the Most Great Prison in the name of My handmaidens, written by him who hath turned unto the Supreme Horizon and hath drunk the cup of reunion from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the All-Merciful, the Munificent. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the most great steadfastness in this Cause whereby the backs of the idolaters were broken and the pillars of the idols were shaken. He is assuredly among the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise in the sight of God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech God to assist His loved ones with the angels of the unseen and the visible world and to aid them to triumph in His Cause through the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Conquering, the Omnipotent. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon you, O My loved ones and My friends, and upon them that love you for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>

<p>Praise be sanctified above the tongues of created things, befitting the most holy court of that Intended One who ordained the Primal Word to be the fountainhead of the water of life for all contingent beings. From but a single sprinkling of its outpourings, countless oceans came into being and were made manifest. Whosoever attained unto a drop thereof was adorned with a wondrous new life, while he who remained deprived thereof died a death after which no life was to be seen. How great is His bounty and how exalted His generosity, which has ever been and shall forever remain beyond the reckoning of them that reckon, the comprehension of them that comprehend, and the knowledge of them that know! He is the One Who created all contingent beings through a command from His presence, brought them forth, gave them utterance, and caused them to grow, then made them return unto Him. He is the One through Whom the horizon of utterance was illumined, the proof was made manifest, and the nightingale warbled upon the branches. Sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Single One, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>The Glory shining forth from the horizon of the loving-kindness of the Lord of Names rest upon His chosen ones who have cast away what the people possess when that which is with God hath appeared. These are honored servants upon whom neither fear shall come, nor shall they grieve. Through them were the standards hoisted and the banners unfurled. The Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Cities of Names send their prayers upon them. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to decree for this evanescent servant that he be numbered among them, that He gather me beneath their shade, give me to drink from their cups, and draw me nigh unto them in all conditions. Verily, He is the Lord of the beginning and the end. There is none other God but He, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice unto your praise! This evanescent servant hath been blessed to hear the scratching of your pen, which hath spoken in praise of God and His chosen ones, and in remembrance of God and His loved ones. When the wine of utterance had intoxicated me, I turned toward the Beloved of all possibility and presented before His face your letter and what had been inscribed therein by the pen of your love and the ink of your affection. When this was completed, the countenance of the Beloved turned toward me and He spoke that which was the Kawthar of life to all contingent beings, the dayspring of knowledge to the followers of all religions, and the dawning-place of certitude to whosoever hath turned unto his Lord, the All-Merciful. At the end of His utterance, I heard these sublime words: We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid him to remember and praise Him, and to draw him nigh unto Him through His bounty and sovereignty, in such wise that he shall behold naught in existence save the countenance of the Adored One, that he may remind the servants of what God hath revealed in the Book, that perchance they may abandon the fancies of their souls and the imaginings of their hearts, and hold fast unto that whereby God hath distinguished between truth and falsehood. Verily, He is the Almighty, Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate and no matter can thwart. From His Most Exalted Pen have flowed the oceans of names, and through His supreme bounty hath been manifested that whereby all things have been made to speak. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the Only, the Self-Subsisting, Who begetteth not, nor was begotten, and there is none comparable unto Him.</p>
<p>O physician! God willing, mayest thou be favored by the grace of God and speak with wisdom and eloquence amongst the people of the contingent world. For people have not yet comprehended the purpose, most of them wandering in the wilderness of idle fancies and traversing the desert of vain imaginings, occupied with a mere pond while veiled from the Most Great Ocean. Gradually, heedlessness has reached such a point that the religion of God has weakened and the path of God has been forsaken. They have abandoned the Book and Tradition, and taken up volumes of conjecture and fancy. What was the strength and might of Islam in its early days, and what has it become now? Weakness, impotence, and feebleness have reached such a degree that understanding fails to comprehend it and the pen falls short of describing it. Glory be to God! How can it be that man, despite possessing reason and understanding, becomes so confused about a matter that he attributes injustice to the Dawning-Place of justice, and counts the essence of fairness among the oppressors? We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to rend asunder the veils through His grace and lead the people from the darkness of heedlessness to the dawning-place of light. Whenever thought turns to these matters, sorrows encompass from all directions. It behooveth us to turn to God and say:</p>
<p>O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of names and in Whose right hand is the reins of all things! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the world to ordain from Thy Most Exalted Pen for the people of creation that which will draw them nigh unto Thee, O Creator of the heavens! My Lord! Thou seest and hearest what hath befallen Thy servants at the hands of Thine enemies. I beseech Thee to protect them and raise them to the highest station of glory, exaltation, might, and power. Thou art He to Whose greatness, power, sovereignty, and authority both my outer and inner tongue bear witness–nay, all my limbs testify. Thou doest what Thou willest in the kingdom and ordainest what Thou desirest. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the nobleman upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], it was very good indeed. In any case, this matter is acceptable and praiseworthy, for both your honor is occupied with a profession and thereby the pretext of the heedless will be lessened. I beseech the Most High to ordain for your honor the good of this world and the next, and their profit. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the Afnan, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God, it caused great joy, delight and gladness, for praise be to God, they proceeded in perfect health, blessing and well-being to visit the stars of the Muhammadan heaven and the Imams of God’s religion, peace be upon them. If one would be somewhat fair and reflect, one would always be engaged in goodly matters and attain lofty stations. I beseech God for success in enabling this evanescent servant to be confirmed in goodly matters and to accept deeds and remembrances that are unworthy. Verily, He is the Single, the One, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Eliyahu requesting expenses - this matter is most strange from him, for referring such matters outwardly to this Seat has never been and is not now favored. Every matter in the world has had and has its proper reference point. Today everyone who has drunk from the ocean of knowledge has known and knows that this Station is sanctified and holy above such talk, conditions and mentions. If they are in that land, convey greetings to them on behalf of this evanescent servant and make mention that I beseech God, exalted be His glory, not to deprive you from the outpourings of the cloud of bounty and to make you successful in that which is good. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>His Holiness the Most Great Branch - may my spirit, my being and my essence be a sacrifice for the dust of His blessed footsteps - has gone to Beirut some time ago, therefore the letter sent remains until He returns, and what His Holiness had commanded in reply was exactly right and the matter unanswered.</p>
<p>Concerning what was mentioned about being commissioned to Iran - that beloved one knows that no one here is given such a commission. Out of pure grace they said return to your own land and if you can, remind some of the servants of praiseworthy conduct and pleasing deeds which are the cause of the appearance and manifestation of the essence of humanity. This is what has been and is said to all. This servant beseeches God to engage them in that which He loves and with which He is pleased. And on behalf of this evanescent servant convey greetings to Mirza Sulayman from the people of Ha. They were observed with intelligence and acumen and God willing my petitions will not be forgotten by them. Their mention has been and is here. Verily He loves faithfulness and has commanded His servants to faithfulness. Glory be to God, the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, Who created existence and all things through the First Word, and verily He is the Single, the One, the Wise.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the letter of Hadba, it is known that all are commanded to wisdom and love. Certainly if they conduct themselves in such a way that the consul is pleased with them, it would be most fitting and excellent. God willing may all be engaged in the remembrance of God with the utmost joy and fragrance. Some time ago a letter arrived from His Holiness Zayn - upon him be the Glory of God - and this servant has not been successful in replying. God willing perhaps in these days he will be enabled, and hope for pardon from them in all conditions.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote that his honor Muhammad Surur Effendi - upon him be the Glory of God - has proceeded to the land of Ha, and someone gave a petition in the name of His Holiness the Most Great Branch - may the spirits of all worlds be sacrificed for Him - it was previously submitted that He is not present. God willing after His return whatever is required will be submitted. At this time they gained admittance to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. Write:</p>
<p>O physician! We make mention in this station of My loved ones in that place and counsel them with the supreme wisdom, even as We have counseled My loved ones in other cities. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to enable them to manifest love, affection and unity. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty. And We make mention of thy two sons - give them the glad-tidings of the remembrance of the Wronged One and remind them of that which will draw them nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The Glory be upon them and upon thee and upon them both and upon thy wife who hath borne tribulations for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>He Who is our Purpose, our Beloved, and our Object of Worship beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who hath appeared is His Manifestation, His Self, His Visible Form, His Sovereignty, His Cause, and His Power. He is the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Secret. Through Him the letter Kaf was joined to its pillar, the letter Nun. The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of His utterance be upon His loved ones and companions who have not broken His covenant and testament, who were not hindered by the doubts of the skeptics nor the gestures of the heedless, and who were not frightened by the hosts of princes nor the clamor of those in the realm of creation. They turned with illumined hearts and radiant faces on a Day when all but those whom God, our Lord and the Lord of earth and heaven, wished, turned away.</p>
<p>And now, O beloved of my heart, thy letters and writings have descended like copious rain. Praise be to God, thou art remembering with thy tongue, hearing with thine ear, witnessing with thine eye, turning with thy face, accepting with thy heart, taking with thy hand, and writing with thy pen. Glory be to Him Who hath strengthened you, guided you, caused you to know, established you, and granted you a great kingdom in His remembrance and the service of His Cause. Though outwardly there hath been separation due to God’s consummate wisdom, the writing of letters hath joined that which no separation can part nor any change or transformation affect. Exalted be His glory, universal His bounty, great His grace, and mighty His bestowal! The replies to thy beloved letters were written in detail, but their dispatch was delayed this time, and this brief note is hastily submitted. For it is crystal clear that no glad tidings and no joy or delight can be greater than a message from the Most Holy Court. Its tidings revive the soul and its effect bestoweth life upon decayed bones. How then could there be delay, given your burning desire and this evanescent servant’s sincerity?</p>
<p>The letter from the honored friend Abbas (upon him be the Glory of God), which the spiritual friend Ali Haydar (upon him be God’s glory and favor) forwarded, was presented at the Most Holy Court. The answer to his question was revealed from the heaven of divine will, and as commanded, this servant wrote and sent it to Ali Haydar for delivery. This was truly a great bounty bestowed upon him, for questions had previously been forbidden, as revealed in response to a petition from one of the divines. His blessed and exalted Word states: “This is not the day for questions. It behooveth every soul, when hearing the call from the Supreme Horizon, to arise and say: ‘Here am I, O Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven!’” Nevertheless, the answer to his question was graciously given and dispatched. Happy is he! We beseech God to assist him in that which befitteth His Cause and His days.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! According to the command, when you give an amount to any person, let them not think it is continuous, for if they understand this it will cause you difficulty. Often there is nothing available, as most times in this land expenses are met by borrowing from others. However, the teachers must receive sufficient means that they need not be dependent and accept nothing from others except for the love of God, love of His Cause, and the exaltation of His Word. If such souls are found, the Cause will move faster than lightning and encompass all lands.</p>
<p>Regarding the specified amount, according to instructions it was bestowed upon some, including Mishkin-Qalam who, with his family, left Cyprus several months ago and came to the Most Holy Court, thus losing their government pension. Many travelers have also come this year. Five people, one of whom is Mulla Muhammad-’Ali-i-Yazdi, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, were given fifty tumans. As no cash was available, according to instructions Aqa Mirza Muhammad, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, obtained it from some sources to be repaid later.</p>
<p>Since your departure nearly a year ago, very little has been received. Though the Cause rests with God, exalted be His glory, this is meant to inform you. Regarding what you wrote about borrowing if necessary from his honor Afnan or Haji Shaykh Muhammad-’Ali, upon them both be the Most Glorious Glory of God, nothing has been borrowed yet. Whatever was needed was obtained from outside sources and spent here and for the community, as you are aware.</p>
<p>When your latest letter arrived, permission was granted to receive that amount, perhaps to pay scattered debts. A small amount for the House has not yet been received but was deposited with his honor Afnan. These days there is intention to discuss the matter of the House. The pool is still not finished - had you been here, it would have been completed quickly. This servant, considering the blessed word revealed in the Book from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of Names which states “Enlarge thy skirts, O Jerusalem,” has begun this work.</p>
<p>Another matter: ten tumans were previously given to the honored Hajiyyih, upon her be the glory of God, from the people of Kaf. The intention was not to receive it back, but the honored lady mentioned during her departure and return about returning this amount there. It became known they had borrowed this amount as a debt and intended to repay it. Thus it was arranged to be given there to the honored beloved Ibn-i-Abhar, upon them both be the glory of God and His favors. Later it was decreed that it should not be accepted. The honored Amin should, on behalf of the Truth, relinquish it to her and convey greetings and expressions of favor on behalf of the Wronged One. This has not been forgotten and remains mentioned. End.</p>
<p>And likewise they said to tell him that Mulla Ahmad and Khan did not come to the Most Holy Court, although you mentioned they had said “We will go there too.” In any case, let it be known that truthfulness, justice and fairness are rare to find in the world, and if found are as scarce as the philosopher’s stone. Mulla Ahmad’s purpose is clear, but poor Khan is unaware and knows not the cause and reason thereof. May that leaf, upon her be Baha’s blessings, beseech God’s grace that He may rend asunder the veils of tyranny and oppression, and deprive not His servants of the effulgent rays of the Orb of justice and fairness. He is the Potent, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Regarding his honor the Bey, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, praise be to God, after his petition and that of the beloved one, it was once again crowned with acceptance, and a separate leaf concerning this matter is enclosed which will come to view. And that they wrote they are proceeding to Hamadan is very good, for one of the companions in that land committed a deed that caused the tears of the sincere to flow and the sighs of those near to ascend. Therefore some hearts were saddened. O Amin! Such souls have ever been the cause of the Faith’s abasement among the people. Beseech God to grant the doer the grace to return, that he may repent like unto Nasuh and take refuge with the Truth, exalted be His glory, from sins and transgressions.</p>
<p>And likewise this exalted word was uttered from the Tongue of Grandeur: O Amin, upon thee be My glory! If the people of the Furqan (Qur’an) had acted according to the Law of the Apostle of God, the lands of Islam, which they imagine to be the people of unity, would not have been encompassed by the people of polytheism. Each day they seize and take away a member and a portion thereof, and until now they have not understood what is the cause and reason. O Amin! Nevertheless We have concealed, for the Truth, exalted be His glory, is the Concealer and the All-Patient. All are commanded to gracious concealment and beautiful patience. Blessed are they that attain! The friends of that land too, if they conceal, will be accounted among those who conceal in the sight of God.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Kurdistan, according to what had been written, a person there committed such deeds as the Pen is ashamed to mention, but knowledge thereof rests with our Lord. If you were to journey there and convey greetings and salutations to the friends on behalf of the Truth, and show kindness and favor, it would be acceptable in the sight of God. Some barking dogs who consider the Truth heedless and themselves learned have passed through those regions and are striving to lead people astray. In any case, that beloved one, and every fair-minded person, and beyond them the Truth, exalted be His glory, bear witness that these barking ones neither were nor are aware of the foundation of the Cause. Whatever they say, they have heard from the liars of the world - like the Shi’ih sect who heard certain fabrications from some ignorant ones, which caused them to inflict upon the souls of Truth, on the Day of Manifestation, that which made the Pen weep and the Tablet lament. It is hoped that hearts and minds will be refreshed by the sweet fragrances of that beloved one’s utterance. In any case, let the friends of Ha and Mim, as well as Kurdistan, exert mighty efforts in this matter and give glad tidings to all, that they might attain, through the breathings of revelation, to that which shall never change. Certain matters occurred in that land which this servant heard from the Tongue of Grandeur. May the Truth, exalted be His glory, grant fairness to the barking ones and sustain His loved ones with the Kawthar of supreme steadfastness. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Another matter concerns an engraver who spent some time in Hadba (Mosul), outwardly in agreement but inwardly a hypocrite. Glory be to God! Until now they have not realized what Day this is and what Manifestation! They drink from the spring of vain imaginings yet count themselves among the people of certitude. They walk in the wilderness of idle fancies yet consider themselves companions of assurance and tranquility. God forbid that anything like the former community, namely the Shi’ihs, should appear in the world. Reflect upon the deeds of those oppressive souls - what they claimed and what they did, how their words and deeds differed. At this moment I was summoned to the most exalted horizon, and after attending, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these words, exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>O servant in attendance! Write to his honor the physician, upon him be My greetings. For a long time the Supreme Pen has been speaking about the deeds of the former community. The wisdom in this is that later souls might become aware and informed, that perchance they might not be afflicted with former vain imaginings. The deniers of the Bayan are occupied with those same idle fancies. By God’s life! Until they cross the gulf of vain imaginings, they will not enter the ocean of certitude, and until they pass beyond the path of names, they will not attain to the lights of the Sun of inner meanings. This is the truth about which there is no doubt.</p>
<p>We beseech God to grant vision, for by the Finger of Power the veils have been rent asunder. We hope that the people of the Crimson Ark will not be afflicted with the suspicions and vain imaginings of the past, nor will they sully their hearts and minds with the foolish utterances of this one and that. The copy of the letter written to Husayn, known as Sukhte, was sent. Glory be to God, how he has progressed! He has become a wanderer and has learned from the white bankers. What that beloved one has seen is but a drop from his ocean of nonsense. It would be very good if he were to send such writings to all regions. Ask God to bestow a subtle light upon the vision of the people of the world. In any case, this servant has seen many things and has much in his possession, but I pray and seek assistance from all the friends that He may guide those veiled souls and remove from the world the foul odor of ignorance, unawareness, rancor and hatred. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>If you inquire about the news of this land, praise be to God, all are well. For some time, the two luminaries of the heaven of grace, namely His Honour Aqa Mirza ?iya’u’llah and His Honour Aqa Mirza Badi’u’llah - may my spirit be a sacrifice for their coming - and the people of the pavilion of purity have gone to Beirut and will return in a few days. The pilgrims to the House of God this year have been many, praise be to God, and have attained their goal. I beseech the True One not to deprive anyone and to confirm and assist all in that which He loves and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Responding One.</p>
<p>Mention was made of the friends of that land. After this matter was presented before the Lord, He said: Convey greetings to all from the Wronged One. We remember them as We have remembered them before, and We beseech God to protect them from the evil of every oppressor, to guard them with the hosts of the seen and unseen, to assist them to act according to what is in His Book, and to draw them near to Him in all conditions. Goodly deeds and praiseworthy character are God’s ladder among His creation; through these every soul ascends to the ultimate goal and the highest summit. Blessed is he who attains unto them, and woe unto him who neglects them. They must associate with all people with the spirit of fellowship and with love and affection. Love is God’s light among His creation; through it every light appears and the world is illumined by it. It is the cause of creation and its manifestation, as expressed in His exalted Word: “I was a hidden treasure and loved to be known, therefore I created creation that I might be known.” Hold fast, O friends of God, to love and fellowship, kindness and unity. Your station is above all stations and your conditions above all conditions, for you are the people of unity and the companions of detachment. Ask God, your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earth, to protect you from the artillery of the polytheists and the swords of the atheists, and to assist you against His enemies through His bounty and generosity. Verily, He is the most powerful of the powerful and the most generous of the generous. Praise be to God, for He is the goal of the mystics and the Almighty over all who are in the heavens and earth.</p>
<p>This ephemeral one beseeches the True One, exalted be His glory, to assist His friends in preserving the pearls of His love and in that which will quiet the fire of hatred in the world of creation.</p>
<p>As for the matter of the House, some time ago His Honour Alif and ?a, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, wrote to this servant that the honored physician, upon him be God’s peace and favor, has requested a power of attorney. This servant presented this before His presence and He said […]</p>
<p>Half of the funds remain outstanding; therefore, We did not wish to issue a decree in this regard. Half of the funds have reached them; We await the remainder, after which whatever is commanded will be most acceptable. God is witness and testimony that We desire no harm to befall anyone, hence the matter remains postponed. We know not what the honored physician, upon him be peace, has done. In any case, We beseech God to soon arrange the means for these funds to be given.</p>
<p>In all conditions, this evanescent servant beseeches and hopes for the loftiness, exaltation, glory and elevation of that beloved one. Were it not for the unwise actions of the friends, I would have caused much trouble. Praise be to God, that beloved one is mentioned in most times. All the friends and pilgrims send their greetings and praise, and this servant conveys greetings and praise to each of the friends in that land. That land and those regions have ever been and remain in view. For each one I seek divine confirmation that they may be assisted in that which causes the elevation of the Cause and be strengthened in steadfastness, which is the mightiest foundation. Verily, He will aid them through His grace, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>At this moment, having intended to approach the Holy Shrine, He appeared before the Presence and the Lord spoke thus: “We send greetings from this Station to the physician, upon him be My glory, and to the leaf who is with him, and to his son who was mentioned before and after in the presence of the Wronged One, and to the unified ones and the sincere ones. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.”</p>
<p>This servant also conveys greetings to the honored leaf and to the son, upon them both be the glory of God, and beseeches God to ordain for them the good of this world and the next. Peace, praise, remembrance and glory be upon your honor and upon those who have acknowledged and recognized the word that there is no God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory in wisdom and utterance!</p>
<p>O My Name! Upon thee be My glory! The letters thou didst send have all been honored by the glance of favor and have attained unto the blessing of being heard. The Living Waters of the Kawthar have ever flowed and descended from the Supreme Pen, yet no seeker is to be found. Now that the baseness of the people of the Bayan hath reached such a state that Ibn-i-Ja’far-i-Kirmani hath become the leader of the people and guide of mankind, they have attributed calumnies to the King of existence - from Whose right and left flow the Euphrates of mercy and surge the seas of bounty, and Who throughout His life hath been caught in the claws of His enemies - and have made these calumnies a cause of the people’s deviation. In brief, a group, like unto the former people, are striving and endeavoring to extinguish the light of God and cut down the Blessed Tree. Therefore, the Supreme Pen hath chosen and continueth to choose silence.</p>
<p>O My Name! Among the wonders of the world is that one who hath lived his entire life in utmost comfort is called oppressed, while He Who throughout all His days hath borne imprisonment, exile, beating and the like is mentioned by another name. Such is the condition of the heedless servants. Those souls who are ignorant of the root of the Cause strive with the utmost cunning and deception to lead others astray.</p>
<p>The letter of his honor Buzurg, upon him be My glory, was noted. We make mention of him as We have mentioned him before in numerous Tablets, and I am the All-Knowing Rememberer. By My life! They have attained unto My verses. When they shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Will, the denizens of the Supreme Concourse and the dwellers on the shore of the Crimson Sea showered upon him the pearls of wisdom and utterance. O My Name! My Pen lamenteth and speaketh: Beseech ye God that He may draw the servants from the left hand of idle fancies to the right hand of certitude.</p>
<p>Mention was made of his honor Muhammad and Aqajan. Mention of both hath been sent down from the heaven of utterance of God, exalted be His glory. The relatives of the Martyr, upon him be My glory and My loving-kindness and My mercy and My grace, have ever been and continue to be remembered. My Name Jamal, upon him be My glory and My loving-kindness, sent to the Most Holy Court the petition of the wife of the Martyr, upon her be the grace of God and His mercy and His glory. Praise and gratitude be unto Him. All are adorned with the ornament of faith and are gazing toward the Supreme Horizon.</p>
<p>O My Name! For twelve hundred years the former people were worshippers of names while counting themselves among the believers in Divine unity. By the life of God! They never inhaled the fragrance of unity, as became evident and manifest from the recompense of their deeds on the Day of Resurrection. They committed that which caused the realm of immortality to implore annihilation from God, glorified and exalted be He. Not a single person in that land, whether learned or ignorant, remained except that they engaged in cursing and execration. Finally they committed that which amazeth the realm of justice and fairness. Today, should any soul reflect upon the deeds and actions of those souls and their fruits, he would become established upon the throne of certitude and would abide upon the seat of assurance. Names would not withhold him from the ocean of inner meanings, nor would the doubts and intimations of the opposers and deniers affect him. They run from city to city and village to village, thinking they are helping the Cause of God and protecting His Law. Say: O heedless ones! The Truth hath come with “He doeth whatsoever He willeth” and abideth in the pavilion of glory with “He ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth.” Whosoever drinketh from the ocean deposited within this word shall find himself free and liberated, and shall regard all else besides God as mere dust, nay, even more abject, were they but to know it.</p>
<p>O Buzurg! Mention has been made of Siyyid ’Ali and likewise his vow hath been accepted. Blessed is he in that he hath turned towards God, the Single, the All-Knowing. O Siyyid ’Ali! Strive to attain such a station that the ants of the world shall have no power over thee. The people of that land, despite their many claims, have ultimately become the most loss-bearing of all people. Beseech ye God that through the power of the Most Exalted Pen He may grant strength unto the people, bestow might, and make them powerful, that all may be adorned with the Word of God as revealed in the Bayan. He saith that a year-old child in the Day of His Manifestation is mightier than the entire Bayan. All matters have been and are dependent upon this Manifestation. The divine Books all proclaim and herald this, and the Messengers have explained and acted upon it, yet the people are in evident delusion.</p>
<p>The letter of Jalal, upon him be My glory, was perused. Mention of him hath been made in the Most Holy Court, before and after, and all that he wrote to the servant present hath been honored to be heard. Blessed is he and blessed are the friends of God in that land who were not held back by human limitations from the Most Great Prospect, and whom the hosts of those that turned away from God, the Lord of the worlds, did not frighten. We make mention of his mother and his wife. O My Name! All the souls mentioned in his letter have attained and been honored by the traces of the Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>O Jalal! Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto that which most of the peoples of the world are deprived of. Thou hast heard the Divine Call and beheld the waves of the ocean of utterance. Thy call hath been and is being heard. God, exalted be His glory, is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. He heareth and seeth. Convey My greetings to the friends in that land. Some time ago wondrous and exalted Tablets were revealed from the heaven of glory and dispatched. In every letter thereof an ocean lieth concealed. By the Sun of proof! Were the people to attain unto them and drink therefrom, they would find themselves independent of all save God.</p>
<p>O people of God! This is the Day of steadfastness. The cawing ones are spread abroad like locusts, and this is the news which the Ancient Beauty gave in Zawra and the Land of Mystery and this land, thus informing all. Today the ocean of mercy is surging and the Most Great Name standeth before all faces. Blessed are they whom the whisperings of devils and the doubts of the idolaters did not prevent or hold back from the straight path.</p>
<p>O My Name! The letter of ’Attar, upon him be the glory of God, was perused. The Most Exalted Pen hath borne and beareth witness that they are among those who arose to serve at the beginning of the Cause. Both men and women have been observed to be steadfast and enkindled in exalting the Word and serving the people of God. We beseech God to make all steadfast and to illumine them with the lights of the Sun of Truth. He is, verily, powerful and mighty over all things. Blessed is the mother who hath been named by the Tongue of the Lord of Names as the Mother of the Friends. We make mention of her at this moment that it may be a glory, an honor and a treasure for her with God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The resplendent Remembrance from the horizon of the Kingdom and the radiant Light from the heaven of might be upon thee, O My handmaiden and My leaf, who hath spoken My praise, turned unto My horizon, soared in My atmosphere, clung to My cord and held fast to the hem of My loving-kindness and mercy. Thou art she who turned unto the Most Exalted Horizon when the Creator of the heavens came with the kingdom of names, and who hearkened when the Most Sublime Pen raised its shrill voice, and who hastened unto the ocean of knowledge when the concourse of divines and rulers held back. Blessed art thou, O mother of My loved ones and she who hath shown kindness to My chosen ones. I testify that thy heart was a dawning-place of the love of God, thy tongue a source of His remembrance, and thy breast His view. Blessed is the handmaiden who turned unto thee and made mention of that which was sent down from the heaven of thy Lord’s will, the All-Merciful, when thou didst ascend unto the Most Exalted Companion and didst dwell in the precincts of the mercy of thy Lord, the Lord of all men and the Lord of the worlds to come and of the first worlds. Blessed is the earth that was honored by thy body and attained unto thy presence. I testify that thou didst believe in God when most of His servants denied Him, and didst drink of My choice sealed wine through My Self-Subsisting Name when most of the people of the lands were debarred therefrom. Thou art she whom neither clamor deterred nor hatred veiled. Thou didst voice the praise of thy Lord until thy spirit ascended unto a station known to none save God, the Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens. In thy life thou wert in a house wherein was raised the remembrance of God, the Goal of all desire, the Lord of the Throne on high and of the earth below. Thou art she who attained unto the verses of thy Lord before and after thine ascension. Mercy outstripped thee and grace encompassed thee, and light moved before thy face, and at the time of thine ascension a company of angels and the Spirit received thee. He Who possesseth the Mother Book beareth witness unto this. Glory be upon thee, upon thy beginning and thine end, thy outer and inner being, and the mercy of God and His favors.</p>
<p>O my God, my God! I beseech Thee by the hearts that were cut to pieces in Thy path and dissolved in separation from Thee, and by the bodies that soared in Thy love, and by the faces that turned unto Thy face, and by the sweet-scented breezes of Thy Revelation in Thy days, and by the manifestations of Thy power in Thy Kingdom and Thy Realm of Might, to ordain for him who hath visited Thy handmaiden, through Thy Most Exalted Pen, the best of the world to come and of the first world. Then forgive him, O my God, through Thy grace and bounty, and purify him, O my Goal, from transgression, through Thy Name, the All-Merciful. Thou art He through Whose Name, the All-Forgiving, the ocean of forgiveness surged in the contingent world, and through Whose Name, the All-Bountiful, the sun of bounty shone forth from the horizon of the world. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy face to forgive Thy servants and to remit their misdeeds and transgressions. Then accept from them, O my God, what they have wrought in Thy days and what they have arisen to render in service to Thy loved ones and chosen ones. Verily Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He pleaseth, and in Thy right hand are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>

<p>In the name of God, Who endures after the annihilation of all things!</p>
<p>Bear thou witness unto that whereunto God did testify before the creation of all things: that verily I am alive in the Most Glorious Horizon. And now from this Horizon, hearken unto that which God doth speak, and be not of them that have veiled themselves from their Lord’s command and are accounted among the heedless.</p>
<p>He calleth unto thee at the time when the spirit of life was taken from the people of all existence, save them who turned unto God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Compassionate, in those days wherein the Sun of eternity did shine forth from the horizon of the remembrance of thy Lord, the Most High, and the Dove of faithfulness warbled upon the twigs of the Ultimate Tree with verses that drew unto them the hearts of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>O friend! If thou desirest to be apprised of that which hath befallen Me, know thou that Husayn hath appeared in truth, even as was promised by the tongues of them who drew nigh unto God, and beneath His shadow have entered the realities of the Prophets and the chosen ones. Then He Who came unto you with the name of ’Ali before Nabil, as ye had heard aforetime that He would appear with manifest sovereignty and all the Prophets would enter beneath His shadow. Then the Promised Qa’im - and this is among the tidings of the ancients.</p>
<p>But when He appeared and His countenance shone forth amidst all the worlds, there arose against Him idolatrous servants: among them were those who denied His verses, those who said “I shall reveal the like of what God hath revealed,” those who said “He hath fabricated against God,” and those who said “He speaketh from desire.” Thus did it befall the Youth, if thou be of them that hear.</p>
<p>This, after We had created them by Our command and preserved them from the harm of the idolaters, and had made their names renowned and exalted their mention throughout the lands. Their likeness is as the likeness of Satan, as ye have heard before concerning that which was revealed in a preserved and mighty Tablet - that God had exalted him and named him in every heaven with one of the names, but when he perceived his own elevation and power, he waxed proud before God and became of the idolaters.</p>
<p>Even so did We exalt one among the servants lest any should discover God’s treasury of knowledge and the repository of the pearls of His wisdom. Yet when he witnessed his elevation and the exaltation of his mention, he grew proud before Us in such wise as none can recount.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not rest in thy place. Arise and say: O people! Fear ye God and follow not the satans. This, verily, is He Whose meeting was promised unto you in all the Tablets and in mighty and glorious Scriptures. Verily, He Who came with the name of ’Ali aforetime gave you glad tidings of this Manifestation and took from you the covenant of My Self before His own covenant, yet ye have broken God’s covenant and violated His testament and were of the heedless ones.</p>
<p>O people! By the True One! This is indeed His Beloved and His Glory, then His Purpose. Slay Him not with the swords of hatred and rancor, and be not of the oppressors.</p>
<p>O people! This is He for Whose sake the Primal Point sacrificed Himself, then those who took the path unto God. Say: Have ye not read in the Bayan that which was revealed concerning this Manifestation from God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise? He counseled you not to cling, at the time of His appearance, to aught that hath been created in the heavens and on earth, yet ye have clung to your own selves and desires, and have objected to Him and turned away from Him. Woe unto you, O concourse of the heedless!</p>
<p>Thus doth He speak between heaven and earth and address the idolaters among the people of the Bayan, yet they are in mighty veils […]</p>
<p>O people of the Bayan! This is the Trust of the All-Merciful with which We have given you glad tidings at all times. Yet when He came to you with the truth, you denied Him. Thus did Satan make your deeds seem fair to you, and you became a people, evil and far removed. O people! I have sacrificed myself in His path and called you at every moment to His mighty, exalted, inaccessible and wondrous Self, until I was suspended in the air and martyred in His path, and my spirit ascended to the Sadratu’l-Muntaha and the Supreme Companion. From that most distant station, We observed you and saw your evil deeds, and We wept for you and for myself and for this lonely Wronged One.</p>
<p>O people! Reflect on those who came before with God’s signs and evidences, that you may be among those who know. O people! Be ashamed before God Who created you, and before my Beauty and what has befallen me in His path, and be not among the heedless. O people! When I heard the call of this Revelation, I witnessed how all things trembled within themselves, and Ridvan and all created therein, and Paradise and all ordained therein, sighed in their longing to meet Him. Then did I descend with the hosts of revelation and inspiration, and the denizens of the highest paradise, until I arrived in the presence of my Beloved and the Beloved of the worlds.</p>
<p>When mine eyes fell upon His face, I witnessed how it was changed from the buffetings of the idolaters, and I found the countenance of God turned pale through what your hands have wrought, O heedless ones! Alas, alas, that I should see the Beloved in manifest grief and tribulation! Would that I had never been created in existence, nor drunk the pure milk from my mother’s breast, nor manifested myself among the worlds! Would that the Ridvan had never been created in its essence, nor the gardens in their reality, nor any exalted kingdom of glory, rather than witness my Beloved in the clutches of these transgressors!</p>
<p>O people! Fear God and violate not the sanctity of His Cause. He has come to you with what is greater than what I brought you, and there has appeared from Him what has never appeared in creation. I know not by what proof you have turned away, O people of the Bayan, and by what evidence you have disbelieved in God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>And thou, O Radiyu’r-Ruh, hearken unto My call, that perchance God’s call may influence thee and detach thee from all else but Him. O Rida! We have kindled within thee the fire of God - be thou ignited by it, that its heat may be manifest throughout all regions. This behooveth thee and whoso attributeth himself to the Self of God, the Mighty, the Powerful. By the True One! God’s bounty hath been perfected for all in the horizons, were ye but to know. God’s proof hath been completed for all in the heavens and earth, were ye but to reflect. God’s grace hath encompassed you and all in the lands, and His very Self, the Truth, is witness to what I say.</p>
<p>O Rida! Dost thou rest in thy dwelling while the eye of God weepeth? Dost thou repose upon thy couch while the winds of dissension blow and the leaves of the Tree of Inner Meaning and Utterance fall to the earth? Yet the people are fast asleep. Say: O people! Do ye preserve yourselves while the Self of God is in the hands of the idolaters? And among My greatest afflictions was when someone came to the gate saying that Yahya had written him words and he wished to come before the Throne that verses of mighty glory might be revealed for him. By […]</p>
<p>By God! Through this the hearts of existence were consumed and the Eye of God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Knowing, wept. Say: O people! By God! Were all who are in the heavens and earth to be filled with books, psalms, scrolls and tablets, they would not equal a single letter of that which proceeds from the mouth of God, if ye be of the fair-minded. Is it fitting for dust to confront the Lord of Lords? Nay, by His mighty and bountiful Self! How great the sorrow for these veiled ones! Or is it befitting for utter nothingness to stand before the Ancient Being? Nay, by the Beauty of the All-Merciful! Yet the people are in grievous heedlessness. And on another day he came again to the Gate and said: “I wish to come before His presence. If my soul finds rest and my heart is assured, I will prostrate myself before God and be among those who return.” And for this he was accursed in this world and the next, for he made the Cause of God an object of mockery and derision. Thus did Satan whisper in his breast and he became one of the idolaters. Say: If your souls find no rest, shall the Cause of God be rendered void? Nay, by the Self of God that standeth over all things, if ye be of those who perceive. Say: He hath appeared with such sovereignty that none on earth can prevent Him. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. His Cause dependeth not on any thing in the heavens or on earth; rather, all things depend upon His firm, mighty and powerful Command. He intended naught but deceit through what Satan taught him, and thought that God was unaware of what was in his breast. Say: With Him is the knowledge of all things and whatsoever is hidden in the breasts of all beings. Thus have We informed thee of what hath befallen the Youth from those who sold the Beauty of the Ancient Being for their vain desires, who denied God throughout all ages and waxed proud before the Manifestations of the Cause at all times. Convey Our greetings to thy brethren that they may rejoice in the remembrance of God, follow thee in the Cause of thy Lord, and be among those who tread the paths of the Cause. Blessed are they in that God hath related them unto thee, and this suffices them if they be of those who know. Arise to serve the Cause, then gather together those who have believed, and leave them not to themselves. Thus did We command thee before and now from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Wise. Grieve not over anything, for We are with thee at all times. We beseech God not to separate thee from the Manifestation of His Essence, neither in this world nor in the next. Verily, He hath power over all things. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who have heard My call and who circle round thee out of love for My beauty and in conformity with My luminous and wondrous Command.</p>

<p>He is the Mighty, the Wondrous!</p>
<p>This hath been sent down in truth from the heaven of ancient glory unto him who hath been named Ashraf, that it may be an honor unto him and a remembrance unto others.</p>
<p>O Ashraf! Hearken unto that which the Tongue of Eternity imparteth unto thee, and be not of the heedless. Verily, the hearing of but a single melody from among the melodies of thy Lord would attract the worlds, were they to turn thereunto with pure and wondrous ears. And verily, were the names to free themselves from the limitations of creation, they would all become the Most Great Name, if thou be of them that know. For the Ancient Beauty hath, in these hallowed, mighty and inaccessible days, shone forth upon all things with all names.</p>
<p>Strive thou within thyself to be beneficent in thy Lord’s Cause and sincere in thy love for Him, that He may make thee one of His most excellent names in the kingdom of creation. And this, verily, is a great bounty. By My life! Were all created things to raise their hands today in pure supplication toward the court of hope of the King of Names, and were they to beseech Him for the treasures of the heavens and earth, He would bestow upon them through His all-encompassing grace ere their hands returned unto them. Thus hath His mercy ever encompassed all the worlds.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Deprive not yourselves of God’s grace and mercy. Whoso depriveth himself is in manifest loss. Say: O people! Do ye worship dust and forsake your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower? Fear ye God and be not of the losers. Say: The Book of God hath appeared in the temple of the Youth. Blessed be God, the most excellent of creators! O concourse of earth! Flee not from Him, but hasten unto Him and be of them that return. Repent, O people, for your negligence toward God and your excesses in His Cause, and be not of the ignorant. He it is Who created you and provided for you by His command, and made known unto you His Self, the Mighty, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, and revealed unto you the treasures of knowledge, and caused you to ascend unto the heaven of certitude in His firm, mighty and sublime Cause.</p>
<p>Beware lest ye deny God’s favor unto yourselves, or render your deeds vain, or reject Him in this Most Manifest, Most Impregnable, Radiant and Luminous Revelation. Be fair in God’s Cause, your Creator, then consider that which hath been sent down from the direction of the Throne, and ponder it with pure and sound hearts. Then will the matter become as manifest to you as the sun at high noon, and ye shall be of them that are assured. Say: His proof is His Self and His Manifestation, and for them that are powerless to recognize these two, He hath ordained His verses as proof. This is of His favor unto all worlds. He hath deposited within every soul that whereby it may recognize the signs of God, for otherwise His proof unto His servants would not be complete, if ye be of them that ponder His Cause. He wrongeth no one, nor doth He burden His servants beyond their capacity, for He is the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.</p>
<p>Say: God’s Cause hath appeared in such wise that even the blind of the earth can recognize it, how much more those possessed of pure and luminous sight. The blind cannot perceive the sun through sight, yet can perceive its heat throughout the months and years. But the blind of the Bayan, by God, can recognize neither the sun nor its heat and light, even were it to appear before their very eyes at every moment.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! We have singled you out for the recognition of Our Self amidst all the worlds, and have drawn you nigh unto the right shore beside the Spot of Paradise – the station whereat the Fire proclaimeth in all melodies that there is none other God but Me, the Most High, the Most Great. Beware lest ye veil yourselves from this Sun which hath shone forth from the horizon of your Lord, the All-Merciful’s will, with a radiance that hath encompassed both small and great. Open your eyes that ye may behold it with your own vision, and depend not upon the sight of any other, for God doth not burden any soul beyond its capacity – thus hath it been sent down in all the Tablets to the Prophets and Messengers. Enter, O people, into this expanse that hath neither beginning nor end, wherein God’s call hath been raised and the breezes of His sanctity waft. Let not your bodies be bereft of the robe of glory, nor your hearts of the remembrance of your Lord, nor your ears of hearkening unto His most wondrous, most mighty, most eloquent and perspicuous melodies.</p>
<p>O Ashraf! Give thanks unto God for having honored thee with His presence and admitted thee before the Throne, a seat of magnificent glory. Blessed be thine eye for having beheld the beauty of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all creation. Blessed be thine ear for having heard the melody of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Know thou that the time of thy presence before the Throne hath now ended. Arise and take God’s Tablet to His yearning servants who have burned away the veils with the fire of attraction and have ascended unto God, the King, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Then remind them of what hath befallen Us from those who were created by Our command, and give them the glad tidings of God’s good pleasure, that they may be of those who rejoice. Recount unto them the stories of the Youth that they may be informed thereof and be among those who remember. Say: O loved ones of God! Arise to render victory and follow not those who have disputed with the Self of God and denied the proof which God hath made the evidence of His Cause between the heavens and earth, and who have rebelled against God to such extent that they arose in opposition to His Face and showed no shame before God Who created them by His command. Thus did these oppressors deal with the Ancient Beauty, and their opposition reached such a point that they arose to slay Me through what Satan had cast into their breasts – and God is verily aware of this and witnesseth it. When they found themselves powerless before God’s sovereignty and might, they arose with a new scheme. Thus did We receive treatment from those who were created by Our command, and verily We are powerful. O loved ones of God! Be as clouds of grace to them who have believed in God and His signs, and as the decreed punishment for those who have disbelieved in God and His Cause and were among the idolaters. Say: O people! Listen not to the words of those who ascribe partners to God and to the Manifestation of His Self. Fear ye the Day when all shall be questioned concerning their deeds in the presence of their Lord, the Most High, the Most Great, and shall be recompensed for what they have earned in their vain life – this hath been decreed in preserved tablets of glory. Be not of those who at every moment adopt for themselves a cause and then deny it at another time. Fear God, O concourse of believers! Take what hath been sent down to you from the direction of the Throne and abandon all else, and be of those who are firmly established in the Cause.</p>
<p>And should you meet him who was named Muhammad-before-’Ali, remind him from Us and convey unto him that which We have commanded, that he may arise to serve the Cause and remain steadfast in such wise that his feet shall not slip from the path of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say: O servant! By God, whatsoever thou hast heard and known hath appeared from Us, and all else was created by My command, if thou be of them that understand. And whatsoever We have indicated to others was due to a wisdom from Us, and none hath comprehended this save those whom We have acquainted with the strongholds of the Cause and whom We have strengthened with the Spirit of Certitude. Rend thou asunder the veils of idle fancies, that the Sun of Certitude may shine upon thee from the dawning-place of My Name, the All-Merciful, and make thee one of the sincere. Arise to serve thy Lord and turn not unto them who have denied God and are numbered among the deniers. Remember thou the people with wisdom and counsel, and dispute not with anyone concerning thy Lord’s Cause, that thy Lord’s testimony may be perfected unto all the worlds. Be thou united with the loved ones of God, then gather them together in the sanctuary of security beneath the shade of the Name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Protect the servants lest the promptings of Satan cause them to slip when he cometh unto your land with a mighty deception, bearing that which would turn you away from the love of the Youth. Thus have We informed thee of the tidings of the unseen that thou mayest be apprised thereof and be among the steadfast. Detach thyself from all regions, then turn thy face toward the Sacred Precinct, the seat of thy Lord’s throne, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Know thou that We have mentioned thee in the Tablets aforetime and thereafter, yet We found not from thee that which beseemeth thee. Beware lest thou deprive thyself of that which We have ordained for thee in the preserved Tablets of holiness. Free thyself from all that keepeth thee back from God, then remember Him with a humble and radiant heart. It behooveth thee to be steadfast in the Cause to such degree that even should all who are in the heavens and on earth dispute with thee, they would be powerless to make thee slip from the Cause, and would find themselves impotent. Thus must it be with him who in these days attributeth himself to God, days wherein most of the servants are drowned in the depths of superstition and fancy, and are numbered among the perishing ones.</p>
<p>And when thou meetest Abu-Basir, present this Tablet before him that he may read it and be of them who know. Convey Our greetings unto him that he may rejoice in the glad-tidings of the Spirit from the presence of One mighty and wise. Say: O servant! We have sent down verses unto thee and dispatched them to thee as a mercy from Our presence, that thou mayest remind those who dwell in thy land, that they may arise from their slumber and turn with their hearts toward the Qiblih at whose appearance the faces of the concourse of the worlds have been laid low. Then remind from Us the loved ones of God who were not hindered by veils from entering the depths of the sea of thy Lord’s mercy, the Bestower, the Gracious. Thus have We commanded thee, inspired thee, and taught thee that thou mayest thank God, thy Lord, at all times and be of the thankful. And the Spirit and glory and splendor be upon you, O people of Baha, and upon those who have sought the Face of God and were of them that turned unto Him.</p>

<p>He is the Manifest, the Hidden, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing, the Ever-Forbearing. O Lord my God! Whensoever I attempt to unloose my tongue to extol the wondrous expressions of Thy transcendent oneness, or to open my lips to disclose the mystic gems of Thine incomparable handiwork wherewith Thou hast inspired me, I am compelled to recognize that all things sing Thy praise and glorify Thy remembrance–a remembrance which hath so pervaded the heavens and the earth that all things proclaim, in their very being, the wondrous testimonies of Thine exalted praise and bear witness to the marvellous tokens of Thy transcendent unity. Wherefore am I ashamed, as are all who mention Thee, to approach the exalted heights of Thy remembrance, and am powerless, as are all who extol Thee, to ascend unto the lofty summits of Thy praise.</p>
<p>Glorified, immeasurably glorified, art Thou! So exalted are the wonders of Thy bounty unto Thy creatures that Thou hast made all things to serve as a sign unto the mindful amongst Thy servants and as an admonishment unto the heedless amidst Thy people. Thy glory beareth me witness! They that are endued with true understanding can discern naught in all creation save the wondrous tokens of Thy matchless handiwork, nor behold aught else in the world of being but the hidden gems of Thine all-glorious sovereignty.</p>
<p>I swear by Thy glory, O my Best-Beloved! Whensoever I raise mine eyes to the heavens and witness their loftiness, I recognize naught therein but the wondrous heights of Thy supreme power and sovereign authority. And whensoever I turn my gaze towards Thine earth and observe the potentialities wherewith it hath been endowed, I perceive naught but the peerless signs of Thine immutable nature and abiding constancy. And whensoever, O my God, I behold the sea and its waves, methinks I hear the billowing ocean of Thy wealth and power. In the sun I discern naught but the marvellous splendour of the light of Thy hallowed countenance and presence, and in the wind I sense naught save the stirring breezes of Thy nearness and reunion. In the trees I behold only the revelation of the fruits of Thy wisdom and knowledge, and in their leaves I read but the pages of the books enshrining the mysteries of all that hath been through Thy command or will be through Thy power.</p>
<p>Glorified, then, be Thou, O my God! I am powerless, as are all those who enjoy near access unto Thee, to reckon the least sign of Thy creation, inasmuch as Thou hast made all things to mirror forth the manifestations of Thy handiwork and the revelations of Thy sovereign rule. Such being the bounds of powerlessness and poverty that confine me and all created things, how then can any soul ever hope to approach the portals of the sanctuary of Thy knowledge or conceive the least expectation of attaining the city of Thy transcendent glory? Glorified, immeasurably glorified, art Thou! From everlasting Thou hast been sanctified above the comprehension of Thy creatures, for this comprehension is naught but the product of such idle fancies as pertain to their own selves, while Thou hast remained, in the reality of Thine own Self, exalted above them and all that they possess, and beyond the grasp of all that are in heaven and on earth. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Incomparable.</p>
<p>Having acknowledged, O my God, with my soul, my tongue, mine essence, and with mine inner and outer being, all my trespasses, whose like mortal eyes have never beheld nor human minds conceived, I implore Thee to pardon me and Thy loved ones for whatsoever we have failed to observe of Thy laws and ordinances. Attire us then with the robe of forgiveness, O my God, in this Day whereon Thou hast assumed the throne of Thy grace and bounty invested with the full glory of Thy names and attributes; the Day whereon the sun of Thy beauty hath dawned above the horizon of Thy grandeur, and the signs of Thy glorious sovereignty have been vouchsafed from the treasury of Thy grace; the Day whereon the sweet savours of reunion have wafted over all who are in Thy heaven and on Thine earth, and the hidden Word hath shone forth from the repository of Thy protection and power.</p>
<p>I bear witness, O my God, that Thou hast ordained this Day to stand unequalled amongst all the days of Thy world and unrivalled amidst all that Thou hast fashioned through Thy creative power. This is that primal Day which Thou hast singled out from among all other days, and exalted over all other times, and appointed as the King of Days unto all peoples, inasmuch as Thou didst manifest on this Day the tokens of Thy transcendent power and the evidences of Thy holy unity. Thou hast caused its radiance to surpass the splendour of the sun, the moon, and the stars, and to transcend the brightness of every lofty and glorious, every shining and brilliant light. Nay, Thou hast illumined this Day, O my Best-Beloved, with the very lights of Thine own inaccessible Being and with the full glory of Thine own exalted Essence.</p>
<p>Since this text is already in English and appears to be a complete prayer or meditation, no translation is needed. The text is presented in its original form.</p>
<p>Since Thy bounty hath suffused the whole universe and the lights of Thy countenance have illumined all created things, I beseech Thee by this Day, and by the hearts which Thou hast made to be the repositories of Thy knowledge and inspiration and the treasuries of Thy revelation and recognition, to grant that the signs of Thine undisputed ascendancy may shine above the horizon of Thy command, that the showers of Thy surpassing mercy may rain from the heaven of Thy grace, and that the tokens of Thy deliverance may appear through the operation of Thy sovereign Will.</p>
<p>Thus may Thy friends be released from the clutches of Thy foes, and Thy loved ones delivered from the hands of the wayward among Thy servants, that they may extol Thee, O Lord, with ringing voices in the supernal realms of Thy names and worship Thee with their entire beings in the kingdom of Thine attributes. And thus may Thy Name be exalted, Thy testimony established, Thy proof vindicated, Thy favour completed, Thy bounty fulfilled, Thy verses promulgated, and Thy signs expounded, in such wise that the entire world may be filled with the light of Thy countenance and all dominion may be Thine alone. No God is there but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>I entreat Thee, moreover, O my God, by Thy Name through which the Bird of the celestial Throne hath warbled in the Realm of the unseen the melodies of Thy transcendent unity, and the Dove of Thy Revelation hath sung forth in the Kingdom of eternity the paeans of Thy sovereign oneness, and the Holy Spirit hath magnified in wondrous tones Thine everlasting glory–I entreat Thee not to withhold from these servants the gentle breezes of the morn of Thy nearness and presence, nor to suffer them to be far removed from the sweet savours of the dawn of Thy reunion and recognition.</p>
<p>Grant, O my God, that this Festival may be a source of blessings for them and for all Thy loved ones. Supply them, then, with all the good Thou didst ordain in the heaven of Thy decree and purpose and in the Tablets of Thy protection and behest. Vanquish, then, O my God, in the course of this year, their enemies through the power of Thy wrath and of Thy resistless might, and ordain for them, O my God, all that I have asked of Thee and all that I have left unasked. Endue them, then, with such constancy in Thy love and in Thy Cause, that they may never break Thy Covenant nor violate Thy Testament to which they pledged themselves ere the creation of the heavens and the earth. Render them victorious through the most wondrous means that lie hid in the treasuries of Thy power and the repositories of Thy might, and grant them, O my God, to attain the Hour Thou didst promise them in Thy latter Resurrection through the appearance of the Manifestation of Thine all-glorious Self–for this in truth is the very object of their existence and the existence of all things, the cause of their creation and the creation of all things. Suffer them then, O my God, to submit to Thy will under all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Lord of grace and bounty, of endless bestowal and unfettered sovereignty. And Thou art verily the Most Exalted, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>I beg Thee moreover, O my God, by all the Exponents of Thy names and all the Revealers of Thine attributes, not to number these Thy servants with those who outwardly observe the Festivals associated with the advent of Thy Manifestation, who honour and glorify these days as beseemeth their means and abilities, and yet who remain shut out as by a veil from the One Who is, through His command and decree, the Author of these observances and of all else, for thus will all their works be rendered vain, even though they perceive it not.</p>
<p>I implore Thee, O my God, by the appearance of Him Whom Thou hast manifested in these days through Thy Name “He Who is Invoked”, and by His beauty, and His majesty, and the afflictions He hath been made to suffer, and His divine fragrances, and His sweet accents, and His grandeur, and His might, to grant that the eyes of Thy loved ones may be freed from the veils of ignorance and blindness and from the obscuring mists of doubt and wretchedness. Perchance they may fix their gaze upon the Tree of Thy Revelation and upon that which appeareth thereon of the wondrous leaves of Thine ancient eternity and the precious fruits of Thy holy unity, may take delight in them and in that which they contain of Thy hidden gifts and concealed knowledge, and may rid themselves thereby of attachment to aught else. This, verily, is but perfect grace and unalloyed blessing, and the very essence, origin, and ultimate abode thereof, for within the compass of Thy knowledge there is naught higher than this grace nor sweeter than this blessing. Thou, verily, art the King, the Omniscient, the Omnipotent, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified above the comprehension of all created things, befitteth the court of the glory of that Desired One Who brought forth all the infinite worlds into the realm of existence through two words from the unseen. He is the Omnipotent One before Whose power the might of the world is weak, nay, non-existent, and ever shall be. And He is the Sovereign before the manifestation of Whose most insignificant sign the kingdoms of the earth are subdued and vanquished. All things have testified to His grandeur, His power and His sovereignty, and every possessor of might hath bowed before His glory, His manifestation and His authority.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose Name the ocean of life surged and the fragrance of Thy Name, the Most Merciful, was diffused! I beseech Thee by Thy Great Throne and Thy Exalted Seat to assist Thy servants and Thy creation to turn towards the river of Thy mercy and to cling to the hem of Thy bounty. O Lord! Illumine the faces with the lights of Thy countenance and the hearts with the effulgences of the suns of Thy knowledge. Thou art He before Whose generosity and favors every possessor of knowledge hath confessed, and before Whose greatness and gifts every possessor of grace hath acknowledged. O Lord! Take the hands of Thy loved ones through Thy munificence and bounty, then deliver them from all that is unworthy of Thee and Thy days. There is no God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter dated the 17th of Ramadan, along with two other pages, was a source of joy and delight. Praise be to God that thou art adorned with the ornament of health and engaged in serving the Cause. By the permanence of the earthly and heavenly kingdoms, if thou were to offer thanks for this bounty bestowed upon thee, it would assuredly be insufficient and ever shall be. Praise be to God, the drops of the seas of bounty have embraced thee; throughout all days thou hast been known by His Name and hast arisen to serve Him. No possessor of insight hath denied or will deny this station. Were this lofty station to be unveiled, most of the servants would be found thunderstruck. God willing, through the Name of the Peerless Friend and the favor of the Incomparable Beloved, this most exalted and supreme station shall remain preserved. Blessed art thou, O my beloved, then joy be unto thee, by the everlasting Names and Attributes of God.</p>
<p>This servant sent two detailed letters to thee. Regarding one of the two, dated the 2nd of Rajab, thou hast written that it was received, but concerning the other letter, dated the 14th of Sha’ban, which was more detailed than the previous one, no news of its receipt hath come. This evanescent servant beseecheth the Exalted Truth to deliver that letter to thee as well. Verily, He hath power over all things. And regarding thy request that this ephemeral one should perform the pilgrimage on thy behalf, this was carried out according to thy wish. The servant beseecheth his Lord to make it a treasure for thee with Him. Verily, He is the Omnipotent, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about the transactions of Miyanduab and others, it was submitted. This decree hath issued from the Source of the Cause - exalted be His glory: “Whatever hath been commanded in the presence of the Cause must be carried out. It is not permissible to demand anything from anyone. If anyone of his own accord giveth something, accept it; otherwise, thou hast no right to demand anything from anyone. Verily, thy Lord is the Bestower, the Bountiful.” End quote.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst write concerning various matters, God willing, thou art assisted in performing good deeds and art confirmed in serving the Cause.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about the Sacred Place, yes, some time ago the honored Afnan, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, and also the esteemed Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah presented their petitions to the Most Holy Court, and these were graced with acceptance. In truth, whatever charitable deeds and good works appear in these days, their fragrance shall never cease. Blessed is he who holdeth fast to that which is good and forbiddeth others from evil. The servant beseecheth his Lord that He may aid all to accomplish that which will exalt the Word of God and perpetuate their remembrance and their names. Verily, He is the Helper of those who turn unto Him and the Answerer of those who call upon Him.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about Mulla Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, his petition was presented to the Most Holy Court, and an answer descended from the heaven of God’s Will, and specially revealed verses were graciously bestowed upon the souls mentioned. God willing, may they be enkindled at all times and under all conditions with the fire of divine love and be occupied with service to the Cause. Since mention was also made in your letter of Mulla Husayn and his brothers and Haji Aqa Baba, upon them be the Glory of God, it was again presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and these sublime, impregnable and holy verses were revealed from the heaven of divine Will, that they may be a treasure and honor unto them and their families and their descendants. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Forgiving, the Generous. This is what was revealed from the heaven of grace. His word, exalted and mighty is He:</p>
<p>He is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>The Wronged One maketh mention of His loved ones who hastened to the Water of Life when it surged forth through the Word of God, the Lord of all worlds. These are servants who have attained unto the wine of revelation and the Kawthar of utterance when the All-Merciful came with the kingdom of proof. Blessed are they that have attained. O My loved ones! Hearken unto My call from the precincts of My prison. Verily, He mentioneth you with most excellent mention and commandeth you to that which will exalt the Cause of God, the Lord of the mighty throne. Ye have attained unto the movement of the Most Exalted Pen as it courseth in the arena of wisdom and utterance from the presence of the Mighty, the Ancient. Hold ye fast unto the cord of the Cause, detached from all who are on earth. Thus doth He command you from Whose presence is a preserved tablet. Soon will there appear among you one who will prevent you from the Euphrates of the mercy of your Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. This is the Day of steadfastness and utterance, were ye of them that know, and this is the Day of wisdom and knowledge, were ye of them that hear.</p>
<p>O loved ones of the All-Merciful! I speak in Persian that all may understand. Today the Truth is afflicted and captive among the most wretched of creation, yet He makes mention of you at a time when sorrows have encompassed Him from every direction. Hearken unto the call of the Peerless Friend and act according to His bidding. Today is the day of steadfastness. God willing, may all be illumined by the effulgent lights of the Sun of certitude and remain firm in His Cause through divine power and strength, for the evil ones have been and are lying in wait, misleading people in the name of truth. Blessed is the soul that arises to serve the Cause in such wise that all else besides God shall be powerless to prevent it.</p>
<p>O My loved ones! Rejoice in My remembrance and utterance, in the rain-showers of the clouds of My wisdom, the outpourings from the heaven of My mercy, and the sweet waters of My bounty which flow from the right hand of My mighty Throne. God willing, may all be set ablaze by the warmth of the utterance of the All-Merciful and derive pleasure from the sweetness of His mention, and may they manifest such love of God as to become the cause of attracting the hearts of His servants. Thus doth He Who possesseth the knowledge of all things teach you from His presence in a clear Book.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that all have once again attained to the mention of the Lord of creation. Happy indeed are they! On behalf of this evanescent servant, convey greetings to all and say in his tongue: O friends! Strive to free yourselves entirely from the idle fancies and vain imaginings of the past. This is the Day wherein man can acquire lofty stations and enduring mention for himself and his kindred. I swear by the light of the countenance of your Beloved and mine that the mention of this most great and most holy Day hath been recorded in all the divine Books. Know ye its value and arise as behooveth it.</p>
<p>Many are the barking dogs that have appeared and will appear, even as aforetime when the Sun of the Cause was rising from the horizon of Iraq - all were warned of the barking of dogs and the birds of night. Assuredly whatsoever hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen shall come to pass. Beseech ye God to protect all through His grace. Whosoever hath truly attained in this most glorious and most holy Day to the knowledge of God and hath quaffed from the choice wine of His utterance is and shall remain protected. Were all the hosts and legions of the world to arise to prevent such a one, they would find themselves utterly powerless. God willing, may all the people of Baha be adorned with these holy and luminous robes.</p>
<p>O My loved one! When this lowly one reached this point, he attained the Most Holy Court where it was said: “O servant in attendance! We wish to make mention once again of Abu’l-Hasan who hath turned, hearkened, attained and arisen to serve the Cause of his Lord, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. We also remember My handmaidens who have believed in God, the Mighty, the All-Loving. O Abu’l-Hasan! We send Our greetings upon thee and bid thee convey Our greetings to the faces of My loved ones and to thy daughters who have turned and attained to the mention of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. We make mention of My handmaidens in that place and give them the glad-tidings of My grace and bounty which have preceded all who exist. Rejoice thou in thy Lord’s bounty and say: Praise be to Thee for having mentioned me and made known to me Thy straight path. Praise be to God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen.”</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be the glory and bounty of God, concerning the Huququ’llah of that land - let them consult on all matters and act according to what becomes apparent. The glory be upon thee and upon whosoever heareth thy word concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of [the worlds].</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Ancient, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise be hallowed above mention and utterance - praise that befits the most impenetrable, most holy court of the Beloved One, Who adorned the world with the blessed word “Look and thou shalt behold Me,” and honored sanctified, receptive ears with hearing it. He is the Almighty One Whom the weapons of the world prevented not from accomplishing His purpose, nor did human conditions deter Him from revealing the hidden mystery. By the sword of utterance He conquered the illumined cities of receptive hearts. With one cup of the wine of utterance He intoxicated the essences of creation, such that the Abrahams of the age turned toward the fire, and the sacrificial victims of the day hastened with utmost joy and attraction to the place of sacrifice, and unlike before, returned not alive but offered up their lives with complete longing. Exalted be their station, exalted be their rank! These are the souls whose mention all divine books proclaim, and to whose lofty station the company of Prophets and Messengers bear witness.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou in Whose grasp is the rein of all created things and in Whose right hand are the reins of all existence! I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou didst send down the Book and manifest the signs, to ordain for Thy loved ones from the Supreme Pen that which will draw them nigh unto Thee in such wise that the conditions of creation shall not weaken them, nor shall the hints of those servants who have cast Thy commandments behind their backs and followed their own desires render them powerless. O Lord! Thou seest those near to Thee turning toward the horizon of Thy manifestation, and the sincere ones hastening to the shore of the ocean of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by the sun of Thy loving-kindness and the heaven of Thy bounty to ordain for Thy loved ones that which befitteth Thy greatness and power. O Lord! Thou seest them clinging to the ropes of Thy gifts and holding fast to the hem of the robe of Thy generosity. Send down upon them through Thy might that which will preserve them from all else besides Thee and raise them to a station wherein they will arise to commemorate Thee, praise Thee and serve Thy Cause. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the light of Thy countenance and the fire of Thy Sacred Tree to aid all to turn unto Thee and draw nigh unto the court of the gate of Thy mercy. Thou art He Whom the might and power of creation cannot prevent. Thou doest and ordainest as Thou pleasest. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant became acquainted with your mention, your praise, your submissiveness and your humility before God, our Lord and your Lord, our Beloved and your Beloved, and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and the earth. When I gathered the ripe fruits from the fresh trees of your utterances, I turned toward the Most Glorious Horizon and the Supreme Horizon. When I attained the presence, I presented what was born of the maidens of your knowledge and what appeared of the pearls of your utterance. When that which was in your letter was completed, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in reply, saying, glorified and exalted be He:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One, the Stranger […]</p>
<p>Thou art he who was present, heard and witnessed, and wast of them that testify, and didst attain unto that which was inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books of God, the Lord of all men. Verily thy Lord is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed. Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto the Day of God and hath heard that which the Lote-Tree of the Uttermost End hath spoken from its station, and hath taken the choice wine of revelation from the hand of the bounty of his Lord and drunk thereof in His Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Thou hast indeed reached the Most Exalted Goal and the Supreme Summit until thou didst attain unto that which none hath attained save whom God, the Lord of the worlds, hath willed. We counsel thee to preserve this Most Great Station. By the life of God! All that thou beholdest today shall perish, and there shall endure that which hath been ordained for thee by the One Who is the Almighty, the Ancient of Days. Read thou the verses of God with joy and fragrance. Verily they shall draw thee to a station wherein the affairs of earth shall not prevent thee from its luminous horizon.</p>
<p>O Zayn! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. God willing, the sweetness of utterance shall be made manifest with complete effect in thy taste. Thou art and hast been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. In these days if one looks to the veils of the people, the loftiness, sublimity, penetrating influence and all-encompassing nature of God’s Cause remain concealed. Assuredly this concealment shall be followed by revelation, and this contraction shall be transformed into expansion. I swear by the Sun of the heaven of inner meanings that the stations of God’s loved ones shall ere long become manifest as the rays of the sun and encompass the world. Those who in the great nations count themselves among the most learned of men and consider themselves among the civilized ones cling to matters more flimsy than a spider’s web and sacrifice their lives and wealth for their realization and manifestation, while this Cause, which is greater than the heavens and the earth, hath appeared and become evident among the people of Iran; nevertheless souls remain heedless of it and veiled from it. We beseech God to make the people aware and not deprive them of the lights of the Sun of Truth. Verily He is powerful over all things. That which hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen shall assuredly appear in the realm of manifestation, even as most of it hath already appeared and become evident, and all have witnessed it.</p>
<p>O Zayn! Thy reward is preserved with God and shall certainly reach thee. Strive ye that steadfast and firm souls may remind people through healing and sufficient utterances. This is what is incumbent upon all. Verily He speaketh the truth and guideth the Way. Be thou joyous through God’s grace and assured by what He hath mentioned. God willing, mayest thou be adorned with the utmost trustworthiness, religiosity, truthfulness and sincerity, and mayest thou embellish the world with these sacred garments. Should the entire world arise with sharpened swords and attempt to prevent a single letter of God’s words that have flowed from the Most Exalted Pen from taking effect, they would surely find themselves powerless and in loss.</p>
<p>You had sought permission to turn towards the Prison. Praise be to God that you attained His presence and received an ample portion from the Kawthar of reunion. Now you must devote your energies to teaching God’s Cause. This has been and will continue to be the cause and means for the elevation of receptive souls. Strive and hold fast to this in the days and nights, that perchance people who have grown cold may be refreshed and enkindled by the Kawthar of utterance and the fire of the love of the All-Merciful, so that from the verdant and flourishing trees the fire of God’s Word might become manifest and evident. Ere long, the rewards of deeds performed for God and in His path will be revealed in the realm of vision and witness. Be not grieved. God willing, you shall attain to the ocean of joy. Verily your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Ere long, infinite doors shall be opened before the faces of God’s loved ones. Verily He speaks the truth, and He is the True, the Trustworthy Informer.</p>
<p>Illumine the friends in that land with the lights of God’s Supreme Remembrance. We counsel them as We counseled them before, to show forth the Greater Steadfastness, and to be characterized by trustworthiness, religiosity, truthfulness and fidelity. By the life of God! Goodly deeds and praiseworthy attributes have been and are the hosts of God, and the conquest of the citadels of hearts depends upon these hosts. Verily He reminds them and teaches them that which profits them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant at all times beseeches the True One, exalted be His glory, to assist that honored master to render such service in the path of the Cause that countless centuries and endless ages and epochs will not erase it. Great is this day, and whatever matter appears in it for the sake of God is greatest and most glorious. God is witness and testifier that your mention has been upon the tongue and your love in the heart, and God willing, through His grace it shall continue to be so. And I hope that you may attain to that which is the cause of good in this world and the next. And as for what you had besought from God, exalted be His glory, that He might adorn that land with the shining lights in the presence of His countenance, it was submitted. His word, exalted and mighty be He: God willing, they shall attain to that which they have desired. Verily He is the Observer, the All-Seeing, the Near, the Answerer.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseecheth that if it be deemed advisable and wisdom requireth it, greetings be conveyed on my behalf to the friends in that land. It is hoped that at all times they may partake of the fruits of the immortal Tree and drink from the ocean of divine love in such wise that neither the cares and sorrows nor the conditions and vicissitudes of the world may stay their progress or debar them from that which is beloved. Though to some the world may appear slow in its movements and progress, yet in truth, in the eyes of the people of Baha, it is seen to be swifter than lightning and closer to extinction than the twinkling of an eye. In such circumstances, the friends of God must hold fast to that which is enduring and everlasting. By the ocean of truth! Today in the Most Great Prison, before the face of the Ancient King, the ocean of reality appeareth manifest and billowing. Were all the peoples of the world to inhale but a trace of the fragrance of His robe, were they to hearken unto but one of the revealed utterances, they would all forsake that which they possess and turn unto that which is with God. It is hoped that all the friends will concentrate their efforts on serving the Cause and cling to whatsoever will attract the hearts of men. May the glory shining from the horizon of the loving-kindness of our Lord, the All-Merciful, rest upon you and upon those who have hearkened and responded and have testified to that whereunto God hath testified: verily there is no God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. And praise be to God, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Best-Beloved.</p>

<p>The Tablet of God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting</p>
<p>He is the Witness from His Most Exalted Horizon</p>
<p>This is a Book which the Wronged One hath sent down, desiring naught except to attract thereby the hearts of the servants unto God in their return, to guide them to the Most Exalted Horizon, and to teach them the path of righteousness. Blessed is he who hasteneth unto the good-pleasure of God and uttereth that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered when He was established upon the Throne with power and sovereignty. The necks have bowed down before the Lord of Lords, yet the people are in a strange sleep. We have manifested that which was hidden in knowledge. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen. Woe unto every heedless denier.</p>
<p>We have remembered thee and revealed unto thee a Tablet which testifieth before the faces of the world that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Chosen. Give thanks unto God for this most great favor. He hath remembered thee in such wise that its fragrance shall endure throughout centuries and ages. The Glory from before the Lord of Names be upon those who have attained unto the Most Great Steadfastness in this Cause whereby feet have slipped.</p>
<p>We have turned from the Arabic tongue to the Persian. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. It bestoweth new vision upon the sight and eternal life and awareness upon the soul. Thy letter arrived and was presented at the Most Holy Court. We heard thy call and saw thy letter. Praise be to God, it was observed to be illumined and adorned with the lights of the Luminary of Divine love. We beseech God to cause the Salsabil of utterance to flow from the tongues of the loved ones, that all may attain unto eternal life through that spiritual and delicate water. The water of utterance hath a penetrating power and influence which most of the people of the world are powerless to comprehend. This is that water concerning which He saith: “And from water We made every living thing.” We beseech God to illumine the hearts of His servants with the light of knowledge and to strengthen their limbs in such wise that neither the might of the aggressive ones nor the ascendancy of the oppressors may enfeeble them. Let them take hold of the Book with divine strength and power and adhere unto it. The letters of the Word and the words of the Book have ever been and shall ever be remembered before the Wronged One. Blessed are ye, O children of the Friend and heirs of Him Who conversed with God! Ye have attained unto that which most of the divines of the age have failed to attain. Well is it with you for having drunk the choice wine of loving-kindness from the hands of the bounty of your Lord, the Bestower, the Generous. Rejoice in that God hath forgiven you at this time and purified you from transgression. Henceforth We counsel you to fear God and preserve what ye have been given by Him. He is verily the Ever-Forgiving, the Pardoner, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O son of Na?ir! The honored ’Aziz’u’llah, upon him be My glory, hath repeatedly mentioned the friends of Marv. We have remembered those who have attained unto the lights of knowledge with a remembrance whereby spirits have taken flight. He in Whose possession is the Mother Book beareth witness unto this. The prison-land appeareth each day in a different state. If there be delay in the sending of Tablets, it hath been and is due to the tyranny of the oppressors and the upheavals in this land, as well as the multitude of petitions that arrive from all directions. We desire to make mention of Our loved ones there, that they may rejoice in God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O Isma’il! Thy name was present before the Wronged One, and We have revealed for thee from the treasuries of the Pen of the Most Merciful the pearls of wisdom and utterance, that thou mayest behold and be of the thankful. This is a Day wherein the banner of proof hath been raised to the highest station and the standard of knowledge hath been uplifted upon the luminous spot on the shore of ’Amman. God knoweth the purpose of the mystics.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who hath been named Moses that he may testify to that whereunto God hath testified: that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the All-Informed. Beware lest the happenings of the world hold thee back from the Most Great Name, or the doubts of the heedless debar thee from My straight path. Blessed art thou for having turned unto Him Who hath been wronged, when every remote oppressor and every doubtful scholar turned away from Him.</p>
<p>O thou who art dear to God! When thou hast quaffed the choice wine of revelation from the chalice of My bounty, and My most sweet call hath drawn thee to the kingdom of Mine utterance, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! How can the weak make mention of the manifestations of Thy power, and how can the feeble describe the dawning-places of Thine utterance? I beseech Thee by the power before whose revelation all things have bowed down, and by Thy knowledge which hath encompassed all created things, and by the sweetness of Thine utterance and the might of Thy will, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and upright in Thy judgment. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Mercy of God! The mercy of thy Lord hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth, and His favor hath encompassed all who are in the kingdom of His command and creation. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say:</p>
<p>Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having guided me unto Thy path and for having sent down unto me in Thy Most Great Prison that which hath gladdened all eyes. I beseech Thee, O Bestower of bounties and Educator of the peoples, by Thy Most Great Name, to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and profit me in Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>O Elias! Behold and remember when We sent forth Him Who conversed with God with clear signs; the people turned away from Him until We helped Him through a command from Us. Verily thy Lord is the Helper of the Messengers. His rod prevailed over the swords of Pharaoh and his chiefs. Verily thy Lord is the Strong, the Triumphant, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Rahim! Say: O concourse of the earth! The promise hath come, and that which was hidden hath appeared with manifest sovereignty. Cast away what ye possess and take hold of that which God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, hath given you. The appointed time hath come, and the Sovereign of signs hath been established upon the throne and hath called all unto the Mighty, the All-Praised. Thou hast attained unto the traces of My Most Exalted Pen. This is through the grace of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. O Rahim! Behold and then remember when He Who conversed with God sought the ultimate goal and the supreme summit until He reached the right Valley and heard the call from the Most Glorious Tree that “Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Ancient Revealer.” We sent Him unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, and there befell Him in My path that which caused the denizens of My kingdom to lament, yet most of the people were heedless. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the lights of this Day and for having turned unto God, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>O Son of Jacob! The Light hath shone forth and the darkness hath been illumined, the Cry hath been raised and the Table hath been sent down, yet the people are in manifest loss. They have cast the rights of God behind their backs, having followed every accursed satan. Beware lest the doubts of the peoples withhold thee from the Dawning-Place of the signs of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Bountiful. Soon will there come unto you one who will croak; leave him to himself, placing your trust in God, the Lord of the Sublime Throne. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O son of Mahdi! Praise be to God that the friends of God have attained unto that which hath no like nor equal. Today the understanding of every soul must needs attain maturity and behold itself independent and self-subsisting from all who dwell on earth. All must today fix their gaze upon the horizon of oneness. Some among the people of the Bayan have loved and continue to love discord, awaiting the appearance of some calf that they might thereby summon the helpless servants unto it. Say: The Revelations have reached their end. Whosoever before the completion of a thousand years maketh any claim, whosoever he may be and whatsoever he may bring forth, is false and untrue. Give thanks unto the Object of all creation Who hath aided thee and guided thee. He is the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O son of Dost Muhammad! The meaning of steadfastness is that the people should become aware and know with absolute certitude that after the Most Great Manifestation they neither were nor are in need of another Manifestation. The Primal Point, namely the Herald of the Most Great Beauty, gave the people glad tidings that they might purify and prepare their hearts. Before His mission was complete, the divines of Persia pronounced the sentence of His death and martyred Him. Thereafter the Most Great Luminary rent asunder the veil, and through His Revelation the worlds of Command and Creation were perfected and established. That which was intended was made manifest. Should some deluded soul appear and make a claim, verily he is a lying impostor. Whosoever attaineth unto this station is reckoned among those endowed with supreme steadfastness by the Pen of God and is so recorded. Say: O loved ones of God! Some weak souls are observed who, upon hearing a word from some deluded one, slip from the Straight Path. The cawers from one direction and false claimants from another have appeared and will continue to appear. Blessed is he who strengtheneth their weak ones, and steadfast is he who repelleth them, and wise is he who counseleth them, for they are the cause of corruption in the world and loss among the peoples. We beseech God to preserve you and His loved ones from their evil and their scheming. Verily He is the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful. We ask of God that He aid thee to make mention of Him, to praise Him and to serve His Cause. He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>O Khudadad, O son of Nasir! Each of the souls mentioned hath attained unto the remembrance of the Wronged One and been adorned and illumined by the lights of the Day-Star of utterance. We beseech God to ordain for each of them a brilliant star in the world of the spirit, and a book in the world of knowledge, and an essence of love in the city of lovers, and a volume of certitude in the realm of understanding. Verily He hath power over all things. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>My God, my God! These are Thy servants and Thy creation, encompassed by Thy Will and Purpose within the grasp of Thy power. Should Thou forgive them, verily Thou art the Master of forgiveness, and should Thou chastise them, verily Thou art the All-Choosing in every condition. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds, by the letter Nun and the Pen, and by the mysteries of Thy Most Great Name, to attract the hearts of Thy servants through the breezes of Thy utterance to the supreme heights and the Dawning-Place of Thy signs, O Lord of all beings and Master of the world to come and the world that was!</p>

<p>He is the Herald from His Most Exalted Horizon!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath through His Most Exalted Word revealed that which lay hidden in the treasuries of His protection and concealed in the repositories of His preservation. He is the Almighty through Whose command the ocean of utterance surged in the world of being and the luminary of grace shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of proof. Through Him was the standard raised before the faces of all people, and through Him was manifested the oneness of God, His sovereignty, His power and His might. Salutations, glorification and splendor be upon the Hands of His Cause who have cut across all paths and ways to exalt His Cause and establish His Most Great Word whereby the realities of all things were attracted and the Sadratu’l-Muntaha proclaimed in the Most Exalted Paradise: “The King hath come with an authority before which the heavens and earth cannot endure, and with a sovereignty that hath subdued all who are in the kingdoms of command and creation.” He is the One through Whose appearance the countenance of the Mother Book smiled in the Ultimate Goal and summoned all unto God, the Lord of all men. And upon those who hearkened to their call, honored their dwelling-place, and acted according to that which they were commanded in the Books of God, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>O friends of God and His party! His honor Baqir, who hath been surnamed Baha’i in My eternal Book, appeared before My face and mentioned you. Therefore have We mentioned you and revealed for you that which hath caused the fragrance of Mine utterance to waft and the ocean of My grace to surge. Verily your Lord is the All-Merciful, the Beneficent. O My Afnan in the lands! Upon you be My glory and My loving-kindness. Hearken unto My call from this Most Exalted Station and Most Sublime Summit. Verily there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. We testify that ye have attained unto the recognition of God, the Possessor of the Kingdom of Names, have believed in Him and turned toward His horizon when the servants who denied His manifestation and His proof turned away and uttered that which none of the ancients had uttered.</p>
<p>O My friends in ?a! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison. Verily when it is raised, the countenance of utterance smileth and the earth and heaven speak: “The Promise hath come and the Promised One hath come with the standards of signs from God, the Possessor of existence.” O Hands of My Cause! Blessed are ye for having turned with radiant faces and attained unto the recognition of your Lord when the limbs of all names trembled. I bear witness that ye have drunk My Sealed Wine from the chalice of the bounty of My Hidden Name, Who speaketh at this moment before the faces of all who are in the heavens and earth, and giveth them glad tidings of that which hath appeared and become manifest from the horizon of the heaven of God’s mercy, the Lord of the Unseen and the Seen. Blessed is he who hath loved you, heard mention of you, and arose to serve you. He is of those who have attained in My Perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>At this moment My Will hath desired to mention My friends in Qaf and Mim with verses whereby the hearts of those who believed when they heard the call of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, are attracted. O My friends there! We counsel you to remain steadfast with the Most Great Steadfastness lest your feet slip through the whisperings of those who denied the proof of God when it was sent down in truth and disbelieved in Him Who speaketh among you with the most exalted call: “Verily there is no God but I, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.”</p>
<p>O Land of Kaf! The breezes of the Manifestation passed over thee at the dawn of His Day. Didst thou perceive them or wert thou of the heedless? O My friends there! We have heard your call and witnessed your turning. Verily your Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Blessed is the ear that hath succeeded in hearing and the eye that hath beheld My Most Great Signs. These two are under the shadow of the loving-kindness of their Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Land of Sad! Where are My loved ones and My friends? I testify that in thee the fire of hatred was kindled, and by it were consumed the hearts of the pure ones through whom the Sun of Certitude shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of divine knowledge, and the Herald proclaimed from every direction: “He Who was hidden hath appeared and He Who was treasured in God’s knowledge, the Lord of this exalted station, hath come!” O My loved ones therein! Blessed are ye, inasmuch as ye have heard My call and turned with your hearts to My horizon and drunk the choice wine of divine knowledge from the hand of My bounty and acknowledged that which hath been sent down in My Great Book. We have, as a token of Our grace and mercy from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed, veiled your names.</p>
<p>O people of Nun and Jim! My “Ha” hath appeared before My face and desired from the ocean of My bounty your mention. We have made mention of you through that by whose light earth and heaven were illumined. He with Whom is the Preserved Tablet beareth witness unto this. O My loved ones therein! The Spring of Divine Utterance hath come, and We have caused to rain from the clouds of Our mercy the showers of Our favors. Blessed is the heart from which have sprung the ears of wisdom which We have enjoined upon all in Our Great Tablet. Well is it with you for having borne tribulations in My path and endured afflictions in your longing for My good-pleasure. We beseech God to confirm you in steadfastness and to ordain for you through His Most Exalted Pen every good thing which He hath revealed in His Book. Verily, He is the Ancient Revealer.</p>
<p>O Pen! Turn thy face toward Alif and Ra and say: Where is your mention and your praise, and where is your turning and your ardor, and where is your attraction and your detachment? Let not the might of the divines frighten you, nor the power of the mighty weaken you. Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, through wisdom and utterance, and be not of the silent ones. You had a station with God - soon shall every steadfast one behold what hath been ordained for him from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Why do I see you silent and mute in the mention and praise of God? Hath heedlessness overtaken you, or are ye among the fearful? Arise in My Name, take the cup of immortality, then drink therefrom in remembrance of Me, the Wondrous. We have created you and manifested you for My service. Let not the clamors of the babblers hinder you. We counsel you as We counseled you before - to be trustworthy and God-fearing, truthful and faithful, and to that whereby the Word of God, the Lord of all worlds, may be exalted. Blessed is he who hath cast away corruption and risen in reform - he is of those brought near in the Book of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>O My loved ones! We have commanded you to righteousness and piety, and forbidden you oppression and wickedness and whatsoever causeth the servants to grieve in the realm of creation. I am the All-Merciful, the Compassionate. Make it your concern to aid the servants and that whereby their hearts may be gladdened. Your Lord commandeth you to that which profiteth you and forbiddeth you from that which harmeth you. He is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in all regions! The fragrance of divine utterance hath been wafted abroad when the Speaker on Sinai spoke. Blessed is the ear that hath heard, and woe unto every heedless remote one. Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, through utterance whereby the servants may be attracted. This is what We commanded you before and at this time.</p>
<p>O people of Dal and Vav and their environs! Rejoice that We have found from you the fragrance of the love of God, the Lord of this glorious station. We testify that ye have turned unto God, the Lord of the Exalted Throne, and there befell you in His path that which caused the Supreme Paradise to lament, and those who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide. We have indeed revealed for My loved ones in the Tablet which We sent down from the heaven of My Will for those who have soared in My atmosphere and held fast to the cord of My love and voiced My praise among My servants and clung to My luminous hem.</p>
<p>At this moment We make mention of him who hath been named Muhammad, who arose to serve My Cause and to teach that which hath been sent down in My Book. We testify that he hath attained unto that which most of the servants have failed to attain, and I am He Who knoweth and counteth all things.</p>
<p>O Pen! Turn thy face toward Ha and Waw, then make mention of them with words wherewith the trees speak forth, even as the Tree of Sinai spoke unto Moses, He Who conversed with God. O My loved ones! We testify that ye have attained unto My verses and My signs, and there hath been sent down for you in the Tablets that which hath enraptured the hearts of them that are nigh unto God. We beseech God to aid you to remain steadfast in this mighty steadfastness, such that the doubts of the divines who have hindered men from drawing nigh unto the momentous Announcement of God shall not cause you to slip.</p>
<p>O My loved ones! We testify that ye have been beneath the glance of My tender care. Your names have been inscribed by My Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have not revealed your names nor made mention of them save as a mercy from Our presence and a wisdom from One Who is a wise Judge.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in the cities and villages! This is a Day wherein signs have appeared, verses have been sent down, and evidence hath been made manifest. Take heed lest ye deprive yourselves of that which hath appeared through grace. Cast aside vain imaginings and turn unto this assured Light. This is a Day wherein the Balance hath been set up, the proof hath appeared, and the mountains have passed away like clouds - this is what the All-Merciful foretold in the Qur’an. Blessed is he who hath turned towards it, and woe unto them that turn away.</p>
<p>O people of God! Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the Most Great Ocean which surgeth before all faces in the name of the Almighty, the Powerful. The rivers of utterance have flowed, and the breezes of the All-Glorious have wafted, and the Spirit crieth out in the wilderness of faithfulness: “Here am I, O Lord of all beings! Here am I, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of names! Here am I, O Thou Who art the Goal of the knowing ones!”</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Ya! The Wronged One hath turned toward you from the direction of ’Akka and remembereth you with that which shall cause your remembrance and your names to endure in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds. Let not the happenings of the world grieve you. By My life! It shall pass away, and that which hath been ordained for you by God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, shall endure. Tribulations have encompassed Us from every direction, and there hath befallen Us at the hands of the oppressors that which hath caused all things to lament and every informed soul to cry out. We desired for them the supreme bounty, while they desired for My Self the ultimate abasement. We beseech God to adorn them with the ornament of justice and to enable them to return unto Him. Verily, He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Compassionate, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God, that the bounty of verses hath been made manifest and the feast of clear proofs hath been sent down. Pure hearts and souls have been adorned with the wondrous ornament of fellowship. Praise befitteth the Lord of existence and the Educator of the seen and unseen, Whose remembrance knoweth no pause and Whose utterance no barrier can restrain. His Will is triumphant and His Purpose all-encompassing. Exalted be His might, sublime be His majesty, glorified be His sovereignty. There is no God but Him.</p>
<p>In these days, although news of the health and well-being of your honor and the honored Afnans - upon them be the glory of God and His favors - is manifest and evident in the realm of the Lord of religions, yet fresh mention hath another sweetness and delight. Some time ago your esteemed letter arrived like a spiritual messenger. Indeed, both joy and sorrow were evident from it. Its joy dispelled the melancholy of the realms of grief and weariness, while its sorrow added to the sadness of these days. However, since these tribulations, afflictions, losses and upheavals have occurred in the days of the Peerless Beloved and in His most exalted path, they are in truth the dawning-place of the world’s joy and the dayspring of the nations’ delight - if the world and its peoples should attain, or if we should attain, to the recognition of this station. The Command is in God’s hand - He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He desireth.</p>
<p>After reading and reviewing, we proceeded to the presence of the Lord of creation. After permission was granted, it was presented and achieved the honor of being heard by the Lord of all being. This is what was revealed in reply from God, the Lord of the beginning and the end. Exalted be His utterance and sublime be His proof:</p>
<p>In His Name, the One Who domineth over all names […]</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One and who standeth before the Gate! Hearken unto that which the Lord of Lords uttereth from His abode. Verily He attracteth thee, draweth thee nigh, delivereth thee from the sorrows and vicissitudes of the world, and maketh thee one who speaketh His praise, who turneth toward the lights of His countenance, and who standeth firm in the service of His Cause both at eventide and at dawn.</p>
<p>Today from the Dawning-Place of the Supreme Pen, the Sun of steadfastness hath risen and shone forth, and from the Source of utterance the river of divine knowledge floweth. Blessed is he who hath found and partaken thereof, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>The True One, exalted be His glory, hath in this Most Holy, Most Exalted Day manifested Himself through all names. Blessed is the servant who hath inhaled the fragrance of His utterance and attained unto that which was recorded by the Pen of Revelation in the Scriptures and Tablets.</p>
<p>O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. This exalted Word was previously revealed from the tongue of the Lord of the Kingdom of Names, and again at this manifest hour it hath appeared. The Afnans of the Divine Lote-Tree were created for the service of the Cause. In all conditions and circumstances they must hold fast unto that which will cause its exaltation and elevation, and the manifestation of that which is now hidden from minds and eyes.</p>
<p>O My Afnan! By the life of God! Soon shall be revealed that which hath been inscribed by the Pen of the Ancient of Days. The Mother Book beareth witness unto this. Today thou must hold fast unto those means which cause the upliftment of the Word and the advancement of existence, and which become the cause of attraction and enkindlement and the eagerness of those who have turned to God and are filled with longing.</p>
<p>In the Tablet of the World this exalted Word was revealed: “O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness.” The pavilion of God’s Cause is mighty. It hath encompassed and will continue to encompass all the peoples of the world. The day is your day, and a thousand tablets bear witness. Arise to assist the Cause, and with the hosts of utterance occupy yourselves with the conquest of the hearts and souls of the people of the world.</p>
<p>The Afnan must in these days hold fast unto that which is the cause of joy and expansiveness to the peoples of the world. Be not grieved by loss and the like […]</p>
<p>Would that the people of God had acted in the Most Great Prison as they ought to have acted, for then most of mankind would have turned to the Truth and attained that which leads to immortality in the Paradise of the Divine Utterance. In Muharram and the blessed month of Ramadan, the Truth Itself hath acted and continueth to act as befitteth It. Say: O people of God! Take fast hold of the Book of God with His power, then act according to it. Verily He will protect you and guard you through His sovereignty and will exalt you through His Name amongst His servants. He is, in truth, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the blood that hath been shed in Thy path, and by that which hath befallen the Manifestation of Thyself in the Land of Ta through the tyranny of Thine enemies and the injury inflicted by the wicked ones among Thy creatures, to aid Thy servants to turn unto Thee and to arise to serve Thy Cause. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Munificent.</p>
<p>The Glory shining and gleaming from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty be upon you, O My Afnans, and upon those who have quaffed the wine of divine knowledge from the chalice of My utterance and who hearken unto your words concerning this manifest Cause and this mighty Announcement.</p>
<p>Praise, glory, remembrance and thanksgiving be unto God, for in these days when the fire of sorrows was kindled from all directions and the light of the Cause was concealed, the Lord of all beings was occupied with the mention of His loved ones. Such bounty hath appeared in the world as hath no peer or likeness. In these blessed days, at all times, the tongue of Grandeur speaketh and maketh mention of His pre-existing mercy and all-encompassing favor, and He hath ordained for His loved ones that which no tongue or pen can describe. The servant beseecheth Him to protect His loved ones from the oppression of the oppressors, the malice of the polytheists, and the wrath of the transgressors. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>They had expressed anxiety over the vicissitudes of the times and the straitening of circumstances. After these were presented, these exalted words were revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance - exalted be His utterance and magnificent His proof: O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Such matters are among the conditions of the days of Revelation. A Cause of which all people were heedless in its early days must needs give rise to clamor, discord and upheaval. However, afterwards all shall be transformed by the command of the True Ordainer: tyranny into justice, agitation into tranquility, remoteness into nearness, denial into acceptance, aversion into attraction, poverty into wealth, and want into abundance. All this was decreed by thy Lord as an irrevocable fate. Didst thou but know what hath been ordained for thee and for those with thee, thou wouldst soar on the wings of longing and find thyself firmly established, steadfast, well-anchored and joyous in this firm, mighty and wise Cause.</p>
<p>Ye should conduct yourself in such wise as to cause the hearts and souls to be attracted and enkindled. Hearken unto the counsel of the Wronged One: verily it will protect thee, deliver thee, and exalt thy station both outwardly and inwardly. Thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>At all times should ye rejoice in the special favors of God, exalted be His glory. In every word of the Divine utterances is concealed the water of life. They have ever drunk and continue to drink therefrom. Henceforth, however, they must fix their gaze upon His commandments and ordinances, and cleave instantly to whatsoever is enjoined. God willing, may that assembly ever be warmed and enkindled through your presence. This servant hath repeatedly besought this from God, exalted be His glory, and continueth to do so. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>O honored one, his eminence the Afnan, the esteemed Haji Siyyid Muhammad, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God! You have ever been and continue to be remembered. This servant conveys greetings, glorification and radiance to you and to all the other honored Afnans of the Sacred Tree - upon them be all His most glorious splendor - and to the friends of God and the friends of the friends of God. I submit my petition and beseech from the Mine of Generosity, for each one, that which is everlasting and eternal. Verily our Lord is the Answerer and the Fulfiller of the needs of those who are near and those who are sincere. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those who love you and who hearken to your words concerning the Cause of our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earths.</p>

<p>God, the All-Powerful, the Single, the Self-Subsisting, hath sent this down unto him whom He hath loved in His Own Self and named Muhammad, that he may prostrate himself before his Lord and be of them that bow down and worship.</p>
<p>He is the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>The Beauty of the All-Merciful from the horizon of the Divine Good-Pleasure, behind clouds of sorrow, did verily shine forth. Should the clouds be lifted, such commotion would arise in every soul that the servants would turn away from the Lord of all creation. For this reason did He take on a veil before His face, that the light might shine upon the righteous in measured portion. Such is the state of the righteous among the learned; how much more those who have disbelieved in their Chosen Lord and have taken the calf as their beloved instead of God! And when We found the people deaf and blind, We left them wandering in the wilderness of fancy and desire, and departed from their midst with a sovereignty witnessed by all the worlds. And We sat alone in the house, detached from all else, awaiting the grace which had been inscribed by the fingers of God in the Mother Book. When the people veiled themselves behind the veils of glory, the lights of beauty were withheld from their eyes, and the Ancient King chose for Himself a station hidden from the sight of all in the world. And beyond this veil is a veil whereof none is aware save My True Self, and thus was the matter recorded in the Mother Book from the mystery of revelation with justice. Soon shall the monotheists cry out and place their fingers of bewilderment between their teeth, and they shall not find the Youth though they search throughout the heavens and earth. Thus was judgment decreed by the Glory on the Tablet of Destiny as an irrevocable command. This is of the tidings of the unseen which We reveal unto thee and unto them that believe, that they may know the worth of these days and take unto the Lord of Spirit a guide. O people! Seize ye the worth of these days and deprive not yourselves of this bounty which hath been sent in human form.</p>
<p>O My Name the Most Great! Hearken unto the call of thy Most Glorious Lord from the Supreme Scene, the dwelling-place of God, the Most High, that the most sweet melodies may attract thee to the Divine Lote-Tree, the station wherein the Sun of Eternity did shine forth from the horizon of grandeur, which God hath preserved from the touch of the polytheists. Leave thou all else behind thee, then enter with thy heart the holy precincts, that the divine emanations from the divine Egypt may pass over thee and move thee with such movement as shall move all worlds collectively in their longing to attain the presence of God and in their quest for His good-pleasure. Thus have We detailed the verses in this Tablet which hath been beheld by the glances of God.</p>
<p>O Letter of the Divine! Stand firm in the Cause, then summon the people unto thy Lord’s horizon, and leave them not to themselves, for Satan lieth in wait at every path to lead the people astray from the shore that was blessed in the primal eternity. Follow what is revealed unto thee, then protect the sheep from the wolves and gather them in the shelter of security beneath the shadow of this Name that encompasseth all things. Say: We have raised the Standard of Proof in My Name, the All-Merciful, and have manifested the Evidence with such power as would render impotent all who dwell in the heavens and earth, be they lowly or noble. Say: My proof is My Self, My sovereignty is My power, My evidence is My Manifestation, and My testimony is My presence between earth and heaven, and that which floweth from My Pen is My creation, were ye but to know it. O My Most Great Name! We have made thee the Kingdom of Our names between earth and heaven. Therefore manifest whatsoever thou willest of the most beautiful names, that thou mayest guide the people unto this Beauty that hath come unto them upon the clouds of the Cause with manifest sovereignty. Let thy tongue speak forth in remembrance of thy Lord, the Bestower, and fear no one, and in all things place thy trust in God, thy Lord. He will aid thee with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, and will protect thee from every sinful idolator. Beware lest thou forget the time when thou wert present before the Throne and there shone upon thee from the horizon of thy Lord’s mouth the Sun of Words with verses that God made clear evidences of His Cause in the kingdom of creation and the light of His countenance unto all in the realm. Hearken unto what the idolators say. By God! What issueth from their mouths curseth them though they perceive it not within themselves, and they are drowned in the depths of idolatry. They claim faith within themselves yet deny Him through Whose single letter the decree of faith hath been manifested in every age. Thus hath God seized their sight and deprived them from the shore of grace. They were to strive in God’s path with their wealth and souls, yet when that which they knew came unto them, they denied it and turned upon their heels. Therefore all atoms reject them and their deeds disown them. Thus doth God render vain the works of those who disbelieved and associated partners with God, and who stood at the threshold of rejection with injustice. Stand firm in the Cause, then give the servants to drink of the living waters from thy Lord the All-Merciful’s cup, ere Satan’s cawing be upraised and bar the people from the holy and manifest path. They who speak as children have risen against God and the Manifestation of His Self, and have denied the blessing that was sent from the realm of bounty. Soon will tablets be spread before thee wherein fingers of ignorance and idolatry have moved to reject God, and thus hath man been ungrateful to his Lord. When thou witnesseth and knoweth this, take up the Pen of Command by Our behest and inscribe upon the tablets what God hath cast upon thy heart in refutation of him who hath rejected God. By God! Then will the Holy Spirit confirm thee and the Spirit that was preserved in the treasuries of infallibility by God’s protection will speak within thy breast. Break the power of blind imitation through the force of unity, then ascend with the two wings of detachment unto the heaven of transcendent glory. Then adorn thyself with pure servitude unto God, thy Lord, for through it is established the sign of unity and is destroyed the standard of idolatry raised by every wicked denier. Say “God,” then leave those who have disbelieved.</p>
<p>Say: The Most Great Word hath appeared, and through it God hath distinguished between the righteous and the wicked, and through it He hath made a separation among the peoples of the world. God hath made this Word sharper than swords, for while swords divide limbs and bodies, the Word separates all things from this day until the Day when the veil of all created things shall be rent asunder and the Beauty of Glory shall appear upon crimson clouds as promised. Verily it is the Water of Life whereby God quickeneth all creation. Verily it is God’s Lamp between the heavens and the earth, by which every pure and illumined heart is lit. Verily it is the Most Great Mirror among His creatures wherein the Ancient Beauty is known according to each one’s capacity. Verily it is the Most Great Weight between the heavens and the earth and God’s Enduring Testimony unto all in the kingdoms of Command and Creation, and through it the fragrance of God is wafted among all, whether small or great. Say to him who cannot attain the presence of the Throne and behold the Beauty of God: Let him look upon the Word of God. By God! Through it eyes are gladdened and the hearts of all who seek are purified. Say: O people! Compare not the Word of God with aught else, for by it was all else created, and none comprehend this save those possessed of keen insight. Come forth from behind the veils, then manifest My Cause which hath encompassed all worlds. Remind the people of that wherewith We have reminded thee, then inspire them with that which We have inspired thee, that they may take the path to the Holy Court. Know thou that thy letter hath come before the Throne and holy glances illumined with loving radiance have turned unto it, that thou mayest be stirred from thy slumber and be enkindled by the fire that blazed in the Tree of Utterance upon the Mount of Inner Meanings by God’s leave. Be thou ignited by the warmth of thy Lord’s love, then kindle the people with the fire of remembrance through this Word which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Tablet with mighty sovereignty. Preserve the pillars of the Cause through the iron of exposition lest the hosts of Satan undermine them - this is a command sent down in truth from the heaven of wisdom. Know thou that We have found from thy letter the fragrance of the garment and have sent thee the breaths of the All-Merciful from the direction of this Paradise, that the divine fragrance may attract thee to a sublime heaven of glory. We have given thee in this Tablet the wings of power and might that thou mayest soar thereby to the station wherein all created things shall seek thy shadow. Thus have We aided thee amongst Our servants and raised thee to the Most Exalted Horizon, a wondrous holy seat. We have been with thee at all times and witnessed what befell thee in thy Lord’s paths, and We were thy witness. We have mentioned in the Tablets what hath come upon thee and what hath reached thee through the wisdom hidden in thy Lord’s knowledge. Beware lest thou grieve at what hardships have touched thee. God shall soon cut off the last remnant of those who have wronged without clear proof or enlightening book. Be patient, then show forth supreme patience until the promise cometh from the presence of One mighty and powerful. When tribulation waxeth severe, remember My trials and what hath come upon My Beauty from all peoples, and behind them servants who were created by My word - and My own Self, the True One, is witness to what I say. Thus have We imparted to thee from the gems of wisdom and utterance that thou mayest gather together the servants of the All-Merciful and protect them through a strength from Us against the arrows of every wretched idolater. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, who have taken beneath thy Lord’s shadow a station purified from all idolatry.</p>

Praise be to God, the letter bore mention and praise, and likewise revealed the mysteries of heart and soul. The fragrance of divine love and the infinite mercy of the Lord emanated from it.

<p>O Nasr, upon thee be the glory of God, the Lord of the Throne! His honor, my namesake M.H., upon him be my Baha, brought thy letter into the presence some days ago. We saw and heard it, and likewise the second letter. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to manifest that which He hath ordained for thee, and to shower from the clouds of grace and the heaven of bounty the rain of blessings and the table of knowledge, glory and benediction. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Convey greetings from this Wronged One to the friends. We have delayed in sending replies to petitions out of wisdom, and we counsel all to this, and to that which is conducive to the tranquility of the servants and the refinement of all in the land. O Nasr! When thou art blessed with the sweet savors of utterance, render thanks unto God, the Lord of all religions, and say […]</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou hearest and knowest that this Thy servant hath testified to the unity of Thy Being and its sanctity, and to the immaculacy of Thine Essence and its sovereignty, and hath acknowledged Thy power, Thy grandeur and Thine authority. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Kingdom and by Thy Prophets and Messengers, and by Him through Whom Thou didst unlock the gates of bounty unto all being and of generosity unto the world - He through Whom was manifested the decree of unity amongst the peoples - to assist me in all conditions to remember and praise Thee, and to grant me success in that whereby my mention may endure throughout the permanence of Thy dominion. O Lord! Thou seest me turning unto Thee, clinging to the cord of Thy grace, standing before the door of Thy bestowal, and hoping for the wonders of Thy bounty. O Lord! Aid me with the hosts of the unseen, then preserve me from the manifestations of doubt and uncertainty. O Lord! Thou seest the poor one seeking Thy grace, the remote one Thy nearness, the weak one Thy power, and the wronged one Thy justice. I ask Thy forgiveness for this; nay rather, he seeketh Thy grace, and the thirsty one Thy sweet waters, and the seeker Thy dwelling-place, and the stranger his native land in Thy presence. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy trusted ones and Thy chosen ones. I testify that Thy generosity hath preceded all things, Thy grace hath encompassed all things, and Thy mercy hath preceded all who are in Thy heaven and on Thine earth. Thou art He, O my God, unto Whose power all created things have testified, and to my powerlessness; to Thy might, and to my weakness; all contingent things to Thy wealth and my poverty, and to Thy care and my want. I beseech Thee by Thy bounty which hath encompassed all things, through which the Speaker of Sinai spoke and the dwellers of the graves arose, to assist me in that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love. Thou seest me, O my God, at this moment clinging to that which Thou didst reveal in the Qur’an to Thy Beloved One. Thou didst say, and Thy word is the truth: “O ye people! Ye are but paupers in relation to God, whereas God is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised.” Thereby was established my poverty by Thy testimony of me, and Thy wealth by Thy testimony of Thyself. Wouldst Thou turn away one whose poverty and Thy wealth Thou hast testified to? Nay, by Thy glory! It beseemeth not the All-Bountiful to turn away the poor from His door, nor the Almighty to withhold the lowly from His threshold. O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! I beseech Thee by the Word through which Thou didst bring forth all things from the unseen into the visible realm and from nothingness into existence, that Thou mayest ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of this world and of the world to come. Verily Thou art the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust below, and the King of the Kingdom of Names. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>O Pen! The irrevocable command hath come unto thee from the presence of the Lord of eternity to make mention of him who hath ascended unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed art thou, O Muhammad-i-Yusuf, inasmuch as thou didst soar on the wings of detachment in the days of thy Lord, the Creator of all things, through Whose remembrance the earth and heaven were illumined, and before Whose command all things have bowed down, while the Herald hath cried out from every direction: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Possessor of all that was and shall be!” The first fragrance that wafted from thy Lord’s utterance, the All-Merciful, and the first mercy that preceded all possibility was upon thee, O thou who didst turn to the horizon of Revelation on the Day of Resurrection and didst hear the Call when it was raised between earth and heaven, and didst answer thy Lord, believing in Him, in His verses, and in that which was revealed in His Book. My Pen and My tongue bear witness to thy recognition and certitude, and to thy turning unto a station from which most people have turned away, and to thy holding fast unto the Sure Handle amidst all created things. Thou art he who drank the choice wine of immortality from the cup of thy Lord’s bounty, the Creator of the heavens. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, at this hour to send down upon thee from the heaven of His generosity a mercy from His presence and to give thee to drink of the Kawthar of life at all times. Verily, He is the Lord of all religions and the Protector of all possibility. Blessed art thou, O Yusuf, inasmuch as thou hast attained unto God’s testimony concerning thee, and He hath revealed for thee that whereby thy name and mention shall endure in a Book which no obliteration can touch and wherein the deeds of His loved ones are recorded by the Pen of God, the Almighty, the Powerful. Blessed is he who through thee draweth nigh unto God and who visiteth thy resting-place and remembereth thee with that which hath been sent down from God, the Lord of the mighty Throne.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all things! I beseech Thee by Him through Whom the mysteries were revealed, the signs appeared, and the leaves and trees spoke forth, that Thou forgive me, my father and mother, my kindred, and those who have clung to the hem of Thy gracious robe and have acknowledged that which the tongue of Thy grandeur hath spoken. O Lord! Purify Thy loved ones from the dust of sins and the grime of transgression, and illumine them with the lights of Thy bounty and generosity, O Thou Help in Peril! There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>At this hour We have desired to make mention of Mashhadi Muhammad-Kazim, upon him be the glory of God. O Kazim, say:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having guided me, given me to drink, caused me to hear, and shown me. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I beseech Thee by the light of Thy Cause whereby Thy heaven and earth were illumined, and by the Word of Unity whereby the polytheists lamented and the unitarians rejoiced, to aid me to be so steadfast that neither hosts nor ranks nor the doubts of any heedless and obstinate polytheist shall hold me back. O Lord! Ordain for me that which will strengthen me to act according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>O mother of him who hath ascended unto God! Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou seest Thy handmaiden turning unto Thee, acknowledging Thy unity and oneness, and that Thou art the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the Self-Subsisting, the One, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>We beseech God to aid all to that which is conducive to the reformation of the world and the refinement of nations.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who was named Qasim, whom Asad, upon him be My glory, hath mentioned. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for him the reward of deeds that have attained unto the light of acceptance, and to decree for him that which will draw him nigh unto Him at all times. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Qasim! Turn with thy heart and direct thy face towards the House and say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the breezes which have quickened the trees of humanity throughout all possibility, and by the effulgences of the Orb of Thy Cause whereby Thou hast nurtured Thy servants and Thy creatures in the cities and habitations, in the wildernesses and deserts and upon the mountains, to make my outer and inner being adorned with the ornament of justice and fairness and illumined with the light of Thy knowledge, O King of bounty and grace! O Lord! I am Thy servant, and the son of Thy servant and Thy handmaiden. I hold fast unto Thee and unto Thy cord. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me in attaining that which Thou hast ordained for those who circle round Thy Sacred House. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>We have mentioned and do mention at this time him who attained unto Our presence and ascended unto God, in such wise that his remembrance and his name shall endure through the eternity of names. We beseech God to forgive him and draw him nigh unto Him, and to send down upon him at all times from the heaven of His bounty mercy from His presence. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.</p>
<p>His honor Azizu’llah has written details regarding the will of Aqa Dadash and sent it to the Most Holy Court. His property should be used in that same place for charitable purposes, and now that property should be expended for the two daughters in whatever manner the trustees of that land deem advisable. Its transmission to this land is not permitted.</p>
<p>Mention unto Mulla Muhammad-’Ali on behalf of the Wronged One. Blessed are they whom their wealth and possessions did not deprive on the Day of Return, and who delayed not, according to their capacity, in teaching the Cause. Today this matter is accounted among the mightiest of deeds. However, in all circumstances they must observe wisdom. O people of Baha and Dal! Hearken unto the counsel of the Wronged One. In all circumstances be mindful of wisdom and hold fast unto that which is conducive to reconciliation. Verily, He is the Counselor, the All-Knowing, and He is the Helper, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory in wisdom and utterance!</p>
<p>O Ramadan! Give thanks unto God for having strengthened thee and caused thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of His Revelation and the Dayspring of His verses, and for having manifested through thee one who hath occupied himself with My service, attained My presence, heard My call, and beheld My resplendent horizon. Blessed art thou, and blessed is he, and blessed is his mother - give her the glad-tidings from Me of My loving-kindness and My mercy which have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>O Ramadan! We make mention of the son of ’Ali and his other son as a token of grace from God, the Lord of destiny. Each of them hath been illumined by the lights of the Luminary of My utterance which hath shone forth from the horizon of My Most Exalted Pen. Thy Lord is verily the All-Merciful, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Ramadan! Hearken in the Persian tongue to the utterance of the Best-Beloved of the worlds, that thou mayest be illumined by the Day-Star of inner meanings which hath shone forth from the horizon of the divine kingdom of knowledge. Thy son ’Ali hath drunk from the cup of bounty and hath attained unto service. His kinsmen are each and all remembered in the presence of God. I swear by the Lamp of Light which shineth by the command of the Lord of Manifestation and the Interlocutor of Sinai - the world hath never equaled and shall never equal a single word from the words of Truth. His eminence Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin, upon him be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy, hath for some time been taken by the hand of grace and assigned a station in the shade of the Blessed Tree. Night and day he dwelleth nearby, occupied with transcribing the verses of God. We make mention of all the friends in that land and ask confirmation for each one of them. That which shall gladden the eyes of those who are nigh and sincere hath been ordained for those who have turned unto God. We enjoin wisdom upon all. They must occupy themselves with the exaltation of the Word of Him Who is the Goal of all being, in a spirit of joy and radiance, with wisdom and utterance. This is the most great station and the most exalted rank. Well is it with them that act!</p>
<p>O Haydar! Thy brother hath been mentioned and the Lord of might is engaged in thy remembrance. Blessed is the soul that hath today attained unto the remembrance of the Lord of Days. He is accounted in the presence of the Truth as among the most exalted of beings and is recorded by the Divine Pen. Blessed art thou, and blessed is he that is with thee, and blessed is he that hath believed in God, the Single One, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-’Ali! Thou hast been mentioned and the Divine Countenance hath turned toward thee from the Most Great Prison. If thou attainest unto the recognition of this station and preservest it, thou shalt, throughout thy life, be engaged in celebrating the praise of the Lord of Manifestation with utmost joy and gladness, in such wise that neither the world and its ornaments, nor its doubts and allusions, nor its gifts and bestowals shall prevent thee from holding fast unto the cord of God or deprive thee of attachment to His sanctified hem. The glory of God rest upon thee and upon thy wife and upon those that are with thee, from God, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Ni’matu’llah! The Wronged One hath turned toward thee from the precincts of the Prison and maketh mention of thee with a remembrance that shall not be overtaken by forgetfulness, oversight, negligence or oblivion. He is the possessor of the Most Great Infallibility and the Sovereign Who doeth what He pleaseth. Were all the peoples of the world to meditate upon this most exalted Word and to drink from the ocean of its meanings, they would find themselves seated upon the thrones of faith and certitude and would regard all else besides God as non-existent and as naught. The reward of no one hath been, nor ever shall be, lost in the presence of God. The souls in that land who have turned toward Him and who have arisen to serve Him have each attained unto that which is more precious in the sight of God than all things. We give them the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds, and We give them the glad-tidings of God’s everlasting bounty and His eternal table of divine knowledge. And verily I am the All-Bountiful, the All-Merciful, the Munificent.</p>
<p>O Ali Muhammad! Praise thou the Wronged One of the world Who hath made mention of thee in the Most Great Prison. Verily He remembereth those who have turned unto Him. He is the Compassionate, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Convey My salutations to thy wife and give her the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness. All the friends of that land, as well as the kinsmen of Aqa Ali, have on this blessed night been blessed with the verses of the Most Exalted Pen. We beseech God to assist them, to aid them, and to reinforce them with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Verily He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth through His command, and He is the Strong, the Triumphant, the Almighty.</p>
<p>O Ali-Qabl-Muhammad! The Truth maketh mention of thee and counseleth thee to steadfastness. Give thanks to the Ancient Lord Who hath guided thee and enabled thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of His verses. Glory be upon thee and upon thy wife from God, the One, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! We enjoin thee and the friends of God to perform such deeds as will lead to the exaltation of the Word of God. Blessed is he who hath heard and acted accordingly.</p>
<p>O Nur Muhammad! Today pure deeds and spiritual qualities are the hosts of God, exalted be His glory. All must assist the Wronged One through these hosts. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen made mention of thee and thy wife as a token of My grace, that thou mayest be of the thankful.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabl-Ali! Contention, conflict and corruption have been forbidden in God’s Book. All must arise to serve the Cause in perfect unity and harmony, and occupy themselves with the praise and glorification of Him Who is the Desired One. We counsel you all to act with righteousness. Cast away what the people possess and take what ye have been commanded in the laws of God and His ordinances, in the precepts of God and His decrees. Verily, He commandeth you that which shall profit you in all the worlds of His worlds. He is the Compassionate, the Mighty, the All-Wise. We have made mention of thee, thy mother and thy wife, that thou mayest become aware of My loving-kindness which hath encompassed all things, both seen and unseen.</p>
<p>O Ibrahim! The Wronged One remembereth thee whilst under the claws of hatred wrought by the hands of the heedless. Glory be upon thee, upon thy wife, and upon every maidservant who hath heard, responded, turned unto God and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of all who are in the heavens and on earth!”</p>
<p>O Rahim! Mention of thee hath been made at the Most Holy Court, and thy name hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. We counsel thee and the friends to perform such deeds as will draw the servants nigh unto God. Take ye what ye have been commanded by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Abdul-Khaliq! These are the days of God, and the Speaker of Sinai is seated upon the throne of Revelation, manifest and evident without any veil or concealment, calling thee and all on earth to the Most Sublime Horizon. Hearken, and be not of the heedless. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto the remembrance of God and been adorned with His attributes.</p>
<p>O Muhammad Ali! My Glory be upon thee and thy wife. Know ye the station of the friends in that land. In these days the honored Amin, upon him be the glory of God, hath attained the Most Holy Court and made mention of that land, and especially concerning Mulla Baqir, divine verses were revealed and sent both before and after. God willing, they shall drink from the ocean of the utterance of the All-Merciful and shall find themselves detached and free from all else but God.</p>
<p>O Jafar! We made mention of thee in the Most Great Prison. This day unity and concord are well-pleasing and acceptable in the sight of God. Beseech ye God that He may enable all to attain unto this station. In the right hand of unity the banner of divine succour can be seen. Well is it with them that behold it.</p>
<p>O My handmaiden, O Kulthum! Thy name hath been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One, and thou hast been honoured with the mention of Him Who is the Beloved of the worlds. From the beginning of days, on the day when the Ancient Beauty left His house in Baghdad and entered the garden named Ridvan, He shed the splendour of all His names upon all created things. None hath ever reckoned, nor shall ever reckon, the effulgence of this Daystar of divine bounty, for it is sanctified above and independent of the power and might of creation. Likewise hath He ordained that every name that attaineth unto the presence of the Throne shall be honored with divine mention and with the effects of the Most Exalted Pen. Until this time, every name that hath been present before the Wronged One hath been favoured with that which hath no peer or likeness. We beseech God that He may enable all to preserve His gifts, His bounties and His bestowals. He verily hath power over all things and is the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-’Ali! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee from His prison and summoneth thee to the most sublime horizon. We beseech God that He may enable all to achieve unity and concord. This is the Testament of God which hath flowed and continues to flow from the Most Exalted Pen, both in the past and in the future. Blessed are they that have attained, and happy are they that act accordingly. The glory be upon thee and upon thy wife.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in that land! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One from the Most Sublime Horizon. He counseleth you with that which will draw you nigh unto a station wherein naught is heard save the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing and the sighing of the Most Exalted Pen. He, verily, is the Ordainer of whatsoever He willeth. None hath comprehended His grace save His Own Self, the One Who dominateth all that are in earth and heaven. O My loved ones! Say: In the Name of God and by God, and take ye the chalice of utterance from the hands of the mercy of your Lord, the All-Merciful, then drink ye therefrom in despite of them that have disbelieved in God when He came with manifest sovereignty. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken from His glorious station. Blessed is he who hath heard and acted according to that which was enjoined on him by God, the Lord of existence. The glory be upon you and upon My handmaidens who have heard and believed in God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.</p>

<p>O Mahdi Tabasi, upon him be the Glory of God!</p>
<p>He is the Hearer, the Answerer!</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Upon thee be My Glory and My loving-kindness! From the Supreme Prison there hath flowed from the Pen in thy remembrance that which caused the hearts of ardent lovers to soar unto God, the Lord of the Day of the Covenant. Thou hast been blessed with My call time and again, and with My verses repeatedly. God shall soon raise up from every word that which shall recount this most exalted station. Verily thy Lord is the Omnipotent, the All-Choosing. Beware lest the veils of the world prevent thee, or the oppression of those who have denied God, the Lord of Lords, weaken thee. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear the All-Merciful. Cast behind you the idols of names, turning unto God, the One, the Alone, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. This is a Day wherein none save Him is mentioned, as attesteth the Mother Book which is with Him. Say: Fear God, O people of the Bayan, and deny not Him Who hath come unto you with God’s signs and sovereignty. Thus hath the matter been decreed from the presence of God, the Lord of the beginning and the end.</p>
<p>We have desired to make mention of him who was named Hashim, that he may rejoice in God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of the worlds. O Hashim! Hear the call from the supreme horizon, from the Ultimate Lote-Tree in the prison of ’Akka: Verily there is none other God but Me, the One, the Alone, the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful. Cast aside vain imaginings, turning to the horizon wherefrom hath shone the Sun of Certitude from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Beware lest anything prevent thee from this Most Great Announcement, or any matter grieve thee in this Straight Path. Say: O people of the earth! I have forsaken the religion of a people who believed not in God, the Lord of the Glorious Throne. Beware lest the swords of the enemies frighten you, or the derision of those who have denied the Day of Judgment grieve you. Thus have We caused thee to hear the warbling of the Dove of Divine Knowledge upon the highest branches. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath turned and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth!”</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Isma’il! Hearken unto the call of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. He maketh mention of thee and those who have believed, whereby the eyes of the mystics have been gladdened. When thou hast drunk the choice wine of revelation from the cup of My bounty and hast heard My most sweet call from the direction of My prison, turn toward the Kaaba of God and say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy guidance and for having revealed unto me from the treasuries of Thy Most Exalted Pen the pearls of bounty and bestowal. I beseech Thee by the repositories of Thy revelation and the Daysprings of Thy Cause to ordain for this poor one, through the Pen of Thy bounty, that which will exalt him through Thy Name. Thou art, verily, the Omnipotent over what Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all things past and future.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Taqi! We have made mention of thee as a bounty from Our presence, and We mention thee as a mercy from God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Blessed is he who hath drunk the choice wine of My utterance from the cup of My bounty and hath heard My most sweet call from My most exalted horizon on this blessed, mighty and wondrous Day. Grieve not at the clamor of the wayward, and fear not the might of the oppressors. Take hold of the Book with the power proceeding from God, the Lord of the exalted Throne, and say:</p>
<p>My God, my Lord, and my Support! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the mysteries of Thy Book to aid me to serve Thy Cause in Thy days. Thou art, verily, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Ancient Beauty! Turn Thy face from the direction of the Most Great Prison toward him who was named Rida in the books of names, that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the Rememberer, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Rida! We make mention of him who was named Muhammad - upon him be My glory and loving-kindness - whom the breezes of Revelation stirred and whom the hand of might raised up to serve this glorious and mighty Cause. We have made mention of him and those with him through verses that all the books of the world cannot equal, as doth testify the Mother Book in this exalted station. O Rida, say:</p>
<p>Praise be to Thee, O Lord of all beings and Ruler of the Kingdom of Names, for having made me to speak Thy praise, to turn unto Thy Kaaba, and to circle round Thy will. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Throne and by Thy Most Ancient and Most Mighty Name to make me steadfast in Thy love and firm in Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Hear My sweetest call, then make mention of him who hath turned unto Thy horizon and desired to enter the depths of the ocean of Thy oneness - he who was named Ahmad in the Kingdom of Names and whose name hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur in this clear moment. Blessed art thou for having turned and heard the Call when it was raised between earth and heaven, and for having attained unto the mention of God and His signs that have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Beware lest the veils of names prevent thee from drawing nigh unto their Creator and their Manifestation. Take hold, with the hands of resignation, of the hem of thy Lord’s mercy, and say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou seest me turning unto Thee, enkindled with the fire of Thy Sacred Tree, and attracted by Thy verses. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne and by that which lay hidden and treasured in Thy knowledge, to aid me to be steadfast in this Cause whereby all things have cried out and proclaimed: “O concourse of earth and heaven! By God! The Lord of all beings hath come with a sovereignty that hath subdued all who are in the heavens and on earth.” To this doth bear witness the Most Great Book of God in this mighty Prison.</p>
<p>The Most Great Branch and My loved ones there have mentioned thee time and again, and he who was named Husayn, who arose to serve the Cause in its earliest days, hath made mention of thee. We have remembered thee through this wondrous Book. We beseech God to assist His loved ones in that which will cause the fragrance of the garment to be diffused throughout all regions and the sweet savors of holiness to spread among His servants. Verily, He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. He is the All-Bountiful, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. We make mention of Our loved ones who have not broken God’s covenant and His testament, and who have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken in His days. We ask for them divine success and confirmation in all conditions. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>O My loved ones! Know ye the value of these days and hold fast unto that which will cause the exaltation of the Word of God. These days shall pass away, and whatsoever is seen and shall be seen will return to nothingness. Therefore must they who are immersed in the sea of oneness and have turned to the Most Sublime Horizon arise to mention and praise God and to serve His Cause throughout the nights and days. These sublime words were previously revealed from the tongue of the Wronged One:</p>
<p>Death to the veiled ones, pain to the frozen ones;</p>
<p>The King of Days hath come, that Perfect Treasure hath come,</p>
<p>That Hidden Mystery hath been revealed,</p>
<p>Despite the will of common folk.</p>
<p>And likewise in another place […]</p>
<p>That divine Horseman with sovereign crown</p>
<p>With the diadem of “I am God”, like dawn emerged from night</p>
<p>Say: O people! None can prevent the influence of the Most Exalted Word and the Supreme Pen. By a power and might hath the Cause been made manifest, the like of which the essence of creation hath never witnessed. We beseech God to set ablaze His loved ones with the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree - a fire which neither the happenings of the world nor the oceans of rejection and hypocrisy can extinguish or diminish. Ye are today the daysprings of acceptance and the dawning-places of the love of the Eternal Beloved. Ye must raise the hands of hope toward the heaven of God’s generosity in such wise that through them may be uplifted the hands of all created things, and manifest such power that the might of all beings shall fail to weaken it. Take ye the Book of God with the power and sovereignty bestowed by Him. He is with you and will aid you with His sovereignty. Verily, there is no power save His power and no sovereignty save His sovereignty. He is the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Conquering, the Commander, the All-Wise. We were with you in your [gathering], aware of your state, and We heard your mention and praise of God’s Manifest, Speaking and Clear News. At this point We wish to conclude this Tablet with mention of Mulla Ahmad-’Ali.</p>
<p>O Ahmad-i-’Ali! We testify that thou hast drunk the choice wine of thy Lord’s utterance time and again, and He hath given thee to drink of the Kawthar flowing from the Supreme Pen. Be thou thankful and numbered among the grateful. Thou hast ever been beneath the glances of Our loving-kindness. Illumine the loved ones of the City of Nun and Ya with the effulgent lights of the Luminary of utterance, the Goal of all the worlds. They have striven in God’s path and aided His Cause with a power that neither the might of tyrants nor the assault of pharaohs could withstand. Blessed are they in that the Goal of the world hath, in the Most Great Prison, taken up the chalice of utterance in their names and drunk therefrom in remembrance of them in this hallowed, luminous, transcendent, glorious and exalted station. Give them glad-tidings from Us and remind them from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Bountiful. We have mentioned thee in numerous Tablets and ordained for thee that which the treasuries of earth cannot equal, as this clear Book doth testify.</p>
<p>The loved ones must, one and all, with spirit and fragrance, with wisdom and utterance, awaken those who slumber and deliver those who waver from the limitations of the polytheists. The former people clung to [names] and were thus deprived of their Goal. Therefore were they barred from the ocean of mercy of the Ancient Lord Who hath appeared through His Most Great Name, and they remain, like the Jewish people, wandering in the wilderness of perplexity. O My loved ones! Strive ye, perchance ye may preserve the world from the suppositions and imaginings of the past and bestow upon it the living waters. Ye are the divine cup-bearers. Praise be to God, His Holiness the Afnan is present in that land. Ye must, in consultation with him, hold fast to whatsoever conduceth to the exaltation of existence. God will soon manifest that wherewith He hath given you glad-tidings in His Books, His Scriptures and His Tablets. Verily He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Ancient Commander.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath revealed Himself through His Most Great Name, whereupon the limbs of the idolaters among the nations did tremble, and the faces of the monotheists were illumined amidst these intense and gloomy darknesses, and the doves of the Supreme Paradise warbled, and then the rustling of the Lote-Tree of the utmost boundary was raised in the most exalted Paradise. He hath come, through Whose advent both the kingdom of earth and heaven were honored. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Him and attained, and woe unto every heedless doubter. Light and glory be upon the Hands of the Cause amidst humanity, whom God hath purified from tyranny and immorality, and adorned with the raiment of piety. These are honored servants whom God hath mentioned in His Books, His Scrolls and His Scriptures, both in the past and future, and hath preferred them above many of His creatures. Verily, He is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>We have arisen this day in this exalted station, and We desire to make mention of God’s friends and loved ones, to give them glad tidings of His grace and draw them nigh unto Him in this Day wherein We are encompassed by the fires of sorrows from those who behold the sea and its waves yet deny them, and the sun and its radiance yet turn away from it, and the heaven and its stars yet object to them. Indeed, they are the worshippers of vain imaginings, to which the Tongue of Grandeur doth testify in this mighty stronghold. Say: O people, shatter the idols of self and passion with the arm of God’s utterance, the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below. Then shall ye behold what no eye hath seen and hear what no ear hath heard, to which God’s perspicuous Book doth testify at this moment. The ocean of knowledge hath surged and the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath wafted, yet most of the people remain heedless.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Thy letter hath attained Our presence, sent by him whom We named Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin in My mighty Book, and it was presented by one of My Branches whom We named Diya. We have answered thee with verses whose fragrances have been diffused and whose perfume hath been wafted. Blessed is he who hath found them and attained unto them, and woe unto every remote heedless one. We make mention of My loved ones who have turned toward My horizon and soared in the atmosphere of My love and uttered My beautiful praise.</p>
<p>O Man?ar! The Lord of Destiny hath made mention of thee from His Most Great Scene with verses through which God created ears among the Concourse on high specifically to hearken unto them. Know thou the station of this bounty and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of grace and favors, and in Whose right hand is the kingdom of justice and equity. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleaseth. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Na’im! We have mentioned thee before and sent it unto thee that thou mightest rejoice and be of the thankful. Say: Were it not for the Glory (Baha), who would stand before princes and divines? And were it not for Him, who would proclaim between the heavens and the earth? Be fair, O people, in what hath been sent down in truth and appeared in justice, and be not of the wrongdoers. By God! There hath appeared what hath never appeared in creation, whereunto the Mother Book doth testify in this exalted station.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Aqa! My name Mahdi, upon him be my glory, hath made mention of thee aforetime, and We have sent unto thee that which hath diffused the fragrance of My mercy that hath preceded all who dwell on earth. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Beloved, for having caused my remembrance to endure in Thy perspicuous Book. I beseech Thee to aid me and Thy loved ones to perform such deeds as would be honored with Thy gracious acceptance and from which the sweet savors of Thy good-pleasure may be wafted. This is my hope and the hope of them that are nigh unto Thee. O Lord! Assist Thy loved ones to be steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that the ranks of kings and rulers may not deter them.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-i-Mashhadi! Dost thou know Who maketh mention of thee at this hour, and dost thou recognize Who calleth thee from this most luminous and most holy Spot? By My life! Wert thou to truly know, thou wouldst soar upon the wings of yearning in this hallowed, glorious and resplendent atmosphere. The people have cast the Ocean behind their backs, hastening unto idle fancies and vain imaginings. Thus hath the Ocean of Utterance surged before the faces of all religions. Blessed is he who hath attained and hath said: “Praise be unto Thee, O my Lord and my King, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Beloved and my Adored One!” I testify that Thou hast adorned the Tablets with Thy mention and Paradise with the breezes of Thy Revelation, and hast honored the earth with Thy footsteps, and illumined the horizons with the light of certitude and hearts with the light of Thy knowledge. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Gracious. Blessed be My name Jamal who hath drunk the choice wine of My utterance from the chalice of My bounty and hath voiced My praise amongst My servants in days wherein the faces of the ignorant have been darkened and the feet of the mystics have slipped upon the path of God, the True King, the Manifest One - save whom God hath willed, his Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Blessed is he who hath heard His call in this Most Great Remembrance and followed Him in this wise Command.</p>
<p>O ’Inayatu’llah! This is a Book inscribed by the Pen of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, and this is a sealed tablet, a command from God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Blessed is he who hath shattered the idols and taken up the chalice of utterance in My Name before the faces of men, and hath drunk in remembrance of Me, the Mighty, the Beloved. The Day is come, yet most of the people comprehend not. The Light hath shone forth, yet most of the people recognize it not. They have cast justice behind their backs, clinging to tyranny, yet they perceive it not. Say: My God, my God! Adorn my head and the heads of Thy loved ones with the crowns of detachment and their temples with the raiment of godliness. Thou, verily, hast power to do what Thou willest. O my Lord! Aid me in that whereby Thy Most Exalted Word may be uplifted amongst mankind, and enable me to achieve that which Thou lovest and pleasest. O my Lord! I am Thy servant who hath turned unto Thee and held fast unto the cord of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee to ordain for me the good of this world and the next, and whatsoever beseemeth the ocean of Thy generosity, O Thou Lord of existence!</p>
<p>O Habbu’llah! We have commanded all to be trustworthy and religious, and to that whereby the station of man may be exalted, yet the people have wrought that which hath caused the Pen of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, to weep. The verses have been sent down and the evidences have appeared, and the Tree of Utterance hath cried out when He Who conversed on Sinai was established upon the throne of Revelation: “O people of the Bayan! Fear the All-Merciful. This is He but for Whom I would not have revealed Myself nor uttered a word. Fear God, then hasten unto Him. There is no God but He, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. If anyone denieth Him, by what proof can he establish aught else besides Him? Be fair, and be not of them who see and deny. This is He through Whom the standards of verses were hoisted and the banners of signs appeared, and through Whom every tongue hath spoken. Sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Lord of creation.”</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Rida! Hear the call from the Most Exalted Horizon - verily there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. He hath come, He by Whose name the scrolls of God, the Lord of lords, were adorned. We have remembered thee with that which neither the treasuries of kings nor the wealth of servants can equal. To this the Mother Book beareth witness in the final return. Blessed is he who remaineth serene, whom armies cannot frighten, and strong is he whom the might of the wicked cannot weaken. We have sent down from the heaven of grace that which encompassed all regions. Yet when the light shone forth and the people felt secure, they emerged from behind the veils and committed that which caused the hearts of the righteous to melt. Say: O people, fear God! He hath come unto you with oceans of verses and proofs, and hath called all on earth unto God, the Lord of creation. Glorify thy Lord with praise and remind the servants of that which will draw them nigh unto the most exalted station. Blessed is he who hath heard and responded, and woe unto every denying infidel. The glory of God be upon thee and upon thy daughter who hath believed in God in the final return.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Qabl-Muhammad! This Name hath come and given glad tidings to the people of My manifestation, My appearance, My grandeur, My power, My might and My sovereignty. Yet when I came with the standards of guidance and success, My servants turned away from Me, denied My manifestation and disputed My verses. Thus did their own souls deceive them. Verily they are in heedlessness and error. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having guided me unto Thy straight path and revealed unto me that which delighteth eyes. O Lord! Drive me not from the door of Thy grace and deny me not from the ocean of Thy bounty. Ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Chosen One. O Lord! Aid Thy servants unto virtues through which Thy Cause may be exalted among Thy creation and Thy glory in Thy lands. Thou art verily the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>O Husayn! We have sent down unto thee a Tablet that no other tablets can equal, and We have remembered thy father with such remembrance as hath melted hearts. Grieve not over anything. Trust in all matters in Him. He is the Powerful, the All-Forgiving. We beseech God to punish those who wronged thy father and pronounced judgment against him without proof or evidence. The servants who circle the Throne have wailed in grief for him at morn and eve. Grieve not over anything. Verily he dwelleth now within the pavilion of My glory, surrounded by angels and the Spirit from God, the Revealer of verses. We have remembered the sons of him who ascended unto God, the Lord of religions, and We have remembered al-Ashraf whom the wolves of the earth devoured out of hatred toward God, the One, the Almighty. The son of the wolf opened his mouth and his followers devoured him. Verily he is in abasement and loss. Soon shall he see the recompense of his deeds as did his father, and the angels of torment shall cause him to enter with wrath from God, the Powerful, the Compelling. We promised him in the Tablet of Proof concerning the evil punishment that would befall him. And We remember at this time My handmaidens and counsel them to fear God, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning. The glory from Us be upon you, O My loved ones, and We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid you in that which will attract the hearts of the servants. He is verily the Powerful, the Protector, the One Who speaketh before the faces of the parties.</p>

<p>He is the One Who hath appeared in the Kingdom of Proof in the midst of creation!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath revealed Himself through His Most Great Name unto the world, whereupon the Books were made manifest, the Scrolls were expounded, the Psalms came forth, the Tablets were revealed, and the Mother Book spoke forth at the final goal above the heads of the factions. By God the Truth! The Dawning-Place of God’s Cause, your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, hath come. Light and revelation and glory be upon the faithful ones whom neither the former tales nor the latter have prevented, who have turned with radiant faces unto the divine traces and have heard with their own ears the verses of God, the Supreme, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>O friends of God in Kaf and Ra! Hearken unto the call of God from the precincts of the Prison. He verily guideth you unto His Most Straight Path and His Most Great Announcement, whereby the limbs of the nations have quaked–those who changed God’s bounty into disbelief and led their people to the abode of perdition. Leave the opposers behind you, then turn towards the horizon whence hath shone the Sun of Utterance from God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of the opposers! Come with your ropes and your staves. By the life of God! Ye have no escape nor any place of refuge. Fear ye God and follow not every sinful denier who hath taken vain imaginings as lords besides God and hath committed that which hath caused the Supreme Paradise, the Most Exalted Garden, and this Pen whereby God hath subdued the hearts of His servants to lament. Hear ye the call of the Wronged One, then judge with fairness in this Cause which, when it dawned from the horizon of utterance, caused the Proof to cry out, “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having manifested me through Thy Most Exalted Pen,” and the Evidence to say, “Thanks be unto Thee, O Lord of Names, for having granted me victory in Thy days.” Woe unto him who hath denied Thy Cause and hath not attained unto the glory of Thy acceptance when the standards of Thy manifestation were unfurled. I beseech Thee to aid Thy servants to hold fast unto Thy cord and to be detached from all else besides Thee. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Qabl-i-’Askar! The supplication hath attained the presence of the All-Bountiful, through Whom the banner of Reality was raised and the standard of metaphor was lowered on this Day wherein they that are nigh unto God have soared in the atmosphere of the love of their Lord, the Lord of the Final End. We have mentioned thee and have revealed for thee that which attracteth the hearts and brighteneth the eyes. Soon shall that which thou seest today be changed, and there shall remain for thee what hath been inscribed by My Pen in this Tablet, before which all other tablets have bowed down in submission when it appeared. Beware lest the doubts of the suspicious ones or the oppression of the wrongdoers prevent thee from turning unto the Dawning-Place of verses. Cast aside what the people possess, by My Self-Subsisting Name, and take hold of this Book through which the fragrance of grace and favors hath been wafted.</p>
<p>In the Persian tongue, hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. Today the Sun of Truth is manifest, visible, dawning and shining before all faces, yet the people are heedless thereof and are attracted, oriented and clinging to vain imaginings and idle fancies. By the life of God! That which had never appeared in creation hath been made manifest, and at its appearance the Dawning-Places of knowledge and wisdom have bowed down in submission. To this testifieth every tongue that doubts have not held back from mention and utterance. Say: O people! Fear God, then return unto His traces. They verily guide you unto His path and make you independent of all else besides Him. He verily needeth not the mention of any other to prove His Cause. To this bear witness the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise, were ye of them that hear.</p>
<p>Today the people of Baha are souls whom tales have not debarred from the holy Kingdom of God. They behold His signs with their own eyes and hearken with their own ears unto His verses. Strive ye, that perchance ye may achieve some deed and be adorned with the ornament of acceptance and the light of His good-pleasure. His honor Niyaz, upon him be My Baha and loving-kindness, hath verily chosen for himself a station beneath the shade of My mercy, and in the nights and days hath been blessed with remembrance, praise and attainment unto His presence. We beseech God that through him His verses may be spread among His servants there. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The servant present before My face hath made mention of you on your behalf, and this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath been revealed from the heaven of Will especially for you, that you may give thanks unto your Lord, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. Convey My greetings to the loved ones in that land and say: This is the Day which He had aforetime announced and foretold, and His Cause hath been recorded by the Pen of Grace in the divine Books. This is the Day of this blessed verse wherein He hath said: “Say: God; then leave them to entertain themselves with their cavilings.” And it is the Day of another verse wherein all must arise before God’s Kaaba and utter these words: “I have abandoned a people who believe not in God and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter.” Apart from what hath been mentioned, none hath attained or shall attain unto true knowledge. Had the Shiite faction turned even slightly toward the Dayspring of Revelation with their sight and hearing, they would surely have attained unto that for which they were created to know. Glory be to God! Him Whose presence they sought by night and day and Whose remembrance they uttered, they now curse and revile from their pulpits. Such is the recompense of their deeds, manifested from the true, overwhelming Justice. A certain person in those regions from among the Sunnis claimed to be the Qa’im, and now nearly a hundred thousand souls have accepted him, while the people of Iran attained unto the true Qa’im and martyred Him. Thus hath God made the lowest among the servants highest, and the highest lowest. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful. At this moment a book from someone is present before My face wherein he hath mentioned the Afnan in unseemly terms. Say: God hath made his seclusion in this place his glory, and he would not exchange this glory for the glory of all the worlds. Say: Know with certain knowledge that their pride is not in commerce and amassing of wealth and that wherewith people occupy themselves, but rather in propagating this Most Great Announcement and this Manifest Cause. We beseech God to guide the speaker to recant. Verily, He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Qabl-i-’Askar! Say: O my God, my God, my Lord, my Support, my Goal and my Beloved! Praise and thanksgiving be unto Thee, and glory and radiance be upon Thee, inasmuch as Thou hast made Thyself known unto me, revealed unto me Thy path, and shown me from among Thy signs the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance, and from Thy remembrance the effulgences of the sun of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee, O Quickener of moldering bones, by Thy Most Great Name through which the dwellers of the graves arose when the One Who conversed on Sinai spoke forth, to make me steadfast in Thy love and firm in wisdom and utterance in the promotion of Thy Cause. O my Lord! Aid me to fulfill what Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book concerning righteousness and piety, and what Thou hast forbidden me regarding corruption, contention, tyranny and wickedness. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, standing at the door of Thy bounty and beseeching the wonders of Thy generosity and grace. Would the All-Bountiful withhold the suppliant from His door which He hath opened to all who are in His heaven and His earth? Nay, by Thy Self! This is not what the people of Baha expect of Thee, O Thou Lord of all men, Lord of the Throne on high and of the earth below, and Ruler of the Hereafter and of the world of old. Ordain for me through Thy grace that which shall make me independent of all else save Thee, and occupied with Thy remembrance. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O My Pen! Make mention of him who was martyred in the path of God in the early days, who was named Sul?an-’Ali and who attained the choice wine of revelation from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the All-Bountiful. I testify that he believed in God and acknowledged His Manifestation on a day wherein every remote scholar denied Him. Blessed art thou, O Sul?an, inasmuch as the All-Merciful hath made mention of thee from His glorious station. Glory be upon thee, radiance be upon thee, and exaltation be upon thee, O thou who didst hold fast to the cord of God, the Firm! The ocean of bounty surgeth in thy remembrance, the fragrance of mercy is wafted, and the verses of God, the Lord of all worlds, are sent down. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to send thee at all times a noble Book through the hands of them that are nigh unto Him, to shower upon thee mercy from His presence, and to provide thee with His wondrous eternal bounties and His everlasting paradisial feast. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou hearest the cry of the sincere ones, the lament of them that are nigh unto Thee, and the sighing of them that know Thee, when Thine enemies have encompassed them from every direction and there hath befallen them that which hath caused the dwellers of the cities of names to wail. I beseech Thee, O my God, by them and by those who have offered up their lives in Thy path and have expended all they possessed in their longing to meet Thee, to assist Thy loved ones with the hosts of the unseen and of the visible realm. Then protect them from the evil of every oppressive enemy and every wicked transgressor. O Lord! Deprive them not of the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty, nor of the effulgences of the daystar of Thy grace. Thou seest them, O my God, holding fast unto Thee and acknowledging that which hath been revealed from Thee. Verily Thou art with them, witnessing and beholding their deeds and their confession of Thy oneness, their acknowledgment of Thy unity, and that which Thou hast sent down in Thy Book. Thou art He, O my God, from Whose knowledge nothing escapeth, and the oppression of Thine enemies and the tyranny of the wrongdoers among Thy creatures cannot frustrate Thee. Thou art He through Whose name the standard of power was planted amidst all creatures and the banner of guidance was raised amongst all creation. I beseech Thee not to disappoint those who hope in Thee from the treasury of Thy bounty and the repository of Thy generosity. Then preserve them through Thy protection and Thy guardianship. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Triumphant, the Humbler of all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>

<p>This is the Surih of the Bedouins which hath been sent down from the presence of an Ancient One. He is the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most High, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>These are the verses of God which have been sent down in truth from the heaven of glorious and wondrous might. God hath made them a proof from His presence and a testimony from His court unto all the worlds. Therein He maketh mention of such servants of God as have recognized Him by His own Self, whom the howling of the idolaters did not deter, who have entered beneath the shadow of His loving-kindness and dwelt in the precincts of His mercy - that mercy which hath preceded all created things. This indeed is a mighty bounty. These are they upon whom the denizens of the Supreme Paradise and the angels of His nearness shower their prayers. These are they who, when the Sun of Eternity dawned once again from the horizon on high, fell prostrate upon their faces before God, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
<p>O ye who are beloved of God among the Bedouins! Hearken unto the call of God from this Tree which hath been raised up in truth and every leaf whereof proclaimeth in all things that “Verily I am God, there is no God but Him, the Most Holy, the Mighty, the Generous.” O people! Hasten ye to the Tree of God and seek shade beneath it. By the Truth of God! Should ye search throughout all regions of the heavens and earth, ye would find no place of security save beneath the shade of this Tree which hath been raised up over all mankind. Through its boughs wafteth the breath of God whereby every mouldering bone is quickened. Turn ye unto it and eat of its fruits that your hearts may be purified from the promptings of every wicked sinner.</p>
<p>Give thanks unto God for having protected you from the wilderness of self and passion, and for having delivered you from the depths of fancy and blindness on the Day whereon God came with the kingdom of His Cause and manifested His sovereignty over all who are in the heavens and on earth. He made Himself known unto you, revealed unto you His Beauty, conversed with you openly and manifestly, and made you to be numbered among His knowing servants.</p>
<p>Stand ye firm in the Cause, for Satan hath appeared with his hosts and commandeth you at every moment to deny God Who created you by His command and made you to be among the triumphant. Give praise unto God for having chosen you specially for Himself, inasmuch as when the Sun of Pre-existence withdrew from its native land, it rose from the horizon of Iraq, your land. This is of His bounty unto you, wherewith nothing in the heavens and earth can compare. The countenance of God was among you, shining and resplendent, without veil or covering, reciting unto you the verses of your Lord throughout months and years. The Ancient Beauty walked among you with the dignity and tranquility of God, revealing Himself unto you at every moment with a fresh revelation. Thus was the grace and mercy of God perfected upon you, that ye might be among the thankful ones.</p>
<p>It behooveth you to glory over all the tribes of the earth, for they have not attained unto that which ye have attained, if ye be of them that know. Therefore it behooveth you to acquire the attributes of God, that the sweet fragrances of holiness may waft from the direction of your hearts upon all created things, and that there may appear from you the signs of your Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate. And since He hath chosen you from among His creatures, strive that there may appear from you that which hath not appeared from others, that your special station with Him may be proven among the worlds.</p>
<p>Be ye as stars among the people of the earth, that through you the servants who are veiled from the knowledge of God and the Manifestation of His Cause, and who are among the heedless, may be guided. Be ye trustees of yourselves and of the people, and likewise of their possessions. This is a quality which God loved ere He created Adam from water and clay, and ye should […]</p>
<p>O trustees on earth! Neither you yourselves will find tranquility, nor will the people find repose in you. Thus doth God counsel you through the tongue of the Manifestation of His Cause–a remembrance unto you and unto all created things. Purge your hearts of envy and rancor, then your souls of tyranny and wickedness, then act according to what God hath commanded you. He hath commanded His servants naught save what is better for them than all the treasures of the heavens and earth. Beware lest ye dispute with anyone concerning that which hath been created in this world. Leave such things to their owners that your souls may find rest and ye may be wholly devoted to your Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. The Kingdom of wealth lieth in the hand of your Lord, the All-Merciful. He enricheth whomsoever He willeth through His command, for He is the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Know ye that God hath entrusted the earth to the hands of kings and made them the manifestations of His power amongst all created things, should they enter beneath the shadow of the Tree of His Cause. Apart from this, the matter resteth in His hands. He doeth what He pleaseth and ordaineth what He willeth. He hath never desired aught for Himself. He hath consigned the world and its adornments to its people, and hath sanctified His loved ones from turning unto it, for He desireth for them only that which endureth through the eternity of His exalted and mighty Self. What He desireth of the world is the hearts of His loved ones, that He may purify them from all else besides Him and raise them to the station of security–a station wherein they shall behold naught save the effulgences of His countenance and wherein naught shall be mentioned save My mighty and wondrous remembrance. O people! Open ye the cities of men’s hearts with the sword of the tongue, in the name of your Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Bountiful. Thus hath the Tongue of the All-Merciful commanded you aforetime, and now commandeth you to act as ye have been bidden, transgressing not the bounds set by God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Beware lest ye dispute with anyone concerning the Cause of God, for We have lifted the law of the sword and have ordained victory through wisdom and utterance, as a bounty from Us to all created things. O people! Be ignited with the fire of the love of God, that the hearts of men may be set ablaze thereby. This, verily, is the true victory, could ye but know it. He hath ever been sanctified above this world and all that hath been created therein and thereon. Were He to will it, He would subdue the earth and all that are upon it through His Name, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. O people! Be ye dyed with the dyeing of God and shun the dyeing of the idolaters. God commandeth you to be righteous and God-fearing. Fear ye God in matters of religion and commit not tyranny and wickedness. Be ye of them from whose faces shine forth the lights of your Lord, the Chosen One, and from whom are manifested the signs of God and His dignity. Thus doth it behoove you, O people of Baha, in these grievous days. O Arabs! Hear ye My call, then walk in My footsteps, then remember the days of meeting Me and attaining My presence, then My exile and estrangement and My imprisonment, that God may remember you in His Kingdom of mighty glory. Abandon the cup of extinction proffered by those who follow the dictates of self and passion, then take the cup of everlasting life from the fingers of Baha in the name of your Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, in this last revolution, whereby souls shall become independent of all the worlds.</p>
<p>O Pen of Eternity! Make mention of Our Arab servants whom God hath singled out for Thyself and caused them to gaze toward the direction of Thy mercy and severed them from the idolaters, that they may rejoice within themselves and remain steadfast in the Cause at which the heaven of aversion was rent asunder and every lofty and towering mountain was crushed. Say: O people! We informed you at the time of Our departure from Iraq that the Samiri would appear and the Calf would cry out and the birds of night would stir after the setting of the Sun. Beware lest ye forget the words of God. Abide beneath an impregnable protection. By God, O Arabs! Were ye to behold Me, ye would not recognize Me, for the black musk hath turned white through successive tribulations, and the Alif of the Cause hath appeared in the form of Dal through continuous trials, and this radiant and crimson Face hath turned yellow.</p>
<p>O Arabs! Forget not My remembrance, My tribulation, My grief and My trials. By My life! Mine eyes rain down tears and My heart lamenteth for My soul amidst these idolaters. By God! The Beauty of the Divine Will hath been altered through the oppression of the enemies, and the Temple of Volition hath come to rest upon ashes, and Destiny hath rent the garments of patience, and Fate hath been prevented from its execution by reason of what hath befallen the Most High God in His latter Manifestation at the hands of the hosts of the wicked. Thus hath the matter been decreed, if ye be of them that hear. Is there any helper who will assist the Beauty of God with his tongue and protect the Temple of His Cause from the swords of the people of the Bayan, and be of them whom the veils of names have not hindered from entering this Most Great Ocean, this wise Remembrance? And is there any kinsman who will show mercy unto this Wronged One and stand firm in His support and detach himself from all else but Him?</p>
<p>O Arabs! He who was powerless to speak in My presence hath now risen up to slay Me, after We created him and reared him and taught him and protected him for months and years. By God! Were I to recount unto you the tales of Joseph of Eternity and what befell Him at the hands of the wolves of hatred, ye would surely detach yourselves from your own souls and spirits and repair to the wilderness and lament until your spirits depart from your bodies. However, We have restrained the Pen from utterance to protect your souls, O concourse of the sincere ones!</p>
<p>O Arabs! Bewail ye My loneliness and My exile and My imprisonment and My tribulation, and be not of the heedless. They whom God hath made an example in the earth have risen in opposition in such wise as hath left the Pen of all worlds powerless to recount. O Arabs! Hearken unto My words and draw not nigh unto them from whom the stench of faithlessness is wafted. Shun such as these and abide beneath an impregnable protection. Thus doth the Beauty of the All-Merciful command you at a time when sorrows have encompassed Him through the hosts of Satan, if ye be of them that know. And the radiance that hath shone forth from the realm of eternity be upon you, O people of Baha, throughout the everlasting dominion of the Almighty, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>

<p>Praise be to the Beloved of the world, that at this hour, when the sun is setting, the effulgent rays of the Sun of Divine love have arrived in the form of a letter. In this station, no mention of joy and delight, nor any measure or limit, is befitting. It was not a letter, but rather a volume; nay, by the life of our Purpose and your Purpose, it was a manifest Book in its mention of love and steadfastness, and in its praise and glorification of the Lord of all beings. Moreover, by the life of our Beloved and your Beloved, were the letter to be pressed, the true spiritual fragrance that was gathered from the roses of the garden of inner meanings would drip drop by drop, bestowing fresh life upon the soul, for it was sanctified above the conditions of the earthly world and possessed the meanings of the true Paradise. Blessed be your pen, and blessed be your ink, and blessed be your tablet! At that very moment it was brought before His presence, and He uttered that which, compared to the flow of its mysteries, the ocean is but a drop, and before the effulgence of its words’ radiance, the sun appears but an atom. In all conditions, We beseech and implore the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted, that He may at every moment increase that ocean of love and join to it infinite seas, until the word “there is naught on earth save the ocean of His mercy” may be unveiled and be made manifest in the world of creation.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O Thou Who kindlest the hearts of them that yearn after Thee with the fire of Thy love, and Who drawest nigh unto the hearts of them that are brought near unto Thee through the sweet melodies of the Dove of Thy affection! I beseech Thee by the Manifestations of Thy signs, and the Daysprings of the lights of Thy Revelation, and by that which is hidden in Thy knowledge, to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty upon him who hath found Thee that which will cool his eyes, and tranquilize his heart, and give rest to his being, that the affairs of the world and what the nations possess may not trouble him. Then assist him, O my God, through the signs of Thy power and the manifestations of Thy sovereignty. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Commander, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O my God! Bestow Thy blessings upon Thy Prophets and Messengers who did not break Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, each of whom Thou didst make a guide for Thy servants unto the Supreme Paradise and the Most Exalted Heaven. Verily, Thou art He Whom no matter can harm nor can anything profit. At times Thou withholdest in accordance with the requirements of Thy wisdom, and at times Thou givest through Thy grace and bounty. I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, to protect Thy trusted servant who is named Muhammad in the Kingdom of Thy names, and whom Thou hast made one of the Two Most Great Names in Thy Book. I implore Thee, O Thou the Goal of the hearts of the sincere ones, to make the whole world, with all that is created therein, a helper unto him, an assistant unto him, mindful of his remembrance, oriented toward his orientation, and speaking with his utterance in Thy praise and glorification. O Lord! Thou seest him so devoted in his love for Thee that the pen is powerless to mention it, the tablet to encompass it, and the tongue to express it. That which cannot be mentioned befitteth him, for he is Thy servant, and Thou art He Who cannot be described, that He might be spoken of in this Most Holy and Most Exalted Station, and this Most Holy and Most Glorious Remembrance. There is none other God but Thee, the Lord of all beings, and the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below.</p>
<p>And furthermore, O essence of my heart and soul! This evanescent servant knoweth not what to say, having fallen into a world wherein he beholdeth the attributes of that Beloved One in such wise that no word is capable of describing them, nor qualified to define them. I swear by the Sun of utterance which hath shone forth from the most exalted station in all the world that no word can clothe the meaning of love for that Beloved One, nor can it reveal, indicate, describe or guide. Rather, in this station words remain silent, nay, prostrate, uttering only “I am the weakest of the weak.” The ocean of inner meanings–that is, the ocean of love for that Beloved One–surgeth in this station. In truth, after the letter was presented in His presence, there flowed from the tongue of His Holiness, the Ever-Present One–may our spirits be sacrificed for His sake–in this station that which causeth all oceans to appear as mere drops. I beseech God–exalted be His glory and abundant be His favors–to protect that blessed being and to manifest him through His Own Name, that he may arise to serve throughout all his days and occupy himself with that which beseemeth him, even as he hath been and is. To this beareth witness every learned one and every mystic endowed with insight from God, our Lord and your Lord, our God and your God, our Goal and the Goal of the hearts of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>Another matter to present is that previously a letter arrived from his honor Ali, upon him be the peace of God, wherein he wrote in detail about the tribulations and compulsory difficulties of that Beloved One. And verily, what they have written is true. Glory be to God! This too hath been and is among the requirements of the wisdom of God, exalted be His glory. That Beloved One’s affairs are referred to Him and entrusted to Him. Whatsoever hath occurred or may occur, assuredly no harm can be seen therein, for the very atoms of creation testify to the sincerity of that Beloved One and to the sanctity and purity of that Beloved One’s heart. In any case, your tribulations have greatly affected his honor Ali, upon him be the peace of God. He mentioned them in such wise that at that moment tears were shed and the heart was set ablaze. Through all the tongues of creation, I have beseeched and do beseech God, exalted be His glory, to transform into good all that hath appeared or may appear, and to adorn and illumine it with contentment. He is the Omnipotent One, to Whose power all the pens of the world and tongues of the nations have borne and do bear witness.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Ordain for the people of unity that which befitteth Thy loftiness, O Lord of all mankind! Thou art He Who hath adorned Thy mentioned servant with the ornament of Thy grace, the fire of Thy love, and the light of Thy knowledge. Increase, O my God, through Thy bounty and generosity, that which Thou hast given him at all times. There is no God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.</p>
<p>Unto the friends of that land, upon them be the peace of God and His grace and glory and splendor, one and all do I send greetings. God the One is witness that His Honor Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’l-Husayn, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory, holds a place in my heart and dwells in my soul. In all conditions do I beseech and continue to beseech from the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted, health and protection and loftiness and ascendancy for him. He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty. And likewise unto the beloved of my soul, His Honor Aqa Siyyid Yahya, upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of all beings, do I extend greetings, and I beseech for him that which is everlasting and eternal. Further, His Honor Ghulam, upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of all names, is before my eyes and ever remembered. I implore the True One, exalted be His glory, to aid him in all conditions to mention and praise and serve Him. Unto his honor ’Ali-A?ghar, upon him be the peace of God, who in truth is known as Akbar before the Divine Countenance, do I waft the fragrances of grace from the dawning-place of bounty, and I beseech confirmation for him. Further, His Honor Aqa ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of Power, together with His Honor Mirza, upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven, do I mention with the flame of the fire of love and the light of affection. Their abode, according to what they mentioned, is elsewhere. That spiritual beloved must send this remembrance which is in truth characterized by that which is unfitting and unseemly, that they may know they have not departed from the heart of this evanescent servant, and in the days of their absence they are manifest and present. Although that beloved and the friends are not present, yet His Honor the beloved of the heart, Aqa Ahmad, upon him be the glory of God, is present on behalf of all. And among the wondrous coincidences which in truth was due to their sincerity of intention and that of His Honor the revered beloved, His Honor the father, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, is that they now reside in the house facing the house of Bahji - that is, the house where previously his honor the Overseer, upon him be the glory of God, resided. In view of the weakness of some, they were commanded to dwell here for some time for a change of air. Night and day they attain the honor of hearkening to verses and kindly counsels and generous exhortations. This is naught but the result of their acceptance and steadfastness and stations. The seal of the letter is adorned with mention of the light of the loved ones, His Honor ’Ali, one of the most exalted, upon him be the glory of God and the splendor of the worlds. In truth his letter is genuine musk. Praise be to God, the fragrance of their love is diffused. I beseech from the True One, glorified be His majesty, to send down bounty and blessing and mercy from the heaven of grace. God knows the intention of that beloved and them is to serve the people of unity and to exalt His Cause. Assuredly whatsoever is required by divine wisdom and knowledge hath been and will be made manifest. Peace and remembrance and glory be upon your honor and his honor and upon those who hold fast to that which is right and to the fear of God, our Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne.</p>
<p>=== END BH00611 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00612 ===</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! This servant of Thine hast Thou stripped of the garment of Thy Divinity and distanced from the gardens of nearness to Thy Lordship. Thou hast removed from him the robes of understanding fashioned from the wonders of Thy knowledge through the gems of Thy decree that befell him, and divested him of the shirt of certitude wrought of the essence of Thy wisdom through the swords of Thy retribution that descended upon him. Thou hast made him seek Thee through Thyself, turn to Thine Essence through Thine Essence, and gaze upon the hem of Thy countenance through Thy direction. Thou hast imprisoned him in the prison of earthly dominion by Thy power and sealed against his face the doors of grace by Thy might.</p>
<p>All this descended upon him in such wise that the heavens were rent asunder at comprehending it, the earth shook at its occurrence, the spirits were troubled at hearing it, the waters ceased their flow, beings were brought to naught at its execution, essences were demolished at its reckoning, and the sun was darkened by what befell it. Yet he sits before Thee at a time when he finds no helper, no supporter, no companion, and no friend. He is among people yet not of them, speaks with servants though not being one of them, sits with them while not desiring them, and walks among them though loving them neither secretly nor openly.</p>
<p>All this appeared solely through the measures of Thy Cause, the resources of Thy wisdom, and the tokens of Thy abasement which Thou ordained for Thy guides and decreed for Thy loved ones. Yet, O my God, after Thou didst clothe me in the garment of poverty and abasement and dressed me in the raiment of sorrow and anguish, Thou didst comfort me through inspiring me that all this flowed only from the subtlety of Thy grace and the precision of Thy gift. Even as Thou showed me the creation of the heavens of Thy Cause, how Thou raised them by the sovereignty of Thy power and ordained therein brilliant stars and manifest planets, decreeing for them neither setting nor eclipse. All revolve in the heaven of Thy direction, moving through the cycles of Thy ordainment and sanctification, illumined by the dawning rays of the sun of Thy Self-Subsistence and brightened by the flashing lights of the moon of Thy holiness, moved by Thy command and circling round Thee, such that they are untouched by what befalls the suns in the heavens of Thy holy oneness and what descends upon the moons in the horizon of the cloud-veiled heaven of Thy glorification through the eclipses of Thy decree and the settings of Thy execution.</p>
<p>All this stemmed only from the hidden aspects of Thy wisdom and the conditions of Thy glorious sovereignty, and this is among that which appeared from Thy timeless action and Thy mighty handiwork, and what resembles it from what Thou hast manifested from the treasuries of Thy power and the storehouses of Thy might. Thus dost Thou plant the tree of Thy singleness in the sacred soil of Thy will and preserve it through the sovereign of Thy grace in these nights and days by the hands of Thy generosity. Thou sendest upon it the breaths of Thy eternal holiness and waterest it from the rivers of the camphor of Thy glorious oneness, guarding it with the hosts of the unseen which none can reckon save Thee, until Thou hast raised high its branches and boughs, brought forth the fruits of Thy identity, and caused it to put forth leaves through the wonders of Thy favors and blessings. After Thou didst raise it to the highest horizon and cause it to ascend to the most exalted kingdom, children gather around it and stone it so that there might fall upon them its fruits from the paradise of Thy eternality and there might descend from it the fruits of the bounty of Thy mercy. All this befalls it because of its fruits, for verily a tree without fruit none desires […]</p>
<p>In the name of God! No soul shall draw nigh unto it, nor shall there descend upon it the misfortunes of abasement and what is beneath them. Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee! How wondrous are the marvels of Thy handiwork, and how sweet are the manifestations of Thy craftsmanship! Thou hast ever humbled Thy loved ones through what Thou hast ordained for them of the conditions of Thy might, and Thou wilt ever exalt Thine enemies through what Thou hast decreed for them of the retribution of Thy sovereign power. Thou hast concealed the wisdom of this from the eyes of Thy servants and hidden its pearls in the shells of Thy power in the seas of Thy grandeur, such that none save Thee should become aware thereof.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Despite my recognition of all this and my certitude in all that Thou hast taught me of the wonders of the craftsmanship of Thy heavens of ordainment, the ornaments of the movements of the cycles of Thy sovereign handiwork, and the revolutions of the pillars of the manifestations of Thy glorious might, I am consumed by the fire whose ember sets ablaze all existence, and I weep tears from which all the seas find their essence. How could it be otherwise, after I heard the call of one of Thy loved ones whom Thou didst love in the privacy of Thy mystery, unknown to any soul? He cried out before Thee with such a cry that the hearts of existence were set aflame, and he lamented with such a lamentation that the spirits of the ethereal beings in the palaces of manifest glory were troubled, and the life of the secluded ones in the chambers of heaven before the countenance of the All-Praised was transformed. The seas of grandeur grew still from their waves in the depths of the seas of the Divine Essence, falling into repose. The winds of love were cut off from the gardens of the holy and beloved One, as Thou didst will to make him drink from the springs of separation and remove him from the throne of intimate communion, after Thou hadst filled his heart with the essence of Thy rapture, the pure substance of Thy attraction, the splendor of Thy love, and the radiance of Thy glory.</p>
<p>Thou didst call him through Thy mystery to the thrones of Thy nearness, and hasten him through Thy call to the arenas of Thy reunion and meeting. Thou didst cause him to dwell in the vicinity of Thy mercy and gave him to drink of the pure wine of Thy favor from the hands of Thy generosity. Thou didst make him taste the sweetness of Thy remembrance from the fruits of the tree of Thine eternity, and caused him to hear, through the inner realities of existence, the melodies of the dove of Thy mighty heaven and the doves of Thy glorious kingdom.</p>
<p>Judge then, O my God, and be fair, O my Beloved, at this moment - how can anyone bear this, or how can anyone endure this? How befitting is it for Thy sovereignty to treat anyone as Thou hast treated him through the wonders of Thy deeds, or to send down upon any soul what Thou hast sent down upon him of the gems of Thy wisdom? Yet, O my God, since he gazeth upon Thy mercy, prostrateth himself before Thy countenance, is content with Thy decree, and is patient in the circumstances of Thy Cause, I call upon Thee now with his call before Thee […]</p>
<p>O my God! In his separation, make for me a means of attaining unto Thy presence, and in meeting him, grant me the attainment of Thy covenant. Cause him to return unto Thee as Thou didst cause him to return the first time, and bring him back as Thou didst bring him back before. Verily Thou art the Originator of all things and their Return, the Restorer of all things and their Haven. Thou art, verily, powerful over whatsoever Thou lovest, and Thou art the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.</p>
<p>Then, O my God, make him steadfast in Thy love, patient in Thy good-pleasure, yearning for Thy union and Thy meeting, walking in the paths of Thy paradise, and treading the ways of Thy good-pleasure. This station is greater than the creation of the heavens and earth, such that no other station can equal it, no matter can parallel it, and nothing can compare with it, neither in the heaven of Thy mercy’s tender affections, nor in the realm of Thy power’s majestic manifestations. For this is the station which Thou hast specially ordained for the sincere ones among Thy loved ones and the near ones among the people of Thy affection - they who behold none but Thee, who turn to none but Thee, who trust in none but Thee, who find intimacy with none save Thy beauty, who immerse themselves in naught but the seas of Thy good-pleasure, who breathe not except by Thy leave, and who speak not except by Thy command.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou! Glorified art Thou! How exalted are the wonders of Thy mercy upon them, how sublime are the jewels of Thy favors concerning their station! How pure are the essences of Thy generosity in their inmost hearts and their outward beings, their visible and their hidden aspects, their beginning and their end, their origin and their return! Thus dost Thou exalt whom Thou willest, elevate whom Thou willest, love whom Thou willest, and do what Thou willest unto whom Thou willest. Within Thy grasp lies the kingdom of all things. Thou orderest them according to Thy measure and Thy decree. Verily, Thou art the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>Therefore, O my God, send Thy blessings upon Him Who raised the pavilions of Thy grandeur through Thy celestial might, Who manifested the tabernacle of Thy loftiness through Thy divine power, Who sat upon the throne of Thy Lordship and reclined upon the couch of Thy Divinity, Who was seated at the right hand of Thy power, before Thy might, to the south of Thy grandeur and to the north of Thy loftiness. Thou didst make Him the Supreme Ruler over all Thy names and attributes in the kingdom of Thy Command, and the Self-Subsisting, the Transcendent One in the heaven of Thy creation, through all that Thou art able and dost love. Verily, Thou art the Most Exalted, the All-Subduing, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Luminous.</p>

<p>O Ismail! Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Most Sublime Horizon and attained the presence of the Wronged One, from Whom all have turned aside except such as God, the Lord of the hereafter and of the former generations, and the Lord of the Mighty Throne, hath willed. Give thanks unto God for this most great favor. He will assist thee to recognize Him and hath drawn thee nigh unto Him at a time when every learned one hath objected to Him. Let not the circumstances of the prison sadden thee. Be thou confident in the grace of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>The names which thou didst send have been presented before the Wronged One, and We have revealed for each one of them that which will bring solace to the eyes and tranquility to the hearts. Yet most of the people remain heedless.</p>
<p>We make mention of Ha preceding Sin, and give him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and mercy which have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. O Husayn! Hearken unto the call of the Prisoner. He maketh mention of thee in such wise as cannot be equaled by the ornaments of the world nor by that which the nations possess. He Who possesseth the mighty Book beareth witness unto this. We have inhaled the fragrance of thy love and have turned unto thee, and We have heard thy call and have answered thee with this perspicuous Tablet. Say: O peoples of the earth! Fear ye God and deny not Him Who hath come unto you with His power and sovereignty, and with that wherewith every trusted Messenger hath come. Beware lest the veils of the divines shut you out from the Creator of heaven. Cast away what ye possess, turning unto the Most Sublime Horizon, the station wherein the Lord of Names proclaimeth: “There is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” Blessed art thou, O Husayn, for having hearkened unto My sweetest call and having turned thy face toward thy Lord, the Lord of all mankind, and for having taken hold of His Book in His Name while every ignorant doubter cast it behind him. Say: O concourse of divines! By God, through you have the sighs of the Prophets ascended and the tears of the sincere ones been shed. Cast away what ye possess, then hearken unto that which the Speaker of Sinai uttereth in this Revelation. He guideth you unto the straight path of God.</p>
<p>And We make mention of Mahdi and give him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and bounty, and guide him unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Be thou thankful unto God for having aided thee and caused thee to know Him and enabled thee to hear this wondrous call. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord’s loving-kindness and cleave unto His resplendent hem. Let not the affairs of men sadden thee. Leave them to themselves, turning unto the One, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>And We make mention of Ahmad, whom We have mentioned before with verses that cannot be equaled by the books of the world, and from which everyone possessed of a sense of smell can detect the fragrance of the garment of his Lord, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who hath been named ’Abdu’llah and give him glad tidings as We gave him tidings before, that he may rejoice and be of them that are thankful. O ’Abdu’llah! Be not grieved by the people and their utterances and that which proceedeth from their mouths. God shall soon return them to the lowest station, and ye shall behold yourselves in an exalted station. Read thou what We have sent down unto thee before and remind the people with wisdom and utterance of this Cause whereby the earth hath been cleft asunder and the heaven hath been rent and every lofty mountain laid low. Say: O concourse of divines! By God, the Truth, ye are the tyrants and the idols, and ye are they by whom the Maiden hath lamented in the Most Exalted Paradise and the Apostle in the Supreme Concourse, and by whom the eyes of them that are nigh have shed tears. Through you hath every possessor of a heart wailed, and every possessor of eyes wept, and every possessor of a tongue cried out, and the pillars of a lofty throne have quaked. Soon shall ye know what ye have wrought and shall recognize what hath escaped you in the days of God, the Mighty, the Praised. Say: Where are the divines of the Torah and the idols who pronounced judgment against Muhammad, the Apostle of God, of old? And where are the Pharisees who pronounced judgment against the Spirit when He came with a light that illumined the horizons and every noble station? Ye have forsaken what is right and chosen what is wrong. Thus have your souls enticed you. He, verily, is the All-Numbering, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>And We make mention of Shaykh-Qabil-Muhammad and counsel him to manifest supreme steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of the mystics have slipped. O Muhammad! The One, the Single, maketh mention of thee and commandeth thee to that which will exalt the Cause of God and thy station. He, verily, is the Counsellor, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Cleaver of the Dawn and Sender of the Winds, for having remembered me in the prison when I was in the hands of the heedless. I beseech Thee by Thy Name whereby the world hath been illumined that Thou disappoint me not from the ocean of Thy mercy and the sun of Thy bounty. Thou art, verily, powerful over what Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who hath been named Ilyas and cast upon him of the verses of his Lord that he may arise to make mention on this Day wherein clamor hath been raised from every quarter by reason of what the transgressors have wrought against the loved ones of God, the Goal of the sincere. Beware lest the sayings of men hold thee back from the truth. Leave what they possess, holding fast unto the cord of God, the Most Strong.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who hath been named Ghulam-Qabil-Rida and bid him to that which hath been sent down in the Book from the presence of One mighty, ancient. This is a day wherein the wrongdoers have denied the right of God and His Cause, and have broken His covenant and His testament. Thus have the vanities of this world deluded them. Lo! They are in thick veils. O Ghulam! Rejoice thou in that the Lord of the worlds maketh mention of thee from the precincts of His Most Great Prison and commandeth thee to manifest beautiful patience in this mighty Cause.</p>
<p>O Kingdom of Utterance! Make mention in the Tablet of My servants who have detached themselves from all else but God, clinging to the hem of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. O people of Baha in the kingdom of creation! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven. He, verily, maketh mention of you and giveth you glad tidings of what He hath ordained for you, and consoleth you concerning what hath befallen you at the hands of those who have denied the proof of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen.</p>
<p>O ’Aziz! Hearken unto that which the Dove of the Cause warbleth in the Supreme Paradise: He is, verily, none other than the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. We have made mention of thee in numerous Tablets, and likewise of those whose lamentations We hear in the land of Ta by reason of what hath befallen them in the path of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named ’Ali, who held fast to My cord in the earliest days and spoke My Name among My servants. He is, verily, of the people of Mine Ark, as attested by the Mother Book with Me and every inscribed Tablet. Rejoice thou in the sweet savors of My Revelation and in the fragrance that hath wafted from the raiment of thy wronged Lord. That which thou didst send hath reached Our presence, and We have heard thy call and found the fragrance of thy love in this praiseworthy station.</p>
<p>We make mention of Kazim, who believed in God when the world turned away save whom thy Lord, the Lord of creation, did will. We have remembered thee in the Most Great Prison and in other lands with verses that draw nigh the honored servants. Blessed art thou for having turned to the Supreme Horizon and attained My Preserved Tablet.</p>
<p>O people of Kha! Rejoice in that the Dawning-Place of Revelation and the Dayspring of the verses of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, hath turned towards you. We have remembered every city that hath been illumined by the lights of remembrance, and every village wherefrom hath wafted the fragrance of My love, the Mighty, the Beloved. We have praised every spot wherein the mention of God was raised, and every servant who hath testified to that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath testified: that there is none other God but Me, the One Who doeth what He willeth through My word “Be” and it is.</p>
<p>O concourse of loved ones! We make mention of My Name, the Wronged One, Who was imprisoned in the land of ?a for having summoned the people unto God, the Lord of all kings. And We make mention of ’Ali-Akbar who spoke the truth when questioned about this Most Great Announcement concerning which all are in dispute. And We make mention of My chosen ones and My loved ones who turned toward the Prison through that which the hands of every heedless one had wrought. By God’s life! These are the people of the Crimson Ark, though the people perceive it not. They are servants whom the blame of the blamer hath not deterred in the path of God, nor have the veils of every unknown scholar hindered them - they who warred against God and pronounced judgment against His chosen ones without any clear proof or manifest Book.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Conclude this Tablet with the mention of him who turned to My horizon and set his face toward My countenance, who arose to serve My Cause and traveled through the lands to exalt My Name and raise My Word aloft, and who bore in My path that which none knoweth save My all-pervading Self, the Witness of all that is seen and unseen. Blessed is he, and blessed is his father who cast away the world in his longing to attain the presence of the Ancient King, who traversed land and sea until he reached the Prison and stood before the Gate, and heard the call from the Dayspring of Glory, and received from the hand of His bounty His sealed nectar.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Muhammad! Behold and remember when thou wert in the presence of the Throne and didst hear the call of God, the Self-Subsisting, and didst witness His most exalted horizon and drink from the ocean of His hidden favors. We were with thee when thou didst speak My Name and guide the servants to My straight path. Convey My greetings to those who have turned with radiant faces toward their imprisoned and lonely Lord. By My life! Soon shall all that the people possess perish, while the dominion of earth and heaven shall remain with the chosen ones of God, the Lord of this frequented House.</p>
<p>We make mention of the handmaidens who turned away from the dawning-places of ignorance and faced the Dayspring of knowledge. Blessed are ye, O My handmaidens, for having inhaled the fragrance of the Divine Robe when every mighty one, puffed up with pride, turned away therefrom. The glory shining from the horizon of My heaven of grace be upon My loved ones and friends, and upon My handmaidens and leaves who have held fast to the cord of My firm decree. And praise be to God, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>He is the Mighty, the Wondrous!</p>
<p>O Mahdi! I have sent down and dispatched unto thee luminous and holy Tablets, that perchance thou mightest be illumined by their light and cause all men to be brightened and enlightened thereby. Haply might the murk of this world of clay and the promptings of the denizens of hell be erased from the hearts of the people of the highest heaven, that they might face the holy rays of the Sun of inner meanings and be illumined by its wondrous effulgence. Yet despite this supreme bounty and this most great favor, thou didst not bestir thyself, as though not even a drop appeared from thee. And afterward I sent flaming and fiery Tablets, in every letter of which was concealed the call “Verily I am God”, that perchance thou mightest hearken unto the sweet melodies of the All-Glorious and the exalted trills of the All-Merciful, and the moisture of thy lethargy and the dampness of thy torpor might be brought to boil by their heat, and thou mightest raise such a cry from thy soul that would cause the dwellers of the highest Kingdom and the lands of creation to cry out, and through thy yearning lamentation they would hasten to reunion with their Beloved. From that too We saw no fruit and heard no trace. And in all these degrees, I swear by the Beauty of the All-Glorious, there hath been and shall be no purpose save the ascension of veiled souls to the divine and holy heights. I am astonished how these holy and eternal breezes and these life-giving and merciful breaths have shown no effect and displayed no traces. Therefore, now once again I have sent this noble and holy leaf, adorned with holy and infinite signs, that perchance in this subsequent stage thou mightest make up for what thou didst neglect in the first. O Mahdi! With a weighty soul and an ailing frame, ascent to the holy and noble heaven of glory is impossible, and with broken wings, flight in the atmosphere of the forgiving Glory is impossible. Therefore, cast away from thyself, through divine strength, whatsoever thou hast borne that hath caused the weariness of thy soul, that perchance after this supreme lightening thou mightest enter the most exalted court of glory and the most resplendent fields of holiness.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Every matter requires proof and every claim demands evidence. The token of those who are detached is nearness to the realms of the Manifest Lord, and the sign of the enraptured lover is orientation toward the sanctified seats of the Traceless One. The intent of this nearness has never been to traverse the path with infirm feet; rather, that nearness which has been and ever shall be sanctified from all directions is what is meant and intended. Although not every eye is worthy to gaze upon the Countenance of the All-Glorious, nay all are forbidden, for the Ancient King has, on account of the deceit of the deceivers and the craftiness of the crafty, veiled the Manifest Beauty in such wise that none is granted the honor of attainment unto His presence, nor permitted to drink from the cup of nearness, save whom thy Lord willeth.</p>
<p>But thou, O Mahdi, hearken with the ear of thy soul unto My wondrous counsels and act upon them with utmost diligence, for the cloud of My gracious favors hath not been withheld from thee, nor have the outpourings of the ocean of My bounty been cut off. Beware, beware, lest through the breaths of the malevolent ones thou deprive thyself of the sweet savors of My eternal glory. Beware, beware, lest thou veil thyself from the hand that holdeth the kingdom of all things and from the manifestation of His training, Who traineth all things and through Whom all things appear according to their relationship with Him.</p>
<p>Abide beneath the shade of sanctified grace and enter beneath the shadow of the training of the Beauty of Divine Unity. Consider the date stone: if the hand of men’s training should plant it in blessed and goodly soil, ere long a tree will appear, and lofty and wondrous fresh dates will become manifest and visible. Now if thou shouldst regard this with an eye that seeth no end, thou wouldst behold this tree and its fruits unto an end that hath no end, for from a single date stone a hundred thousand dates become manifest. Now that a hundred thousand stones have appeared, how can the fruits thereof have any end? However, had that first stone been cast upon barren and unsuitable ground, none of these fruits and trees and branches would have appeared in the realm of being.</p>
<p>Therefore, O Mahdi, surrender the seed of thy being to the control of God’s conquering and omnipotent hand, that He may plant it in the blessed and holy soil of His paradise, that from it may appear everlasting branches, eternal boughs, and never-ending fruits. But observe with keen sight and delicate vision that if a fresh date be planted, it will yield no fruit, for it hath not been divested of its outer garment and hath not been detached from whatsoever pertaineth to this world. Yet when the bare and detached stone returneth to the soil of the Lord of Lords, it is therefore blessed with these supreme honors and countless fruits.</p>
<p>Therefore, O Mahdi, enter barefoot into the sanctified court of Divine Unity, and purified from all else, arrive at the station of eternal glory. This is the counsel of the Merciful Lord unto His servant. O Mahdi! Say: God; then leave them to their vain disputations. At last, send forth from thy soul one selfless breath for the sake of the Beloved, and dispatch from thy grief-stricken heart one sorrowful sigh, detached from attachment to all things, to the paradise of the Lord of the worlds. How long wilt thou remain occupied with this and that, and be frightened by the words of troubled souls? I swear by God that they who seek My path hasten with assured steps to the seats of the All-Merciful. Purify and sanctify existence from the defilement of limitations and allusions, and with perfect tranquility enter the tabernacles of the Lord of all beings.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! On the tongues and in the mouths of the common people runs this saying: “Death comes but once, and lamentation but once - die once and begin life anew.” Be not grieved at divine destiny, nor distressed at His ordained decrees. I swear by My Beauty that the arrows of the Beloved’s decree have been and ever shall be dearer than all else that is desired, and the poison of His tribulation hath been and shall ever be sweeter to the palate of His true lover than any honey. Therefore be thou neither troubled by the blows that have befallen thee, nor distressed by the calamities that have descended, for after every darkest night hath followed the dawning of a brilliant morn. Plant thy feet firmly upon the straight path in such wise that all the world may become steadfast through thy steadfastness and attain unto certitude. This is the counsel of thy Lord, if thou be of them that hearken.</p>
<p>For the solace of thy heart, consider My tribulations, for from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end, none hath endured nor shall endure such afflictions. So manifest and evident hath My oppression become that the oppression of every oppressed one hath been erased from memory. At all times and seasons have the oppressors wreaked their tyranny upon this Manifest Beauty, yet did I conceal it until matters reached such a pass that the very essence of tyranny raised the standard of oppression and arose with utter guile, that perchance thereby the people might be deprived of the dawning-places of glory and the daysprings of eternal holiness. Thou well knowest that none hath ever comprehended, nor ever shall comprehend, the true nature of this Cause and its exaltation. Whosoever claimeth otherwise hath spoken falsehood against the Lord of Baha and is recorded among the liars in the Holy Tablets.</p>
<p>I mention one matter that thou mayest ponder it and shed tears of grief like the spring rain and holy clouds over My oppression. Consider then: What is the state of a mighty King Who taketh a handful of clay in His merciful hands, moisteneth it with the water of His grace, breatheth into it the spirit of life, and nurtureth it with the blessings of His bounty and the water of His mercy until their names become renowned throughout all lands and their mention famous in every region? Then the breezes of vainglory begin to blow and the winds of falsehood to stir, until it reacheth such a pass that certain souls divest themselves of the garment of the Desired One, and not content with this, raise objections against the Beauty of the Desired One and turn away from His proof.</p>
<p>Observe now how many afflictions and trials have befallen that King of the seen and unseen. I swear by the Beauty of the All-Glorious that what hath befallen this Beauty is a hundred thousand times greater than this, but the people perceive not. Nay, not content with these things, they have arisen to cut down the Divine Tree and have striven in this nefarious design with such intensity that it transcendeth description by tongue or pen. But God hath destroyed them for their plotting and will destroy them for what they plot.</p>
<p>Now all things are engaged in lamentation and weeping, while they rejoice in their seats. Such is the condition of this company. Furthermore, denial hath reached such a point that they seek to become a barrier between the Beauty of the All-Merciful and the people of creation, even as they have sent tablets of associating partners with God and embodiments of hatred to all lands, and forbidden all servants from approaching the direction of the All-Merciful and the Self-Subsisting. Thus have We recorded their deeds and mentioned them in the Tablet as a remembrance from Us to them that remember. And praise be to My Self, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory and greatness!</p>
<p>The divine verses have encompassed the world and the light of His grace has illumined the hearts of the unitarians. The orb of justice has risen and shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of supreme statecraft, yet the veils of heedless souls–that is, the turning away of those evil ones–have concealed its rays. What has been the cause of deprivation, and what the reason for prevention? There can be no doubt that the All-Bountiful Lord, exalted be His favor and magnificent His grace, created the world for the sole purpose of recognition and the manifestations of justice and fairness. The rain of His generosity has ever poured down and the verses of His grace have descended. In all things the banner of God’s power is raised, and in every station the standard of God’s might is unfurled. Nevertheless, the unitarians are seen to be weak and the polytheists strong, as witnessed when the cities of the people of divine unity were besieged and the artillery of the polytheists encompassed them. This is naught but the recompense of deeds and actions.</p>
<p>And the prayer shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of God’s mercy be upon the Essence of His creation, the Dawning-place of His signs, the Dayspring of His revelation and the Source of His Cause, through Whose light the world was illumined and in Whose name the nations were blessed. He it is through Whom every cause began and ended, and through Whom appeared the straight path of God and His mighty Command. But for Him no name among names would have appeared, nor any attribute among attributes. And upon His family and companions, whom the veils of the veiled ones prevented not, nor the might of the polytheists–they aided the Cause of God with true aid such that their might seized all in the world and their power encompassed all peoples. These are servants whom nothing whatsoever frightened and no mention barred. They arose from the horizon of power and conquered the cities of the wicked. Through them shone forth the light of unity and appeared the decree of detachment.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of the world and Goal of the nations! I beseech Thee by them and by what appeared through them in Thy path, to assist the people of unity in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Then aid them against those who have transgressed against them and seized their rights. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the servant received your letter. I read what was in it and presented it before His countenance. The Lord–may our souls be a sacrifice for Him–said: “We beseech God, exalted be He, to open before the faces of His servants the gate of His grace, to draw them nigh unto the ocean of His knowledge, to adorn them with that whereby His Cause may be exalted, and to ordain for them from the Supreme Pen the reward of the Hereafter and of the former time. He is, verily, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust. We bear witness that there is no God but Him, in acknowledgment of His oneness and in recognition of His singleness. He hath ever been mighty over all who are in earth and heaven. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. We send greetings from this station to Our loved ones and counsel them to wisdom and to that whereby the station may be exalted among the people.” End.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The blessing of love, which is accounted among the greatest of divine bestowals, exists - the world is ablaze with its fire and illumined by its light. When in equilibrium, it is the spirit animating all created things, but if it exceeds its bounds in the slightest degree, it brings destruction and obliteration. Glory be to God! Both the prosperity of the world stems from it and its ruin. What manner of creation is this, that all are bewildered by its description! Both the wailing of weeping rises from it, and boundless joy is made manifest through it. This servant beseeches and implores God - exalted be His glory - to bestow moderation upon His loved ones and to grant them the taste of the choice sealed wine. In one station, it is the guide and the channel of grace after the Prophets - peace be upon them. In another station it is the interpreter, and in yet another the expositor. Glory be to God! Its description cannot be completed by the pen. In all things this bounty is evident and manifest according to their measure, for all things point to God - exalted be His glory. Likewise from His handiwork are the pen and ink, though they cannot race in this field. The Command is in God’s hands - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>As to the mention made of Haji Siyyid Mahdi - upon him be God’s peace - his remembrance hath been accepted in the presence of the Lord. Let them recite this prayer, for verily it guideth unto the straight path of God.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, and directing myself to the Dawning-Places of Thy Revelation, the Sources of Thine inspiration, the Repositories of Thy knowledge and the Fountainheads of Thy commandments and laws. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue the world and guide the nations, and by Thy sovereignty that hath encompassed all things, and by Thy signs that have pervaded earth and heaven, and by those whose hearts were melted in Thy love and who gave up their spirits and all they possessed in Thy path, not to deny me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and destined for Thy trusted ones. O Lord! Thou seest the needy one standing before the gate of Thy favour, and the destitute one clinging to the cord of Thy bounty. Ordain for me that which befitteth the heaven of Thy generosity and the ocean of Thy grace. Thou art He to Whose exaltation and sublimity all created things have testified, and to Whose greatness and power all things possible have borne witness. O Lord! Send down from the clouds of Thy mercy’s heaven that which will draw us near unto Thee, then provide us with the best of what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. I testify, O my God, to Thy unity and singleness, and that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee. Thou hast ever been in the heights of majesty and power, and wilt ever be as Thou hast been from time immemorial. The conditions of creation do not weaken Thee, nor do the doubts of the people. Verily Thou art the Self-Subsisting One Whose hosts are not weakened by the armies of the world nor by the ranks of nations. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised. My God, my God! Thou seest the sinner who hath sought the ocean of Thy forgiveness, and the remote one who hath desired the horizon of Thy nearness and good-pleasure. I beseech Thee by the breathings of Thy verses and the breezes that waft from the direction of Thy loving-kindness, to aid me in Thy remembrance and praise, in turning to Thy horizon, in beholding Thy signs and in directing myself toward Thy verses. O God of the world! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Light, the Most Straight Path, to number me among those whom Thou hast described in Thy Book which Thou didst send down unto the Sovereign of Thy Messengers - they are honoured servants on whom no fear shall come, nor shall they grieve. Wilt Thou deny me, O my God, after I have hastened to the Euphrates of Thy mercy, and wilt Thou disappoint me, O my Purpose, after I have raised my suppliant hands to the heaven of Thy grace and Thy gifts? Nay, by Thy glory! This is not what I think of Thee. I testify that Thy door is open, Thy grace all-encompassing, and Thy mercy ever-precedent. Neither do the rejection of Thy servants prevent Thy generosity, nor the errors of those in Thy lands hinder Thy giving. Therefore forgive me through Thy grace and bounty, then aid me to serve Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! Divine favors are manifest and grace is resplendent. This evanescent servant beseeches the True One, exalted be His glory, to confirm them in that which is befitting and to aid them in His remembrance and praise, and in acknowledging that which the Supreme Pen hath spoken before the creation of earth and heaven. Verily, there is no God but Him. He begetteth not, nor is He begotten, and He hath taken neither consort nor son. God willing, may they drink of the choice wine of utterance, for whosoever attaineth unto it hath attained unto the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory. Had all the peoples of the world hearkened to the Word of Unity as it deserveth to be hearkened to, all would have turned unto God, detached from all else. The deceptive conditions and allusions of the world have debarred the nations from the most great bounty. Reward and punishment are two mirrors reflecting good and evil deeds which are manifested therein. By the mystery of existence I swear that had they acted according to the Book of God, exalted be His glory, the evident abasement witnessed today would not have come to pass. All must now raise their outer and inner hands to the heaven of bounty and grace of God, exalted be His station, with the utmost lowliness and supplication, and seek His help, that perchance none may remain deprived and forbidden from the ocean of awareness and knowledge. In brief, the recompense of people’s deeds hath held them back, but as the door of grace is open, it is hoped that the lamentations of the believers and the monotheists may prove effective and He may adorn the world with the ornament of justice and equity. The supplication is from the servants and the answer is from God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>To the honored and beloved H and S, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, I send greetings. Praise be to God, they have attained and their mention hath been made before the Lord. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to send down upon him from the heaven of grace the rains of mercy and bestowal. Verily He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His Word “Be” and it is. Likewise, to the honored and beloved K and R, upon him be the peace of God and His favors, and to the other friends, upon them be the peace of God, I send greetings and for each I seek confirmation and support. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer. Peace and praise be upon you and upon the sincere servants of God.</p>

<p>The City of God. O physician, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!</p>
<p>At all times doth the Book of God call out and declare: “O people of the earth! The True One, glorified be His majesty, hath sent Me down from His Kingdom of utterance that ye might all hold fast unto Me and find the path of salvation. Through Me is the straight path made clear and the evident proof established. Through My being hath the world been established, through Me are mysteries revealed and lights made manifest, the ocean of knowledge billoweth and the sun of wisdom shineth resplendent. O people of the glorious Faith and the radiant Law! Return ye unto the Truth and act according to Me. Today the monotheists must arise to make good what hath been lost, that perchance the departed glory might return, the fallen standard be raised again, and the banner of power be unfurled. But alas! Alas! For in the days when I was with the Interpreter and We came for the salvation of the world, the people of the earth were found heedless and remote, save for a few. And afterward, when the sword appeared, some turned to Him willingly or unwillingly. In truth, had the servants been enabled to act according to what was recorded in God’s Book by the Supreme Pen, the whole world would now be illumined with the light of unity. The results of deeds have weakened strength and transformed assurance into fear and trepidation.”</p>
<p>And peace and blessings be upon Him unto Whom God revealed the Book and sent Him for the guidance of creation until the Day of Return, through Whom was opened the gate of knowledge and understanding before all possibility, and through Whom spoke the Tongue of Grandeur: “Power and might belong to Me and to My friends.” And upon His family and companions, at whose might the world trembled and the skin of the nations shuddered. Through them was made manifest God’s power among His servants and His sovereignty over all lands - blessings eternal and everlasting.</p>
<p>Thereafter, O beloved of my heart, the servant hath been honored by your letter, which was an eloquent proof testifying to your sincerity and your devotion. It related what was hidden in the grieving heart. I beseech the Exalted One to assist your honor and to aid you with the means of the heavens and the earth. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>After reading and reflecting, proceeding to the Presence, achieving the honor of attentive listening, the Lord (may our souls be His sacrifice) said: “O physician, upon thee be My peace! Thou hast fallen into hardship. The True One, glorified be His majesty, hath foretold the absence of comfort in this world. In truth, its comfort is hardship, let alone its hardship. However, since it is transient, there hath been and is no harm. In one station, hardship is the cause of testing the servants, that the station of each soul might become known - from it patient perseverance is made manifest, and through it the world of attention and remembrance is adorned and evident. O physician! Tears are very good, and sighs most desirable. Hardship is the cause of the awakening of being, and awakening is the cause of reflection upon the end. In this state, sighs ascend and tears descend. Were We to expand upon this station, a book would come into being. We beseech the True One, glorified be His majesty, to preserve your honor from the vicissitudes of time. Say […]”</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Your love has set me ablaze, and my remoteness from the shore of Your nearness has consumed me, causing my veins to be severed and my liver to melt. I beseech You by Your Prophets and Your chosen ones, by the mysteries of Your Kingdom and Your Dominion, and by the Mother Book which none has known save You, to aid me in that which You love and are pleased with, and to assist me in serving Your chosen ones and Your loved ones. Then grant me the best of what You have revealed in Your Book. O Lord! You see that hardship has encompassed me and difficulty has seized me. Where is Your ease, O Master of existence, and Your repose, O Sovereign of the seen and unseen? You behold me, O my Goal, turning toward the lights of Your countenance, holding fast to the cord of Your grace, and clinging to the hem of the robe of Your bounty. O Lord! The thirst of days has destroyed me. Where is the sweet water of Your mercy, O Goal of the worlds? I beseech You by Your Name through which You have subdued the world and guided the peoples, to send down upon me from the clouds of the heaven of Your grace the rain of Your bounty, that it may cleanse me from the murk of the world and its cares and sorrows. Then open before my face and the faces of Your servants the gates of Your relief. You are He by Whose will all things have appeared and by Whose desire all possibilities have been created. Ordain for me through Your Most Exalted Pen the good of the hereafter and of this world. There is no God but You, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The drops from the vessel of grace have made fresh and verdant the realm of the seen and unseen. Ever has the sun of His truth and bounty been manifest and evident and clear. This servant beseeches the Eternal Lord and submits in humility and supplication that He may confirm that Beloved One in that which will cause the exaltation of the Word of God and His glorious Law. O Beloved of my heart! We must all, in the nights and days, hold fast to the cord of grace of the Lord of all beings and seek from Him the protection of the people of unity. The servant asks his Lord to protect the people of unity from the fire of the hatred of the polytheists and to assist them in what they have missed in pure servitude to His true Self. For had the Book been followed, this evident abasement would not have occurred. In all conditions, we beseech the Exalted Truth for the reformation of the people of the world, that all may attain to the fruit of their existence and not depart heedless from this world. Verily, He is God; there is no God but Him, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Hearing, the Answering.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning the emigrants and the Leaf, upon them be the peace of God and His favors - they were honored in these regions for a time. Praise be to God, they inhaled the fragrance of the Hijaz and bore the difficulties of the way for love of the Glorious One. They attained to the circumambulation of the House and the sight of Yathrib. God protected them with the hosts of the seen and unseen and granted them a great victory, for despite the upheavals in these parts and the might of the polytheists and the disorder of the way, they arrived, saw, and attained in perfect health and safety. This is among the special and mighty divine favors. Blessed are they!</p>
<p>And as to what was mentioned that the honored emigrants, after visiting the Sacred Thresholds, intended to stay in that House - this matter was honored by being heard. We ask God to assist them in what they have intended, to remind them of His verses, to adorn them with His beautiful remembrance, and to ordain for them the reward of what they have done in His path. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about the House, they said that you yourself know there were and are no special funds with the friends that could be transferred. And the matter of the House - its details are not known. Previously a description was written and sent, but no reply was received - apparently it did not arrive. This matter was truly approved in consideration of your love and desire. Now you should, as commanded, describe in detail the affairs of the House - how much has been received and how much remains, and likewise how much you intend to spend on repairs. However, given the lack of means, the more modest it can be the better and more fitting. This year the affairs of this land have also become somewhat disturbed. Surely news about the House in this land has reached or will reach your ears. In any case, they repeatedly said that the honored physician has been put to trouble - the first matter not yet complete when you fell into a second difficulty. By the life of our Beloved and your Beloved, due to lack of means these matters and their completion were delayed. Now you should write in detail all that was mentioned and send it. After its receipt, it must be carried out in whatever way possible. In these days some mischief-makers in this land have made certain accusations that have caused grief to the friends - that is, general grief. Although whatever has happened and is happening has been in the path of God and we are all content and thankful for it. Convey greetings from this ephemeral one to the friends in that land. God willing, may all be assisted to act in ways that cause the reformation of the world and the tranquility of nations. A reply to this letter is desired as soon as possible.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote that “it is two hours past sunset on Thursday the 13th of Jumada I, and we are dwelling in the upper chamber above the entrance with weeping eyes and burning hearts, together with the Leaf, upon her be God’s peace” - these words had a profound effect. The dwellers of the pavilion of glory all send their greetings to that Leaf and express their loving-kindness. The servant asks his Lord as you asked: “O God! Cause Your House to be built by the hands of Your chosen ones and Your loved ones. Verily You have power over all things.”</p>
<p>The greetings and praise of that beloved one were conveyed to the presence of the Branches of the Blessed Tree - may my spirit, my being and my essence be a sacrifice for the dust of their footsteps - and each one expressed loving-kindness and sends greetings with the utmost eagerness, love and kindness. Praise be to God, mention of that beloved one and the days you were here has been and continues to be made. Blessed are you! Peace and praise be upon you and upon those with you and upon God’s sincere servants. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>My spirit and my being be a sacrifice unto Thee, O Spirit, through Whom the breath of the Spirit hath wafted from the direction of Thy nearness, and the fragrance of the garment of Thy reunion hath been diffused, causing these decayed bones to quiver. The glorious letter of that beautiful Countenance, which was adorned with the crown of grandeur, magnificence and glory to the name of our Lord, the Glorious, the Most Glorious, came as a spiritual diadem adorning the head of this ephemeral one, and the fragrances of the garment of sanctification were inhaled from its holy words, free from incidental allusions and the indications of vain imaginings. Glory be unto God, then power, might and dominion be unto God, Who, by a gesture of the finger of His power, rent asunder the all-encompassing veils of names, and were He to will and make another gesture with His other sacred fingertip, He would raise up the entire kingdom of names and the heaven of essences in their reality. Then would appear the word: “Immortality belongeth unto God, the Powerful, the Glorious, the Most Glorious.” And furthermore, with this same exalted finger He created a new creation, such that were all the worlds of origination and invention to become embodiments of names and desire to utter or speak a single letter from the letters of the Book of Creation other than that which hath been revealed from the Most Glorious Pen of God, they would all be considered absolute nothingness and sheer non-existence. Exalted, exalted is the power of our Lord, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Omnipotent!</p>
<p>Praise be to God that your honor is manifest before the Most Great Scene as one of the powerful, steadfast souls, and is adorned with the ornament of a new creation. We beseech God that through the effect of thy steadfastness He may manifest powerful souls and firm feet that may stand firm in the Cause and aid the All-Merciful with the swords of utterance. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>And regarding your previous request for permission to attain His presence, this servant beareth witness that at all times the decree of nearness and attainment unto His presence is established concerning your honor. These are now the days wherein we must all dedicate all affairs to the service of the Cause and occupy ourselves with teaching. Praise be to God that the True One, glorified be He, hath confirmed and assisted your honor, and you have been and are engaged in services to the Cause. May my soul be a sacrifice for thy devoted efforts!</p>
<p>Concerning the beloved friends in the land of S and M, about whom they have written both before and after, mention of all has been made before the Divine Throne, and infinite expressions of loving-kindness have dawned from their Source upon all. All have been and are beneath the glance of mercy and the gaze of loving-kindness, and the Tablets of God have also been sent down from the heaven of His Will. God willing, they will gradually be dispatched, and all shall be nourished from the inexhaustible ocean of grace. Convey this evanescent one’s expressions of devotion, self-effacement and glorification to all of them. May my spirit be a sacrifice unto them for having recognized, turned unto, believed in, and become certain of God. We beseech God that they may remain steadfast in the love of God and His Cause, and be among the firm ones. In the Tablet addressed to your honor, all have been mentioned by the Ancient Tongue. Convey the glorification of the Truth to all. The petitions that were sent with Jinab-i-Aqa Shaykh-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, met with circumstance, and in the great city all were destroyed, and indeed they acted with wisdom. Your honor should write the details to the people of Kha. Two Tablets specifically for Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Muhammad-Rida and Aqa Siyyid Abu-Talib were revealed more than a year ago but did not arrive. Now they have been sent and should be delivered. A single number of exalted Tablets were revealed, some sent without names. Your honor should consider them and deliver them as appropriate, and gladden and illumine all with the manifestations of God’s infinite bounties and the effulgences of the Sun of His most glorious mercy. The Branches of the Divine Lote-Tree, its twigs, fruits and leaves, all remember your honor with most wondrous and exalted praise, mention and glorification. Furthermore, convey this evanescent one’s expressions of devotion, love and glorification to your honored father and mother, upon them be the glory of their Lord, and likewise to all relatives and kin and all who attain your presence. I trouble all with expressions of devotion and countless glorifications. God willing, may all remain firm and steadfast in the path of the Cause through the influence of your holy breaths and spiritual emanations, in such wise that the false indications and polytheistic allusions of the opposing souls may neither prevent nor veil them. By God! O my beloved! Verily the Cause is mighty, and mightier than all that is mighty, nay mightier still than that, and thy Lord is the Most High, the Mighty.</p>
<p>According to your command, you must act with great wisdom in this journey, and strong emphasis has been laid on this matter. God willing, this has been and will continue to be observed. Furthermore, among the incidents that have occurred is that two individuals and their sister in the Land of Sirr exhibited such behavior that, by God besides Whom there is no other God, the like of it has never been heard of in creation. When God forbade them from what they did, they turned away and objected until they denied God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. In all days and nights they engaged in what they were forbidden from. They mocked God’s messengers and emissaries, and from them appeared that which caused the dwellers of Paradise and those who circle around thy Lord’s throne, the Mighty, the Generous, to lament. They were never truly followers of my Faith, but in the Land of Sirr they secretly engaged in opposition and objection until one saw the overwhelming might of his Lord and repented at the time of death, and God forgave him - verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. After his passing, Rida-Quli came and repented - verily thy Lord is the Ever-Forgiving, possessed of manifest grace. Though his inner hypocrisy was known, due to the precedence of mercy and the all-encompassing grace, it was concealed until he arrived at this prison and openly began misleading some, for he found the Truth imprisoned and oppressed. He drank wine openly and his sister would drink and appear before the Countenance. Thus did it come to pass with the Beloved. This has been mentioned that thou mayest be informed. And this was among their better deeds - we seek God’s refuge from their other acts. When their rebellion, tyranny and ingratitude reached their height, God cast them out and left them in the torment of hell. They departed and said what none before had said. Fie upon them and their faithlessness! Whatever divine verses they possessed, they added some fabricated ones and gave them to the people of this land, creating great mischief. But their efforts in this vain life came to naught. Verily He is the ruler over what He wills. They attributed all their reprehensible deeds to the Truth. Observe how, despite God’s great mercy and all-encompassing grace, they rebelled such that when they sought forgiveness it was not accepted. Thus they returned disappointed and at loss, and now they have united with Satan - God’s curse be upon them. Those souls wrote such letters in the Land of Sirr against Iblis and his followers and sent them in all directions. In any case, O My loved one, they have manifested such hatred the like of which has not been seen. They oppose all the Prophets and Messengers. We beseech God to seize them with His justice. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for some time verses had not been revealed from the heaven of divine will, the door of meeting was closed, and the Countenance of the Desired One sat alone in the house. For several days now the clouds of favor have risen and the rain of mercy has descended. God willing, mighty tablets will continue to be sent from the divine direction, that thy eyes and the eyes of the knowing ones may be gladdened thereby. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Additionally, regarding the outcast soul, a brief note has also been written to Aqa Mirza Husayn, upon him be the glory of God - they will observe it. Also, convey from this servant an exalted greeting to Aqa Mirza Sayyid Husayn from the people of Ta and Fa, and write to them in detail so they may be informed. And the spirit and glory and holiness and splendor be upon thee and those with thee among the people of Baha.</p>
<p>In most of the revealed Tablets, whether Persian or Arabic, the Pen of the Lord of Creation has, both implicitly and explicitly, forbidden the servants to turn towards this direction, and there has been much emphasis, warning and admonition in this binding commandment from the presence of the Mighty, the Powerful One. You must specifically forbid this and not allow anyone to turn in this direction, for manifest harm lies therein. In one of the exalted Persian Tablets, these words were revealed - exalted be His glory: “Forbid the loved ones of God from turning towards this direction. Say: O friends! harm will befall the very root of the Tree through coming and going. Beware lest ye transgress that which hath been ordained in the Book. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” Similar blessed passages, and even more severe and emphatic ones, have been revealed in numerous places, but we have confined ourselves to this one passage. We must all beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant us the grace to act according to His command and walk in the path of His good-pleasure. Verily, He ordaineth naught for His servants save that which is better for them than the kingdoms of earth and heaven. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>There are two petitions in the envelope which this servant has submitted. Please deliver them to the two names, upon them be the Glory of God.</p>

<p>O My Name! Upon thee be My Glory! A hundred thousand pities that the people of the world hearkened not to the rustling of the Supreme Pen and remained deprived of the whispering of the Divine Lote-Tree. They counted affliction as a bounty and torment as ease. Throughout the nights and days We summoned those on earth to the Great Announcement and the Straight Path. The people of the cities of justice and fairness all bear witness. From the Supreme Pen flowed that which a single drop thereof was the water of life for all who dwell in the realm of possibility. Yet greed and avarice have so encompassed the people of earth that all remain veiled and occupied with their own idle fancies, imagining that other than God can assist, support and benefit them. Far, far from it! Say: Ponder upon the parties of old and inquire, that perchance ye may be mindful. Today is the Day of God. Strive that ye may attain unto His knowledge and arise as behoveth you. The Caesars, Pharaohs and tyrants of the world in every age and cycle arose in oppression, vainly counting themselves as enduring and others as transient. Where are their stations and their palaces? Behold their graves, that perchance their extinction may remind you, their remoteness draw you near, and their darkness illuminate you. O My Name! The people are seen to be asleep, nay rather dead, save whom God willeth. Beseech God that He close not this door He hath opened, and extinguish not this fire He hath kindled through His love. He is the One with power whom the cawing of the world hindered not, and the clamor of the nations withheld not from His purpose. He called aloud in the palace, His remembrance was raised in the garden, and in the Most Great Prison He bore, more than at all other times, that which all were powerless and incapable of bearing. The heaven beareth witness, and the sun is aware of what hath been mentioned - this Sun of Truth that hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of inner meanings. Today the melodies of the Manifestations of Beauty are raised in the Most Exalted Paradise, the cooing of the doves of eternity is heard, and the murmuring of atoms is apparent. Blessed are they who have hearkened with true ears and become detached and free from the world and all that is therein. Convey to the people of God, wheresoever they may be, the greetings of the Wronged One, and remind them all of the verses of the Manifestation of clear proofs, that perchance they may not remain deprived of the splendors of the lights of the Sun of Truth and may not be afflicted with the idle fancies and vain imaginings of the past. The Supreme Pen hath at times desired to rend asunder all veils completely, but the weakness of the servants and their lack of capacity hath restrained it. The people are weak and the Cause mighty and great.</p>
<p>O My Name! There appeared before the Wronged One a letter which two of the friends had written to thee, adorned with mention of the loved ones of the land of K. The name of each is remembered before the Dawning-Place of Names and the Source thereof. Praise be to God, they have attained unto the waves of the ocean of the utterance of the All-Merciful and have drunk of the sealed wine which had ever been hidden, from the hands of bounty. That wine, in its primary station, is the recognition of the Self of the Manifestation. Whosoever attaineth unto His knowledge is indeed a partaker of that wine and numbered among them that comprehend, and none besides hath any share of this most great favor. Give thou the glad-tidings from God unto all, that they may rejoice and drink from the divine chalice the water of life of steadfastness, in such wise that the sources of vain imaginings and the heedless among the people of the Bayan may find no way unto them. O My Name! Make thou the people aware, saying: Consider ye at the beginning of the Cause the former community. If ye become informed of the calumnies of that group, ye will hold fast unto the cord of God’s favor with such firmness that the fragrance of permanence may be inhaled therefrom. A few heedless souls became the leaders of that community and led them all to hell. They changed God’s favor into denial and caused their people to dwell in the abode of perdition. Reflect ye upon the Manifestation of the Herald, the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake. All the lands of Persia arose in error, hypocrisy, unbelief and dissension, and issued decrees for the shedding of the most pure blood of the Day-Star of the horizons. Such was the fruit of that community. Now again certain worshippers of names who have appeared in the Bayan desire to contaminate the people of God with those same vain imaginings. Say: O people! If ye discover the fragrance of the Bayan and perceive the sweet savors of the Supreme Pen, arise with utmost endeavor and steadfastness to serve the Cause.</p>
<p>O people of K! We counsel you to be steadfast in these days in such wise that the hearts of the doubters who have broken God’s Covenant and His Testament, and have turned away from Him Who hath come with what they possessed of the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds, may be sorely troubled. Verily, the primary source of error hath been the divines who opposed God’s Messengers in the past and present, and through their turning away the people turned away. To this testifieth every fair-minded and well-informed person. Beware lest the intimations and doubts of the cawers prevent you from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty be upon you and upon everyone who is steadfast, firm and upright.</p>
<p>In the letter sent by the servant Ali and Aqa Hashim, mention was made of Mulla Aqa Jan.&nbsp;Give thou the glad-tidings to that servant of his Lord’s loving-kindness. Verily He hath forgiven him as a token of His grace and purified him from transgression. He is verily the Protector, the Mighty, the Bestower. O My Name! That which was submitted by him who is named Nayib Hasan hath been presented, and the Most Great Branch - upon him be My mercy, My loving-kindness and My grace - read it before My face, and We have revealed for him that which will draw him nigh unto God. Thy Lord is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous. O Hasan! Grieve not because of the taunts of the enemies and the clamor of them that are in the lands. We have borne that for which all things have lamented, and I am the True One, the Trustworthy. We have arisen before all faces when the Sun of Justice was behind the clouds and the Orb of Equity behind the veils, and We have manifested the Cause as a token of Our grace. Thy Lord is verily the Powerful, the Mighty. Say:[…]</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by the light of Thy knowledge whereby the hearts of them that are nigh unto Thee were illumined, and by the fire of Thy love which hath set aflame the hearts of them that yearn after Thee, and by the radiance of the heaven of Thy bounty and the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance, that Thou mayest ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit me in the world to come and in this world. Verily Thou knowest what I possess, and I know not what Thou dost possess. Thou art, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O Lord! Strengthen my limbs in Thy service and my heart in Thy knowledge, and aid me to remain steadfast in Thy love and to arise to serve that which beseemeth Thy Revelation and Thy days. Verily Thou art the Strong, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast mentioned concerning him who is named Ibrahim Kh., We have indeed heard his call before. He is among those who have attained unto tribulations in My love and My path. God hath magnified his reward in His perspicuous Book. This world hath no station. Erelong shall the wrongdoers behold the recompense of their deeds, bereft of any evidence from God, the Commander, the All-Wise. O Ibrahim! Upon thee be My glory. Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison. Verily He remembereth thee in truth and remindeth thee of the signs of God, the Lord of all worlds. Turn not unto the world and its affairs. By My life! Had it possessed any station, thou wouldst surely have found Me seizing its reins and established upon its throne. Behold, then remember what the All-Merciful hath sent down in the Qur’an concerning this most hidden mystery and this mighty announcement, and before it in the Gospel and the Torah, and that which was revealed unto Isaiah from God, the Mighty, the Most Praised. Blessed art thou for having endured in My path what My chosen ones have endured, both in the past and in the future. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Knowing. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge, and within His grasp is the dominion of all who are in the heavens and on earth. When thou dost inhale the sweet savors of My verses, turn thy face toward God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Say:</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Beloved of the world and Desire of the nations! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name to aid me in that which shall cause my remembrance to endure amongst Thy servants and my praise amongst Thy creation. O Lord! Thou seest me advancing toward Thee, detached from all else save Thee, turning unto the effulgences of the lights of Thy countenance, and holding fast unto the cord of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which Thou hast ordained for them that are detached from Thy creation. Then write down for me the good of this world and of the world to come. Verily Thou art He Whom the forces of the world cannot hinder. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy power and ordainest what Thou pleasest through Thy command. There is none other God but Thee, the Supreme over all names, the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below. Verily Thou art the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
<p>O My Name! Praise be to God that they have attained in the path of God unto that which hath befallen His loved ones. We beseech and implore Him to keep them steadfast and to make them content. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower, the All-Knowing. Assuredly, whatsoever the requirements of wisdom are hath flowed and shall continue to flow from the Most Exalted Pen. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. The glory that shineth resplendent from the horizon of the heaven of My kingdom be upon thee and upon them that have remembered thee, loved thee, assisted thee, and hearkened unto thy words concerning the Cause of God, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>

<p>May Mr.&nbsp;Varqa, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], take note of this.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Most Great, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath revealed Himself unto all created things through that Name whereby the Concourse on High rejoiced, the hearts of the Manifestations of Names took flight, and through which the lovers uttered “My spirit be a sacrifice unto Thee,” and the Dove of Holiness warbled upon the Divine Lote-Tree. The Kingdom and the Realm of Might, then the realms of divine power and sovereignty, then all the kingdoms of creation be a sacrifice unto Thy Name, O King of Names! Then the Tongue of Grandeur spoke between the heavens: “By God, the Truth! That which hath come is that by which all atoms were attracted, and verily He is the One Who was forever hidden, none being aware of Him save His Own Self, the One Who dominates all who are in the heavens and the earth.” Praise be to God Who hath made tribulation the key to His exalted Paradise, whereby those who followed their desires fled while the people of Baha drew nigh, those who cast away this world and took hold of that which would profit them in the Hereafter and in this life. Exalted be our Lord, the All-Bountiful, and exalted be His all-pervading grace, and exalted be that whereby He is remembered, described, and praised. Verily, He is the Single One Who was sanctified above all others, and the Expositor Who was elevated above all utterance. We testify that the Kingdom of Utterance circles round Him and prostrates itself at His call and submits at the appearance of His proof. We testify that there is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
<p>My soul be a sacrifice for Thy love! Two letters which had shone forth from the horizon of your love brought joy to this evanescent one’s heart. However, as they conveyed news of the tribulations that had befallen you, and the successive afflictions and cascading calamities, such grief overcame me that its description is impossible for this helpless pen, nay, for the pen of any lover to convey. We beseech God to grant you success and to assist you in all conditions, and to ordain for you that which is best for you. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Although mention of your tribulations caused countless sorrows, yet, as it hath been said:</p>
<p>Every calamity in Thy good-pleasure is joy,</p>
<p>And every sorrow in Thy love is gladness,</p>
<p>Every tribulation in Thy love is comfort,</p>
<p>And every hardship in Thy days is ease.</p>
<p>Every poison in aid of Thy Cause is healing balm, and every bitterness in service to Thee is surpassing honey. By God! Not an atom of what hath befallen that honored one hath been, or shall ever be, effaced from the page of creation. Blessed art thou for having drunk the cup of tribulation in love of thy Lord, the Lord of all names. God willing, through divine bounties thou shalt soon become the dayspring of the mention of all creation and the source of universal affairs. Verily He is the One Who ordaineth what He pleaseth for whomsoever He willeth. He, verily, is the Single One, the All-Informed. This servant hath felt the utmost regret, for he was not able to respond to that honored one. This was not due to any neglect or lassitude on the part of this servant, but rather owing to the absence of messengers. In these days, as the beloved and most cherished ones, his honor Aqa Mirza Haydar-’Ali and his honor Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Husayn, upon them be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, were preparing to depart, this petition was boldly presented. God willing, in all conditions ye shall occupy yourselves with wisdom and utterance in making mention of the Goal of the world’s peoples, that perchance the heedless, lifeless souls may turn unto the water of life.</p>
<p>Here is another account concerning events in this land - strange and wondrous happenings have occurred there which will surely reach your blessed hearing. In all Tablets, Scriptures, Books and Holy Writings, all the friends have been commanded to manifest religiosity, trustworthiness, truthfulness, high endeavor, justice and fairness - as all the divine friends can bear witness to what has been stated. Nevertheless, certain matters have transpired which this servant is ashamed to mention - the luminous hem has been sullied. Although the resolution of these matters depends upon a Word from God, this servant’s sorrow stems from the fact that such souls should appear with perfect trustworthiness, religiosity and truthfulness among the people, so that all may be illumined by the rays of the suns of detachment. For those souls who are truly gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon today and have reached the supreme heights are the dawning-places of goodly attributes, the rising-points of pure deeds, and the sources of actions that are pleasing and acceptable. We beseech God to aid us in what He loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p>Every morning and evening, night and day, the Supreme Pen, with perfect kindness, mercy, compassion and bounty, summons these servants to that which is best for them. Nevertheless, most remain heedless and occupied with their own desires. In any case, these matters too are among the conditions of imprisonment. For once this servant heard from the Most Holy Tongue saying that although God, exalted be His glory and greatness, transformed the prison land and opened its gate, yet at times certain events occur therein so that the mention of prison and its signs may not be erased. Verily in this are signs for those who understand. I testify that all that was uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur appears in truth and none can gainsend it.</p>
<p>In the days when the Surih of Ra’is was revealed, mention was made of the Sublime State and what it did and what would befall it. Many were bewildered as to how this would come to pass. God, the Most High, the Most Great, spoke truth. Now in these days one should recite that blessed Surih to gain insight into the power and greatness of God’s Cause, and all will testify that verily He is the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, the Wise.</p>
<p>Likewise with the Tablet of Paris - no one could conceive how such a momentous matter would come to pass. Indeed, someone mentioned to this servant that it was inconceivable that someone like Napoleon would be deposed or come to an end. But days had not passed before the Sun of God’s Word shone forth and all that was revealed in the verses appeared word for word, letter for letter, and all witnessed it. Nevertheless, most again appear heedless and sleeping - nay, dead. And this servant is in all conditions forbidden from mentioning certain hidden matters. Were He to command me to reveal them, all would surely testify that there is no God but Him, the Powerful, the Most High, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Another submission: Although this servant delayed sending petitions due to the absence of couriers, it has also been some time since news has come from you, even though letters now arrive directly by post from all parts of Iran. God willing, contrary to before, both this servant shall cause trouble and you shall be the cause of joy.</p>
<p>Another supplication is that you should convey greetings on behalf of this ephemeral one to the loved ones of God–those souls who have drunk from the ocean of love and are gazing toward and turned to the horizon of grace–and make mention that today is the day of the remembrance of God, and today is the day of service and assistance. Time must not be lost, and the purpose of service and assistance is the mention of Truth through wisdom and utterance, that perchance the scattered letters of the world may be gathered together in the temple of a single word, and that word may become the cause of the completion and adornment of the Book of Creation. Say: O leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree! The ear is attentive that it may hear, from the blowing of the winds of the divine days, the sound of your movement and vibration. And let it not be imagined that by movement and vibration is meant conflict, corruption and contention. Nay, by His very Self, the Truth! This Revelation is different from other revelations, and these days are different from other days. God willing, the mature, holy, and steadfast souls should appear in such wise that all the world may partake of the sweet fountains of their love and affection. And since these fountains flow in the name of Truth, from their murmur should be heard the soul-entrancing call “Verily, He is the Beloved of all worlds.” We beseech God that He may confirm today those who drink the choice wine of understanding, that they may invite all people to the Truth and not become the cause of division and discord, and that they may act according to that which hath been revealed in the Most Holy Book from the Supreme Pen. May they pass beyond self-seeing, which is in truth the source of nothingness and duality, and occupy themselves with the mention of Him Who alone exists, so that the polytheists may find no opportunity for aversion and objection. O my masters! Today discord hath been and will be the cause of harm to the Cause of God. Set aside your selves and take hold of God alone. Thus doth your Best-Beloved, the Most Glorious, command you. To this testifieth this servant and those who have acknowledged and recognized that He is God, the Powerful, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Furthermore, all the pilgrims and assembled souls who have come from various directions are all occupied with your mention. In truth, they convey greetings from the depths of their hearts. Verily, He is the All-Witnessing, the All-Knowing. Glory and majesty be upon your honor and upon those with you and those who have attained and become assured of the meeting with their Lord, the Mighty, [the Impregnable]. The Servant. On the 19th of Jamadiyu’l-Avval.</p>
<p>=== END BH00619 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00620 ===</p>
<p>In the name of the manifest and visible Lord! O thou Jamalu’l-Fath, hearken unto the divine melodies in the Persian tongue! By God, thou shalt not hear their like though thou searchest throughout all regions. The meaning is that were mention to be made of what hath befallen this servant through the tyranny of enemies and friends, verily would measureless sorrow encompass thee. And this much hath been known to thee, that many matters have remained, and still remain, concealed from all eyes and thoughts for the glory of God’s Cause, until such time as God shall will otherwise.</p>
<p>By God, O Fath, the root of the matter was not as the people have heard, and none were apprised thereof save two souls. One was he who was named Ahmad, who hath ascended unto God, and the other was he who was named the Interlocutor, who walketh while destiny walketh behind him. This is one of those mysteries that was hidden from the truth, and this is of the wisdom of thy Lord which none knoweth save those endowed with illumined vision.</p>
<p>None besides God is cognizant of God’s Cause. Were it not for the consideration of the people’s sedition and thy harm, assuredly would the command be given that thou shouldst turn toward the holy court and become apprised of matters which none else hath known.</p>
<p>Apart from these considerations, the purpose of creation hath ever been the knowledge of God, and the knowledge of Him hath ever been and shall ever be dependent upon the recognition of the Manifestation of His own Self, as is recorded in all the pages of the Bayan. And He Who is the Essence of the All-Merciful hath made all that is ordained in the Bayan conditional upon His appearance and recognition. He Himself sufficeth as a witness. This station hath been sanctified from all limitations, allusions and restrictions, for this is the station of “Know God through God” and through what proceedeth from Him, not through what hath been created between the heavens and earth.</p>
<p>In most passages it hath been mentioned that the people of the Furqan were not well trained. God willing, may the people of the Bayan be so trained that they may not remain veiled from the Source and Fountainhead of the Cause, either through verbal allusions or without them. Now ponder this utterance, that ye may enter the pure ocean of God without allusion, in such wise that ye may regard all as non-existent save him who hath entered beneath the shadow of his Lord.</p>
<p>Now consider the firm ordinances of the Furqan, among which is the mention of the “Seal”, in His exalted words “but He is the Apostle of God and the Seal of the Prophets.” Consider also the words of the Letters and the Gates concerning the appearance of the Qa’im. Yet at the time of His wondrous manifestation all these sayings were set aside by a single word, as thou thyself bearest witness that the Prophet hath been from the beginning that hath no beginning and will continue unto the end that hath no end, as mentioned in the words of the Exalted One - may the life of all else be a sacrifice unto Him.</p>
<p>How tenaciously did the people of the Furqan cling to these ordinances, yet remained deprived of their essence! This servant himself wrote numerous treatises on these matters, that perchance the people might rend asunder the veils and recognize the Lord of Names and Attributes. In brief, at the time of manifestation nothing profiteth or hindereth, as hath been mentioned, for the Sovereign of Manifestation is known through His own Self. Were it otherwise, and were He to be known through words and allusions, the verdict of non-existence, negation and hellfire would not have been passed upon the people of the Furqan and those veiled therefrom, notwithstanding these healing utterances.</p>
<p>Free your spirit from the fetters of allusions and ponder the wondrous words, that you may attain unto the spring of divine bounty. Moreover, the Point of the Bayan hath, in all His Tablets, given explicit counsels and conclusive admonitions, that none should remain veiled from the Manifestation or cleave unto aught else. Yet, notwithstanding the wondrous signs of thy Lord that have encompassed all created things, they have inflicted such harm as is not meet to mention. Whatever these immature servants behold - be it the revealed and decisive verses, the all-encompassing conditions, or the manifestations of power in this Revelation - they have witnessed its supreme evidence, such that none but every sinful denier would reject it.</p>
<p>By Him Who holdeth my soul in His hand! This servant hath transcended self, yet the purpose is that these servants should not remain veiled like the peoples of the past, nor visit upon the Manifestation of the Cause in the next Revelation that which hath been visited upon this servant. I swear by the Sun of inner meanings that purely out of self and desire have they perpetrated what they have done, attributing it to this most pure and holy seat. Woe unto them for what they earn! They have ever turned away from the truth, as evidenced by the treatises they have written rejecting one another, all of which are extant. And now, united in their hatred for this Youth, they have written epistles rejecting God and sent them to all regions. Soon they will reach you. If these epistles are examined with an eye unclouded by imitation, by God! the lies of the liar and his ignorance will be as manifest as the sun in mid-heaven. All the refutations of that heedless and ignorant one actually prove this wondrous Cause, were ye to behold with sanctified vision. By God! From his words Satan himself is manifest, as though deprived of the fragrances of the All-Merciful. He speaks as a child, nay lower still hath he been and ever shall be. The rejection of this company of the Beauty of Divine Unity is even as the rejection and turning away of dung beetles from the Paradise of Divine Unity. Doth it beseem a gnat to object to God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting? Nay, by His very Self, the Truth, were men to comprehend!</p>
<p>Verily, the signs, words and deeds of Truth are, distinct from all else, like the rising sun - manifest and clear. Blessed are they that perceive! The sweet fragrances of the Musk of the All-Merciful waft continually from His signs and utterances, yet none shall detect them save those endowed with refined perception. These words have been revealed for the good-pleasure of God, that perchance they may preserve a few from the depths of passion and lead them to the certitude of eternity. God guideth whom He willeth.</p>
<p>Cast off the garment of blind imitation from the temple of detachment, lest the lights of the Beauty of Divine Unity remain veiled by the covering of limitation, and the Cause of God - which hath ever been sanctified above the comprehension of the learned - be sullied by the allusions of the heedless. Enter the sanctuary of “Know God through God” and the station of “He cannot be comprehended through aught else.” Know the Truth through the Truth and comprehend it, for none other than this can truly know that peerless Beauty and the manner of the appearance of the Lord of Majesty, except what He may choose to reveal through His grace.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the time of the Manifestation of the Self-Sufficient, nothing shall profit anyone - even if all who are in the heavens and earth should possess illumined tablets, precious scrolls, or volumes of books - except after their entry and arrival [under the shade of] the Most Great Luminary. Thus doth the Pen of the All-Merciful speak at the time when the fingers of the All-Glorious move it as they please, by His command. Verily, He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
<p>O Khalil! Were you to become aware of the sorrow of Nabil, you would not choose the abode of patience and the dwelling of forbearance, but like the lovers would set forth into the desert of longing, consumed by grief for the Day-Star of the horizons. Such is the state of this world and its people. They have ever veiled the Beauty of the One with the veils of envy. Blessed is he who rendeth asunder the veils and entereth beneath the pavilions of holy splendor.</p>
<p>Hear thou My words, then purify thy vision from human allusions and stand at the Most Great Scene. By God! That which was to appear hath appeared, and We beseech God to make thee among those who perceive. Would that there were a fair-minded one with insight, or a detached one with knowledge, who might witness what none among the worlds hath witnessed. Soon shall the greatest clamor be raised, and people shall be prevented from the Most Great Wine. Verily, those who turn away shall be seen to outnumber those who believe, for pebbles are found in abundance while pearls are rare.</p>
<p>God willing, you shall not deprive yourself of the outpourings of the clouds of the Cause and the effusions of the clouds of grace. Would that the people of the Bayan had received from this servant the equivalent of what was revealed by the Point of the Bayan, and had kept themselves from calumnies. Nay, they will not be content with anything less than shedding holy blood. Thus doth their desire command them, if thou be of those who know.</p>
<p>Most wondrous of all things is that, despite this Most Great Revelation and supreme power, none hath reflected upon the nature of the Cause. Rather, all cling to vain imaginings and remain veiled from the Beauty of certitude. Thus hath it been aforetime and thus shall it be unto the end of ends. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Qabli-Naqi! Hearken unto the Voice from the shore of eternity in the crimson spot, from the Divine Lote-Tree: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the Ridvan Festival in the Garden when the All-Merciful revealed Himself unto all creation. Be thou thankful and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp lie the reins of earth and heaven!” Say: This is not a day for tarrying. Blessed is he who hath heard the call from the supreme horizon and hath responded: “Here am I, O my Lord, the All-Merciful!” Say: The Call is a wing for him who desireth to soar in this atmosphere, a lamp unto the people of creation, and the river of thy Lord’s mercy unto all existence. It is healing for the distressed and life unto the buried. Blessed is he who hath heard it with the ear of the heart, turning unto the Qiblih of all horizons.</p>
<p>O Most Holy Pen! Make mention of him who hath turned unto the Sun of his Lord’s countenance, the Mighty, the Bestower, that the remembrance of God may draw him unto the Kingdom of Names and Attributes. Blessed art thou for having shattered the idol of vain imaginings when thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, came in the shadows of the clouds. Arise by thy Lord’s leave, then subdue hearts through this Name which God hath made to be sovereign over all names. Thus hath the matter been decreed by the Revealer of verses. Say: O people! The Day hath come–that which ye were promised in the Tablets. Through it the Great Cry hath been raised, and the Rock hath proclaimed: “The Kingdom is God’s, the One, the All-Compelling!” Beware lest the veils of creation withhold thee from turning unto the Supreme Truth. Be as thy Lord was, such that neither the hosts of the earth nor the might of any proud oppressor shall frighten thee. Be thou a herald of My Name and one who speaketh My praise, albeit with wisdom and utterance. Thus hath the matter been ordained in the Book.</p>
<p>When We arrived at the prison, We desired to convey to all that which thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful, had willed. We have sent down to every one of the rulers of the earth that which hath blinded the eyes of the unbelievers and gladdened the vision of Our chosen servants. We have created the new creation through the spirit of power and might, and have sent it with the Tablet of thy Chosen Lord, from whose horizon the sun of names hath shone forth with power and sovereignty. Tribulation hath not deterred Us from the remembrance of God, the Creator of names. From the horizon of the prison, We summon the peoples unto the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Say: O people! Verily, Jacob regained his sight when he found the fragrance of the shirt of a Name among names, and We have sent unto you that which hath diffused the sweet savors of the All-Merciful. Turn ye, O people of understanding! We have heard thy call and have answered thee from this spot, as a token of Our grace unto thee and unto those who have turned unto the Face on a Day wherein feet have slipped.</p>
<p>O Most Pure Pen! Look from the direction of the Most Luminous Scene towards him who is named Ali Akbar, that he may behold himself beneath the gaze of the Lord of Destiny, through whom the Path was established and the Balance set up. Hearken unto what the Ancient Beauty calls out to thee from the direction of His Most Great Name. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Help in Peril. Blessed art thou for having cast away idle fancy and laid hold on certitude when the Self-Subsisting came with clear proof and evidence. Say: O concourse of divines! Remember when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came, He was rejected by him who deemed himself the most learned among men, while he who tended sheep believed in Him. Glory lies not in knowledge but in the recognition of the Known One. Ponder, O ye that are veiled! Behold the paucity of their minds - they write with their pens what their desires dictate to them, after the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen has been raised between earth and heaven. Say: Cast away what ye possess and be silent, then hearken to what the Tongue of Grandeur and Glory utters. How many a veiled woman has turned to God and believed, while how many a turbaned man has turned away and followed the dissenting factions. Blessed is he who has rent asunder the greatest veil in the name of the Lord of mankind and has turned towards the straight path. Among the idolaters is he who said: “Has the Hour come?” Say: “Nay, by the Lord of Lords, it has passed! The Sun of Certitude has shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord’s will, the All-Merciful, while the idolaters remain in heedlessness and doubt.” Say: “The morn has dawned, and thereby the fragrance of the garment has wafted through all regions.” Thus have We inspired thee and sent thee that which causes souls to soar and the hearts of the righteous to be attracted.</p>
<p>O Pen! Turn toward him who has turned to the Most Great Name, who is named Muhammad in the Kingdom of Names, that he may rejoice in this remembrance which God has made the ornament of the Book of Creation. Say: We have kindled the fire of longing in all regions, and this is the Beloved One, O concourse of lovers! Thy name hath been mentioned before the Throne, and there hath been sent down for thee that which quickeneth the dead. Be thankful that God has aided thee to recognize the Manifestation of His Cause, and there hath flowed from the Pen of Revelation that which shall establish thy remembrance among His servants. Can any bounty equal this among all that hath been created on earth? Nay, by the Dayspring of Lights! Arise to serve thy Lord - this is better for thee than all thou seest, and every steadfast believer testifies to this. Say: All previous Revelations have culminated in this Most Great Revelation, and whosoever claims after Him is indeed a lying impostor. We beseech God to guide him to repentance should he turn back - verily thy Lord is the Ever-Forgiving; but should he persist in his claim, God will surely send against him one who will show no mercy - He is verily the Almighty, the Subduer. Counsel those who have made God’s Cause a plaything and a sport. By My life! They are in grievous error and delusion. Were the Cause as they assert, how could that which We have purposed be established among men? Reflect, O ye who possess insight! How many are the cawing ones who caw - this is what your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, has informed you. O My loved ones! Guard the fortress of the Cause through My Name, the All-Encompassing over all regions, then drink from the cups of the mercy of your Lord, the All-Merciful, the water of everlasting life, despite those who have disbelieved in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Thus have We expounded the verses for thee and We expound them in another strain. Verily thy Lord is the One Who has power over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Husayn, that he may hear the call of this Wronged One. Verily the Beloved calleth, the Well-Beloved hath come, yet the people understand not. The rapture of the All-Compelling hath seized all regions, and most of the people are thunderstruck. The Sacred Valley crieth out: “Praise be to Thee, O Lord of Names!”, and the Far Temple proclaimeth: “The Kingdom is Thine, O Lord of the seen and the unseen!” Every lifeless thing hath been quickened by the breezes of God, yet the people are as dead, save those who have cast away desire and laid hold on guidance - these are they that shall prosper.</p>
<p>Grieve not at anything, but trust in thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, in all matters. This is the Day of remembrance and utterance; remind the people of this promised announcement. Sorrow not at remoteness, for how many a far one is near, and how many a near one is far. Thus have We decreed the matter in a preserved tablet. How many a seeker hath arrived yet not attained as he ought, and how many an aspirant hath not arrived yet attained, and how many a servant hath arrived and attained - such a one is among the most exalted of creation, by thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Unto each We have assigned a portion in the Book. Nothing escapeth His knowledge; verily He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who hath turned and arrived until he attained the presence of the Throne, detached from his desires, and heard the call of his Lord. He is of those who have outstripped existence. Today none is permitted to attain the presence of the Face, for We are in strictness and a forbidden station. Turn with your hearts - this is better for you in such days, if ye but knew.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of ’Ali at the end, that he may convey the remembrance of his Lord to the utmost end and recite the verses of his Most Glorious Lord that were revealed in this noble station. Though he be in the most ruined of houses, yet the Kingdom circleth round about him. Blessed are they that understand. Can anything sadden him or prevent him from what he desireth? Nay, by the Lord of the worlds! In tribulation he calleth unto all who are in creation and summoneth them unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Remember My days and what hath befallen Me at the hands of the wrongdoers. We desired their salvation, yet they strive to shed My blood, though were We to wish, We could seize them with a word from Us. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful. Mercy hath preceded; verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. The people are blind - when their eyes are opened they will reflect and say: “We testify that Thou art the Mighty, the Wondrous!” Be thou assured by the grace of thy Lord, and be a helper of His Cause and one who speaketh in His remembrance. Verily He is with His remembering servants.</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned in the beginning! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of the Manifestation at the end. There is no God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Be thou a servant to thy Lord’s Cause in all conditions, and convey My greetings to the faces of My loved ones and gladden them with this wise Remembrance. God shall soon seize him who hath wronged and transgressed. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Forsake not wisdom in affairs - this is what the Lord of creation hath decreed, before and after. He is the Best of Judges. Say: Praise be to God, the Goal of them that know.</p>
<p>O thou who art turning thy face toward God! The majesty of oneness hath risen above the horizon of divine unity, and the light of singleness hath shone forth from the dayspring of lordship. The wisdom of eternality hath been revealed and the mysteries of creation have been unveiled. The sun of grace hath risen above the horizon of the world, and the breezes of mercy have wafted from the kingdom of the All-Glorious. The divine springtime hath come and the spiritual verdure hath appeared. The clouds of bounty have rained down the water of life, and the trees of existence have yielded their fruit. The ocean of knowledge hath surged, and the pearls of wisdom have emerged therefrom. The garden of guidance hath been adorned, and the roses of understanding have bloomed. The nightingale of divine verses hath warbled, and the dove of inner meanings hath cooed. The banquet of the Lord hath been spread, and the table of heavenly sustenance hath been laid. The seekers have found their way, and the lovers have attained their goal. The mysteries have been disclosed, and the veils have been rent asunder. The signs have appeared, and the allusions have become manifest […]</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>O Nabil Qabli Khalil, upon whom be the glory of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Sublime - the Most Ancient, the Most Great! This is a remembrance unto him who hath attained My presence, turned unto My countenance, heard My call, and whom God hath enabled to behold My Beauty with Mine own eyes, aided him to recognize Me in My days, and caused him to speak My praise amongst My creatures, that he might once again drink the choice wine from the hands of his Lord’s bounty - the Most Glorious - Who remained among the enemies and cast Himself amidst the wicked ones who abandoned faithfulness, followed their desires, cast aside justice and rose up in tyranny. Yet in such circumstances and amid intensifying tribulations, He shineth from the horizon of power and calleth the people unto God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thy letter hath reached the Prisoner, and We found therein supreme steadfastness in this hidden Mystery and treasured Name. We bear witness that thou hast done what was commanded thee in the Bayan by thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Thus doth God aid whomsoever He willeth - verily He is the Ruler, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing. Were people to behold Me with Mine own eyes, they would not hesitate for less than a moment to renounce all creation and hasten with their hearts unto their Lord, the All-Merciful. But their hearts have hardened because they have followed vain imaginings and strayed from this near-at-hand grace.</p>
<p>The world hath been set ablaze by the Word of the Ancient King, yet the people remain heedless thereof, as if they were among the dead. God had counseled His servants to regard this Revelation with His eyes - this after countless other counsels which none can reckon save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing. They cast God’s counsel behind their backs and clung to the vain imaginings of creation mentioned in bygone ages, whereby they were veiled from Him around Whom revolves every wise command.</p>
<p>Consider the people of the Bayan: had they held fast to this counsel alone, they would not have hesitated in the Cause of Him at Whose advent the Holy Spirit cried out, “By God, the Beloved of the worlds hath appeared!” Some were veiled by mention of succession and the like. Say: Fie upon thee, O thou who art far removed! Hast thou not heard the decree concerning origination? By God, this is the Originator of the heavens and earth! No mention can be compared to His mention, no command to His command. Reflect, that ye may find the sweetness of this wondrous Origination.</p>
<p>O Khalil! The ocean of fire hath dripped from the Pen of the Chosen One. Blessed is he who hath been enkindled thereby in the love of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. The people of the Bayan speak as spoke the old women of the Furqan. Say: Shatter the idol of vain imaginings - thus have ye been commanded in the Tablets of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing - when He came with the truth, announcing this manifest Light. Among them are those who cling to fancy, turning away from the Self-Subsisting. When asked by what proof they turned away from the All-Merciful, they speak of tales of old, even while beholding the Sun shining from the horizon of power and the Tongue of Grandeur speaking at every moment.</p>
<p>Some have said that He hath claimed divinity. Say: I lament at this, for He Who came with the truth hath informed creation that everything proclaimeth, “There is none other God but Me, the Forgiving, the Generous.” Verily, he who hath inhaled the fragrance of the Most Merciful’s garment and comprehended what was revealed in the Bayan is assured that He occupieth a station that descriptions cannot ascend unto, nor can mentions attain. Thus hath the matter been decreed in truth from the presence of a powerful, ancient Ordainer.</p>
<p>O Khalil! The people are seen to be sick, not recognizing Him Who would heal their ailments and quench their thirst. Though they have witnessed that all they previously possessed was mere fancy, not a letter of which was fulfilled, nevertheless […]</p>
<p>They cling to countless fancies. If the divine Hand of Power should rend asunder one veil, they would instantly become concealed behind another. By My life, they know not what they say nor perceive to whom they allude. Their hearts have hardened and their eyes are blinded. O friend! Great is the call, but narrow is the throat of the world. The sun is at its zenith of radiance, yet eyes are weak. Would that the people of the Bayan would ponder this blessed word wherein He saith “Behold Him with His own eyes.” I swear by the Most Great Name that the recognition of this single word would suffice all mankind, yet some are deprived and others shall be deprived. For the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - informed the people of the Bayan of this Most Great Revelation and the tribulations that would befall Him, such that they would spend their nights and days in lamentation. Consider now what hath come to pass and what shall yet occur. We are God’s and to Him shall we return.</p>
<p>The wayward ones, by mentioning a fabricated successorship, have prevented and continue to prevent people from the Dawning-Place of guidance, even though were anyone to search the Bayan, he would find no mention of it therein. Yet they cling to it and turn away from Him through a mere gesture of Whose finger successorship and authority and all else above them were established. Such is the condition of the people and their understanding. They are indeed in manifest loss.</p>
<p>Had they gazed upon the Truth with His eyes and acted upon this single word, they would never have been deprived of the eternal springtime nor barred from the outpourings of the ocean of divine unity. Since mention of successorship was, in their estimation, among the most important matters within the community of the Furqan, and people clung to it, they now grasp at it hoping thereby to prevent weak minds from the direction of divine unity. Were it not for the weakness of the people and their lack of understanding, We would have mentioned here that which would have rent asunder the veils, even as We rent asunder what they possessed concerning the mention of the Qa’im, that every person of insight might be convinced that He alone hath been the Beloved of the worlds, and all else was created by His will. He is indeed the most powerful of the powerful ones.</p>
<p>Behold how they have attributed such accusations and calumnies to Him before Whose mention the Primal Point would bow in humility. Still the deluded ones among the people of the Furqan await an imaginary Qa’im who would appear from an imaginary city with conditions they have conceived. Fie upon them and these people! But these are even more veiled than those. They are indeed in grievous delusion.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, O thou who gazeth upon the Countenance and speaketh the truth and calleth out among the people inasmuch as thou hast recognized the purpose of God and turned unto Him with His own eyes. We testify that thou art among them that behold. Rejoice thou in God’s testimony, for naught that hath been created between the heavens and the earth can equal it. We beseech God to preserve you from the enemies of His Self and to strengthen you in His Cause and to bring low your adversaries. Verily He is the Protector of those who love Him, and He is indeed the Almighty over all the worlds.</p>
<p>The letter thou didst send in the name of Allah-u-Mihdi reached Our presence and was the object of Our loving attention. Most excellent was what thou didst mention regarding patience. Blessed is he who is adorned therewith and who in this followeth his wronged Lord Who was imprisoned at the hands of the oppressors.</p>
<p>How excellent is the state of one who hath returned unto God and ascended unto the Supreme Companion, at a time when the denizens of the highest Paradise inhale the fragrance of the Beloved’s love. For such a soul one ought not grieve. We bear witness that he hath ascended unto the Most Glorious Companion and hath attained the lights of his Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High. Rather should one grieve, nay lament and weep, for those who remain imprisoned in this world. Were they to turn even slightly toward the divine decree and consummate wisdom, they would observe with the eye of certainty that whatsoever befalleth the loved ones of God is better for them than all that is in the heavens and the earth, for in all circumstances such souls have been and are treated with the utmost grace and favor. By My life! Were the veil to be rent asunder and were they to behold the Supreme Horizon, they would cast aside their bodies and wing their flight unto that holy, radiant and shining station. In their hardship lieth ease, and in their death lieth life. Well is it with them that understand.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention regarding thy having turned to certain regions and spoken among them of that which is right - excellent is what thou hast done. We beseech God to cause thee to conquer the citadels of the hearts of His servants and guide them to the straight path. Grieve not for what hath befallen thee and what they have said regarding thee. Soon shall they bear witness unto that which they denied, and point to thee with their fingers, saying: “We testify that thou art he who turned toward thy Lord, the Most Merciful, when we were wrapped in heedlessness and rebellion.” They sow for themselves the thorns of loss, yet today they perceive it not. When they awaken they shall cry out for what they have wrought. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. In all circumstances be thou vigilant in affairs, with due regard to wisdom, lest anything arise that might extinguish the fire. Verily thy Lord is the Counselor, the Trustworthy.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings unto My Afnan and give them the glad-tidings of My mention of them in this mighty Tablet. We beseech God to aid them to gaze upon His countenance and to be well-pleased with that which He loveth and which pleaseth Him. Then convey My greetings unto My loved ones. We counsel them to show forth supreme steadfastness, for this Cause is mighty, mighty and great, great. Blessed is he who holdeth fast thereunto in the Cause of his Lord, detached from all else. Thou didst in thy letter convey greetings to the servant who is present before the Throne. When he hath finished transcribing that which hath been revealed from the heaven of grandeur and majesty at this moment, We shall convey greetings unto thee. Verily thy Lord is the Most Great, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>He is God!</p>
<p>I have taken up the pen at this moment, O my God, from Thee, and have placed the ink before Thee, not knowing what Thou desirest to cause to descend upon it and to manifest through it of the wondrous measures of Thy handiwork and the wise counsels of Thy glory. Whether Thou causest to flow from the ink the oceans of Thy grandeur or the rivers of Thy holy oneness - who can prevent Thee in this, O my God? And shouldst Thou manifest from the pen the signs of Thy glorious singleness and the tokens of Thy holy greatness - who can hold Thee back in Thy Cause, O my Beloved? For Thou hast ever been powerful over Thy Cause, mighty in Thy deeds, and supreme in whatsoever Thou willest to bring forth of the wonders of Thy decree, and sovereign in whatsoever Thou desirest to reveal of the decisiveness of Thy Will. To such an extent that wert Thou to gather all names within a single one of Thy names, Thou wouldst be praised in this; and shouldst Thou wish to sanctify it above all that and whatsoever pertaineth to the kingdom of creation and the realm of glory, Thou wouldst be obeyed in Thy Cause and loved in all that proceedeth from Thee and is attributed unto Thee.</p>
<p>And shouldst Thou, O my God, through a single letter thereof, resurrect the cycles of the two weighty ones in the two names - this would be befitting of One like Thee, and none could reject what Thou hast decreed. And wert Thou to move through a single word thereof the ages of the two kings in the two mysteries - this would be a judgment from Thee, and none could prevent what Thou hast ordained. And shouldst Thou take all of this away from it and render it nonexistent, such that no name nor trace nor fruit nor sign would remain thereof - this would be a command from Thy presence, and none could resist what Thou hast caused to flow. Yet by Thy glory, I am not content with any of this and do not wish to turn to anything thereof, except that Thou make me wholly detached unto Thee, returning unto Thee, and pleased with Thee. And this shall come to pass when Thou beholdest my hair dyed with my blood while I am seated upon the dust, my head bare, my feet unshod, my body trembling and my spirit agitated with thirst. Then shall I look to the right and find no helper besides Thee, and turn to the left and behold no succorer other than Thee who might assist me in aught, or give me a drink of water, or accompany me in my distress, or console me in my anguish and tribulation.</p>
<p>Then shall I rise from my place, yet be unable to stand due to the weakness that hath overtaken me, and fall prostrate upon my face in the dust once again, calling out to Thee at that moment in my inmost heart: “O my Beloved! Hast Thou accepted from me and art Thou pleased with me?” And Thou shalt answer me: “O My beloved! Blessed art thou in having fulfilled thy covenant and kept thy pledge.” Thereupon shall I swoon before Thee from the profusion of blood flowing from my veins, such that the entire earth shall be reddened thereby, and I shall remain in my swoon for a duration that none can reckon save Thee. And after my spirit returneth, I shall commune with Thee in the most hidden recesses of my heart without letter, sound or mention, or Thou shalt speak through my tongue with the evident tokens of Thy mercy, without description, attribute or symbol, lest anyone discover the stations Thou hast concealed in the hidden repositories of Thy Cause and the pavilions of Thy glory. Then shall there appear before me he whom Thou hast made the most wretched of servants in all lands and the most misguided of people in guidance, that he might sever my head and raise it upon […]</p>
<p>By Your glory! After my spirit soared into the holy atmosphere of Thy Essence and my light ascended to the horizon of the heaven of Thy Oneness, then did I traverse the firmament of the gems of existence and journey through the realms of pure manifestation. And I declared: “How pleasing to me, O my Beloved, are the wonders of Thy mercy! How blessed, O my Heart’s Desire, are the ornaments of Thy tenderness!” And I sang with a melody that drew forth the gems of existence, and chanted with a tune that gladdened the pure ones in their slumber. All this was a bounty from Thee unto me and an honor bestowed upon me from Thy presence, wherewith I take pride in the kingdom of Thy Cause and the dominion of Thy creation.</p>
<p>I testify this day that Thou hast fulfilled all that I asked of Thee, granted all that I desired of Thee, and accomplished all that I hoped from Thee. For Thou art too exalted and too great to delay in what Thou art called upon to do, too glorious and too gracious to alter what Thou art beseeched and hoped for. Nay, Thou hast ordained for me what was never ordained for anyone before me, and caused to flow what shall never flow for any soul after me. Yet none save Thee can know this, and no one but Thyself can reckon it. For just as Thou canst not be perceived by eyes, likewise Thy deeds cannot be comprehended by thoughts. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Compelling.</p>
<p>All this was revealed at the time when Thou didst cause me to hear the disputation of Thy servants regarding my station, after Thou hadst ordained for me no station save servitude to Thyself, humility before the gate of Thy mercy, and lowliness before the manifestations of the lights of Thy countenance. For Thou hast ever been sovereign over me, and I have ever been a servant before Thy face. I was master of myself yet owned by Thee, abased before Thy presence, insignificant before Thy sovereignty, non-existent before the manifestation of Thy power, and nullified before the revelation of the lights of Thy eternal might.</p>
<p>This is to the shame of those who seek to spread corruption in Thy land, to exalt themselves in Thy domains, and to bring about in the kingdom that which was not ordained for their own selves and stations. Glorified, glorified art Thou above all this and above whatsoever I have attributed to Thee! For Thou canst not be comprehended so as to be described, nor known so as to be characterized. Rather, this servant of Thine is a servant to those who serve Thee, prostrate before those who prostrate themselves to Thee, a servant to those who serve Thy Cause, submissive to Thy sovereignty, a helper to those who seek Thee, and an aid to those who aid Thee in Thy heaven and desire to assist Thee in Thy lands.</p>
<p>By Thy glory! I find for myself no greater honor than this, no higher station than this. And whoever carries in his heart ardent longing for Thee and passion in Thy love will recognize the love wherewith Thou hast honored me through the gems of Thy mercy and pure bounty. He will inhale from this rose-leaf the fragrant breezes of the garden of immortality and the sweet scents of the city of faithfulness, and will witness how this candle melts and dissolves in the lamp of his heart through what hath befallen it and descended upon it in the Cause of its Lord.</p>
<p>Glorified, glorified art Thou, O my Beloved! If at this moment Thou wouldst accept from me what I have mentioned of what Thou hast taught me through Thy generosity and caused to flow through my pen by Thy grace, then I would do what befitteth Thy station and perform what beseemeth Thy grace and favor - as a manifestation of Thy generosity and honor toward Thy servant, though I deserve none of this and am not worthy of less than this. For all my limbs have been occupied with other than Thee and have been heedless of Thy remembrance. Yet how could I be worthy to recall the wonders of Thy favors and the outpourings of Thy glorious mercy, or […]</p>
<p>I ascribe my inability to count the gems of Thy bounty and the essences of Thy bestowals, for how can an eye that hath turned to other than Thee be worthy to behold the revelations of the lights of Thine eternity? And how can a heart occupied with anyone but Thee be capable of recalling the tokens of Thy glory and oneness? And how can a tongue that hath spoken other than Thy name be worthy to speak that which Thou hast spoken upon the throne of Thy Lordship? And how can feet that have moved in paths other than Thy good-pleasure ever approach the precincts of the sanctity of Thy meeting? And how can ears that have heard verses other than Thine be capable of hearing the enchanting melodies of the Dove of Thy oneness or delight in the mention of the letters of Thy eternal glory? By Thy might! At such a time my wings are clipped by the assaults of Thy decree for what I have committed before Thee, and I shall never be able to soar to the canopy of the heaven of grace and the gardens of primordial glory. Therefore it behooveth the King of Thy mercy to raise up this servant through the power of Thy will to the summit of the heavens of Thine eternity, and to cause this sinner to ascend unto the horizon of the heaven of Thy oneness and the inmost heart of the paradise of Thy forgiveness and pardon, that thereby the dwellers of the realm of divinity may remember him in the ascents of grandeur and the denizens of the Kingdom may be stirred in the pavilions of infallibility. Glorified, glorified art Thou, O my God! How wondrous are the marvels of Thy handiwork in my affair which Thou hast caused to flow from this Pen of mine, whereby I behold at one time that Thou causest it to rise from the dayspring of words, and there floweth from it the sweet water of life without cessation, delay or hindrance, as though it had counted all things in their places and had set in motion all possibilities and what they contain, and all created things and what lieth upon them, by a movement from its mouth; and at another time I behold that Thou veilest it in the setting-place of allusions and concealest it in the darkness of symbols, whereupon it becometh still in its motion as though it were powerless over anything. Exalted be Thy power in Thy dominion, and glorified be Thy grandeur in Thy lands, and triumphant be Thy might over Thy servants! At such a time, when the matter hath reached this station before Thee, it behooveth me to return the utterance to another strain, that haply thereby the servants may ascend unto the Most Exalted Horizon and the all-glorious canopy. And now the tablet is ended, though the degrees of yearning in the breast of the Dove and the stations of ardor in the heart of faithfulness are not complete. But since it is finished and concluded, I seal this remembrance with the declaration that there is no God but Him, and that the Most Exalted Beauty is His light and His radiance, and the Holy Countenance is His glory and His beauty, and the Temple of Light is His essence and His lamp. We, verily, are all assured of them.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath revealed Himself unto all created things through the light that hath shone forth, risen, gleamed and flashed from the horizon of the heaven of His prevailing Will. Thereupon did the Names tremble, all things were drawn forth, and the Dove cooed upon the Ultimate Tree. Verily, there is none other God but Him Who is established upon the Most Great Throne. He, verily, is the Lord of eternity and the Sovereign of nations. He, verily, is the Dawning-Place of God’s revelation, the Treasury of God’s knowledge, and the Dayspring of God’s wisdom. Through Him was the heaven of religions cleft asunder, the earth of idle fancies rent apart, the mountains of vain imaginings swept away, and the sun of knowledge shone forth through His Name, the Self-Subsisting. Exalted be the Possessor of all that was and shall be, Who through a single word caused all who are in the heavens and on earth to swoon away, save those who have cast away all else and held fast to the Sure Handle. These are among the people of Baha between earth and heaven, who dwell in the Crimson Ark. The Concourse on High and the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise who circle round the Throne every morn and eve pray for them. Praise be to God Who hath made the Word itself the Most Great Trump and the Mightiest Bugle, whereby He hath distinguished between all created things and united those who have detached themselves from all directions, turning toward the Most Sublime Horizon and the Most Exalted, Most Resplendent Station. These are honored servants and upright men who speak not until He hath spoken and who act by His command, whom the blame of the blamer cannot turn aside from the Cause of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant hath been honored to receive your letters time and again, and hath found in every word thereof evidence of your arising to serve God and your steadfastness in His love, after the feet of the learned had slipped, the hearts of the mystics were troubled, and the skin of the divines crept with fear. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist you, protect you, and grant you at all times the water of everlasting life, and to make you one who speaks forth His Name amidst all possibilities. Verily, He is the Almighty over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant submits that he was repeatedly blessed to see your handwriting and had prepared one petition at the time of the return of the honored beloved, Mulla ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God. That petition was lost, meaning it was submerged in the seas of papers, writings and books gathered in this evanescent servant’s place, and until now this servant has not had the opportunity to search for and find it. Therefore, he has newly undertaken to submit this petition. This servant’s occupation has reached such a point that he has not a moment’s rest. We beseech God to assist me in this most great service. Were it not for God’s grace and favor, I would surely be among the impotent ones.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning his honor the revered Aqa Mirza Siyyid ’Abdu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God, that he intended to present a petition to the Most Holy Court but at that moment a sneeze occurred and for that reason he desisted - the details were presented to the Most Holy Court, that is, the exact words which you wrote from his tongue were presented before His countenance. He spoke, and His word is the truth: “Verily, he is the one who is mentioned in the prison and is under the gaze of his Lord, the Protector, the Forgiving, the Generous. We read his letter before he wrote a single letter. Verily his Lord, the All-Knowing, is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. There hath been inscribed upon the tablet of his heart, by the Pen of Divine craftsmanship, the remembrance of God and His love. We have witnessed this and We were among those who read it. Glad-tidings be unto him for having heard the Call and responded to his Lord on a day whereon all in the worlds were thunderstruck save whom God, the Almighty, the Powerful, willed.”</p>
<p>As for the sneeze, in the Most Holy Court such matters are not considered, and the execution of good deeds has never been and is not contingent upon a sneeze or the lack thereof. However, since he acted with wisdom in view, there was and is no harm in it. We have accepted it from him as a token of Our grace and We ordain for him what We desire and We pray for his supreme steadfastness in this most grievous and momentous Cause. Say: Be thou assured of God’s grace and mercy, for verily He is the Protector of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding the distinguished Leaf, upon her be the Glory of God, especially a Tablet was previously revealed in her name from the heaven of divine bounty and was sent, and likewise in these days a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was newly revealed in her name and was sent in the care of his honor Dahji. Her petition was also presented at the Most Holy Court and was accepted. How blessed is she, how fortunate is she! Similarly, a Tablet was also specifically revealed for your honor and the Leaf, your wife, upon her be the Glory of God, and four unnamed Tablets and another Tablet which was in the name of one of the loved ones were sent in the company of the honored beloved, his honor Mulla ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, to be delivered to your honor. We beseech God to honor you with meeting with and visiting these Tablets.</p>
<p>The petition of his honor the son, upon him be the Glory of God, was presented at the Most Holy Court. In truth, he had presented it with the utmost love, attraction, eagerness and longing. The Ancient Beauty, after hearing it, expressed countless tokens of favor and a Tablet was also specifically revealed and sent for him. We beseech God to assist him and aid him and to make in his breath a healing and a mighty influence for curing the ills of hearts and souls, and likewise to make him a translator that he may translate the verses of God. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Giver, the Munificent, the Ordainer, the Protector, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>With regard to what you had previously written, that someone among the mathematical scholars had inquired of His Holiness concerning the celestial spheres, planets, their movements and influences - this was presented at the Most Holy Court. He - exalted be His mention - said: “O ?a before Sin! If people were not heedless and would turn to the Dawning-Place of divine knowledge with such questions and beyond, verily all hidden knowledge would become manifest and visible. The grace of God is such that He does not cause any soul to despair, but souls have become veils unto themselves and soar on the wings of idle fancies. How many scholars in the Land of Mystery [Adrianople], this land [Akka], and during the sojourn in Iraq asked questions about various branches of knowledge. Answers to all descended from the heaven of divine knowledge in such wise that none could raise objections, yet none of those souls attained the ocean of inner meanings. How many philosophers inquired about the sayings of ancient philosophers, yet after the dawning of the Sun of Wisdom and their acknowledgment of it, remained veiled. By God! My Most Exalted Pen desires only to speak of that which the Point of the Bayan foretold - verily there is no God but Me, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>
<p>However, during the days in Iraq, a Tablet was revealed from the heaven of God’s Will concerning these matters. This servant will present what is remembered from it. Among other things, in that Tablet nineteen planets were mentioned, and He stated that the full account had not yet been given. What was mentioned therein about the heavens and celestial spheres was different from what people commonly describe. In any case, He commanded the Most Great Branch - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the most precious dust of His footsteps - to write a commentary on these matters. God willing, it will be sent later, but as He is currently occupied, it has been delayed. The treatise which was previously written concerning the governance of cities is with Mulla ’Ali-Akbar - you will observe it.</p>
<p>God the One is witness that if this servant were to be continuously engaged in mentioning you without interruption or delay, neither pen nor heart would find rest from longing and yearning. It is known that the water of remembrance does not extinguish the fire of love, but rather increases its heat. As for what you mentioned in the Tablet of Ridvan which ascended to God, by your life, by your life, there has been revealed for it from the heaven of your Lord’s grace that which will never be erased from the book of possibility. Verily our Lord is the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>To Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Fadlu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God, I send countless greetings. God willing, may they be engaged at all times in the remembrance and praise of God with the utmost joy and fragrance. The people of the prison, God willing, do not forget one another. We beseech God to strengthen him and strengthen me in all conditions. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. All the people of the prison send their greetings to them. The Two Most Great Branches - may my spirit and the spirit of all in the worlds be sacrificed for their most pure footsteps - remember you with most wondrous, greatest, most exalted greetings, as do the members of the divine pavilion of infallibility and the Afnan of the divine Lote-Tree - all send their greetings to you. May glory and spirit and remembrance and praise be upon you and those with you.</p>

<p>In the name of our Lord, the Most Invincible, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who created all things through a single word and gathered them in one plane. Then the Call was raised from the Treasury of Grandeur: “Am I not your Lord?” Among them were those who turned away at the mere hearing, and among them were those who turned towards it and exclaimed: “Yea, verily, yea, O Lord of Names! Yea, verily, yea, O Creator of the heavens!” Those who turned towards it at the moment of hearing are the people of Baha. The tongues of all pens fall short of their mention. These are the servants whom God hath described in His Books, His Psalms, His Scrolls, and through the tongues of His Prophets, His Chosen Ones, and His Messengers. These are servants who speak not of their own accord, nor move according to their own desires; rather, the winds of God’s Will move them as they please, and God’s Purpose causes them to speak as He desires. By God’s life! They speak that which hath been revealed in the Book and pursue that which they have been commanded in the Tablets. They transgress not their bounds and stations, and confine their affairs to the remembrance of God and the service of His Cause. Blessed are they and joy be unto them! Through them the horizons were illumined and the Covenant was made manifest, and through them was raised the standard of Justice on the Day of Separation. I beseech God, exalted be He, to confirm all His loved ones as He confirmed them, and to assist His servants as He assisted them. Woe unto those whom the world hath prevented from turning to God, the Possessor of all things! Such as these have clung to their desires and turned away from their Creator. Through their tyranny the dwellers of the cities of Names have lamented and the Concourse on High have cried out. They have been heedless of that for which they were created and have clung to that which they were forbidden. The servant beseeches his Omnipotent Lord to protect all from these who have gone astray and led others astray, who have followed the opinions of every divine who hath pronounced judgment against God and every mystic who hath turned away from Him when He came with a sovereignty that encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Praise be to God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment!</p>
<p>Thereafter, the morn of reunion hath breathed when thy letter arrived, and the night of separation hath darkened upon beholding thy traces. When I opened it, saw it, read it and understood it, such joy and gladness took hold of me that I found myself unable to describe them, for it was adorned with the mention of God, embellished with His praise, and from it wafted the fragrance of His love. When I recognized this, I soared on wings of longing to a station illumined by the lights of dawning. When I entered and attained His presence, the face of the Beloved turned toward this servant and asked about the letter. Thereupon I presented before the Throne what was inscribed therein. When this was completed, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which was a spirit to the body of the world and insight to the nations. Glorified be His grandeur! He said:</p>
<p>O Mahmud! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious. Verily, He calleth thee and maketh mention of thee from His praiseworthy station. He it is Who hath mentioned thee, caused thee to hear, given thee knowledge, and made thee speak His praise when every veiled scholar turned away from Him. We have made mention of thee and do make mention of thee at this time wherein the Wronged One is established upon the throne of His Name, the Self-Subsisting. Be thankful unto God for having opened unto thee the gate of heaven and for having enabled thee to recognize thy Lord when He came with manifest sovereignty. Take the chalice of joy in the name of the Lord of the Manifestation, then drink thereof that He may render thee detached from all that hath come upon thee from the parties. Verily thy Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Loving, the All-Forgiving. Do the affairs of earth grieve thee while thou hearest the call of the Lord of Heaven from the direction of His renowned prison? Verily, We behold thee and commune with thee, and We have heard that which thy tongue hath uttered. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen!</p>
<p>O Mahmud! God willing, thou shalt drink from the Euphrates of divine mercy and receive thy portion from the Kawthar of inner meanings. Tribulations and afflictions have ever been the lot of God’s chosen ones. Consider what hath befallen this Wronged One. By the pearls of the divine ocean of knowledge, in those days when the Ancient Beauty was in the hands of the heedless ones, each day fresh trials descended upon Him, the mere mention of which melteth the hearts of His loved ones. Throughout the nights they would conspire to shed the blood of the Wronged One, and during the day they would utter that which was unworthy. They were heedless of the fact that the hand of divine power protecteth the hidden treasure and delivereth not the concealed mystery into the hands of the treacherous before its time of revelation.</p>
<p>O Mahmud! God is aware of what hath befallen thee. In truth, there hath befallen thee what befell the Best-Beloved of the world. However, these tribulations have come to pass for a mighty, a most mighty purpose. Thou shouldst render thanks with a thousand tongues, and with the tongue of thine inner being utter these exalted words which have shone forth from the Dayspring of divine knowledge:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! I have heard Thy call and hastened unto Thee. I have inhaled the fragrance of Thy garment and have departed from my homeland until I attained unto Thy presence. Thou hast enabled me, O my God, to partake of the Kawthar of Thy reunion before the manifestation of Thy Cause and Thy Revelation. I beseech Thee, O Creator of the heavens and God of all names, by Thy Name through which Thou hast revealed Thyself unto all who are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth, and hast guided Thy servants to the ocean of Thy bounty, to ordain for me that which shall profit me in all Thy worlds. Thou seest, O my God, how tribulation hath touched me and affliction hath overtaken me, while I hold fast to the cord of Thy grace and declare that Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Bountiful, the Ever-Forgiving, the Gracious. Write down for me, then, with Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall gladden me in the precincts of Thy mercy and shall cause me to attain unto Thy good-pleasure. Thou knowest me better than I know myself, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>And concerning what was written about Karbila’i Mustafa, it was presented, and these hidden pearls appeared from the treasury of divine utterance. He - exalted be His glory - saith: […]</p>
<p>O Mustafa! The Lord of Names remembers you in the prison of Akka that you may rejoice and be among the thankful ones. The letter from him who sought Me has arrived, and therein was mention of you. We remembered you when the sea of thy Lord’s mercy surged. Beware lest the affairs of men withhold thee from the Truth. Forsake all else through My Name, the All-Powerful, the Mighty. Behold, then remember what the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur’an through His words: “The Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds.” This is the Day wherewith We have given glad tidings to Our servants through the tongues of the Prophets and Messengers. We said: Lead forth the people from darkness unto light and give them glad tidings of the Days of God. Thus doth My Most Exalted Pen make mention unto thee that thou mayest be among the steadfast. Hold fast unto My Book which hath been sent down from the heaven of My Will, then act in accordance with what thou hast been commanded by One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Remember Mustafa who was martyred in the land of Ta for the Cause of God, the Manifestation of this wondrous Cause. O My Most Exalted Pen! Turn thy face toward him who was named Mahmud and say: O Mahmud! Behold and remember My servant in the land of Ta when the oppressors gathered round about him and commanded him to deny God and repent of the Cause before which all in the heavens and earth have bowed down. He stood firm in the Cause and demonstrated the greatest steadfastness by Our command and through Our power in such wise as amazed the Concourse on High and those who dwell behind the ocean of grandeur. Verily thy Lord is the All-Remembering, the All-Wise. He makes mention of him who spoke My name and was afflicted with tribulations for My sake. My mercy hath preceded all created things, yet most people are heedless. We revealed Ourselves unto him at the time of his ascension unto Us, as attesteth he who possesseth a preserved tablet. By My life! The might of every oppressor did not frighten him. He spoke My name and hastened to the place of sacrifice through My love, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. The glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon him and upon those who attained his exalted station and took refuge in the stronghold of their Lord’s loving-kindness, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Jinab-i-Rida, upon him be the Glory of God, he has been shown favor time and again. There hath befallen him what befell those near unto God, the sincere ones, and the pure in heart - nay, what befell God Himself, our Purpose and his Purpose, our Beloved and his Beloved. I have heard with mine own ears concerning him that which no treasures can equal. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, that whatsoever is truly beneficial for him may appear from the horizon of the unseen. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. In all circumstances, he should keep his gaze fixed upon wisdom and hold fast unto it, for in most Tablets the decree of wisdom hath been revealed. Assuredly if that which hath been sent down from the heaven of divine knowledge were to be acted upon, the doors of ease and joy would be opened before the faces of all servants. He should not be disheartened, and surely he will be seen in complete joy. The True One is imprisoned, and his prisoner is imprisoned. Soon will the prison doors be opened, even as they were opened through might and power. Verily He is the Strong, the Triumphant, the Mighty, the Wise. Convey greetings on my behalf to all his relatives who are turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about his honor my brother, upon him be the Glory of God, his letters have been arriving continuously. I beseech God, exalted be He, to grant him the best reward and to confirm him in that which He loves and is pleased with. Recently another letter arrived from him which was the cause of boundless joy. God willing, may he ever be confirmed in this blessed deed. The Glory be upon you from God, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful, and praise be to God, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who is Sacred, Exalted, Inaccessible, Forgiving, and Generous</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who has strengthened His loved ones through tribulation and elevated their station through the manifestation of trials in the kingdom of creation, that He might test those who claim belief and who confess with their tongues His singleness and oneness. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Helper. And praise be to God Who has made His firm Cause the supreme touchstone whereby He distinguishes between the pure in heart and the wicked, according to His exalted Word: “Do men think when they say ‘We believe’ they shall be let alone and not be put to proof?” Nay, nay! This is a Day wherein the secrets of hearts are tried and that which is hidden in the breasts is revealed, even as was revealed to the Beloved of the Ascension: “Though it be of the weight of a grain of mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth.” This is a Day wherein the faces of the idolaters are blackened and the faces of those who have turned to the horizon of certitude in the days of the All-Merciful are made white.</p>
<p>And praise be to God Who has caused the Most Great Trump to appear and has breathed into it through My Most Glorious Name. Thereupon, those who dwell in the cities of names and the people of the kingdom of creation were thunderstruck. Some remained unconscious, while others, having recovered, turned toward the Lord of the Day of Separation. Blessed is he who has today held fast to God and has not broken the Covenant. He is indeed of the people of this Horizon which God has made the Sovereign of horizons and the Dawning-Place of all splendors.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, to Whom the essence of unity bears witness by being sanctified from it, and the reality of glorification by being exalted above it. He is indeed the One Who cannot be mentioned by numbers nor counted among quantities. He is unified in His Own Self with a unity unknown to His servants, and is sanctified in His Own Being with a sanctification that the people of all lands shall never attain.</p>
<p>When He desired to distinguish between the nations, He spoke between the worlds through His Most Great Name. Thereupon the lights were drawn to their source, the signs to their dawning-place, the evidences to their fountainhead, the evil ones to their abode and destination, and the wicked to their origin. Thereby appeared the greatest distinction among mankind. Some turned to God, detached from all else, hastened to the horizon of unity, and drank from the hands of their Lord’s bounty the water of sanctification. Others turned away from the All-Merciful and faced toward Satan by virtue of what they had previously earned. And still others acknowledged God and then denied Him, retreating until they reached their origin in the abyss of wrath–a station which God has deprived of the breezes of His days and the fragrances of His garment. We testify that such a one is a yellowed, dried leaf moved by the wind however it wills. There is no God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who has adorned the heads of His chosen ones with the crown of hardship and tribulation, and has embellished their temples with the ornament of trials in the path of His Name that is sanctified above all names. He has made the prison a prisoner for those who have denied God, the Lord of the Throne and earth and of the supreme Paradise, while making it the most exalted Paradise for the people of Baha who have remained firm upon the Crimson Ark with such steadfastness that neither the allusions of the limiting ones nor the arguments of the followers of blind imitation could cause them to slip. By God’s life! They are servants whom calamities cannot prevent from God, the Revealer of verses. The Concourse on High and the denizens of the Kingdom of eternity pray for them. My soul be a sacrifice for their steadfastness! They are the ones through whom the horizon of certitude has been illumined, the countenance of faith has beamed with joy, and assurance has appeared in all existence. By God! They are the steadfast ones whom neither slumber nor sleep overtakes, nor are they veiled by any barrier or measure. Their feet are like iron and […]</p>
<p>Their tongues are as swords wherewith they vindicate God amidst the concourse of creation. Upon them be the glory of God in the first and the last. There is no God but He, the One, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Bestower. And now, O loved ones of the All-Merciful! By God, your imprisonment hath grieved Me, your tribulations have weakened Me, and the burning of your hearts hath consumed Me. All this hath, from one perspective, saddened Me, yet from another, that which hath befallen you hath brought Me joy - a joy which no earthly happiness can match - for adversity hath touched you in His path, and tribulation hath seized you for His love and remembrance. He who is adorned with the ornament of justice speaketh and saith: “Would that I had been with the loved ones of God, and that there had befallen me what hath befallen them in the love of God, the Creator of earth and heaven!”</p>
<p>I address you in Persian that all the friends of God may hear the petition of this evanescent servant and not be saddened by what hath befallen them in the path of the Beloved of the worlds. Blessed is the state of one who is today adorned with the coloring of God. God, exalted be His glory and magnified be His grandeur, hath chosen imprisonment, and whosoever is afflicted thereby must in truth give thanks to the true Ordainer, for it hath befallen him for the sake of God what befell the very Self of God. This form of imprisonment is today more beloved than all that hath been created on earth and is truly sanctified above all the forms with which people are afflicted. For instance, the mystics are today veiled from the Purpose of the worlds by their mysticism, and likewise the learned are deprived of the Known One by their learning, and some are heedless of the Creator of earth and heaven due to names, wandering in the wilderness of error and delusion. Give thanks to the Beloved of the world that ye have drunk from the cup of tribulations in His path and quaffed from the chalice of trials. Blessed are ye, again blessed are ye! Yours is a goodly reward from God, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Through your sorrows joy appeareth in the world, and through your grief surgeth the ocean of gladness amidst the peoples.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I beseech God, exalted and mighty be He, to aid this servant and you to preserve what He hath bestowed, that we may all walk with utmost eagerness and yearning in the path of harmony and unity, and hold fast to the firm cord of divine wisdom that hath been sent down in the heavenly tablets. Let us implore with complete humility that He may keep these servants firm and steadfast in His love and Cause, for this is the Day whereon secrets are tried, and the commanding self is aflame, as we have seen and heard that certain souls who considered themselves to be of the Kingdom of certitude and were outwardly adorned with the ornament of faith, and who in their own estimation had attained the highest degree of knowledge and displayed the utmost humility and submissiveness in their petitions to the Most Holy Court, and likewise in their letters to this servant - nevertheless, due to a vain imagination, transgressed the firm commandment of God and became occupied with their own desires. May God protect us and you from the evil of such people and from their deceit and craftiness. These matters have been mentioned so that all the friends who are gazing toward the All-Merciful may not fall prey to the snares of certain crafty souls. Verily He is the Protector, He is the Guide, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>O imprisoned brother, that is, his honor Aqa Abdul-Baqi! God willing, may you ever be manifest with steadfastness and be adorned with trials in the path of Truth. Your letter arrived and brought the utmost joy, and all that was written therein became known, and the names that were sent arrived. Your mention and that of the other prisoners is continually remembered before the Throne. Blessed are you for having attained to this most exalted, most impregnable, most holy, most mighty, wondrous and invincible station. Convey on behalf of this evanescent servant sublime greetings to all the friends and say: Blessed are you for having attained the wine of tribulation in the path of God, the Lord of Names; and blessed are you for having turned to the Face in the Kingdom of Creation; then blessed are you for having outstripped all creation in recognizing God, the King of the Kingdom of eternity, and for being with His Name, the Beauty, morning and evening. By the Truth itself, were I to repeat the word ‘blessed’ unto the end that hath no end, it would still be little compared to the enkindling of your hearts in the love of God, our Lord and the Lord of the heavens and earths. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about his honor Aqa Siyyid Hasan, the special deputy of the Most Holy Branch - may my spirit be a sacrifice for the dust of His footsteps - that he had sent a dagger: it arrived. Convey greetings on behalf of this evanescent servant to him and to Muhammad Beg who were mentioned in your letter. God willing, may all attain to divine bounties and remain steadfast in His Cause. Today steadfastness is beloved. Consider Mir Abdul-Baqi: he attained the honor of faith and dwelt beneath the shadow of the Face, then through the buzzing of a fly became deprived of the cooing of the Dove. We beseech God to grant him success in returning and to preserve His loved ones from the evil of those who have denied God, the Lord of the seen and unseen. Let all the friends in the Land of Ta study this letter, and likewise send a copy thereof to the Land of Kaf, and convey greetings on my behalf to the friends in that land. Upon them be the glory of God, and upon them be the fragrances of God and His mercy which hath preceded all worlds. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most High, the Help in Peril!</p>
<p>O thou who hast questioned thy Lord aforetime, and whom God hath answered through His grace - verily He is the One Who is asked, the Answerer!</p>
<p>O questioner! Know thou that there hath come before Us a letter from him who hath been set aflame with the fire of God, and therein We found mention of thee. Therefore have We sprinkled upon thee from the drops of the ocean of eternity from the direction of Paradise, that it may purify thee from all the doubts of creation, may detach thee wholly unto God, and may cause thee to speak His praise amongst the worlds.</p>
<p>Know thou then that We answered thee aforetime concerning what thou didst ask of God, thy Lord, through veils and coverings. At times We showed thee the lights of the Countenance from behind seventy thousand veils, and at times We concealed them, for in those days We found the knowledge of the servants at the stage of a mere drop, and We found none who could bear God’s Trust - the Trust of the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Powerful. Therefore did We hold back the Pen and loosed not its reins save according to a determined measure. And We reared a numbered few through the sovereignty of might and power. When they attained unto what thy Lord desired, We then clothed them with the flesh of certitude and brought forth another creation in the love of thy Lord. Blessed be God, the Sovereign of the mighty, and the Best of creators!</p>
<p>Verily, for all things there is an appointed time with thy Lord. When the promise cometh, He revealeth it through truth and sendeth down upon it what He hath ordained. Verily, He hath power over whatsoever He willeth. Although every word that hath been sent down from Our presence is sufficient for all contingent things and therein are treasured the pearls of wisdom, blessed is he who casteth therein the bucket of knowledge, from which the youth of inner meanings draweth it forth, and thereby becometh independent of all the worlds.</p>
<p>We have ordained for the servants a portion from every word according to their capacity. Blessed is he who taketh his portion and is not among the deprived. However, We have ordained the manifestation of the Word and what hath been ordained therein among the servants according to measures decreed by One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. We have made its own self the veil of its countenance, and thus were We powerful to do so. Were it to be revealed unto the servants in its fullness, none could bear it; nay, all who are in the heavens and earth would flee from it.</p>
<p>Behold what was revealed unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God. Verily, at the time of its revelation, there were ordained for it treasuries of meanings as befitted it from the presence of One mighty and powerful. But the people knew it only according to their ranks and stations, and likewise He unveiled not unto them the countenance of wisdom save according to their capacity and strength, even though thou witnessest the Word to be of one nature, wherein nothing hath been diminished nor increased. When the people attained unto maturity, it was revealed unto them in its fullness in the year sixty, when the Ancient Beauty appeared with the name of ’Ali before Nabil.</p>
<p>Verily, were We to expound this station fully, neither tablets nor pens would suffice, and thy Lord is witness unto this. Be thou assured that in every Dispensation thy Lord revealeth Himself unto the servants according to their measure. Consider, for example, the sun: when it riseth above its horizon, its heat and effect are slight, and these increase degree by degree that created things may gradually grow accustomed to it, until it reacheth its zenith. Then it descendeth according to ordained degrees until it setteth in its setting-place. All this is of God’s wisdom, if ye be of those who know. Were it to appear suddenly at the midpoint of heaven, its heat would harm created things. Thus observe thou the Sun of Meanings, that thou mayest be among those who are endowed with insight. For were it to rise forth […]</p>
<p>When the Dawn of the Manifestation shines forth with the lights which God hath ordained for it, the earth of mystic knowledge shall be consumed in the hearts of the servants, for they shall neither be able to bear them nor reflect them, but shall be disturbed by them and become as if they had ceased to exist. Therefore it shineth upon them according to their capacity and receptivity, even as ye witnessed at the beginning of the Manifestation of your Lord, the Most Exalted, in the year sixty, when He appeared at first in the garment of the Bab. At this station the drop of acceptance and capacity in all things ascended to become a clot, then He changed the garment to that of divine authority and raised all created things to the state of embryo, and the gradual progression continued through His sovereignty until He brought them to the station of another creation. Then did He manifest Himself unto them through the name of Divine Lordship and proclaimed: “Verily, I am God! There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Exalted, the All-Knowing!” But today there hath appeared such grace that were all created things to encounter it for less than a moment, it would raise them to a station whereof the Pen of Creation and the tongues of all the worlds are powerless to make mention. For such a Lord beseemeth the glorification of the Concourse of Eternity, and the magnification of the denizens of the Supreme Paradise, and the sanctification of the Company of the Near Ones.</p>
<p>Know thou moreover that if thy Lord should wish to raise all created things from the state of a drop to maturity in less than the twinkling of an eye, He would verily be able to do so through His all-pervading, all-encompassing power. Yet He hath loved to cause all things to progress through their ordained stages and gradual development, according to a wisdom which none save His all-compelling, all-informed Self hath comprehended.</p>
<p>Know thou moreover that God, thy Lord, hath ever been in one condition, neither ascending nor descending, and likewise His Self-Manifestation in that station. Exalted is He above whatsoever the servants attribute to Him from their own understanding; exalted is He above the description of every discerning describer. All words are equal in His sight - He exalteth them at one time and abaseth them at another, and He shall not be questioned about what He doeth. He is verily the Almighty, the All-Powerful. When He saith “I am but a servant,” He thereby educateth the manifestations of servitude, and likewise observe regarding the station of the Bab and beyond that, until it culminateth in “I am God, the Sovereign, the Just, the Wise.” The relation of all these stations to His exalted Self is equal. Nay, shouldst thou observe with the eye of God, thou wouldst witness them all as creation within His dominion, appearing through His prevailing, mighty, and wise command. Ponder thou upon this Tablet, and when thou attainest unto what is treasured therein, arise and give glad tidings unto the servants, that perchance they may arise from slumber and be numbered among those possessed of true knowledge.</p>
<p>O Khalil! When the appointed time of concealment was fulfilled, We unveiled from the Most Hidden Mystery, veiled by mystery, unto pure truth, a secret less than can be numbered. Thereupon the Manifestations of Names were thunderstruck, and all who are in the heavens and earth were terrified, save those whose hearts were assured by the lights of God and whose eyes were opened by the light of certitude. Say: O people! Look not upon Me except through Mine eye if ye desire to know God and His power. Without this ye shall never know Me, even should ye ponder My Cause throughout the duration of the Kingdom and observe all things with the permanence of God, the King, the Powerful, the Everlasting, the All-Wise. Thus do We expound the Cause that perchance the people may become aware within themselves and be of them that know.</p>
<p>Consider thou the condition of these people after they had all testified that I had sacrificed Myself and My kindred in the path of God and to preserve their faith. I remained among the enemies in days when all souls were agitated and they concealed their faces from friends and foes alike, being occupied with preserving themselves. We manifested the Cause and raised it to a station where all acknowledged the sovereignty and power of God, except those who harbored rancor against this Youth in their breasts and were of the idolaters. Yet despite this Revelation that hath encompassed all created things, and this Radiance the like of which they have never heard in all regions, the people of the Bayan opposed Me. Among them was he who turned away from the Path, denied Him in Whom he had believed, and rebelled against God, the Almighty, the Supreme, the Most Great.</p>
<p>Among them was he who halted at the Path and made God’s Cause contingent, in his simplicity, upon the testimony of one who was created by My Word, whereby his deeds came to naught, though he perceived it not. And among them was he who measured God’s Self by his own self, whom names so deceived that he rose against My face, pronounced sentence of death against Me, and attributed to Me all that was within himself. Therefore do I give thanks in My sorrow and grief to Him Who created Me and sent Me forth, and I praise Him in His decrees and in My loneliness and My trials among these heedless ones. I have been patient and continue to be patient in adversity, trusting in God, and I say:</p>
<p>O My Lord! Guide the servants to the court of Thy bounty and gifts, and deprive them not of the wonders of Thy grace and favors, for they know not what Thou hast intended for them of Thy mercy that hath preceded all creation. O My Lord! These are the weak in public and orphans in private, and Thou art the Generous, the Lord of surpassing bounty, the Most Great. Deal not severely with them, O My God, but regard them until the time befitting Thy wondrous mercy, that perchance they may return unto Thee and seek forgiveness for that which they have committed in Thy presence. Verily Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>And thou, O Khalil, remember My loneliness and My exile, then My imprisonment and My trials, and be of them that remember. Then mention this to the people purely for the sake of God, that through thee may be quickened the hearts of those who have died from the severity of the Cause and are numbered among the dead. Thus have We commanded thee and conveyed unto thee a clear message. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee in the Cause of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>At this hour, which is one hour and twenty minutes into the night of Thursday, the 22nd of Dhu’l-Hijjih, a call was raised from the Supreme Concourse, and this evanescent servant was summoned to His presence. After ascending and arriving and standing, these words were heard, blessed and exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>“O servant in attendance! At this hour as We were walking, Ali Haydar came to mind. Out of love for him and as a token of Our grace, We wished to make mention of him, that through the attraction of divine utterance and the fragrance of heavenly words he might arise to promote the Cause and set the horizons ablaze with the fire of love. Verily, whosoever in this day arises to render assistance for the sake of God and in His path will assuredly be aided by the confirmations of God, exalted be His glory. And the victory is in teaching God’s Cause and naught else.</p>
<p>O Ali-Qabl-Haydar! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of Destiny, and like unto the artery in the body of creation, be thou in constant motion that all may be moved. Marvel not at this word which hath shone forth from the Dayspring of divine revelation. Through the grace of the Spirit, he who was but a fisher of men transcended the kingdom of earth and reached the most exalted heights. How many souls have drunk from the cup of life through his breath and been refreshed by the waters of his utterance.</p>
<p>Today the buzzing of flies and the cawing of ravens are raised high. Thou must arise with complete steadfastness to promote the Cause of the Lord of all beings. This day is attributed to God and is mentioned and recorded in the Books of old and of later times as the Day of God. All must fix their gaze solely upon the Supreme Horizon. Whosoever attaineth unto this station shall find himself firmly established, steadfast and detached. Preserve this blessed word as thou wouldst thine eye, for within it are concealed oceans of meaning. This is the station of true unity. How blessed is the one who is illumined by its lights! Such a one is of the people of Baha, upon whom the Concourse on High and they who circle round the Throne in the morning and the evening do send their blessings.</p>
<p>The infidels and traitors, like the former people, have spread the nets of their vain imaginings. By the life of God! They have no share of this surging, billowing ocean, nor any portion of this chalice before which the seas have bowed down in adoration. Say: Cast away what the people possess and take what ye have been given by God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Be not like those who throughout ages and centuries stood in their mosques and upon their pulpits, believing themselves to be mentioning and praising God, exalted be His glory, beseeching and imploring His presence; yet when the morning breeze of His Revelation wafted and the blessed Tree grew forth, all the divines of that age arose to cut down that holy divine Tree. Both learned and ignorant engaged in cursing and execration. Ye have all heard with your own ears and seen with your own eyes. By the life of God! The eye of grandeur wept, and the denizens of the highest Paradise and the most exalted Garden were overcome with lamentation and wailing.</p>
<p>Such was the condition of those divines. Now again the people of the Bayan are engaged in the same vain imaginings. They have added to their turbans, and some have even mounted pulpits. God protect us and you from the evil of such people! Would that they had understood the foundation of the Cause! Verily, they are in grievous error and great delusion. In those days when all were veiled and […]</p>
<p>In the time of oppression, when hearts were troubled and pillars trembled, this Wronged One arose alone before the faces of the world and raised His call. And when the fragrance of the garment of His Revelation was diffused and had appeared in certain lands, they emerged from behind the veil with swords of rancor and hatred, and said that which no oppressor had ever said before, and perpetrated that which no bloodthirsty one had ever wrought. Say: Die in your wrath! That which was due unto the Truth, exalted be His glory, He revealed. The equivalent of all the heavenly Books that were sent down before and after descended from the heaven of His Will, and now exists. Praise be to God! That which had to be said was said with supreme steadfastness, in such wise that neither the power of the world nor the commotion of nations could hinder it. All would bear witness to this, were they to be enabled to speak with truthfulness and fairness. They have not inhaled a breath of the Day of God, nor have they attained unto the hearing of a single word, even as the Shi’ih sect who for a thousand and two hundred years recited the Book of God, yet comprehended not a letter thereof. Take heed, O ye who are endued with discernment! Take heed, O ye who are endued with insight!</p>
<p>Is there anyone in the world who possesses eyes to behold the rays of the Sun of the All-Merciful’s utterance, and is there anyone endowed with ears who can hear with their own ears the Call of God? Nay, by God! All are submerged in the ocean of vain imaginings and wandering in the wilderness of idle fancies, save those souls who see with their own eyes and hear with their own ears. These are they of whom He saith: “They are endowed with insight from God.” In the days when the Sun of Truth was shining from the horizon of Iraq, He foretold the raising of the cawing of the ravens in divers lands, as well as in the Land of Mystery, and at the first arrival in this Most Great Prison, as it occurred some time ago in the Land of Ta, when the cawing was raised. The knowledge of this is with our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth. He burneth with the fire of hatred while imagining he is rendering service to the Truth - exactly like the Shi’ih divines who, from all pulpits, have cursed and continue to curse the Truth. In the early years, not a single one of the divines of the age turned to the Truth. From the pulpits, they would first lament over the letters of the Qur’an, and at the end would revile and curse the Lord of the Letters. And you yourself are witness to this. The people who considered themselves the most exalted of all mankind and the most distinguished of all nations were ultimately observed to be lower than all others. This servant conveyeth greetings and praise to all the friends, and declareth that this is the Day of steadfastness. By the life of our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the heavens and earth, these cawing ones have never had, nor do they now have, any understanding of the root of the Cause. We beseech God, exalted be He, to grant them success in returning. Verily, He is the Ever-Forgiving, and verily, He is the All-Bountiful. There is no God but Him, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Moreover, I submit to them that all must manifest perfect unity and harmony. Should any differences arise, those trusted ones of God should arise to remove them. Souls are diverse: some drink from the pure water of certitude while being detached and independent of all other waters of the earth, while others drink from different springs, and these springs too are various. Consider the Companions of the Apostle of God - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake. Some were at the highest pinnacle of faith and assurance, while others would at times ascend and at times descend. There are also souls who secretly cling to vain imaginings while outwardly professing certitude. One’s gaze must be fixed upon the Truth itself, as hath been repeatedly stated in this Most Great Revelation that the gaze of all must be directed solely to the Most Exalted Horizon. Without this, it will surely lead to stumbling and heedlessness. Verily, He guideth the way and He is the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>It is hoped that you will arise with the utmost resolve to assist the Cause, dealing with the strong with love and fellowship, and with the weak with kindness and forbearance. Two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets were revealed and sent, specifically for the two individuals who had requested them. I beseech God that they may attain unto the Tablet and drink from the ocean of His utterance - a draught that the veils and clouds of the people shall not prevent. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who have cast the world behind their backs, clinging to the cord of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all nations. They are indeed the companions of this mighty, this glorious station. And praise be to God, the Lord of the mighty throne and the Lord of the exalted seat.</p>
<p>I beseech the True One to confirm them in His remembrance through wisdom and utterance, and to ignite them with such a fire that its traces may become manifest and evident throughout the world, and its heat may endure and persist throughout the dominion of earth and heaven. This lowly one conveyeth greetings and salutations to them, and beseecheth assistance from the True One, exalted be His glory, on their behalf. They must at all times be mindful of wisdom, for this binding commandment hath repeatedly been revealed and sent down from the Supreme Pen. This lowly one offereth greetings, salutations and praise to each of the branches of the divine Tree, and seeketh for each that which is peerless. The command is in His grasp; He ordaineth for whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He willeth, and He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. Glory and praise and peace be upon you, and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Mighty, the Everlasting, the Beautiful!</p>
<p>Glorified be He Who sent down verses aforetime when there was no “before”, and Who sendeth them down as He pleaseth by His command. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Able, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. His is the bounty and grace; He singles out whom He willeth with mercy from His presence, and verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>O My Name! Hearken unto that which the Spirit imparteth unto thee, that thou mayest soar in this atmosphere which hath spread forth beneath this heaven that hath been raised in this cloud, and mayest hear the call of all atoms in the kingdom of names and attributes, that “There is no God but Him, and that the Primal Point is His Argument and His Beauty, then His Manifestation and His Majesty unto all who are in the heavens and the earth.” Whoso draweth nigh unto Him hath drawn nigh unto God, and whoso turneth away from Him hath turned away from God. This is the truth, there is no doubt therein, if ye be of them that know. To this beareth witness My tongue, then My spirit and My heart, then My being and My pen, if ye be of them that hear.</p>
<p>Say: By God the Truth! Through Him were raised the heavens of justice, and appeared the clouds of grace, and the rain of bounty poured forth upon all the worlds. Were it not for Him, none would know God’s grace and generosity, and none would find the holy shore of glory’s sacred seat. By God! Through Him wafted the breezes of eternity, and sang the Dove upon the twigs of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. Through Him was perfected the proof unto all creation, and by Him revolved the spheres of existence, and the Fire of God called out from the Tree that speaketh truth in the sacred and exalted Sinai. From Him began the works of creation, and were inscribed upon the Tablet the mysteries of what was and what shall be in preserving tablets of glory. Unto Him return the deeds of all things, if ye be of them that know.</p>
<p>Know thou that the source and return of all things is Him, and from Him was differentiated the Point of Knowledge in the mysteries of destiny behind the sea of might and grandeur, raining down the showers of grace, if ye be of them that witness. Unto Him returneth all knowledge and certitude, and every deed and intention from this day unto the Day whereon God’s Greatest Treasure shall appear in a new holy raiment.</p>
<p>Know thou that thy Lord was and forever shall be a Hidden Treasure in the essence of His Being, and shall ever remain concealed from His creation, for eyes comprehend Him not while He comprehendeth all eyes, and He is the All-Subtle, the All-Informed. He it is Who sent the Messengers aforetime and revealed the Books thereafter. Verily there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Luminous, Whom none can know and unto Whom no birds of the hearts of the seekers can ascend, for He created all that is in the heavens and earth by the Word of Command which was called “Be” before “It is”, if ye be of the certain ones.</p>
<p>How can that which was created by His command, His sovereignty, His might and His power, draw nigh unto Him or know Him as He is? Glorified be He above what the remembering servants imagine concerning Him! Therefore testify within thyself, then in thy spirit, then in thine essence, that there is no God but Him, that He hath ever existed in His Essence, manifest among His servants, self-subsisting amidst His creation. Verily He is the Single, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, the Mighty, the Gracious.</p>
<p>Thus have We sprinkled upon thee from the vast ocean of might and splendor, and cast upon thee […]</p>
<p>Say: The gates of attainment and meeting are shut against the knowledge of His Essence. He hath manifested, through His grace, Eternal Manifestations and Dawning-Places of Oneness, that they might speak of their Manifestor among His creation and their Sender among His creatures, and He hath made the recognition of them […]</p>
<p>Their recognition is His recognition and meeting them is meeting Him. This is the indubitable truth, and there exists no station, abode, beginning or end higher than this, from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end which His knowing servants cannot reckon. This is the ultimate station of the mystics and the final homeland of the lovers in the heaven of glory. This is the station wherein should anyone attempt to soar beyond it by the least degree, his wings would be consumed. Those who have believed in the Unseen in these days and have turned towards Him Who is mentioned in every station and allusion, shall be sufficed from all else. This is a revelation from One mighty and wise. Thus have We expounded the verses for you and made clear every mighty wisdom, that ye may follow God’s commandments in these days when every soul is seized with the stupor of heedlessness and ignorance, rendering them as scattered dust, if ye be of those who know. Know then that the Most Hidden Mystery and Most Treasured Secret and Essence of all gems is He Who can neither be indicated by any indication, nor known by any knowledge, nor comprehended by any comprehension, nor remembered by any remembrance. All describers fall short of describing Him. All the Prophets have acknowledged their powerlessness to know Him, and all the Messengers have confessed their failure to comprehend Him, as testified by their own souls, minds and tongues, if ye be of those who hear. This is the station of the pure Unseen and the absolute Mystery, if ye be of those who know. Whoso believeth in the Unseen in his heart and testifieth to it with his tongue, and sanctifieth it from every peer, likeness, similitude, allusion, associate, helper and equal - such a one is counted among the truly sincere. Every Prophet and Messenger hath turned towards this Unseen, as have those who circle round the Throne and behind them the denizens of the highest paradise. This is mentioned in the first station and the first pavilion and the wise Remembrance and the ancient News. And in one station We mean by the Unseen the realities of Oneness and the eternal essences who were concealed in the Manifestations of old, as ye witness and are among those who testify. In the time of Moses, the Unseen was none other than Jesus in the heaven of names, and He foretold His appearance and was hidden in His days. Likewise the Unseen in the time of the Spirit (Jesus) was Muhammad, the Messenger of God and Seal of the Prophets. Similarly the Unseen in His days was none other than ’Ali, through meeting whom the eyes of those near to God were solaced. And likewise in those days it was none other than He Whose appearance the Point of the Bayan foretold in tablets of ancient glory. We turn to Him in all matters and supplicate Him at all times and await His days as the believers await the paradise of nearness - nay, even more so, if ye be of the assured ones. Say: By God, Paradise itself is meeting Him, and the Hour is His arising amongst all created things. Therefore We say that We believe in the Most Hidden Mystery and in His Manifestations, and We turn towards them and make no distinction between Him and them, except that they are His servants and creation. Thus sang the Mystic Dove upon this lofty Branch, that it might be God’s melody and His proof, then His testament and His all-sufficient evidence unto all worlds. And thou, O Ahmad, purify thyself and thy spirit from those who have fabricated lies against God and in whose hearts hatred hath appeared. Then shun them and remain in detachment and steadfastness. Those who claim what they claim in themselves, say: Present yourselves in Our presence and before Us.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! Purify my heart from the remembrance of anyone but Thee, and my soul from intimacy with aught else except Thee, and my feet from drawing nigh unto any other than Thee. Thou art, verily, powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Lord! Deprive me not of the sweet-scented breezes of Thy holy bounty, and number me not with those who exhale naught but the stench of hypocrisy throughout the world. Then remove from my heart their love and the love of those who love them and the love of that which their tongues utter. Thou art, verily, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Lord! Leave me not to myself or to anyone else besides Thee. Draw me ever closer unto Thee, establish for me a seat of truth before Thee, and join me with such of Thy servants as are nigh unto Thee - those whom nothing can sadden in their love for Thee and their contentment with Thy good-pleasure, whom no cause can hinder from reaching the shore of Thy Most Great Name, the Most Great, which Thou hast made the station of Thy Self in all that pertaineth unto Thee, and which Thou hast made pure and purified from all that pertaineth not unto Thee, reflecting Thine Ancient Beauty in the mirrors of Thy Name, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Lord! Detach me from myself and from all who have departed from Thy shadow, and cause me to enter beneath Thy mighty and impregnable shelter. Honor me with Thy presence in Thy wondrous days wherein Thy Lord of the Throne doth appear, the Dove doth warble, the Holy Dove doth coo, and Thy primordial Will doth don a new garment - days wherein all souls shall be in loss, all […] shall prosper, all who are abased shall be exalted, and all who are poor and needy shall be enriched.</p>
<p>O Lord! Grant me what I have asked and what I have not asked, for Thou knowest better than I what is good for me. Verily, Thou art unto Thy servants the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p>May the beloved, honored and revered Shaykh Jamalu’d-Din - upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness - take note.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! His divine confirmations have reached us and His aid is more manifest than light at all times. The luminary of His grace is ever-shining; His bounty cannot be reckoned by the pen, nor can ink suffice to recount His generosity. Every person of insight acknowledges His grandeur and every hearing ear confesses His sovereignty. His is the praise and the bestowal, His the remembrance and the glorification. In one instance He made the tongues of His loved ones the champions of His Cause, and through them He revealed that which caused decayed bones to stir. The decree of the Most Great Tongue is mightier than the sword, and utterance more powerful than the hosts and legions of creation. Today the loved ones of God, exalted be His glory, are skilled in treating ailments and steadfast in educating His servants. They nourish and apportion sustenance to the children of the world according to their measure and capacity. The Word, in its primary essence, is the water of life for the dead of the world and the hand of power for the salvation of nations. Through a single exalted word, it draws man from the darkness of idle fancies to the light of certitude, and from the deep pit to the lofty palace. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to protect His loved ones through the hosts of might and power and to aid them with the swords of wisdom and utterance. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all created things and the bridles of all contingent beings! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Signs and by the pearls hidden in the treasuries of Thy Most Glorious Pen to make him who seeketh Thee a bird soaring in the atmosphere of Thy nearness, gazing toward Thy horizon, and speaking with wisdom and utterance amongst Thy creatures. Then reveal unto him, O my God, the oceans that lie concealed within Thy verses and hidden within Thy words, that the wine of mystic knowledge may so intoxicate him that he will speak that whereby the hearts of the followers of all religions will be attracted. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>The servant was seated during the days of fasting, contemplating the mysteries of his Lord’s Cause, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, when one of the loved ones arrived with your letter. I took it and opened it, whereupon the house and all around it became perfumed, for it was adorned with the mention of our and your Beloved. I drank from the cups of your utterance the sweet waters of your sincerity, submission and orientation toward God. After being immersed in the ocean of my Lord’s grace, I approached the Dawning-Place of mysteries and the Day-Spring of divine tokens, until I attained His presence and presented what had flowed from your pen in remembrance of your Lord. The Tongue of Grandeur spoke that whereby the realities of all things were attracted. He spoke, and His word is the truth:</p>
<p>He is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned before the Divine Countenance! Hear the call from the Most Exalted Horizon. He giveth thee to drink of the Kawthar of bounty from the hand of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all men. Verily, He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the Mighty, the All-Seeing. Nothing escapeth His knowledge. He knoweth what is hidden in hearts and minds, and seeth what is concealed in the treasuries of the breasts of the righteous. I was walking in the House and speaking the verses of thy Lord when the servant in attendance entered and presented before the Countenance that which the tongue of thy heart had spoken concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of all mankind. We heard it and have answered thee through this Tablet, which God hath made an ocean of generosity for the world and a fountain of life for the dead. By My life! Were it to be cast upon stones, rivers would gush forth from them. Having drunk the sweet waters of mystic knowledge from the cup of utterance, say: […]</p>
<p>Praise be to Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all existence, for having honored me with Thy mention and adorned me with the ornament of Thy Most Exalted Pen, from which the mysteries have been revealed in the beginning and the end. O my Lord! Thou seest me walking in Thy dominion to exalt Thy Word, and speaking among Thy servants what Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy grace, and by the Lamp which Thou hast protected from tempestuous winds through the glass of Thy strength and power, to ordain for me that which will make me strong through Thy strength and powerful through Thy will, that I may cast upon Thy servants, with wisdom and utterance, that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and sanctify them from the doubts of the people of Thy earth and the insinuations of those who have denied Thy favor. Then assist me, O my Beloved, in that which will attract the hearts of Thy creation. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of earth and heaven. O my Lord! Withhold not this servant from the outpourings of Thy days, and deprive him not of the breezes of Thy revelation and Thy inspiration. O my Lord! Strengthen me through Thy bounty and fortify my limbs that I may cast aside my will, taking hold of Thy will, and move not except by Thy desire. Then write down for me, through Thy mercy which hath preceded all created things, that which will comfort mine eyes and the eyes of Thy servants, and assure my soul and the souls of those in Thy lands. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>Hear in the Persian tongue: I beseech God to assist thee in that which will cause the exaltation of His Word. O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! The Sun of God’s favor hath dawned from the horizon of grace, and the Ocean of divine knowledge surgeth before thy face. Beseech God not to deprive His servants of the lights of the Day-Star of justice and fairness, for whosoever attaineth unto these will become detached from all else save God and will turn with heart and soul to the horizon of the All-Merciful. Make mention of Siyyid Mu??afa, upon him be My glory, and Haji Siyyid Mahdi, upon him be My glory, and the other friends on behalf of the Wronged One, and remind them of the verses and favors of God. God willing, may they be assisted and acquire, in this transient abode and station, everlasting stations. Convey on behalf of the Wronged One greetings and salutations to Faraj, upon him be My glory. We beseech God to assist him in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to adorn him with that which beseemeth these days. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Answering, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Thus it endeth. His is the grace and the giving, His the favor and the glory. At every moment the Day-Star of His favor appeareth with manifest radiance. It hath been proven by argument and demonstrated by clear evidence that He cannot be described by any description save His own, nor known through any knowledge but His own. However, He hath appointed for His loved ones a spacious pavilion, and that is the confession of powerlessness and humility before the manifestations of His grandeur, His might and His sovereignty. This powerlessness He hath, through His grace, accepted and approved. His is the praise and the thanks for His favors and bounties.</p>
<p>Time and again that honored one has been and is mentioned in the assemblage of the friends, and likewise in His presence I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to bestow great profit upon the merchants of His knowledge. The people of the earth have not yet become aware and are heedless of the fruits of the Tree of reformation, concord and unity. They know not whence they came and for what purpose they have come. By the life of our Beloved and your Beloved, were they to become aware to the extent of a needle’s eye, all would detach themselves and lay hold - detach themselves, that is, from all else but God, and lay hold of service to Him and His good-pleasure. The Euphrates of mercy gives glad-tidings to the thirsty, the Point of knowledge summons the ignorant, and His loving-kindness bestows awareness upon the heedless. This is the day of the most great bounty, for the most great horizon is illumined with the lights of the Lord of destiny. Blessed is the soul whom the vicissitudes of the world render not sorrowful and whom the clamor of the nations prevents not from his purpose. This Day is the Day whose mention hath flowed from the Pen and been recorded in the Books of the past and of the future. Blessed is he who hath turned unto it, and drunk, and attained, and woe to the heedless, and woe to the deniers. The friends of God, wherever and in whatever place they may be, are remembered in the Most Holy Court. This lowly one hath mentioned and doth mention each of them with wondrous, sublime and exalted words of praise, and beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to adorn all with the raiment of distinction.</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Deprive not the temples of Thy loved ones of this robe. The temple is from Thee, the raiment from Thee, the ocean of generosity and bounty is from Thee. Ordain that which beseemeth Thy bestowal. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the Most Merciful of the Merciful.</p>
<p>To the honored brother Haji Faraj’u’llah, upon him be the Glory of God, I convey greetings and praise, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant him success, that in every station, every place, every land and every region he may be engaged in service to the Cause and attain His favors. Mention was made of Bashir - praise be to God, he is well and occasionally mentions that honored one. God’s power is great - from dark earth He hath brought forth a thousand kinds of fruits and flowers of sublime and varied hues. Perchance He will cause some glad tidings to appear from Bashir also, that is, that he may attain to some service. Verily our Lord is the Powerful, the Almighty. Glory and praise and honor be upon your honor and upon those who are with you and who hearken to your words concerning the Cause of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne and the exalted seat.</p>

The All-Merciful shone upon him with wondrous rays of His glory and caused him to hear such melodies as drew unto them the denizens of the Supreme Paradise and the realities of those near unto God. They who were veiled in those days heard not a single letter from the words of God, nor shall they ever hear - this is a revelation from One mighty and powerful. For had they heard but one letter of God’s verses, they would not have denied these words which God hath made a testimony unto all who dwell in the heavens and the earth, whereby He hath manifested His Cause throughout all ages and shall continue to manifest it as He pleaseth. Verily, He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear ye God and worship not those whom ye find upon the brink of the pit of fire. Fear ye God and be of the God-fearing. Stand ye firm in the Cause of God in such wise as to cause the hearts of the perverters to tremble. Should any among those who have disbelieved in God appear before you, suffer him not to utter a word, for it proceedeth from the very depths of hellfire and must needs return thereto. Say: O thou who associateth partners with God! Judge thou fairly, by God: by what proof didst thou believe in the Primal Point? Explain, and be not of those who flee from place to place to cast doubt into the hearts of the monotheists. Thou and thy like have worshipped vain imaginings for a thousand years and were heedless thereof. And when there appeared among you one who spoke the truth and proclaimed that He would be born, ye denounced him as an infidel and slew him without clear proof or manifest evidence.</p>
<p>We follow not your idle fancies and We beseech God to protect Us from you, from your friends, and from your leaders. Verily, He is the Protector of the virtuous. We are servants who have shattered the chains of blind imitation through the Most Great Name of God and have detached ourselves from those who disbelieved in Him in Whom they had believed, whose eyes were covered with the veils of idle fancy and who were among the heedless. Do ye call upon vain imaginings and forsake the Best of Creators? Woe unto you and unto those whom ye have taken as friends besides God! Thereby have ye entered the abyss of perdition and yet ye rejoice and are not among those who perceive.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, O Hadi, for having been guided by the lights of the Countenance. Stand thou firm, therefore, in the Cause and grieve not at the clamor of the idolaters. Know thou that thy letter hath come before Us, and We have beheld it and are among those who bear witness.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast asked concerning that which hath been sent down from the Most Exalted Pen regarding the Most Great Word, know thou that by the revelation of the Bayan and what hath appeared in its outward meaning and what hath been concealed in its inward significance, naught was intended except this Revelation which hath been made manifest in truth, and which the people of the Bayan have denied out of their hatred for thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Thus were their names inscribed among the people of vain imaginings, while they remain heedless thereof and are numbered with the negligent. By the True One! His pen moved only in My remembrance, His tongue spoke only in praise of My Self, and His heart beat only with My Name, the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. And now He findeth Himself beneath the claws and talons of the people of the Bayan, though He had enjoined them in all the Tablets not to be veiled by anything revealed in the Bayan at the time of His manifestation. Yet they denied Me and sought to shed My blood. When their own deceit became apparent, they claimed oppression among the people, even as they had done aforetime, and they are now among the perpetrators thereof.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Do ye believe in the Bayan while denying Him Who hath expounded it? Woe unto you, O company of the deluded! Say: This indeed is the Spirit through Whom whosoever was quickened, he truly liveth in the sight of God, and besides this all are dead even should they fill the East and the West of the earth. Thus doth the Holy Pen reveal unto thee at this moment when moved by the fingers of thy Lord’s will, the All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate. And verily if thou shouldst examine the Qayyumu’l-Asma’, thou wouldst find naught save this Most Great Name, the All-Glorious, the Most Wondrous, the Most Wonderful. He gave the glad-tidings of this Revelation in all the verses, yet the people denied it and surrounded Him with the swords of hatred and rancor, striking Him at every moment. Among the polytheists were those who said that He loved not the Point of the Bayan. Say: Fear ye God and be ashamed before the Manifestation of His Self, for verily He is My Self and I am His Self and His Being, and one word from Him is dearer to Me than the creation of both worlds, were ye of them that know.</p>
<p>Would anyone deny his own spirit? Nay, by the Self of God Who speaketh between the heavens and the earth! Say: O concourse of polytheists! How long will ye flee from branch to branch? He hath appeared in truth and there is no escape for you save that ye believe in Him or deny all the Messengers of God together. And in another station He desired to manifest His Cause in the station of the Gate, even as thou witnesseth that when the letter Alif standeth upright it is called by the name of Alif, and when it is extended it is called by the name of Ba, though they are one and the same, were ye of them that perceive. This is the station of His Gateship which appeared in truth at the beginning of His Cause and opened unto the faces of all who are in the heavens and the earth, as thou hast witnessed and wert among the witnesses. And this very Alif ascended by itself, then rose to the station of Lam, whereupon appeared the letter of Divine Authority. In this station He removed the veil of Gateship from His countenance and appeared with Divine Authority, saying: “I am the true Qa’im Whose appearance ye have been promised.” Thus shouldst thou understand the Cause of thy Lord and be of them that know.</p>
<p>Then He ascended from this station until He reached the station of Ra, which is the station of Lordship in this stage, and He rent asunder the veils of idle fancy through His sovereignty, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Wise, and said: “I am your Lord and your Educator and your Creator and your Sustainer and your Quickener and your Slayer and your Resurrector and your Bearer of glad-tidings concerning Him Who shall come in truth. Beware lest ye neglect His Cause and […]</p>
<p>Be not of them that hesitate. This is the station of Lordship which hath encompassed and pervaded all worlds. But thou, O Hadi, witness today a new spirit in the temples of words and letters. Should one possessed of hearing be found, he would hear from every letter of the Bayan melodies and anthems in remembrance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, and would say: “This indeed is He Who hath manifested the Alif to reveal His Cause, and the Lam to establish His command, and the Ra to spread abroad that which hath appeared from His presence.” Thus doth He speak the truth, but the people hear not, nor are they among those who perceive. We have indeed interpreted the disconnected letters aforetime with a clear, evident and manifest exposition. Were We to interpret and expound them now, no wayfarer could bear it. And if thou wouldst sharpen thy vision and reflect, thou wouldst witness that these are the days wherein thy Lord’s Cause hath been spread abroad and hath been and will be decreed, and through it truth is distinguished from falsehood, light from darkness, and the wretched from the blessed. In His manifestation He desireth naught but this Revelation, and by this Name hath the Dove warbled upon the twigs of the Tree of Eternity, and the Cock of the Throne hath crowed, and the Tongue of God hath spoken, and the Pen of Command hath coursed upon tablets of transcendent glory. Say: O people, fear God! Pervert not the words of God from their places. By the True One! Every goodly mention revealed in the Bayan referreth to this Most Great Remembrance, this Most Ancient and Most Mighty Cause. Through it the matter hath been and will be decreed around the Fire at the axis of Water, nigh unto this all-pervading, sublime, sweet and luminous Air. And were We to find pure hearts, upright minds and penetrating vision, We would bring forth from this Ocean pearls of sanctified worth. By thy life, O Hadi! Through the buffetings of the idolaters, the mouth of God hath been prevented from His utterance, and the Salsabil from its flowing, and the clouds from their rain, and the Most Great Sea from its waves, and the Lote-Tree of the Extremity from its fruits, and the Holy Land from its vegetation, and the Sun of knowledge from its radiance. Thus have the hosts of Satan assailed the Manifestation of God’s Self. O Hadi! Is there any helper who will aid the Cause of his Lord, and stand firm in the love of his Master, and be detached from the deniers? Is there any faithful one who will fulfill God’s Covenant and His Testament, and fear not the assault of swine? Is there any zealous one who will not alter God’s bounty upon himself and will guard this heavenly Table from these thieves? Thus have We remembered thee and revealed unto thee that thou mayest stand firm in thy Lord’s Cause and be among them that remember. Then make mention from Us unto Ibrahim with gracious mention, then recite unto him and his brother who was mentioned in thy letter this impregnable and lofty Tablet, that it may create in them that which the opposition of the opposers cannot extinguish. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God, then remained steadfast, and are in a state of rapture, attraction, longing and wondrous yearning.</p>

<p>O thou who art turning unto the Most Glorious Horizon, who art known before the Throne by the praise of God, the Lord of Names, who soarest in the atmosphere of love and faithfulness, who dwellest upon the branch of praise in the Kingdom of creation, and who warblest the remembrance of God on a day wherein the foundations of those endued with understanding have trembled! Again I renew My words and say: O thou who art imprisoned in the path of God, the Creator of heaven, and who art expelled from cities and homes because thou hast believed in God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust! O thou who art expectant and vigilant! O thou who art firm and articulate! I testify that thou hast spoken and uttered the truth, and thou hast been wronged by the ignorant ones who claim knowledge and wisdom without clear proof or evidence. Soon shall they behold themselves beneath the earth even as they now see themselves above it. My Lord, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, beareth witness to this. By God’s life! The servant is bewildered concerning the people, and strange it is that one who seeth himself as but a leaf among leaves, appearing on the branch one moment and falling the next, should nevertheless be seized with such pride as to deny God, His sovereignty, His Manifestation and His signs. We beseech God in all conditions to assist His servants and not to render them deprived of this Most Great Ocean or heedless of this noble station.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant attained unto thy letter. Praise be to God Who hath preserved thee and delivered thee from the wrongdoing people, and fulfilled what He promised thee in His firm and mighty Book. The oppressor hath been and shall continue to be the ignorant divines. Soon shall they find themselves in evident torment.</p>
<p>And whereas you had written that some had desired to meet with His Holiness, and His Holiness, in view of not having permission, had not granted this - this evanescent servant bears witness that His Holiness has always been commanded in these matters. That honored one was created for the service of God’s Cause and was made to speak specifically in His praise. However, He has made these matters contingent upon wisdom, and this has been and will continue to be due to previous mercy and comprehensive grace, lest any matter arise that might cause fear in weak hearts. The strong have ever gazed and will ever gaze toward the highest horizon. The manifestations of might, expressions of supremacy, and appearances of retribution have not and will not prevent those blessed, tranquil, content and approved souls. However, in consideration of the ocean of divine bounty and the heaven of divine generosity, He has commanded the people to wisdom so that no harm might befall anyone. May my spirit and your spirit and the spirits of all in the realms of creation be a sacrifice for His bounty.</p>
<p>After the arrival of that letter, this servant attained the Most Holy Presence and submitted the details, that is, presented that very letter in its entirety before the Throne. He said: “O My Name Jamal! If a person be in the East while you are in the West, and if that person desires to attain unto the knowledge of God, it is incumbent upon you, if you are able, to journey to that land and bestow upon that person, according to their capacity and receptivity, the life-giving waters. O Jamal! If you were to reflect upon the verses sent down from the heaven of grace, you would testify that whatsoever the Truth, exalted and glorified be He, has commanded and continues to command has been and will be for the good of His servants. You must certainly teach the Cause and occupy yourself with service. Do not deprive the seekers of the ocean of guidance, but give according to measure. The best fruit attributed to the Tree of the Bayan is this blessed word: bestow the seeds of wisdom in good soil according to measure. God willing, you will ignite all through the heat of the fire of God’s Word and summon them to the Most Holy Court. The Supreme Pen has given countless counsels before and continues to do so now. O Jamal! Associate with all the people of the earth with paternal affection, and likewise nurture all from the breast of wisdom. In no circumstance remove your eyes from wisdom, for it has been and will continue to be the cause of the exaltation of the Cause, the source of tranquility amidst agitation, strength for hearts, and assurance for souls.</p>
<p>O My Name! Be confident in My grace and favor. You have been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. He verily has aided you, nurtured you, protected you, and delivered you. Give thanks to God for this bounty which has sprung forth from the ocean of generosity and grace. He is verily the Teacher, the Manifest, the All-Wise, the All-Informed. Remember when you stood before the Throne and witnessed with your own eyes the favor of your Lord, and heard His sweetest call and wondrous mention. You have a station with your Lord - be thankful and among those who rejoice.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you wish for news of this land, the Ancient Beauty has left the Most Great Prison and established His throne in the garden, and afterward in the mansion known to a hundred thousand tongues and a hundred thousand centuries. This evanescent servant offers thanks and praise, for his prayer was answered and his deed was not lost, although it is observed that the Ancient Beauty Himself prefers the prison more. This is a matter that no one knows except Him, and verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>And as to what you wrote concerning consultation, He said that this matter has always been and will always be beloved, but in matters that accord with wisdom. The purpose of mentioning this is that the fundamental divine law should be known, otherwise these matters are clear and need not be mentioned. All that has befallen you in the path of God is remembered before God, and none has the right to object to what you have done, for the entire matter is in the hand of God, your Lord, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>And regarding what you wrote about turning towards this land with permission, He said you have already attained this blessing three times and it was accepted before God. Further journeys to this land are not permitted, for it is in turmoil, and the hidden turmoil which has been revealed in most tablets remains concealed. This is a land whose surface appears calm while its interior is turbulent. You must be content and grateful with what has been and is commanded, for therein lies the wisdom. End.</p>
<p>This servant begs that you not forget this one and always remember him with goodly mention. Convey greetings to all the loved ones of God who are honored to be in your presence. And concerning what you wrote about Javad, upon him be the Glory of God, it was presented at the Most Holy Court. He said that he spoke truthfully, and indeed his presence in that land was with effect and fruit. I beseech God to strengthen him in all conditions. We testify that he has arisen to serve the Cause of his Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. Wherever he may be, he is under the gaze of divine favor. The Glory be upon him, his wife, his son, and those who are with him. And further, regarding what you mentioned about Aqa Siyyid J, upon him be the Glory of God, this too was presented. He said special favors have been bestowed upon him. We beseech God to assist him and grant him what is best for him. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Generous.</p>

<p>O Husayn! The Pen is nigh moved to lamentation, for the Hand of Power moves it in the evening and at sunrise, at dawn and at dusk, and through the days and at daybreak. It finds for itself neither rest nor stillness, as the Hand of Divine Destiny turns it howsoever it wishes. Verily thy Lord is the Strong, the All-Conquering, the Almighty. Neither the might of the powerful nor the dominion of princes can hinder Him. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. We have mentioned thee before, and before that, with verses whose fragrance, when diffused, caused the graves to quake and the people to stand before the face of thy Lord, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O Husayn! When the Hand of Power raised the standards of wisdom and utterance, and the Morn of Manifestation unfurled the banner of divine knowledge, the people rose in opposition. Among them were those who denied Me, those who calumniated My Person, and those who pronounced the verdict for the shedding of My blood. Thus did their souls entice them, and they are numbered this day among the transgressors in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech God to aid thee and to open before thy face the door of grace and favors. Verily, He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Most Great. May He send down upon thee from the clouds of His mercy a blessing from His presence. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. We make mention of those whose names thou hast mentioned, and We remind them of My verses which reign supreme over all who are in the heavens and on earth. We give them glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for them, and We acquaint them with the power of My Most Exalted Pen and the influence of My Most Sublime Word. Verily, thy Lord is the Expositor, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Husayn! We have desired to make mention of him who is named Mahmud, that this remembrance may draw him nigh unto a station wherein he shall witness what God hath witnessed and acknowledge that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath acknowledged before the creation of earth and heaven: that there is none other God but I, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Hearken unto the Call from the direction of ’Akka. Verily it hath been raised in truth, in such wise that none can deny it save every heedless and remote soul. We have mentioned thee before and have revealed for thee that which hath attracted the hearts of them that are nigh. Give thanks unto God for having aided thee to turn towards Him when the learned ones turned away, and for having enabled thee to acknowledge Him when the divines and scholars of the earth denied Him. Thy Lord is verily the All-Bountiful, the Almighty. By the life of God! There hath been ordained from the Most Exalted Pen for them that are nigh such as hath bewildered the hearts of those who have believed in God, the Single One, the All-Informed. We beseech God to make thee steadfast in His Cause and in the observance of what He hath revealed in His Book. He, verily, is the Confirmer, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Mawzun! The Self-Subsisting hath made mention of thee on a day whereon the Herald proclaimed: The Kingdom is God’s, the Almighty, the All-Loving. We have sent unto thee the breezes of revelation and honored thee with My Tablet, from whose horizon hath shone the luminary of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all existence. Once We mentioned thee with verses of grace, and again with utterance that hath enraptured hearts and souls. Can aught possessed by the people be compared with the Word of God? Nay, by His Self, the One Who dominateth all things past and future! Thus hath the Pen revealed its treasure and the Tongue its utterance, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the True One, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>O Elias! The King of mankind summons thee from His glorious station and remembers thee through His grace, mentioning thee in what hath been revealed in His inscribed tablet. Take what hath come to thee from the horizon of might, and follow not every heedless and veiled one. Say: O people of the earth! Open your eyes! The Sovereign hath come - dominion belongeth unto God, the Lord of the unseen and the seen. Beware lest the dawning-places of idle fancies and vain imaginings prevent you. Cast aside what the people possess, turning unto the Most Exalted Horizon, the station wherein hath been raised the Call: “Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Sovereign of sovereignty and of the Kingdom!” We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid thee and those who have turned unto that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over what He willeth. There is none other God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O Hassan! Show excellence even as God hath shown excellence unto thee. He hath aided thee to turn unto Him when those on earth turned away. To this testifieth His preserved Tablet. Say: My God, my God! I have inhaled the fragrance of the garment of Thy Manifestation, and the wine of the river of Thy knowledge in Thy days hath intoxicated me. I beseech Thee by the breezes of Thy Revelation, the evidences of Thy might, and the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge, to ordain for me to attain Thy presence, to stand before Thy gate, and to hearken unto Thy Call which was raised once from the Tree when Thou didst manifest Thyself unto Moses, and again during the Night Journey when Thy Friend and Chosen One ascended; or ordain for me, by the Pen of Thy Command, the reward of meeting Thee. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent Whom the power of the world cannot frustrate. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Beloved. Then write down for me the good of this world and the next. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.</p>
<p>O Abraham! The tale of the sacrifice hath returned, and they who are detached have advanced to the place of sacrifice, offering up their souls in the path of God, the Lord of creation. Neither the world nor its ornaments prevented them from turning unto the Most Exalted Horizon. Blessed is the soul that hath pondered on that which hath appeared in truth in this Day wherein the standard “There is none other God but Him” hath been raised above the highest ensigns. Do the people hear and deny it? Have their hopes prevented them from God, the Lord of the beginning and the end? Say: Fear God, O people, and withhold not yourselves from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of lords. The Promise hath come, and that which was hidden in the eternity of eternities hath appeared. Cast aside vain imaginings, holding fast unto the cord of God, the Lord of Days. Thus hath the pearl of utterance appeared from the treasury of My Most Exalted Pen. Blessed are ye, O ye who possess insight!</p>
<p>O Ja’far! Be content with what hath been ordained for thee. We beseech God to manifest unto thee that which shall profit thee in all His worlds. Verily, He is the Bestower, the All-Bountiful. O Fath’u’llah! The Wronged One remembereth thee while under the talons of hatred. To this testifieth the Lord of Names in this station which God hath made the Dawning-Place of lights. O Nasru’llah! The Hidden hath appeared and the Concealed hath come, yet the people are in heedlessness and behind a veil. Blessed is the strong one whom the hosts of the world have not weakened, and the steadfast one whose feet have not slipped through the clamor of the wicked. Give thanks unto God for having been mentioned by the Tongue of Grandeur while He was in the prison of the wicked ones. O Isaac! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He mentioneth thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the earth and of the heavens. Beware lest anything whatsoever prevent thee from the path of God, the Lord of all men. Take hold of the Book with the power that proceedeth from Him, and follow not every doubtful idolater. Say: O people! By God, the Desired One hath come and that which was recorded in the Mother Book hath appeared. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken while the Wronged One was walking in the prison because of what the hands of the wicked have wrought.</p>
<p>Verily, We make mention of him who was named Haqq-Nazar, whose name was blessed by the glance of his Lord’s favor, the Almighty, the All-Choosing. Give thanks unto God for this supreme bounty and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the world, and glorification be unto Thee, O Master of souls. O David! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the Loving. He maketh mention of thee from this Spot which God hath made the Dawning Place of mysteries. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the world, and glory be unto Thee, O Dayspring of lights. The glory rest upon thee and upon thy wife who turned unto God while the handmaidens were wrapt in astonishing heedlessness. Verily, when We gazed toward the horizon of bounty, We made mention of those whose names were not mentioned, as a grace from the Wronged One, that they might give thanks unto their Lord, the Cleaver of the dawn. O people of God! Rejoice that your names have flowed from the Pen of Command at a time when agitation hath so seized the dwellers of the earth that it hath been cleft asunder and the mountains have been scattered. Take the chalice of salvation through the power of your Lord, then drink therefrom in My Name through which God hath subdued all names. We have stood before all faces and spoken verses that all the treasures of the earth cannot equal. He Who caused bodies to soar beareth witness to this. Neither the hosts of the world nor the ranks of nations have hindered Us. Every fair-minded and discerning one beareth witness to this.</p>
<p>We make mention of My handmaidens there and give them the glad-tidings of My grace, My loving-kindness, and My mercy that have preceded all who are in the earths and heavens. We make mention of My handmaiden who was named Hajar and bid her to the patience which God hath made the nature of the chosen ones. Grieve not over anything. Verily, He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing. We beseech God to manifest for you that which will solace your eyes and gladden your hearts. Verily, He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>At the close of the Book We make mention of the Mizban and give him the glad-tidings of his Lord’s loving-kindness, the All-Merciful, Who speaketh in the Most Great Prison before the faces of the nations: “Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.” O Mizban! Hear the call once again. We made mention of thee before in such wise that the fragrance of utterance was wafted throughout all possibility. We beseech God to strengthen thee in steadfastness and to aid thee in that which He hath revealed in the Book. Give thanks unto God for this most great remembrance and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all beings. I beseech Thee to write down for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will draw me nigh unto Thee in all conditions.” The glory rest upon thee and upon thy wife who attained unto faith while the divines and theologians of the earth turned away. He Who possesseth the Mother Book beareth witness unto this.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Most Great, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified above the mention of all the worlds, befitteth the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court of the Desired One, Who hath ordained for every being seven stages: Will, Purpose, Destiny, Decree, Permission, Term, and Book. Each of these stages is a fathomless ocean, sanctified beyond all limits. The pearls thereof lie preserved and concealed within the shells of God’s protection, exalted be His glory. In truth, were one to attempt to describe these stages and stations, each of which is a dawning-place of divine knowledge and a dayspring of heavenly wisdom, this pen and paper would not suffice, nor would all the pens and pages in the realm of knowledge, which is the station of them that are nigh unto God. He is the One Who hath power over all things. Whatsoever He hath created, be it atoms or what lieth beneath or above them, all testify to and proclaim His greatness, sovereignty, might, power, generosity, grace and mercy. Glorified, glorified be He! Who can adequately praise His creation, much less His loved ones, His chosen ones, and them that are related unto Him? At this station, silence is most fitting.</p>
<p>Blessings and peace be upon Him through Whose name the Ark of Inner Meanings sailed upon the Sea of Utterance, through Whom the Sun of Unity shone forth from the horizon of possibility, through Whom lands were opened and the stations of servants were elevated. And peace be upon His family and companions, through whom the edifices of idols were shaken and the hearts of idol-worshippers were disturbed, through whom the signs and laws of God and His sovereignty and commandments were spread abroad, and through whom trembling seized the very foundations of those who denied the beginning and the return. And peace and abundant greetings be upon them all.</p>
<p>Thereafter, O beloved of my heart, thy noble letter arrived and my heart was gladdened thereby and my spirit was refreshed, for this servant perceived therefrom the fragrance of love and affection and the mention of God, the Lord of creation. When I read and understood it, I approached the Sacred Threshold and presented it before the countenance of the Lord, may our souls be a sacrifice for Him […]</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned thy face toward God and gazed upon the Most Exalted Horizon! In these days new tribulations and successive sorrows have befallen Us. Tyranny, in the name of justice, is seated upon the throne. All governmental affairs are suspended. This Wronged One hath been accused of that which none hath ever uttered and subjected to treatment without parallel. Yet this Wronged One hath clung to gracious patience and, utterly detached from all else save God, hath remained engaged in His remembrance with the utmost joy and fragrance. In truth, in His path fire is light and hardship is mercy. Thirst in this wilderness is the very essence of Kawthar - despite them and those who have debarred themselves from this glorious and wondrous station, a station wherein the ocean of light is manifest, yet they attribute darkness to it. Tyranny hath reached such heights that the very embodiment of justice is consumed in lamentation. The scratching of the Pen and the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree are raised at all times, yet none can be found who would hearken unto them.</p>
<p>Despite all encompassing trials and tribulations, We have been and are occupied with the remembrance of God’s loved ones. Thy mention hath been before this Wronged One and, God willing, shall continue to be. We beseech God to ordain for thee that which shall gladden thine eyes and rejoice thy heart, to open before thy face the door of His mercy, and to cause the rains of His grace and favors to descend upon thee from the clouds of His bounty. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer, and worthy to respond. We make mention of and convey Our greetings unto him who hath turned, heard, responded, witnessed and beheld - he who was named Muhammad in the Book of Names - and unto those who are there. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid them, draw them nigh unto Him, and to ordain for them that which shall never perish. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! His grace is evident, His bounty manifest, His mercy pre-existent, and His loving-kindness all-encompassing. We beseech and supplicate Him to increase His favors at all times and to gladden the hearts of them who are nigh and sincere through the lights of the Luminary of utterance. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. There is no God but He, the Most High, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>Unto the beloved of the heart, His Holiness M.H. (upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah] the Most Glorious), do I convey mention, praise and greetings. Indeed, in separation man perceives the station of the blessing of reunion and understands it. I beseech and supplicate the Truth to remove the veil and reveal the Beauty. Likewise, unto the masters and all the friends do I convey greetings and praise, and I seek that which is the cause and source of the manifestation of eternal blessing. Verily our Lord is the Lord of earth and heaven, the Lord of the throne and soil. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. He is the Strong, the Mighty.</p>
<p>As for thy having written, despite the multitude of affairs and occupations, about the degrees of remembrance of the beloved of the heart, His Holiness M.H. (upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of creation), and likewise thy mention of thine own heedlessness - that spiritual friend said to write that this entire letter is evidence of attention and remembrance, and every word thereof testifieth to love, steadfastness, adherence, attachment and pure servitude unto God, the Lord of the seen and unseen, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>As to what was written concerning toil, hardship and difficulty, it is indeed the pure truth. However, since engagement in affairs is an imperative command and is also counted as worship, that very moment - meaning the moment of engagement and giving and receiving - is considered remembrance, orientation towards God, and worship. This evanescent one beseeches the Eternal Truth to assist that spiritual beloved in all conditions, in such wise that despite lack of opportunity and preoccupation, the fragrances of His love may be diffused throughout the world and its effects become manifest in souls.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about felicity, acceptance, destiny and fate - that which is outwardly established and witnessed accords with what has been stated: “Nothing exists in heaven or earth except through Will, Purpose, Destiny, Fate, Permission, Term and Book.” Every soul that comes into the world brings with it countless means, though these may not be visible to the outward eye. This station is in truth established. That which is counted among the irrevocable things cannot be changed, while other than this changes through means and deeds. The first inclination that arises in man before the appearance of means is the station of Will; the first conception of means is the station of Purpose; Destiny is the station of measure and proportion, meaning the appearance of means in measure; and Fate is the composition of what was destined. They have described the station of Destiny as most great, as it is said: “Destiny is a secret among God’s secrets, a command among His commands, and a protection among His protections, sealed with God’s seal…” until He says “it is a surging ocean which you cannot enter, and a dark night which you cannot traverse, abundant with fish in its depths which extend between heaven and earth, and its width extends between east and west, and in its depths is a sun that gives light.”</p>
<p>Man observes these stations in his own stations, meaning the seven degrees that were mentioned. After the appearance of Fate, the execution is witnessed, which is the same as Permission. For everything there is and has been a Term, meaning the duration of its existence. Then appears the Book, which is the station of the completeness of the thing. Praise be to God that today the Mother of Stations is manifest, and that is severance from all things and committing all affairs to Him. In this case, these stations themselves are unveiled.</p>
<p>Furthermore, praise be to God that the honored beloved, his eminence Haji - upon him be God’s most exalted peace - and his honored family and children - upon them be God’s peace - have partaken of the cups of the Most Great Chalice and from the goblets of the Most Exalted Cup. May it be wholesome and pleasant for you. It is requested that you convey greetings and praise to the friends of God, exalted be His glory - meaning those who are enkindled with the fire of love and illumined with the light of knowledge and steadfastness. I beseech the Wise, the Powerful One to assist each one in that which its mention is everlasting and eternal. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the One with power over what He wishes, and He is the Giver, the Bestower, the Generous.</p>
<p>At this moment, the most luminous letter of the beloved of the heart, his eminence M.H. - upon him be God’s peace and care - arrived, but there was no opportunity to write a response. God willing, it will be written and sent later. Remembrance, praise and peace be upon you and upon those with you and upon every steadfast, upright one. And praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O Trial of eternity! Await thou the Trial of God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting, for verily it shall come unto you in truth - indeed it hath now come in truth, so bear ye witness. And verily it is a Trial that shall distinguish between the Kaf and the Nun, and shall differentiate all things from that day until the Day when He shall again be made manifest in wondrous days promised through the revelation of His hidden Essence and the reality of His eternity in the year Mustaghath. And this is an irrevocable truth, and verily this is a Trial that shall seize all contingent things, both unseen and visible. Say: Verily this is a Trial wherein souls shall be perturbed, minds shall be bewildered, and mysteries shall be split asunder, then shall the spirits of the sincere be thunderstruck thereby. Say: Verily this is a Trial whereby the heavens of knowledge and wisdom shall be cleft, and the earths of might and power shall be rent asunder, then shall the mountains of glory and light be crushed thereby. Say: Verily this is a Trial whereby the thrones of grandeur shall be shaken and the denizens of the pavilions of loftiness shall be overturned, then shall the concourse of the Spirit in the holy immortal realm be astounded thereby. Say: Verily this is a Trial whereby the suns of radiance shall be darkened and the moons of blindness shall be eclipsed, then shall the stars of knowledge fall from the heavens of the Cause. Say: Verily this is a Trial whereby God shall test every atom, then all created things, then all who are in the earths and heavens, then all the worlds. And verily this is a Trial whereby honored servants shall be tried, then sincere servants, then the angels brought nigh, then the dwellers of the most exalted Concourse. Say: Verily this is a Trial wherein all who claim love for and faith in God, the All-Subduing, the Most High, the Beloved, through this Beauty, the Inaccessible, the Glorious, the Beloved, shall be purified. And verily this is a Trial whereby the holy fire shall be extinguished, then the water of reality shall freeze, then the Lote-Trees of light shall quake and the denizens of Sinai shall perish. Say: Verily this is a Trial that shall seize every sound mystic, every wise adult, every knowing administrator, every trustworthy sovereign, then every Prophet-Messenger. Say: Verily this is a Trial whereby all horizons shall be convulsed and all people shall be tried, and some shall be separated from others as the earth is separated from heaven - nay, more severe than that. Exalted then be God, the Manifester of this inevitable Trial! And thereby He separated what was separated in the time of all the Prophets and Messengers, and before them in times that the knowledge of the wise cannot encompass, and He shall separate thereby all that shall be separated in future times. And verily this is a hidden mystery preserved in holy treasuries, and none knoweth it save him whom God hath given insight that is veiled from eyes of steel. And verily this is such insight that were the people of the worlds of reality and the dwellers in the repositories of the Cause in the inmost sanctuaries of glory to perceive it, they would gasp within themselves and shudder in their beings, and would be unable to witness it. By God the Truth! Through this Trial the vision of mystic hearts shall be snatched away, and holy and spiritual sights shall be dazzled, then shall the moons of divinity be eclipsed in the heaven of the Cause. Say: By God! In this Trial the feet of the mystics who know God by God shall slip, even those who in every moment behold the mysteries of the Cause and Truth with penetrating vision. Say: Verily this is a Trial wherein the veils of hidden things shall be rent asunder and the secrets of confidential matters shall be uncovered, then shall the treasures of hearts be revealed […]</p>
<p>Say: By God, there shall be tested in this test, and cast into the fire, servants who never entertained in their minds even an atom’s weight of the thought that they worshipped aught but God. Say: By God, in this test shall be tried even the realities of those who have never been heedless of God and His Cause for the twinkling of an eye, and who have at all times been mindful. How much more then shall be tried the servants who have not understood of this Cause - whereby all the Manifestations are thunderstruck - even as much as an ant might comprehend of its two wings; these are they who stand recorded before God as the very essence of heedlessness. Say: By God, the Truth, in this test shall slip the feet of all the mystics among the celestial concourse ere they become aware of themselves, or their hearts comprehend, or they distinguish aught with the highest gems of intellect in their pristine understanding. After it is revealed to them what they have neglected, they shall cry out within themselves and lament in their souls, then shall they weep and wail, then shall they cry aloud; and were they to possess all the spirits of the heavens and earth of immortality, they would wish to sacrifice them, that they might not be veiled for less than a moment from this exalted Beauty. By God, the Holy Spirit trembles in those days, and the Light of the Divine Presence quakes, and the Most Great Mystery shudders, and the angels of the Throne in the realm of glory are struck with fear. Say: By God, in this test shall the winds be tried at the very moment of their blowing by their very blowing, then shall the waters be tried at the time of their flowing and drinking, then the fire when it blazes and rages. By God, all the earths and heavens shall be tried, then the suns and stars, then the moons, then the seas with all their ships and waves and drops, and whatsoever wonders of God’s handiwork, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting, have been ordained therein. By God, everything shall be tried in everything, from everything, to everything, by the very essence of a thing, and not an atom of air shall escape therefrom. This is the mystery of what was sent down aforetime upon the First Beloved from the realm of God, the Most High, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and it is that verse wherein God counseled Luqman for his son: “O my son! If there be the weight of a mustard seed, and it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth; verily God witnesses what they do.” By God, were you to observe, you would witness that the lamp which is lit before you in the night is tried in the very moment it is kindled, then the bird that circles round it, then the lights that shine forth from it and encompass its sides and cast upon visible directions. By God, the test tries, and the touchstone proves, and the scrutiny examines, and the sieve sifts, and a single hair splits into a thousand pieces, then each piece is tried - all this from the appearance of this Most Great Test which appears from this Most Ancient, All-Possessing Quarter. Its winds have now blown, and soon shall come in the year of tribulation and seize all lands, and all therein shall cry for help. By God, and by the Manifestation of this Ancient Beauty, in His essence, for His essence, through His essence - were God to remove one veil from what is hidden, there would occur such an earthquake in the pillars of the Thrones that the bearers of the Throne would be shaken and their very beings would well nigh scatter. And were I to make mention of this Most Great News and the manifestations of its test and its most upright trials from this day unto the endless ages of eternity, by God, its mention would never be exhausted and its description would never end, even were there to flow, after all the seas God has created, seventy thousand times as many again - exalted then is God, this is but a limited portion.</p>
<p>O Sun! Emerge from the eclipse of fancy and desire and behold the Most Luminous, Most Manifest, Most Glorious Orb in the pole of the heaven of eternity with such radiant lights that were all the atoms of existence, both seen and unseen, to reflect but the least ray from the rays of its light, verily would they all attain unto the cry “Verily I am God!”</p>
<p>O Sun! Behold on one hand the radiance of His grace’s lights which, with a single effulgence, hath adorned all the heavens of the unseen majesty with suns of glory and honored the mountains of holy oneness with the appearance of hidden mines. And on the other hand, the piercing meteor of His [presence] hath demolished all the thrones of loftiness and elevation, and cast down the exalted suns of the heaven of grandeur to the dust of abasement.</p>
<p>But O Sun! What can this evanescent atom mention of how, at the exaltation and appearance of this Most Great Orb, what standards of rancor and hatred have been raised by the possessors of authority from the Bayan against this Beauty of the All-Merciful? By the One Holy and Unique Essence, never hath such a thing appeared in the world of creation. He whose very existence was created by a word hath repeatedly attempted to veil this Sun of Divine Beauty behind the clouds of rancor and envy, and to conceal His purified Beauty from the horizon of possibility. But the Hand of Power and Divine Dominion exposed his plots and machinations and preserved His Own Beauty of Glory through the angels of His Own Holy, Inaccessible and Exalted Being.</p>
<p>O Sun! He whose elevation and fame He caused to spread throughout all lands for twenty years, such that all servants worshipped him as lord and knew him as their [object of worship] - now when he witnessed the exaltation of God’s Cause, the furnace of envy and hatred began to boil and several times he attempted in various ways to shed His pure blood. When he despaired of this intention, he pursued other schemes until finally, when they observed that all the seas could not extinguish this fire of hatred and all the waters of possibility and existence could not calm this flame of rancor and envy, they at last chose seclusion from all and sat alone, single, and solitary in a house, that perchance thereby the fire of envy of the people of hatred might somewhat subside. Even this did not suffice or satisfy them. From every direction and quarter they have kindled the fire of sedition and corruption, and have cast every manner of turmoil and upheaval among all. And now they seek to use all religions, nations and governments to manifest hatred toward this Wronged Beauty and accomplish their purpose.</p>
<p>O Sun! The details of the events of this year of adversity are more than could be recorded in the chronicles of the first and the last. A hundred thousand worlds of mysteries could not contain a single letter of its telling.</p>
<p>O Sun! Soon wilt thou hear the croaking of infidelity and hypocrisy spread throughout all regions, and they shall return upon themselves that which they themselves have wrought, and shall raise the cry of being wronged. This leaf was written last year in reply to thy letter […]</p>
<p>I certainly had five times what was written, but due to the consideration of ordained mysteries in the Kingdom of destiny, they were not sent. Until these days, when it was observed that the great outcry had arisen and a mighty sedition had appeared, I decided to send them in legible handwriting, since the way I first wrote them could not be read properly. Before even one page was completed, a hundred thousand seas of calamitous waves descended upon the Most Glorious Countenance, such that the pen ceased from writing and the tongue from speech. The servant of God, Aqa Jan.&nbsp;And in these days, a letter arrived from you and his honor, the exalted Name of God, the Sacrifice. I intended to send a detailed reply to them, but the details of the situation are as has been submitted. With pure and most exalted greetings, I remain mindful of their condition.</p>

<p>=== START BH00638 ===</p>
<p>O Abu-Darda!</p>
<p>He is God, the Most Holy, the Most Pure!</p>
<p>O friend! God willing, may you remain protected from the fire of opposition of the Nimrod-like manifestations, and in all ages be engaged in praising the Truth. Say: The Cause of God is more manifest than to need proof or evidence, for in all times and ages there hath appeared that which transcendeth human capacity. Therefore, the excuse of those who hesitate is unacceptable before God. Were people to adorn themselves with fairness, all would acknowledge that the divine testimony and proof of the All-Glorious, the Self-Subsisting, hath appeared in its essence. How many were the souls who witnessed with their own eyes extraordinary events and divine manifestations, their tongues uttering praise of the All-Merciful Beauty to such extent that they composed countless poems in His praise. Yet they became so veiled by that which hath never been deemed to exist in God’s sight that they denied it all, and now they wander in the wilderness of error and traverse the desert of heedlessness and ignorance, to such degree that they have become oblivious to all they had witnessed with their own eyes and perceived with their own hearts. Thus hath it ever been and ever shall be. Even if the Truth should at all times appear with clear and manifest proof, the idolaters would derive no benefit therefrom. Just as in every age they demanded miracles and extraordinary signs from the Manifestations of God Himself, and whenever these appeared, the opposition of the deniers and the fire of hatred grew fiercer and more intense. As ye have heard, I swear by the peerless God that not a single atom moveth in the heavens and earth save by His leave and will. He knoweth what is hidden and concealed in the hearts of His servants, and is able to subdue the earth and all who dwell therein with a single word. However, were such matters to be manifested, all would acknowledge them willingly or unwillingly, yet such acknowledgment would have no value. Therefore, at times the divine manifestations of power are revealed and apparent, and at times concealed and hidden. In their revelation, they draw the people of attainment to the heaven of witnessing, and in their concealment, they distinguish between those of certainty and those of doubt. Thus was it witnessed how people slipped from the path of God’s Cause when the winds of trials blew, though in all divine tablets mention had been made of severe days to come. It was clear and evident that a great tribulation would surely appear. This was announced only that people might be informed and prepared, that perchance they would not be disturbed when trials appeared, but would ascend with complete assurance to the heaven of the All-Merciful and walk in the paradise of certitude. Nevertheless, some remained veiled and others became disturbed and shaken, except those divine souls who were planted by God’s hand in the paradise of certitude and were given to drink from the living waters. These are the children of the spirit on earth and God’s trustees in all lands. God created them from the lights of the Throne, and He verily is the Ancient Bestower.</p>
<p>Say: O loved ones of God! Strive ye to drink from the cup of faith in the name of the All-Merciful during the days of trials, for what is beloved is that people should turn toward the realm of divine oneness during severe times. Otherwise, when the winds of might blow from the direction of God’s power, all will enter the shore of faith and claim certitude. However, this faith and certitude are contingent upon another trial, until such time and such an age when it shall be made manifest, for the cause of this faith has been outward means rather than divine attractions. We beseech God to assist those who have believed, to make them steadfast in His love, and to nourish them from the fruits of the holy tree, which whosoever partakes thereof, nothing in the heavens and earth shall cause him to grieve.</p>
<p>Say: O servants! Hearken unto the counsels of this Prisoner, which He imparteth purely for the sake of God. Fear not for your lives in the path of the Beloved, and be not dismayed by the manifestations of oppression and tyranny. By the Most Great Luminary! None of the peoples of the earth hath or shall have dominion over those who are assured of God, save over their outward bodies, and they have not and shall never have authority in the realms of the spirit. Were the idolaters to reflect even briefly, they would never molest these divine temples, for the purpose of those who turn away hath been and shall be to abase these tranquil souls. And if they knew that within the martyrdom of these souls lie eternal lives, and in their abasement in the path of the All-Merciful is concealed the kingdom of glory, they would never molest them. The ascension of spirits from bodies will occur in any case, whether through apparent illness or implements of war. Thus, blessed are those souls who lay down their lives in the path of the Friend and hasten to the Supreme Companion. O friends of Truth! Count not this matchless favor as insignificant, and be not disturbed by the winds of trials. And if one is granted martyrdom, let him count it as a bounty, for this eternal sovereignty is neither the portion of every ignorant one nor the share of every blind one. This is the cup of the yearning ones and the wine of the lovers; the hypocrites have been and shall be deprived thereof.</p>
<p>O Khalil! In all the Tablets of constancy wherein mention hath been made of grievous days, We have counseled all servants with compassionate exhortations that none should molest anyone, and no soul should contend with another. The decree of killing hath been entirely forbidden in the wondrous Tablets. Nevertheless, that which happened hath happened. Say: O servants of God! Defile not the good earth with the blood of idolatrous souls. The victory of truth hath been through goodly counsels and wise exhortations, not through conflict and contention. Hearken unto the counsels of the Most Exalted Pen and transgress not the command of God. In this Revelation, corruption hath been entirely forbidden, and the purpose hath been and shall be the reformation of the earth and the unity of its peoples. By the Sun of the horizon of sanctification! If My loved ones are slain, it is more beloved to this Servant than the shedding of anyone’s blood. Say: O friends! Be not content with harm to any animal, much less to humans. God hath ever commanded and decreed that which is for the good of mankind. If they turn unto God’s guidance, this good shall return unto those accepting souls, otherwise thy Lord is indeed independent of all worlds.</p>
<p>He maketh mention, moreover, of Jinab-i-Niyaz. Should you meet with him, say that whatsoever hath been manifested sufficeth all existence. Several times have We revealed Ourself unto you, both in sleep and in wakefulness, including once when you were walking upon the mountain. Reflect a little, that perchance you may become aware of that which transpired. After you have turned unto Him and attained certitude, the grace of God shall encompass you. Soon shall the commander and the commanded fall silent, and God shall aid you through the truth if ye be of them that are assured of Him. Verily, He is nigh unto them that do good.</p>
<p>It behooveth you in these days to arise in service to the Cause of God. Consider the diverse peoples, how they are all deprived from the shores of divine unity, inasmuch as they have found the Manifestation of Truth to be contrary to their vain imaginings. Thus do they all still wait, even though He Whom they await hath appeared like unto the sun from the horizon of divine unity.</p>
<p>In these times, remain not veiled from the manifestation of two Names in a single Temple, and account all else as non-existent. The springtime hath appeared and the beauty of the rose is unveiled and manifest. O nightingale! Cease not thy melody, for this is thy time and thy day, as none but thee hath such a share of the beauty of the rose. Sing and warble in this Garden as thou pleasest, and be not of them that are silent.</p>
<p>It would be a pity if you, who for years have been known and remembered by the name of Truth, should today remain veiled from the Truth. Finally, it is said: O Khalil, sacrifice the servant of the Bayan in the path of the All-Merciful, and fear not the hosts of Satan - that is, dedicate thy wisdom and utterance to the promotion of the Cause of the All-Merciful. The loved ones of God must, one and all, be distinguished from all who dwell on earth by their words and deeds, such that truthfulness may be evident from their words and the sweet fragrances of holiness may waft from their deeds. The Spirit be upon thee and upon thy brethren, then upon those whom divine guidance hath preceded from God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the Creator, the Fashioner, the Maker, the One Who giveth life and death, Who hath taken unto Himself no peer, no partner and no equal. He is the One, the Single, the Self-Subsisting. He begetteth not, nor is He begotten, and there is none like unto Him in all creation, nor any equal in invention. He hath manifested Himself in the Return and hath spoken as He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>Thereafter, it is submitted that your letter dated the 7th of Sha’ban was received on the 19th of the blessed month of Ramadan. It brought both comfort and joy, dispelled grief and increased gladness. God willing, may all the friends in this most mighty, most holy Day attain unto the infinite divine bounties and be engaged in His remembrance.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Aqa Muhammad Husayn Navvaz of K—, mentioning his arising to serve the Cause, this was submitted before the most holy, most glorious, most exalted Presence. He said: “It behooveth him to be occupied day and night in thanksgiving and praise to the Best-Beloved of all ages, for He hath aided him to recognition, remembrance and service. Verily, He is the Helper, the Mighty, the Generous.” Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be My Baha, who hath ascended to the Supreme Companion, made mention of him before the Face of the Wronged One and testified to his being enkindled with the fire of divine love. Beyond all mention and utterance, God is the Witness and the All-Seeing. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. His mention hath been recorded in the Tablets by the Supreme Pen. God willing, may he be aided to preserve this most exalted station. We, from this Station, glorify him and counsel him with that whereby the Cause of God may be exalted amongst His servants, and We make mention of him on this Day that hath no equal among days, centuries and ages. God willing, may they attain unto such a station wherein the conditions of the people of the earth shall not prevent them from the Truth, and may they speak forth the praise of the Beloved of all possibility with the utmost joy and yearning, with spirit and fragrance.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant also submitted and sent a letter to them last year, and that same letter bore and beareth witness to God’s grace and favor concerning them, for in those days whatsoever this servant heard from the blessed tongue regarding them, he made mention thereof. In any case, the work of no doer of good hath ever been or ever shall be lost. I beseech God to aid them at all times to that which is pleasing unto Him.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about his honour N.S.Kh.A. - upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah] - praise be to God, he was and continues to be the recipient of divine favors. He turned to the horizon of the Manifestation and partook of the sealed wine. Once these words were heard from the blessed tongue saying: “Verily he drank from the ocean of attainment and achieved the presence when the Cause was still concealed behind the veils of might, power, protection, grandeur and majesty.” Last year he had requested multiple Tablets for the friends of those regions, and all were revealed from the heaven of God’s will and are now in this servant’s possession. However, due to wisdom they have not yet been sent. God willing, they shall be sent. If you meet him, convey to him the glad tidings of divine favors, and likewise mention on behalf of this evanescent servant whatever is befitting. I beseech God to adorn him in the assemblage of the world with the ornament of love for the Ancient King, in such wise that he may be remembered by His name and known by His love. Although he is now known and described thus among the chosen ones, later the names of the sincere ones and those who have turned to God will be exalted in all regions. Verily our Lord, the All-Informed, is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about his honour Aqa ’Abdu’s-Samad, that he has rent asunder the veils and turned to the Lord of all return - blessed be he and joy be unto him. O My loved one! If all the peoples of the earth were to ponder the Cause of God with fairness, assuredly all would turn to the Dayspring of divine manifestation. The people are unaware and have not witnessed the waves of the ocean of utterance and have not attained to the effulgences of the Sun of Truth, and the reins of souls are in the grasp of those possessed of fancy and vain imaginings. These obstacles that have become the cause and reason of prevention have appeared from the deeds of souls themselves, while God, exalted be His glory, created all through one word and called all through one word. Blessed is he who is attracted by His call and turns to His horizon, and woe to those who turn away, and woe to the heedless. In any case, this evanescent servant beseeches God to aid his honour Samad to serve the Cause and make him among those on whom shall come no fear, neither shall they grieve.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the petition of his honour Mulla Husayn arrived, and it so happened that an hour after its arrival it was presented at the Most Holy Court, and these sublime words issued forth from the Dayspring of the mouth of the Revealer of verses - exalted be His grandeur: “O Husayn! Thy call has attained to the honor of being heard, thy state is witnessed and thy condition known. Be thou prepared to hearken unto that wherewith My Most Exalted Pen makes mention of thee from this Most Holy, Most Mighty, Most Glorious Station. By My life! Wert thou to find the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful, joy and gladness would seize thee from all directions. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Cast aside what thou hast and take what God, the Lord of all men, commands thee. Commit all thine affairs unto God and trust in Him and say:</p>
<p>“O Thou by Whose finger’s motion the earth was cleft and the heaven was split, and by Whose will the trumpet was blown and the mountains passed away! I beseech Thee to ordain for me from the wonders of Thy bounty and grace that which will profit me in every world of Thy worlds. O my Lord! Thou knowest what is with me and I know not what is with Thee, and Thou art more knowing of me than I am. Aid me in Thy Cause in such wise that I may choose what Thou hast chosen for me. Verily Thou art the Generous, the Bountiful.”</p>
<p>O Husayn! Thy call hath been heard, and the Wronged One hath turned toward thee from the Most Great Prison, and thy response hath been sent down from the heaven of the loving-kindness of the Desired One of all worlds. The will and desire of the friends must, God willing, be annihilated in the will and desire of the All-Merciful–that is, they must be content with whatsoever He hath willed. Blessed is he who hath attained unto this most exalted station! He is mentioned in God’s Book as being among those who are content and nigh unto Him. O Husayn! Be thou aware, and ponder the fathomless ocean of the grace of the Beloved of all possibility. The Tongue of Revelation maketh mention of thee, and this is that same Speaker Who called out from the Mount. Were thou to sacrifice a hundred thousand lives at His coming, they would not equal one word of those that have streamed forth from His tongue. Reflect upon thy Lord’s grace, and thy Lord’s loving-kindness, and thy Lord’s tender mercy, and thy Lord’s compassion, and be thou of the thankful ones. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>At this moment, when the perspicuous utterance of the Lord of the Day of Judgment reached this point, He desired to make mention of one of His friends, that the fragrances of His wondrous remembrance might be made manifest as befitteth Him. O Abu’l-Hasan! Since thou didst make mention of Muhammad-Qabli-Husayn-i-Naw, and the Supreme Pen hath shown loving-kindness, He now desireth to make mention of him who beareth his name, for in the prime of youth and the springtime of his life he turned toward the Lord of all return, and from ’Iraq and the Land of Mystery and the Most Great Prison loving-kindness was shown unto him. Blessed is he in that he hath attained and heard the call of his Lord and responded. We make mention of him even as We mentioned him before, and We give him the glad-tidings of that which hath been ordained for him from the presence of One mighty and strong. God willing, may they not become heedless of this great station and preserve it. It behooveth him at all times to remember his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He hath been recorded among those who preceded others in the Perspicuous Book. The friends of God were and are in that land, and owing to the blazing of the fire of tyranny some are concealed behind the clouds of wisdom. God will soon manifest through His sovereignty that which He desireth and will reveal the station of those who have turned unto Him and have hearkened unto His verses and have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur testified before the creation of the heavens and earth. The request of this evanescent one is that ye convey greetings and praise on my behalf to all the friends of God who dwell in that land and who gaze toward the horizon of God’s Will. We beseech God to assist them all and keep them steadfast upon the straight path of His Cause.</p>

<p>The tongue of truth speaks these words at the beginning of this letter: O companion of my soul, where art thou? In truth, no fire hath been or is greater than the fire of separation. Its flames melt the world of existence, and its sparks consume all that is. Yet in the estimation of the dwellers in the cities of yearning and the lovers, no bounty hath been or is more beloved than this, nor any gift more desired. They would freely sacrifice a hundred thousand lives to attain unto this fire. This fire, in one sense, is a masterful teacher, imparting the mysteries of instruction and making evident the hidden secrets. If I were to say it is more excellent than light itself, this would not be amiss, for it both illumines and bestows warmth. The hand is His hand, the decree is His decree. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, by the Dayspring of lights and the Lord of the righteous, He Who raised Him up and conversed with Him beyond the veil and honored Him with the Most Exalted Word–and verily this word is the lord of all utterances in the world, namely the word “Thou art the Beloved and Thou art the Adored One,” and in another word, “But He is the Apostle of God and the Seal of the Prophets”–that He may assist His servants in that which is the cause and source of power, greatness, and majesty for the people of divine unity.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! The traces of thy pen, which appeared in the form of a letter, arrived and the lamentation of that unique and lonely heart set my heart aflame, producing profound effects in all my limbs and members. These effects have been and are superior to the bounties of the world, nay rather, they are the cause and source of the manifestation of bounties. Well said the speaker: “I remain silent, being unable to mention numerous matters, and my utterance cannot encompass them; even were I to speak, I would speak little.”</p>
<p>The mention of such stations is not the work of pen or man. I beseech the incomparable grace of God, exalted be His glory, to inflame His loved ones with the fire of love and affection in such wise that it shall neither abate nor be altered nor be numbered. In any case, after reading and beholding this flame which appeared from the letter, I approached the Presence of the Master and presented it. He said:</p>
<p>“O Ali! The world, with all its vastness and greatness, has become constricted. The righteous are afflicted under the claws of the wicked. Greed and avarice have conquered the entire world. Should one observe with penetrating vision, one would see all under the talons of these two oppressors. War and strife in the world emanate from these two, and the conflict and corruption of nations are manifest through them. Every person of power is powerless before them, and every mighty conqueror is non-existent and null before their dominion. Should the fire of these two be quenched, the world would find peace, and all regions of the earth would be seen as one country. They have usurped the domains of the people of unity, and yet they seek more. Strange that until now the guardians of government and nation have not discovered the cause and reason, nor have they arisen to ensure prosperity and reform.</p>
<p>“Beseech God to protect what remains and to illumine the horizon of the world with the light of justice. I swear by the Sun of utterance that shineth from the horizon of the prison that most of the servants are unaware of that which benefiteth or harmeth them. The tongue of the world constantly giveth advice and remindeth; it declareth its own evanescence with utmost clarity, yet aware souls are rare. We beseech God’s boundless grace and mercy to make all aware and to aid them in rectifying what hath been lost.”</p>
<p>O Ali! This Wronged One is at this moment turning with complete attention toward thee and beseeching from God on thy behalf that for which there is no likeness or comparison. Verily God is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, and He is the All-Knowing, the Answerer.</p>
<p>We convey Our greetings to the loved ones. Each one is present before Our face. Every pure deed is a treasure for its doer and is preserved and safeguarded with the true Trustee. We make mention of all and counsel them to that which will exalt their stations, especially those souls who in this age have arisen to render assistance and are engaged in praise, glorification and service to the Cause. Peace be upon them, and mercy be upon them, and glory be unto them. We beseech God to aid them in all conditions to that which He loveth and pleaseth. Verily He is the Lord of creation and the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below.</p>
<p>In truth one is astonished at how long the oppressors of the world will continue to seek ascendancy, and what they have seen in plunder, pillage and bloodshed that they perpetually engage therein. I beseech God that what was formerly ordained by the Lord of the Cause may be made manifest–and that is the Most Great Peace. Should the kings attain to this supreme blessing and mighty gift, torment will be transformed into ease, tyranny into justice, poverty into wealth, hardship into bounty, and anxiety into tranquility. In these days the world of separation is possessed of another fire and another attraction, and no utterance can adequately describe it. Well have they said: The state of those who are attracted and sincere is transmitted from heart to heart. The tongue hath no access there and the pen is truly a stranger, while the inner tongue speaketh secretly these words:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Ordain for us that which will draw us nigh unto Thee, then grant us sustenance from the table of Thy heaven and illumine us with the light of Thy knowledge. O Lord! Disappoint us not of that which Thou hast ordained for the hopeful among Thy servants and them that hold fast among Thy creation. Then write down for us through Thy grace the gathering together. Verily Thou art the Lord of creation and the Sovereign of invention.</p>
<p>I convey greetings to the loved ones of that land, one and all, and I beseech God that they may at all times ascend the heights of mention and utterance. He is the Powerful One Whom the world’s events cannot frustrate from exercising His might, nor can the force of opposition hold back His authority. Glorified be His greatness and glorified be His dominion. There is none other God but Him. To that spiritual friend, his honor Aqa Mirza Ja’far-Quli, upon him be God’s peace and loving-kindness, I send greetings. At this moment they were making mention of him. His friends are not distant from His luminous presence. His grace hath made far distances near. We beseech Him to ordain for his honor the Mirza whatsoever conduceth to glory and bounty and blessing and nearness and praise. They said: We counsel all the friends to observe wisdom.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about his honor Aqa Musa, upon him be God’s peace, God willing may he be confirmed in that which God loveth and is pleased with. I also convey greetings to him and beseech divine confirmation.</p>
<p>At this moment another letter from that Beloved One arrived. Though whatever arrives from those pages - even if a hundred thousand letters, pages and books should come - all are contained in a single word, and it is: “Verily, my self, my being, my essence, my spirit, and whatsoever lay hidden in my innermost heart belong to God alone.” This blessed word cannot in this station be compared with previous words. This word belongs to the world of reality. I beseech God to cause all to attain unto it, that all may be focused on this station, may reach this station, and may hold fast and cling to this station.</p>
<p>In any case, the second letter also opened the gates of joy, and the caravan of gladness and delight arrived. A hundred thousand blessings upon that honored one and this servant! As to the regret you expressed regarding the delay of that which was mentioned - I swear by the Sun of Truth that we consider you and ourselves as one, and all that is there and all that is here as belonging to a single soul. This being the case, it is clear as light that that true Beloved One shows no negligence or delay in matters related to this place, but rather strives with all his being. This word is in truth the beginning of speech. Now that this greatest of ascents has transcended reckoning and been sanctified from all limitations, we beseech God - our Lord and your Lord - to unite us and ordain for us that which befits His glory, His mercy, His generosity and His favors.</p>
<p>God is witness and testifier that whenever I think of you or make a submission, I find myself in supreme tranquility. God forbid that this condition should ever change or be erased, for such a state would arise that time itself would cry out in anguish, let alone this servant. We conclude these words with the remembrance of God, the Lord of all beings, and we beseech Him to assist us in His remembrance, His praise, and the service of His loved ones. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Remembrance and praise be upon you, upon those who are with you, upon those who love you, and upon those who hearken to your words for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>

<p>O Javad, upon thee be the Glory of God! He is the One Who calleth between earth and heaven!</p>
<p>O Javad! Hearken unto that which the Nightingale of Sorrow warbleth upon the branch of grief by reason of what the hands of the oppressors have wrought. Verily, the viper hath bitten the Best of God’s creation, and the wolf hath devoured the chaste Joseph, and the Messenger lamenteth in His glorious and inaccessible station. By God! The denizens of Paradise have cried out, and the Concourse on High have wailed by reason of the throne of tyranny being established upon the seat of oppression without leave from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The people of ?ad have risen against those through whom the horizons of all lands were illumined, in that they have taken the viper as their leader instead of God. Thus have their souls enticed them. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing. We have seized him who arose in tyranny with a vengeance from Us. Verily, thy Lord is the Avenger, the Almighty. And We shall seize those who conspired with him in his designs. He, verily, is the Ordainer of whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>We make mention of Our servant Razzaq and those who are with him in Najm, who have turned towards the Most Sublime Horizon when every learned one who relied upon his own knowledge turned away therefrom, without any clear proof from God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O people of the village! Rejoice in that the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness maketh mention of you–He Who calleth out in the wilderness of utterance unto all created things and summoneth them unto God, the Mighty, the All-Informed. Blessed are ye for having turned unto Him and believed in God. He giveth you glad tidings through this Book, before which, when it was sent down, all the books of the world bowed down, though most of the peoples are heedless.</p>
<p>O Razzaq! Arise to serve the Cause of thy Lord and remind His loved ones with joy and fragrance. Then recite unto them what the All-Merciful hath sent down from the Kingdom of Utterance, that their eyes may be solaced thereby and their hearts be dilated in these days of God, the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful. We counsel you regarding the Most Great Trust and that whereby the Cause of God is exalted amongst His servants. He, verily, is the Faithful Counsellor. Adorn yourselves with My characteristics, then act in accordance with that which We have commanded you in My perspicuous Book. Hold fast under all conditions to the cord of steadfastness and cling to the hem of My Name, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O My Pen! Make mention of the loved ones of God who dwell in Muhammadabad and give them glad tidings of the grace of the Spirit, through Whose manifestation the breeze of God hath wafted and the fragrance of inner meanings hath been diffused between the heavens and the earth. To this testifieth everyone endowed with a refined sense of smell.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in that place! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, Who at every moment calleth unto all who are in the realm of existence, that He may draw them nigh unto the One, the All-Informed. Rejoice in My remembrance of you, then drink the water of immortality of My love from the chalice of My bounty in My Name, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. You are in your homes while the Lord of the Kingdom remembereth you from His mighty prison in the land of exile. Can any bounty equal this which ye witness today? Nay, by My Name, the All-Encompassing over all who are in the heavens and the earth! Abandon what ye possess and turn with illumined hearts towards the ocean of your Lord’s bounty, Who is encompassed by sorrows from every direction from those who have denied Him and His signs when He came with a manifest proof. Hold fast unto the Book of God. Verily, it will acquaint you with that which was hidden from you and guide you unto My straight path.</p>
<p>O Najaf! Mention hath been made of thee before the Throne, and there hath been sent down for thee and My loved ones in that place this Book, which, wert thou to place it upon a mountain, thou wouldst behold it stirred by its longing for the verses of God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. Be thou thankful unto God for this remembrance which is more precious than the world and all that hath been created therein. To this beareth witness every fair-minded and perceiving one.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who has been named ’Arab-’Ali, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. O servant! When thou hearest My call and attainest unto My verses, turn thy face toward God and say: “I beseech Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of earth and heaven, to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will purify the hearts of Thy servants. O Lord! Assist Thy loved ones to be steadfast in Thy Cause and in that which Thou hast commanded them in Thy Book. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest.” Everything beareth witness that Thou art the Omnipotent, the Almighty.</p>
<p>We make mention in this place of My loved ones in another village, ’Ali-Rida-Abad, and give them the glad-tidings of the favors of their Lord, the Lord of creation. O loved ones of the All-Merciful in that place! Hearken unto My call and arise to serve My Cause, and hold fast unto My laws and cleave unto My commandments, whereby the horizons have been illumined. Cast aside the customs of the people and what they possess, and take hold of the customs of God through the power of the Lord of the beginning and of the return. O My loved ones! Drink from the chalice of love and unity, then remember your Lord at eventide and at dawn. We have heard your call and witnessed your turning unto Him. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Beware lest the world and what is therein prevent you from this Cause whereby hearts have been perturbed and livers have melted. This is He Whom God hath made a sword unto His enemies and a spirit unto His loved ones. Verily, He is powerful over all who are in earth and heaven.</p>
<p>O Pen! Turn toward another village, Kakan, then make mention of its people from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, that the rapture of verses may seize them and draw them nigh unto God, the Lord of the Kingdom. O My loved ones! Remember My exile and My imprisonment and My tribulation, and that which hath befallen Me in this year at the hands of those who have denied the Witness and the Witnessed. They have slain God’s chosen ones and plundered their possessions and entered their homes with an injustice whereby all things have lamented and the eyes of the Concourse on High have wept. But the people do not understand. By My life! Were anyone to look and observe My limbs, he would find in every part of My frame the mark of the sword of every polytheist who hath turned away from God, the Lord of the unseen and the seen. We have spent all that We possessed in the path of God, the Mighty, the Loving. God hath cut down the tree of tyranny with the sword of justice. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is. Blessed are ye for having turned unto the Countenance and turned away from every veiled learned one. The glory be upon you, O My loved ones in My lands, and praise be upon you for having attained unto the days of God and found the fragrance of His beloved garment.</p>
<p>O Name of Generosity! Unto each of the people of the villages were sent down from the heaven of divine will wondrous and exalted verses. God willing, may they attain unto them and be engaged in the remembrance and praise of God. Command all to manifest praiseworthy character and attributes and befitting deeds from the presence of the Wronged One, that all may be adorned with a wondrous and exalted ornament. Send a copy of this Tablet to Abdu’r-Razzaq, upon him be the glory of God, that he may know with certainty that he is mentioned at the threshold of the Divine Throne. God willing, they must act and speak in a manner befitting the Days of God, that perchance the veiled ones may succeed in rending their veils and the sleeping ones may arise from the couch of heedlessness. We enjoin upon all to show patience and forbearance in this great calamity. Praise be to God, the hand of divine power hath removed from their midst that wicked soul who was the source and origin of oppression. O Javad! Observe the base rabble of the earth - one who was and is not worthy to serve even donkeys, him they took as their leader and by his decree martyred the chosen ones of God and His loved ones. Blessed are they who drank the choice wine of martyrdom in My path, and woe unto him for the oppression he manifested, from which all in the heavens and earth declare themselves innocent, as thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, doth testify. He chose everlasting torment for himself. Fie upon him and upon those who made him their leader! The polytheists of the Plain of Taff were asked: “For what crime did you martyr the son of the Messenger of God?” They replied saying that he had risen against the Imam of the Age. Now they say that Hasan and Husayn had risen against the Friday prayer leader. O Javad! All the corruption in the world hath been and shall be from these ignorant ones who appear in the garb of knowledge. All are seated upon the thrones of self and passion, and speak that which God hath not permitted. They judge according to their desires as they please. They slay the descendants of the Messenger while mentioning him in temples and mosques. Perdition upon them and upon those who followed them without leave from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. By what name did they plunder possessions? If they say those holy souls had, by reason of their faith in God, departed from the hosts of ignorance and for this offense deserved such punishment - what was the offense of the property, that they plundered the wealth of young and old? Their deeds curse them and their actions belie them, yet they comprehend not. The riches have returned to their source. By God’s life, they belong to Him and His like. Thus hath the matter been decreed and thus hath spoken the tongue of the Wronged One in this noble station. Convey My greetings to all the friends in that land and gladden them with the grace and mercy of God. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy family and upon My loved ones among the men and women servants who have attained unto the recognition of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Sanctified beyond the recognition of all created things!</p>
<p>Praise be to God, Who manifests the jewels of knowledge and wisdom through the divine and eternal signs, Who adorns the hearts of the people of certitude with everlasting and transcendent evidences, Who embellishes the tablets of contingent being with enduring and perpetual traces, and Who inspires the hearts of the faithful with mystic and unifying meanings. He is the One Who has concealed within the darkness of words the fountain of life, and has deposited within the mystery of verses the realities of knowledge and wisdom, and has veiled within the potentiality of evidences the subtleties of wisdom and utterance. Glorified, glorified be His sovereignty and how mighty is His proof! He created existence and made known the path of attainment, and adorned His sincere ones in the unseen and visible realms with the robes of nearness and acceptance. Blessed are they that attain, and joy be to them that arrive! Prayer and peace be upon the Dawning-Places of revelation and inspiration through whom the Way was made manifest and the Proof became evident, and through whom every seeker hastened to the court of the knowledge of his Lord, the Mighty, the Beautiful. And upon those who gathered their traces, who were guided by their lights, who walked by their lamp, and who weighed their deeds with their balance. They are among the people of the Crimson Ark sailing upon the sea of grandeur. Upon them be the glory of the Lord of Names every morn and eve.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Master of all necks and Ruler of the beginning and the return! With what tongue can I mention the signs of the might of Thy oneness, and with what utterance can I explain what hath appeared in creation from the traces of the sanctity of Thy unity? The lights of the sun of Thy singleness have encompassed all directions, and the manifestations of the outpouring of Thy mercy have enveloped all created things. Blinded be the eye that is deprived of beholding the dawning-places of the suns of Thy power on the horizons, and every tongue that hath not spoken in praise of the manifestations of Thy might and power on the Day of Meeting. Perish the hearer who heard not the striking of the trumpet of Thy Cause on the Day of the Covenant, and destruction unto the rider who raced not in the arena of Thy love on the Day of Manifestation and Effulgence, and remoteness to the human who attained not to the knowledge of the Manifestation of Thy Cause and the Source of Thy Revelation in this Day wherein leg was wound about leg.</p>
<p>O my God, my Lord and my Hope! Through the wonders of Thy power Thou hast manifested in the world that which the understanding of nations is powerless to comprehend, whereby Thou hast made clear the Way and made evident the Proof, and given the seekers to drink of the Kawthar and Salsabil. There remaineth no symbol that Thou hast not revealed, no word that Thou hast not interpreted, no verse that Thou hast not made clear, and no evidence that Thou hast not expounded. Yet despite all this, O my God, I witness that Thy servants remained heedless in Thy days, recognized not the dawning of the sun of Thy beauty, and perceived not the fragrance of Thy garment which was diffused in the days of the manifestation of the Exponent of Thy Self, the Dawning-Place of Thine Essence, the Dayspring of Thy signs, and the Mine of Thy evidences.</p>
<p>Thou beholdest, O my God, Thy servants whom Thou didst create for this Manifestation wandering in the wilderness of heedlessness and delusion, and unmindful of that which hath appeared through Thy grace of the hidden Mystery concealed and the promised Symbol recorded in the Tablets and Scrolls. I beseech Thee by Thy conquering power, Thy all-encompassing mercy, and Thy all-pervading will, to manifest in existence that which will draw all unto the Promised One, O Master of the seen and unseen! Thou art He Whose mercy hath preceded all created things and Whose bounty hath encompassed all beings. Look not, O my Hope, upon the weakness of Thy servants and the heedlessness of them that dwell in Thy lands. Aid the receptive beings to attain unto Thy manifest Law proceeding from the right hand of power and might. Verily Thou art the Master of creation and the Sovereign of all beings. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>O thou who art the object of the glance of favor and adorned with the robe of bounty, who calleth out in the lands in the name of thy Lord, the Possessor of existence and the Sovereign of the unseen and the seen! What thou didst write with the pen of love hath been received, and what was contained therein of the verses of love and unity hath been read. I beseech God, the Lord of the worlds and the Possessor of the Most Great Name, to preserve thee beneath His shadow and to assist thee in teaching His Cause and spreading His signs, and to provide thee at every moment with the bounty of His generosity and the Salsabil of His grace. Verily, He is the Kind, the Generous. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
<p>Grieve not over the delay in sending the writing. By thy life! My heart is occupied with thy remembrance and the remembrance of those who have remained steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord. At every moment I desire to manifest what is in the heart of the degrees of love, but for everything there is an appointed time and for all things a season. Nothing moveth except by the will of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Purposeful. Inasmuch as I relied upon what lay hidden of the degrees of concealed love, I paid no heed to the delay in reply until the time came when I moved the pen of love to manifest what was in the heart. I beseech my Lord, the Possessor of creation, to assist thee in that which shall endure throughout the duration of His most excellent Names and most exalted Attributes, and to make thee a standard of guidance among creation and a sign of steadfastness among all beings. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Glorious.</p>
<p>O thou who art beloved! Reflect upon the manifestations of the Cause and the heedlessness of the people of the earth. Man is bewildered by the veiling of the people of the lands. I know not in what valley they wander or to what thing they cling. Do they not see the rising of the Sun of inner meanings from the horizon of utterance, and do they not behold the dawning of the Luminary of knowledge and wisdom at the pole of possibility? Is there in their hands a greater proof than that which hath appeared in the world, and have they a stronger argument than that which the Sovereign of nations hath brought forth? Say: O ye who are veiled! Come, let us together supplicate concerning the Cause of God, the Possessor of what was and what shall be. Should We find what ye possess to be stronger than what We have, We shall be as We have been among the fair-minded, and should ye find what We have to be greater than what is in your hands, be fair and be not among the heedless.</p>
<p>Hath there appeared in any cycle from among the cycles the Cause of your Lord, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting, save as it hath appeared today from the horizon of power and might? Abandon what hath been woven by the hands of idle fancy and turn ye toward the direction of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Reflect upon the past centuries and ages. Did anything prevent the people of the Gospel from turning to the Mighty, the Beautiful, in the days of the rising of the Sun of the Qur’an except these vain imaginings which were built by the hands of heedlessness and forgetfulness? And were the people of the Torah veiled from the light of the Sun of Oneness on the day of the appearance of the Spirit except by what was inscribed by the pen of conjecture upon the pages of ignorance and heedlessness? It behooveth you in these days wherein the world hath been adorned with the lights of the Most Great Name and the body of contingent being hath been honored by the Word of knowledge and wisdom, to weigh every matter with the balance of reason and to leave unto the deficient what hath been uttered by the heedless and ignorant, and to hasten with your heads to the source of bounty and grace. It beseemeth not man to follow what others among his fellow men have spoken. It behooveth all to reflect at every moment upon spiritual progress and not to sully themselves with that which preventeth them from ascending to the heights of knowledge and wisdom. O thou who art beloved!</p>
<p>By Thy life! Man is astonished at the heedlessness of the people of the Bayan, even more than the people of the Furqan. They have veiled themselves from the light of the Cause after Our Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, guided them and perfected His proof unto them every morn and eve. Verily, he who sacrificed himself in His path for the Point of the Bayan, and was engaged at all times in His remembrance and praise, denied Him on the day of His manifestation and turned away from Him when the sun of His beauty dawned, following him who was veiled from the appearance of the light of divine knowledge by the veils of heedlessness and forgetfulness. How strange that they should content themselves with a mere trickle and deprive themselves of the ocean of the knowledge of their Lord, the Mighty, the Omnipotent!</p>
<p>Grieve not at what thou seest of the people in their error. Arise to promote the Cause of thy Lord, the Self-Sufficing, the Most High, with the wisdom which He hath sent down in His Tablets and enjoined upon His loved ones. Ask thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful, in all circumstances, not to deprive His servants of the ocean of His utterance and to guide them, through His supreme power, to the dayspring of His revelation and the source of His signs. Whenever thou turnest to the regions and associatest with the righteous ones, convey unto them the greetings from this Servant and remind them of the days of their Lord, the Generous, Who showed them the straight path.</p>
<p>Say: O loved ones of the All-Merciful! It behooveth you to stand firm in the Cause in these days wherein your Lord, the Mighty, the Gracious, hath been manifested unto all creation. Beware lest the tempests of trials and the storms of tribulations move you, or the doubts of the people of the Bayan veil you from the Dayspring of bounty and benevolence. Regard them as mere nothingness before the Command of your Lord, the Ancient of Days and the Sovereign of nations. I beseech God, your Lord, the Most Glorious, to protect you in His shadow and ordain for you the best of what is in His Book, and make you the standard of steadfastness in His lands and the sign of guidance among His servants. Verily, He is the Kind, the Generous. There is no God but He, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
<p>The Glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon you and upon everyone who is firm, steadfast and upright, and praise be to God, the Beloved of the mystics.</p>

<p>All praise, sanctified from mention and utterance and exalted above the comprehension of all contingent beings, befitteth the One True Object of all the worlds, Who hath caused mention of His loved ones to flow ceaselessly from His Pen and Tongue. They who have turned unto Him have ever been remembered before the Divine Throne, and ere any mention was made He made mention of them, and ere any utterance was voiced He adorned the realm of existence with the light of recognition. For every world He hath ordained a command, decreed an ordinance, and appointed a blessing. Yet for the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise there is another blessing and other fruits, and likewise for the dwellers of the Supreme Paradise His realms are boundless, and His favors - exalted be His glory and His bounty - are limitless. There is no God but Him, no Bestower save Him, and no Giver beside Him. Were the worlds to be mentioned and the veils to be rent asunder, all would hasten with boundless joy toward the Ultimate Goal and the Supreme Summit. However, due to the lack of capacity among the people of earth, the mysteries remain concealed and the tidings hidden.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God of the Kingdom of earth and heaven and Ruler of the realms above! This servant, from this station, beareth witness to that which the Tongue of Thy Grandeur hath spoken and which hath been revealed in Thy Books and Scriptures, that Thou art God, and there is none other God but Thee. Thou hast ever been powerful through Thy Will and sovereign through Thy Purpose. Tongues have fallen short of Thy praise and remembrance, and pens have failed to reckon Thy favors and bounties. Thou hast manifested Thyself for the guidance of Thy creation and their elevation to stations known only to Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee, O Lord of Lords and Ruler of the beginning and the end, by Thy Name, the All-Bountiful, through which the ocean of Thy generosity hath surged and the fragrances of Thy bounty have wafted throughout Thy lands, to assist Thy loved ones to remember and praise Thee and to serve Thy Cause. O Lord! Thou seest Thy servant turning unto Thee, seeking the wonders of Thy grace and the rain of Thy mercy. Send down upon him from the heaven of Thy bounty that which beseemeth Thy days. O Lord! Illumine him with the lights of the Daystar of Thy Revelation and ordain for him the good of what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Thereafter, O beloved of my heart, thy spiritual letter was repeatedly received, and there was delay in sending the reply. This delay was due to the abundance of correspondence, not the neglect of this servant. Surely that spiritual friend also giveth precedence to communications from the Presence over all other matters and occupations. God the One is witness and testament that due to the volume of writing and responding to the letters of the friends, not even the least opportunity is found and no time remains. That spiritual friend hath, by God’s grace and favor, drunk from the Kawthar of certitude and attained unto the choice wine of assurance. However, those souls who have newly turned toward and directed their faces to the Most Exalted Horizon must be assisted, that perchance through mention and utterance they may attain unto steadfastness and remain firm and immovable in the Cause. Though outwardly there was delay in sending the reply, God is witness and testament that thou hast not been absent from sight for a moment - thou hast been and art remembered, and God sufficeth as witness. After observing the letter of that honored friend, I approached the Most Exalted Station and it was presented before the countenance of the Lord of all beings and achieved the honor of His attention. Thus speaketh He, blessed and exalted be He:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Manifest, the All-Knowing […]</p>
<p>O servant! Upon thee be My glory! The radiant lights of the Sun of divine favor have been directed toward thee from the earliest days. Thou hast ever been and art remembered in the presence of the Wronged One. The acceptance, steadfastness, service and dedication of Dhabih, upon him be My glory, My favor and My mercy, have not been and will never be effaced from the Book of God. Verily he attained unto the Kawthar of My knowledge, the Tasnim of My favor, the Salsabil of My grace, and the choice sealed wine of the revelation of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the Wise.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the friends. Say: O people of God! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and hold fast unto that which will exalt the Word of God. The Most Exalted Pen hath ever been occupied with your mention and with counseling all upon earth. Strive that perchance the heedless may become aware and the oppressors be adorned with the ornament of justice. Whosoever hath today, through the aid of the Self-Subsisting Name, quaffed the sealed wine must, according to his capacity and means, make a supreme effort to quicken souls.</p>
<p>The gate of grace is opened and the living waters flow from the right hand of the Throne of the All-Merciful. By God’s life! If assured and contented souls arise to quicken hearts for the sake of God, they will surely achieve it. However, in all circumstances they must observe and hold fast unto wisdom. Whosoever hath attained the Most Holy Court hath become aware of the wisdom revealed in the Scriptures and Tablets. Today, that which conduceth to the tranquility and assurance of the servants is acceptable in the sight of God. Blessed are they who have held fast unto the Will of God and who act upon and adhere to that which hath been sent down from the Most Exalted Pen in the Book.</p>
<p>Convey greetings from the Wronged One to all thy relatives and give them the glad-tidings of the favor of the Goal of all existence, that perchance through the joy of God’s remembrance they may be freed from the sorrows and vexations of the world and illumine their hearts with the mention of the One True Friend. Your journey was for the sake of God. We beseech Him to aid you at all times. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The rain of divine mercy hath showered upon you from the heaven of bounty. The very mention of this is witness and the reality of these words is proof. There hath been and is no need for mention by this servant. From the day of your departure until now, you have been and are remembered in the presence of God. Your movement was for His sake and your journey was by His command. Your reward hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen and hath been recorded in the Book of ’Illiyyin. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Munificent, the Generous.</p>
<p>The honored mother, upon her be the Glory of God, and others, especially the sister-leaf, upon her be the Glory of God and His favors, who acted according to the divine Tablet and chose to travel - all have attained the lights of the Sun of Divine good-pleasure. Blessed are they and joy be unto them. This evanescent servant conveys greetings and praise to each of the relatives, and I beseech from God, exalted be His glory, that which shall never fade and which the world’s events cannot alter. He is the Bestower, the Kind. I convey greetings to the loved ones of that land and have beseeched and continue to beseech for each one the good of this world and the next. Blessed are the servants of this Revelation who have been designated by the Supreme Pen as the Party of God. This is a great bounty, this is a mighty blessing. I beseech from the heaven of grace that He may aid this Most Great, Most Holy, Most Pure, Most Exalted Party to that which befits this title and favor. To the gentlemen of that land who are adorned with the ornament of distinction, I convey greetings, praise, mention, glory and splendor. I beseech God to set them ablaze with such a fire as shall ignite all who are on earth. By the life of our Beloved and your Beloved! This is the time of assistance and these are the days of service. They must guide the people of the world to the horizon of the All-Merciful through wisdom and utterance. They are the guides of the servants and the helpers of the Cause in its beginning and end.</p>
<p>At this moment the Tongue of Grandeur speaks this most exalted word - blessed and exalted be His Word: “O servant in attendance! Write to the servant, upon him be My Glory: You have ever been elevated and mentioned in the Most Holy Court. Remember the days when you were present before the Wronged One, and heard what My Tongue uttered, and witnessed the effulgences of the lights of My horizon. Blessed are you and joy be unto you! You have attained to that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to open before your face a door of His grace. Verily, He is powerful over all things.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God! Blessings are successive and mercy descends at every moment. Congratulations to you and to all the family of the Sacrifice. What you sent arrived, and as it was expressive of your love, it truly became the cause of joy and delight. Action was taken in accordance with what that spiritual friend wrote, especially regarding the crafted items that were the work of your own hands. In all cases, success and confirmation are from God, exalted be His glory. We testify that there is no God but Him, in acknowledgment of His favors and bounties, and in confession of our powerlessness and inadequacy to mention and praise Him. We beseech Him to aid us in what He loves and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Lord of all beings. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Glorious. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those whom the events of the world have not prevented from the Lord of the Throne and earth.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power</p>
<p>The Most Holy testifies that He has ever been sanctified beyond all sanctification and beyond every mention uttered by the tongues of creation, and the Most Pure affirms that He has ever been, and will ever be, purified from whatsoever the contingent beings may express. He is the One before Whom Unity itself is ashamed to claim association, and the Single One before Whose court the very essence of Uniqueness blushes to be mentioned. Exalted, exalted is He above all mention and praise, and exalted, exalted is He above the attributes of all names. I testify that He was and is sanctified, purified, and exalted above whatsoever can be designated by any name, and shall remain as He has ever been. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Help in Peril.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice for your love. The servant has been blessed by the fragrant breezes of the roses of your utterance and has heard the nightingale of praise warbling upon the twigs of the Sadratu’l-Muntaha of your heart. From each of your remembrances I have detected the fragrance of the love of our Beloved and your Beloved. We beseech Him to cause us to ascend at all times to the heaven of greatness, power and glory. He is verily the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>Your letter dated the 3rd of Shawwal illumined the heart with the lights of joy and delight. Praise be to God, and we thank Him for this, and we beseech Him not to withhold from my heart your remembrance and your utterance. He is verily the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Regarding the books of Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God, you had written that whatever is completed should be sent. However, they themselves have provided a list, and accordingly have requested one Persian book. Here also Jenab-i-Jud, upon him be the Glory of God, was told and they have written, and the book of prayers is much beloved if its correct version can be found.</p>
<p>Concerning Jenab-i-Sa’id, what you had written was submitted to the Most Holy Court. They said: We beseech God to assist him and those in Iraq to observe wisdom, harmony and unity, and to confirm them in that which befits the days of their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, mention of the ascension of the sister of Mihman, upon them both be the Glory of God, was submitted to the Most Holy Court. The blessed tongue spoke these words: Upon her be the Glory of God, His remembrance and His praise. We testify that she turned to God, heard His call and responded with a clear mention, and attained the Day of God and was assured of His presence while most men were in doubt concerning this mighty, exalted station. We have mentioned her with these words that the people of Paradise and those who have believed in God, the Lord of the worlds, might remember her thereby. We testify that she bore every tribulation and affliction in the path of God - with Him is the knowledge of all things in a preserved Book - and that she has ascended and soared to a station where the gloating of enemies cannot reach her, and dwells in the proximity of her Lord’s mercy, the Forgiving, the Generous. We console Mihman and mention her as a grace from Us and a mercy from Our presence, that she might thank her Lord, the Giver, the Mighty, the Exalted. End.</p>
<p>The mention of the souls of the emigrants that you had written was presented at the Holy Court. Blessed be they! In truth, your honor is the cause of blessings to the world, for it was observed that for every soul you have mentioned, divine favor was manifested towards them, even if they were among the most sinful of creation, without any concealment. This station is most exalted. At times it was heard from the Beloved’s tongue: “We mention what he mentioned in his book,” and such utterances were heard repeatedly: “Blessed art thou, then blessed art thou, then blessed art thou, and blessed is he who loves thee in God.”</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Aqa Hasan from the people of Dahj, what your honor wrote was in accordance with God’s command, for without permission there has been and will be no fruit, save for whom God willeth. The petition of Aqa Siyyid ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, also arrived and attained the Most Holy Court. His letter had come before as well, and the Name of God, upon him be all of His most glorious splendor, sent his reply. In these days, the souls who have accepted the Faith should be occupied with service to the Cause. In this land, the teaching of God’s Cause has been forbidden; therefore, if the loved ones of God engage in teaching the Cause in Iran with perfect wisdom and with the utmost joy and fragrance, it has been and will be beloved. Convey greetings on behalf of this servant to Aqa Hasan, upon him be the glory of God. We beseech God that His friends may ever succeed in serving the Cause and following God’s command.</p>
<p>Multiple letters from Na?ir, upon him be the glory of God, have arrived here. Praise be to God, he is well. I hope that he will always be assisted and confirmed in God’s Cause. If anyone is traveling to those parts, convey greetings on behalf of this servant to him and to the friends of God in that land.</p>
<p>Regarding what you mentioned about Ustad Husayn, travel to this land has not been and is not advisable. If he remains occupied there with Aqa Nasru’llah in the utmost joy and fragrance, it would be most beloved. He was mentioned at the Most Holy Court. Praise be to God, he has attained God’s favors. Convey greetings to him on behalf of this servant as well.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about Sasun, upon him be the glory of God, several months ago Muhammad Mu??afa, upon him be God’s Most Glorious Glory, sent a letter to the Most Holy Court, and that letter came before the blessed gaze. They said: “Indeed he is from Sasun. God has praised him with the mystery of what was revealed in the Books of old,” to the end of His exalted Words. The details are that Muhammad Mu??afa had written a letter to this servant with a page between its leaves, and the aforementioned gentleman did not know whose page it was. After it was presented to the Most Holy Presence, They said this writing was from Sasun, and some verses were revealed from the blessed tongue concerning him. Likewise, mention of him was revealed in a Tablet to one of the emigrants of Iraq. We beseech God to assist him in serving His Cause and to confirm him in that by which his mention shall endure throughout the duration of the earthly and heavenly kingdoms. This much I submit, that mention of him has repeatedly been heard from the blessed tongue. Blessed is he.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Haji Muhammad-Baqir from the people of N-J, it was presented. This is what was revealed in response:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing Expositor […]</p>
<p>There has appeared before Our presence a letter from one whom God has loved and made to be among the successful ones in a mighty Book. Therein was thy mention, wherefore have We made mention of thee, and the Most Exalted Pen hath moved at thy name in this manifest Prison. Rejoice thou at My mention of thee, then give thanks unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. He verily forgiveth whomsoever He willeth in truth, even as He forgave thee through His grace. He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Generous. We counsel thee to be steadfast in this Cause, for through it the feet of them that have attained have slipped. Turn not unto the world and its affairs. In all matters place thy trust in God, the Single One, the All-Informed. Wert thou to know the station of My mention of thee, such joy would seize thee that neither the turning away of the servants nor the utterances of the deniers would grieve thee. Hold thou fast unto the handle of grace, detached from those who have denied the Day of Judgment. We make mention of those who have believed, and We send Our greetings upon their faces from this far-distant spot. We give glad tidings unto her who hath believed in God through this Remembrance, which nothing created on earth can equal. To this testifieth every knowing, discerning one. The glory be upon thee and upon her and upon those who are with you, from God, the Single One, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst write concerning Mashhadi ’Ali, it was presented. The word of forgiveness was revealed concerning him, however coming to this land is not permitted. He verily loveth the obedient ones.</p>
<p>Concerning thy mention of Aqa Muhammad Isma’il, it was presented before the Most Holy Court and divine favors encompassed his condition.</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst write about Jinab-i-Aqa Habibullah, it was presented, and the newborn was also mentioned by a beautiful name in the Most Holy Court.</p>
<p>This servant beseeches thy favors to convey this evanescent one’s greetings to all the friends in that land. This servant is ashamed before all that he does not submit individual petitions. God is witness and knoweth that the failure to submit petitions is due to the abundance of occupation and the writing of verses. It is hoped that all will forgive. Verily our Lord is the Pardoning, the Forgiving. And glory be upon thy presence and upon them, throughout the duration of the Kingdom and the Realm of Might.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath strengthened His Afnan with such might as can be altered neither by the cawing of the divines, nor the clamor of princes, nor the braying of the ignorant, nor the croaking of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of Names. And praise be to God Who hath aided His chosen ones with such aid as shall not pass away throughout the dominion of earth and heaven - they through whom the suns of faith have shone forth and the horizons of certitude have been illumined, through whom the sign of unity appeared in creation and the token of detachment amidst all peoples, through whom every unifier became unified, every submissive one submitted, every prostrate one prostrated, every learned one learned, every knower knew, every rememberer remembered, every speaker spoke, and every glorifier glorified his Lord, the Creator of earth and heaven. And praise be to God Who hath favored all created things with the manifestation of His Most Great, Most Exalted Name, whereupon all names were transformed, the hearts of the wretched were disturbed, the hearts of the near ones were assured, the Concourse on High rejoiced, and the dwellers of the cities of eternity were gladdened. Glorified be He Who hath distinguished between all things through His Most Exalted Word, whereby He hath taken the essences of existence and left behind the accidents at the stations of allusions and limitations. Verily, He is the One Worshipped, the Educator of the seen and unseen. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Loving.</p>
<p>May my spirit be sacrificed for you! What can this heedless servant mention that would be worthy of your hearing, and what can this ignorant one present that would merit the attention of that Beloved One? For mere nothingness to show a trace of existence is a grievous sin, and for utter non-existence to claim being is a great error. I seek forgiveness from God for what I have said and say, have mentioned and mention, have described and describe, and for how I have moved and move, have spoken and speak, have acted and act. For in truth, when this servant observes himself with fairness, he has not seen and does not see himself worthy of anything, and all words and mentions are seen as evanescent and non-existent before the rising of the sun of meanings, and all lofty attributes and exalted names stand perplexed in their own station, ever beseeching and hoping that the True One, exalted be His glory, will not remove from them the garment of acceptance. Indeed Unity itself, despite its lofty station and exalted rank, declares:</p>
<p>O my Lord! Thou art He Who chose me, distinguished me, elevated me, empowered me, and magnified me to a station where Thou didst speak through me and caused all things to speak in remembrance of me. But by Thy glory, O Beloved of the world and Goal of the nations, I ever cling to the hem of the robe of Thy bounty and grace, lest Thou shouldst withhold from me this most exalted station and this most resplendent, lofty rank. For shouldst Thou abase me, cast me out, and elevate mine adversary in my stead, Thou art indeed able to do this and powerful over it, and none can prevent Thee from exercising Thy sovereignty and will. I have testified and do testify at all times that nothing can prevent Thee from exercising Thy power, might, authority and choice.</p>
<p>Here is something that occurs to me to mention, and the true purpose is to prove the nothingness and effacement of this ephemeral one and engagement in remembrance of that Beloved. In this case there would be no harm in elaboration and detail. Once the Ancient Beauty journeyed to the land of Taff [Karbila], and in those days the Cause was very well concealed, such that no one had any knowledge of it. In that land a group had gathered who occupied themselves day and night with expressions of divine unity, counting themselves among the unitarians. However, their concept of unity was in reality the source of polytheism and the origin of multiplicity. Were this servant to explain this matter in detail, the discourse would exceed moderation. In any case, these souls did not turn to the Most Holy Court - that is, they did not attain the honor of His presence. However, Jinab-i-Ismu’llah Haji Siyyid Javad (may the Most Glorious Beauty of God rest upon him), who resided in that land, would continuously attain His presence and was also part of that group. Yet endless love for the Beloved of the worlds was evident from him, such that despite that group’s prohibition, he was not deterred and would attain His presence most of the time. Finally, one day He said: “O Javad! Despite these people claiming to love and counting themselves among this company, how is it they have not observed the customary courtesies and have not inquired after Us?” Then the Euphrates of utterance flowed from the Source of divine wisdom in such wise that the hearing ear perceived the glorification and sanctification of God, exalted be His glory, from all things. Until one day Jinab-i-Ismu’llah brought with him a person known as Shaykh Sultan. The Ancient Beauty said: “O Shaykh! This unity with whose mention you occupy yourselves night and day, and because of which you consider yourselves rich and independent - if God, exalted be His grandeur, were to erase this unity or roll up its carpet and place it under the throne, what then would you have and with what remembrance would you occupy yourselves?” And at this point such utterances were revealed from the Dayspring of divine knowledge that both Jinab-i-Ismu’llah and the aforementioned Shaykh were set ablaze by the heat of His words. In brief, after some time that entire group attained to true unity. In the words of the author of the Mathnavi: “The withered fish fell into the sea, the lost caravan found the path of guidance.”</p>
<p>In this case, the mention and thought of this servant and the highest stations of the Bayan in these days have been and will be utter nothingness. The people are heedless and ignorant, unaware of the greatness of the Cause, roaming in the valley of ignorance and perceiving not, hastening in the wilderness of error and knowing not, walking in the desert of wrath and understanding not. Observe ye the person whose name is Ahmad. Despite having submitted several petitions to the Most Holy Court and likewise to this servant, and despite his show of faith, certitude, knowledge and steadfastness, the tempestuous winds of vain desire returned him to the lowest depths of the fire. Now the station of steadfastness that hath been revealed in the Tablets of God becomes evident. In numerous passages this verse hath been revealed from the Divine Pen: “Verily this Day is great, great, and the Cause is great, great.” I swear by the Sun of Beauty that hath risen from the horizon of glory that were a soul to truly comprehend the loftiness of this Revelation and that which hath been manifested in its days, he would regard the world and all therein as non-existent and as naught, and all the world would be powerless to prevent him. How many base and worthless souls are observed who have yet to distinguish between the croak of the raven and the cooing of the dove! We beseech God to open their eyes and draw them nigh unto Him through His grace upon them. Verily He hath ever been self-sufficient in His sufficiency and independent of those who believed then disbelieved, who turned towards Him then turned away, through His exalted Word uttered aforetime: “O ye people! Ye are poor in your need of God, and God is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised.” I conclude with “There is no power nor strength save in God.”</p>
<p>Regarding the sum mentioned, according to His command that amount should reach Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty, in Hadba’ that he may distribute it among the captives of that land. The sooner this matter is accomplished, the more beloved it is in the sight of God and His loved ones. Other details of affairs will be mentioned by Ismu’llah Mahdi, upon him be the Most Glorious of all Glory. This servant is ashamed before all the friends due to excessive writing, for he hath not and will never be able to make mention of them as befitteth. From all he hopeth for pardon.</p>
<p>This servant hath submitted a letter to Ismu’llah Ha’, upon him be the Glory of God, which will come to your notice. It would be very good if a copy thereof, after thorough correction, be sent to the land of Sh and Y, for some people are weak and have no understanding of matters - at the mere hearing of a croak they are seen to waver. Where are the mighty hearts? Where are the powerful souls? Where are the steadfast feet? Where are the firm and well-grounded souls? Where is he who said “Say: God - then leave them to their vain discourse”? “Verily we are God’s and unto Him shall we return.” It would also be well-pleasing if a copy of this petition be sent to those regions, that perchance the people may take heed.</p>

<p>O Zabih! He is God! O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who, in these days, hath desired the countenance of his Lord, the All-Merciful, that he may soar on the wings of remembrance and utterance in that atmosphere wherein naught stirreth save the breezes of the All-Glorious, and attain unto a station wherein he beholdeth all created things beneath the shadow of his Lord, the Mighty, the Chosen One. Arise to execute His bidding, then strip the servants of the garments of fancy and desire, and adorn them with the raiment of glory and guidance, that they may detach themselves from those who have disbelieved and turn unto God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Compelling.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of idolaters! Whither will ye flee this Day? By God! Nothing of all that hath been created between earth and heaven shall profit you, nor shall ye find for yourselves any refuge save by entering the paradise of your Lord, the All-Merciful, and drinking the choice sealed wine from the hands of those youths upon whose radiant foreheads hath been inscribed, by the seal of the remembrance of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted. By God! These are none other than the people of Baha, whom God created from the light of His Essence before the creation of names and attributes. Thus hath the earth of inner meanings and pre-existence been illumined by the lights of this Pen, moved by the fingers of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Forgiving.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of idolaters! There is no protector today save God, no refuge save in Him, and no escape save through Him. How long will ye run in the wilderness of fancy, to the right and to the left? Say: Have mercy upon yourselves and associate not with Him through Whose meeting ye have been promised in all the Tablets from the Pen of God. Fear God, O ye who are endued with insight!</p>
<p>Know then, O Zabih, that when the Daystar of the horizons set beneath the horizon of Iraq, he who limped called out from the direction of Zawra with hypocrisy: “O people! Come, that I may guide you across the path that is finer than a hair and sharper than a sword.” Take heed then, O ye who are possessed of understanding! He who cannot walk upon stable ground desireth to guide people across the path. Thus did Satan whisper within his soul, and pride and vainglory seized him. Reflect thou upon him and upon those who followed him despite witnessing him in utter weakness and distress. We have indeed sent down unto thee aforetime a Tablet wherein We expounded what We have mentioned again in this Tablet, that the righteous may be reminded thereby. Leave these people and their followers, their path and their balance, their names and their idols, and put thy trust in God in all matters. Remember thy Lord in the watches of the night and at the ends of the day. And when it is said unto them: “O people! The clouds have been cleft asunder and your Lord, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bestowing, hath come,” they cling to what they possess of the traditions of the followers of the Furqan. Woe unto you, O company of evil ones! Those in whose names and words ye take pride this day were created by My command, and none denieth this save he who hath grown arrogant before God and returneth to his abode in the fire. By My life! If thou wert to reflect upon them and what they possess, thou wouldst find naught save that which is uttered by the most abject followers of all religions. Thus doth thy Lord inform thee that thou mayest become aware of them and of what issueth from their mouths. By God, the Truth! Their habitation is the abyss of wrath, and evil indeed is that resting-place. Purify the hearts of men from allusions, that they may be enabled to drink the choice sealed wine from the hand of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.</p>
<p>In the Persian tongue it is mentioned: Today the people of the Bayan are seen to be more veiled than all peoples and more remote than all nations. They have newly grasped at former traditions, saying at times that such and such a verse of the Qur’an states thus, and such and such a narrator has related thus, and how they pride themselves on mentioning former traditions. Say: For a thousand years ye have imagined a supposed being in a supposed place, and have been worshipping it unawares. And whenever holy souls appeared from the divine horizon and declared that that divine Beauty would be born, ye unsheathed the swords of malice and martyred those sacred beings with the worst of torments. Were We to mention in detail these matters which are concealed from the knowledge of most people, We would stray from Our present purpose. In brief, observe that for a thousand years, nay more, these people have had naught but fancy in their grasp, and through a thousand established traditions and decisive utterances they confirmed to themselves this matter whose very foundation was imaginary, and they clung to it and counted as infidels and rejected ones those who denied it. Then after the appearance of the Most Great Luminary it became evident that all had been worshippers of fancy, as was clearly shown when that Luminary of creation appeared from the loins of one of His servants. “Fancies returned to their source and the Beauty of Certitude appeared with manifest sovereignty.” The cause and reason for these fancies was that several ignorant ones who styled themselves learned agreed together and so firmly established this baseless matter among the people that all the common folk became convinced and clung to it. As thou observest, even now most of the followers of the Qur’an remain fixed in these same fancies and are waiting. And these days are but the beginning of this dispensation. Several ignorant ones who have adorned their heads with green and white turbans have agreed and determined to spread such traditions and reports among the people. By God, O Dhabih, if thou wert truly attentive, thou wouldst hear from every member of this Youth, even from His very hairs, lamentations and cries. And these lamentations are not for His own sake, but because it is observed that these deceitful and lying souls have agreed to afflict the people with the same former fancies. I swear by God that the breezes of the All-Merciful are nigh to being cut off from the realm of possibility. It is most necessary for thee to assist the Cause of God and not allow these polytheists to defile the stronghold of divine unity with the clay of vain imaginings. This is incumbent today upon every existing being, nay it hath been and shall be more beloved than all deeds. The people must be protected and reminded, that perchance from detached hearts may flow and spread the sweet and gentle rivers. Beware lest this group again defile hearts with the pollution of vain imaginings. Soon it shall be observed that some will appear with great turbans and long staffs and cause the people to wander in the wilderness of fancy. In no age have the ignorant ones known as divines ever been guided to the truth, as was observed in the year sixty […]</p>
<p>Thou seest, and in this Dispensation dost observe, that most of those renowned in the Bayan have strayed from the straight path of justice, and yet remain unaware. First, that the Manifestation hath been known by His own Self and hath never needed, nor will ever need, any other. Moreover, the Point of the Bayan declareth that on the Day of His manifestation, the divines shall become as nothing, dead, and non-existent. Yet these veiled souls have newly resorted to the proofs of the people of the Furqan. Woe unto them and unto that which proceedeth from their mouths!</p>
<p>In any case, one of the servants sent a letter to the Holy Court, expressing therein his inability to write words befitting his station, saying “I know not Arabic, nor am I sufficiently capable in Persian to properly present my petition.” A specific response was revealed and sent to him, and as that Tablet made mention of certain ones who pride themselves on their scholarly attainments, a copy of that Tablet was dispatched. Consider it! In all conditions, fix your gaze upon the Truth and cling unto Him, detached from all who dwell on earth. For by God, besides Whom there is none other God! Should anyone today cling to a single letter of all that is visible in the heavens and on earth, he would surely be deprived of the never-failing nectar, the incomparable holy Kawthar, and the ever-flowing pure waters of Tasnim.</p>
<p>Take hold of the reins of authority through Our power and might, then detach thyself from all the worlds. Fear no one, and pay no heed to the clamor of the idolaters. The Spirit, glory and splendor be upon thee and upon those who have soared in the atmosphere of nearness and are of the assured ones. Convey Our greetings to all who are with thee and hear thy words, whether female or male, young or old.</p>

<p>In the Name of the One Beloved Friend</p>
<p>O son of My uncle! Give thanks unto God that this supreme kinship was not severed, and that thou didst outstrip all others among the kindred until thou wert blessed to attain the presence of the Ancient Beauty in the Most Great Prison. Consider this favor as a priceless treasure, for naught that hath been created in earth or heaven can compare with it. By the might and power of the All-Merciful, and by divine leave and permission, return to thy homeland and be occupied with the remembrance of the Friend. Thou must conduct thyself in such wise that all the inhabitants of thy land may inhale from thee the fragrance of the garment of the Chosen One. Preserve thy kinship and keep it safe in the vessel of trust in God, detachment, truthfulness and purity. Manifest among all people such divine qualities that all may witness in thee that which is beloved in the sight of God. Be not grieved by the world and its transient affairs, for these have never endured and never shall endure, and the honored servants pay no heed to that which is destined to perish. How many were the mighty who were suddenly afflicted with abasement, and how many were the wealthy who returned to poverty. Therefore, seek thou that which no abasement shall follow its glory, and no poverty shall overtake its wealth. By My life! It is none other than holding fast to My Name and clinging to the hem of My sacred and luminous Robe. Convey My greetings to all the loved ones of God, be they kindred or otherwise.</p>
<p>And if thou shouldst meet the one known by the Name, convey to him My greetings and say: “Why hast thou withheld thyself from Him for Whose sake the Concourse on High would sacrifice their souls, and through Whom the eyes of them that are nigh unto God were solaced?” What hath befallen you that ye are observed in such fear and trepidation? Reflect upon the state of that Soul Who was raised up by the Holy Spirit and Who, alone and single-handed, turned with the divine Tablet to the appointed place, and with utmost power and assurance proclaimed the messages of the All-Merciful, never disturbed by might or wrath. Dost thou fear for thyself or for that which thou possessest? Hearken unto My call from the direction of tribulation and withhold not thyself from that which hath been ordained in the Kingdom of eternity. Turn with thy whole being unto God and fear not those who have wronged, and if thou desirest to preserve thy life, beseech God, thy Lord. Verily, He will protect thee even if thou be in the depths of the ocean, or in the valleys of fire, or in the mouth of the crocodile, or amidst the swords of the oppressors. By God, the Truth! Not a leaf stirreth save by His leave, nor do the winds blow except by His will, nor doth any soul draw breath save through His aid. Cast aside thy vain imaginings and hold fast unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We counsel thee purely for the sake of thy Lord, for We desire not that thy connection to God, the Mighty, the Wise, be severed. Remember when thou wast in prison and God aided thee with the truth and protected thee with the hosts of the seen and the unseen until He delivered thee by His power and made thee to be among those who rejoice. We were with thee in prison and found from thee the fragrance of devotion to a degree; therefore We delivered thee as We delivered whom We wished when he was in the hands of the heedless. Ponder what We have imparted unto thee that thou mayest be awakened by My remembrance and recall thy Lord’s favor among His servants. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Be thou in such wise that neither wealth divert thee from thy ultimate end nor means from the Cause of all causes. Hearken unto the words of one who loveth thee and desireth for thee what he desireth for himself. Cast away the world entire and take what thou hast been given from the presence of One mighty and powerful. Art thou content with this transient life, having forsaken the eternal life? By My life! This beseemeth thee not, wert thou of them that know. Would that I could sacrifice myself again and again in the love of God, and that at every moment every land might be dyed with my blood in the path of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all the worlds. Finally, why dost thou not reflect? The days have passed and life hath reached its end. Now judge thou fairly: is it better that at the end of one’s days one should give up one’s soul on a bed, suffering from illness and severe pain, or that in these few remaining days of life one should sacrifice oneself in the path of God? I swear by the Ancient Beauty that the former is loss while the latter is spirit and fragrance. What regret and remorse that one should not sacrifice these few borrowed breaths remaining of life in the path of the Friend, but rather should surrender them on the bed of heedlessness after drinking repugnant and foul medicines. Tell Me truthfully which of these two is more worthy? Say: The first course, by my Lord, the Most Exalted, the Possessor of the Throne and of the dust. The point is that the loved ones of God should not be disturbed and fearful, but rather should consider martyrdom in the path of the Friend a mighty achievement if it should occur, not that they should cast themselves into danger, for in this Dispensation […]</p>
<p>Hear the call of the Wronged One Who, in the extremity of tribulation, sorrow and grief, summoneth thee unto God. All are commanded to observe wisdom. Detach thyself from the world and its peoples, and take shelter beneath the shadow of His mercy. Know thou, moreover, that one hath appeared before the Presence and claimed that he had seen thee, saying that thou hadst declared: “We shall no longer send thee any Tablet.” Thereupon did the eye of My loving-kindness weep for thee. By Him Who hath caused Me to voice His praise between earth and heaven! Hadst thou but sensed the fragrance of the Divine Garment and perused but one of the Tablets of thy Lord which We sent unto thee, thou wouldst have sacrificed thy life and all thou dost possess for but a single word thereof, and wouldst have been content to be slain a thousand times in every moment rather than be deprived of the sweet fragrances of the Ancient of Days and the breezes of God wafting from the direction of His Most Great Name. I know not by what thing thou hast been kept back from this most bountiful favor, and hast remained encompassed by doubts and idle fancies. Make thou amends, O my brother, for that which hath escaped thee, and turn unto the Qiblih of all worlds, saying: “I have turned with my whole being unto Thee, O Creator of the heavens and earth! Pardon me for my heedlessness concerning Thee. Verily Thou art the Lord of all worlds.” Beware lest pride keep thee back from the Lord of all creation. Cast away idle fancy and take fast hold of thy Lord, the Most Glorious. This is better for thee, and God is witness to what I say.</p>
<p>And to the other people of the village, whomsoever thou findest turning unto God, make mention of them on God’s behalf and say: Be not grieved at what hath befallen you, for worse than this hath been inflicted upon the Ancient Beauty, Who is now confined in the Most Great Prison, where conditions are so severe that they have blocked both entry and exit. Yet we are engaged in remembrance of the All-Merciful with utmost joy and fragrance. Be not saddened by what hath been plundered, for soon will all who dwell on earth make mention of you. The reward of no soul hath been, nor ever shall be, lost. Whatsoever worldly ornaments have been taken from you in His path, He will surely compensate you for them in this world, and in the next life will bestow stations such that were but one of them to be revealed to the peoples of the earth, they would sacrifice themselves in the path of the Beloved, hoping to attain that most exalted station. Hearken unto the testament of the Ancient Beauty, Who calleth unto you from the direction of the Most Great Prison: Abandon sedition and rebellion, and hold fast unto righteousness. Sanctify your souls from satanic deeds and adorn them with divine attributes. Corruption and contention have never been, nor shall ever be, worthy of the people of truth. Shun reprehensible acts and walk in the paths of sanctity, submission and contentment. Strive that divine qualities and attributes may be made manifest from you, and walk among mankind with perfect detachment and tranquility. Deal with one another with the utmost justice and equity. Transform treachery into trustworthiness, backbiting into self-purification, tyranny into justice, and heedlessness into remembrance. This is the counsel of the All-Merciful that hath been revealed from the mouth of divine Will. Strive that through divine assistance, what hath been ordained in the Kingdom of destiny may not be altered or changed by reprehensible deeds. At all times, implore and beseech the Goal of all creation that He may not deprive you of His grace and favor, and that He may grant you shelter beneath the Tree of affirmation and the Sadrih of names and attributes. And peace be upon you from God, your Ancient Lord, and praise be to God, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>

<p>In the name of my Lord, the Most High! Boundless praise beseemeth the holy and everlasting court of Him Who hath ever caused, and will continue forever to cause, the Sun of His holy countenance to shine upon the hearts of them that dwell in the highest paradise, and hath made the Sun of His Own Face to radiate upon the souls of them that traverse the depths of grandeur, and hath caused the seed of the revelation of His own reality to flourish for the wayfarers in the desert of the Kingdom, and hath made the star of His manifestations to gleam upon the travelers of the path of justice in the realm of mortality, and hath caused the clouds of the light of His Revelation to gather in the arena of all created things, and hath raised the banner of His grace in the highest heaven of hearts, and hath lifted up the standard of His exaltation in the breezes of command and creation, and hath unfurled the flag of His might and majesty in the atmosphere of the heaven of justice.</p>
<p>He it is Who hath ever caused, and will continue forever to cause, His eternal manifestations to dawn upon the souls and bodies of them that navigate the depths of holiness and sanctity, and hath made the breezes of His everlasting revelations to descend upon the essential realities of them that ascend unto the heavens of glory and majesty, so that all creation might be drawn, through that which He hath ordained and decreed, towards that Garment of Reality, and might witness within the inmost recesses of their hearts the signs of divine grandeur and power, and might, through their own attainment, become suppliants at the gates of His bounty and pardon, their tongues, both hidden and manifest, uttering words of lowliness before the Gate-keeper of His holy majesty.</p>
<p>Having thus entered the age of divine unity, they behold the evidences of God’s power, and enter the City of Divine Oneness without intimation and with no trace of heedlessness among its dwellers, and arrive at the paradise of unity without regard to its affluent ones, witnessing the manifestations of the favors and kindnesses of the All-Glorious within the reality of their own hearts, spirits, souls and essential beings. Glorified be the Eternal Beloved Who hath manifested every gleaming theophany, and sent down with every breeze a wondrous sign, and with every breath hath quickened the dead bodies of all creation, and with every manifestation hath suspended a holy revelation from His invisible realm, and with every one of the signs of His unity hath attracted the hearts of all that are and shall be created as He pleaseth, and with every ray from the lights of His glorious Garment hath made manifest a brilliant appearance and resplendent forms […]</p>
<p>Glorified be He! There is none other God but Him. How wondrous is His handiwork, how magnificent His creation! He hath brought forth from utter nothingness the vast expanse of being, and with His hand of power hath given existence to the merest atom from naught, endowing it with speech. Through His Own effulgences He hath transformed absolute nothingness into pure existence, bestowing absolute being through His grace. Through His holy Self He hath manifested the Sun of His Lordship, revealed the signs of His unity amidst the multiplicity of creation, and made evident the tokens of His oneness from all sides and directions, drawing all things unto Himself through every manifestation.</p>
<p>O ye lovers of the holy Concourse, ye who ascend the heights of intimacy, ye dwellers in the depths of Paradise, and ye who traverse the boundless ocean! Open the eye of truth and the true ear, hearken unto words of justice and truth, and behold the signs of divine Lordship reflected in the mirrors of your hearts. Let not these base commodities and transient pleasures become a source of distress, nor this brief life a cause of veils, nor this ephemeral existence - whose end is nothingness, decline and extinction - be the means of continued separation from the countenance of the Beloved. For your return is unto the intended Goal, and the conclusion of all is unto God, the Worshipped Lord, the Praised Sovereign.</p>
<p>Come to yourselves for a moment and become conscious for an instant. Escape from the stupor of death and enter into the realm of life. Emerge from your self-intoxication and enter into true being. Drink from the wine of manifestation in the chalice of light, free yourselves from the darkness of every error, take a few draughts from the sweet waters of Salsabil, and find rest and tranquility away from this house of extinction. When ye come to consciousness, gaze for a moment upon the robe of the Beloved, for thus hath He, exalted be His remembrance, ordained it.</p>
<p>And it hath thus come to pass that that Countenance of Divinity and Vesture of Lordship hath in these days of decline left the wayfarers in the wilderness of error, and hath returned to His Lord in His throne of eternity, and the holy mirrors of His glory have ascended unto God in His lofty heights. How strange that these creatures, who came into being through a glimmer of His manifestation and became visible in the realm of existence through His bounty, should spend this brief life - whose years pass with a few manifestations, whose months change into weeks, whose weeks separate into days, and whose days resolve into hours, minutes and moments, and whose thread will soon break and whose cord will be cut - when all things shall return unto their Lord and shall be present before His holy court.</p>
<p>O friends of the Friend, come to yourselves! O lovers of the Beloved, become conscious! O seekers of Truth, detach yourselves! O hearers of the Word of truth, open the ear of reality and the eye of insight! Let not this transient wealth prevent you from standing in the holy presence of the Beloved, nor this outward glory become a veil in the path of Truth. Open the eye of righteousness and the vision of uprightness, and bring the ear of fairness into the presence of Truth. Neglect not even for a moment.</p>
<p>Arise with ears attuned to truthfulness in the presence of God, neglecting not a moment and wasting not this brief life in aught but His good-pleasure. For all creation hath been assigned its station. Where are the kingdoms and their possessions, the sovereigns and their dominions? What became of the kings and rulers, and whither went the truthful ones? Each hath returned to his place, and every soul hath attained that which was ordained for it in the holy and ancient scrolls of God’s decree. They have bade farewell to this mirage-like world and have all entered their nests, returning to their own annihilation and reposing in their earthen chambers in eternal sleep. Come ye to your senses for a while, hearken for an hour unto the words of Truth, and inscribe for a moment His counsels upon the tablets of your hearts, that on the Day of Presentation ye may be brought before that Tree, be present in His court, and attain and act according to His will and pleasure - neither veiled from the garments of His revelation nor rendered unconscious by the light of His manifestation in the precinct of the Mount of His Command. And should ye be struck unconscious, may ye regain consciousness thereafter, uttering words of pardon, that ye may on that Day attain unto what God hath willed and pleased, and act according to what He hath decreed, conducting yourselves with grace, bounty, glory and majesty in His presence. On that Day may ye act with truth and sincerity, becoming doers of what is right and just, hearing the verses of His truth from His divine utterance and receiving the words of His grandeur from the tongue of His power, glorying therein before the Concourse on High. And none can inform you like One Who is all-aware, and none can apprise you like this luminous decree: How long wilt thou appear in the mirror of union? Break that mirror and manifest thyself to the world.</p>

<p>In the name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise that is sanctified above the mention of all created things and the description of all contingent beings befitteth the court of the holy nearness of the Desired One, Who through His blessed word “I loved to be known” brought the world of creation from nothingness into being, and with the fire of love set aflame the sanctified and detached souls and the radiant and receptive temples. That blessed Word became the dawning-place of light and the source of fire. One of its effulgences shone forth upon the Mount - its form appeared as fire, speaking forth the exalted and blessed words “Verily I am God,” and another effulgence turned toward the Mount - from it light was made manifest and the meaning of the blessed verse “the Mount crumbled to dust” was realized. Glory be to God! Every possessor of power hath confessed his powerlessness and every bearer of knowledge his ignorance. Through a single call He so attracted the lovers in the wilderness of faithfulness that they readily gave up their lives and all they possessed, hastening with utmost speed to the place of sacrifice. How many of the weak ones, after hearing the call, were seen to manifest such strength and power that neither the might and majesty of the world nor the massed ranks of the peoples could prevent them from turning to the Most Exalted Horizon. Hallowed and glorified is that omnipotent Sovereign Who with the finger of power unsealed the choice sealed wine and through the blessing of the Name of the Self-Subsisting bestowed it upon the company of them that are nigh, the monotheists and the sincere ones. I swear by the pearls of the divine ocean of knowledge that whosoever attained unto a drop thereof forsook the world and all that dwell therein, and set his face toward the ultimate goal, the most exalted summit and the highest horizon.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose Name the mysteries were revealed, the lights shone forth, and the trees yielded their fruit! I beseech Thee by Thy Name the Self-Subsisting, by Thy choice sealed wine, and by Thy binding decree, to aid Thy loved ones to be steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the vain affairs of the Pharaohs nor the might of the oppressors - whom this vain life hath deluded and prevented from turning unto Thee, O Lord of creation and Manifestation of the light of oneness - may hinder them. Then preserve them, O my God and God of all names, my Creator and Creator of the heavens, from the arrows of the deniers among Thy servants and the allusions of the wrongdoers among Thy creation. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the light of Thy manifestation and the fire of the Tree of Thy Cause to open before the faces of the sincere ones among Thy servants, through the key of Thy grace, the doors of Thy bounty and favors. Then cause them to know, O my God, that which will so attract them to a station wherein neither the sorrows of the world nor the clamor of the nations will affect them, that they may take, through Thy name the All-Merciful, the cup of knowledge and drink therefrom once through Thy Most Great and Most Glorious Name and again through Thy remembrance, the Mighty, the Wise. O Lord! Illumine their hearts with the lights of Thy knowledge, and ordain for them through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall abide with them in every world of Thy worlds. Verily Thou art the Almighty Whom no power can frustrate and no strength can weaken. There is none other God but Thee, the Powerful, the One, the Peerless, the Mighty, the Luminous.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this servant hath heard thy sweet mention and that wherewith thou didst praise God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen. When he witnessed, saw, and drank from the cup of thy utterance the pure and choice wine in praise of God, the Lord of all names, he approached the praised station and presented himself before His face. Thereupon the tongue of the All-Merciful spoke forth in the kingdom of utterance - exalted and mighty be His Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Witnessing, the All-Hearing […]</p>
<p>O thou who gazest toward the Most Exalted Horizon! All the peoples of the world, of diverse parties, seek to grasp at some means whereby they might establish a cause that would perpetuate their name and remembrance. Thus it hath been heard how many souls in the western lands have sacrificed their lives for vain and futile imaginings, though it is clear to every person of insight that the deeds and acts of those heedless ones have not borne, nor ever shall bear, any fruit. The perpetuation of remembrance is praiseworthy when it is for God’s sake and appeareth in His path, and its benefit returneth to all the peoples of the world. Multitudes have clung to every vain fancy to establish some cause or another, while this Most Great Cause which hath dawned from the horizon of the heaven of God’s Will - from this are the people of Persia heedless and veiled. By the life of God! This is that Cause which the passage of centuries and ages shall not alter, which extinction shall not overtake, and whosoever attaineth unto it hath attained unto God’s infinite bounties in all the worlds. The friends of God, in whatsoever land they dwell, must have recourse to wisdom and consultation, and must hold fast to whatsoever will today draw the heedless to the ocean of awareness and awaken the slumbering from the sleep of negligence, that all hearts and minds may be illumined by the effulgences of the Sun of Knowledge and be adorned with that which God loveth. This is everlasting dominion and eternal wealth. Blessed is he who hath attained unto that which shall profit him in this world and the next, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>The tokens of the favors of God, exalted be His glory, concerning that honored person are known and evident. And his honor, Name of God 66, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, had his petition reach the Most Holy Court, wherein was mentioned that distinguished person, upon him be the Glory of God. This servant presented the entire petition again before His blessed countenance on the blessed night of Friday, the first of the month of Rabi’u’th-Thani. By the lights of His countenance! A word was heard from the blessed tongue concerning that distinguished person which all the treasures of the world could not equal. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, that He may crown him with the diadem of acceptance in this most mighty, most holy, and most exalted Cause. Were but an atom of this station to be unveiled, ye would behold all the honored ones of the world circling round it. God willing, may they attain unto the preservation of this supreme station and most exalted rank through the name of the Lord of Names. Verily, He guideth whom He willeth unto His straight path.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Raqsha (upon whom be God’s vengeance and wrath), that vile one, being heedless, committed this most grievous sin and greatest error for the sake of a few dirhams. Were the peoples of the earth to reflect upon what befell him, they would all free and liberate themselves from the doubts of their suspicions and idle fancies, and turn towards the horizon of certitude. In the blessed Tablet of Burhan, one verse was specifically revealed concerning the Wolf, and this shall soon become manifest and evident. If one possessed of insight were to reflect upon the seizure of Raqsha and what was revealed in the Surih of Ra’is, as well as what was revealed in the Surih of Kings and the Tablet of Fu’ad, he would, in brief, gain some knowledge of the ocean of divine knowledge and His power, might and ascendancy. How excellent is the state of those souls who have drunk from the wine of fairness and who have gazed with illumined eyes upon the revealed verses and manifest, resplendent evidences. These are accounted as the most exalted of creatures in the sight of the Truth. However, the conditions of the world have, like dark dust, seized all, such that they are barred from beholding the lights. O beloved of My heart! By the life of God, the consummate wisdom of God has in certain matters caused delay, otherwise you would have witnessed greater than what has transpired. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that you have attained to the grace of God. Your mention and the mention of those with you have been and continue to be in the Most Holy Court, and this is a bounty that hath had and hath no likeness or peer. Verily, He speaketh the truth and in His grasp is the dominion of all things. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Wise. Convey, if wisdom permitteth, My greetings to the friends in that land on behalf of this evanescent one, and make mention of them. Let not time slip away, and let not opportunity pass. By the Beloved of all possibility, a single moment of these days cannot be equaled by centuries and ages. Today is the day of mention and praise, and the day of obedience and service. Time and again this evanescent servant hath submitted this word to the divine friends and will continue to do so, through God’s help and grace, until the manifest Truth shall come to him. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. The Most Great and Most Exalted Branches - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - have each shown loving-kindness towards you and convey their greetings to you, as do those who circle round. The Glory of God rest upon you and upon the loved ones of God in that place, who have cast aside what the people possess, hoping for that which is with God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, His greatness and His power!</p>
<p>Praise be sanctified from the First Translator, namely the tongue, and from the Second Translator, which is the Pen, befitting the Ancient Lord and the Beloved of nations, Who illumined the world with the lights of the Sun of Manifestation. If some eyes are incapable of perception, the cause is the ophthalmia of idle fancies and vain imaginings; otherwise, no deficiency can be attributed to the manifest, effulgent rays of the Sun. The possessors of hearing and sight bear witness that He is the Omnipotent One Who, with the arm of power, has shattered the idols of fancy and adorned the Hijaz with the light of truth. Through His blessed will, He has made the parched and barren plain the envy of the rivers of Paradise, and through the breezes of His grace and the rains of His mercy, He has adorned the sterile lands with a new raiment. He is that Sovereign Who caused Mount Sinai to crumble through a single revelation of His manifestation and bestowed fresh life upon the world through the Muhammadan Light. How many idols there were whose mention has returned to nothingness! He is the Dawning-Place of the most excellent names and the Day-Spring of the most exalted attributes, and He is the Source of Command in the world of creation.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose remembrance the rivers of knowledge have flowed from the hearts of Thy servants, and through Whose name the horizons of existence have been illumined with the light of Thy love! I beseech Thee by the suns of the heavens of Thy knowledge and the stars of the firmaments of Thy grace to assist Thy loved ones and chosen ones to serve Thy Cause. Then protect them from the enemies of Thy Self. O my Lord! Thou seest Thy loved ones in the prison of the land of Ta, and Thou hearest their lamentation in their separation from Thee and their cry in their remoteness from Thy presence. I beseech Thee by Thy might and Thy power and Thy sovereignty to deliver them. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the All-Conquering, the Almighty.</p>
<p>And furthermore, this evanescent one submits to your eminence that your beloved letter dated the 12th of Jumada’th-Thani was received. For some time this servant found no opportunity to write a reply, as people were constantly arriving, some with permission and some without, and this servant was occupied day and night with fulfilling duties and services, as well as writing replies to petitions. Now, praise be to God, since their service has ended and some leisure has been obtained, I have troubled your fragrant thoughts and with these intrusive words, in all cases hope for forgiveness. God the One is witness that whenever good news arrives by letter, the heart is seized with fresh joy and new delight, for it is adorned with mention of the friends of God and brings glad tidings of your good health. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that this fragrance may ever be diffused and this breeze may continue to blow throughout the duration of the kingdom. The mention of loved ones is the key that opens the door of sorrow, and the countenance of the friends is the dawning-place of light in the darkness of the world. I implore and beseech the glorious and exalted Truth to make all hearts as one heart and make it the treasury of the love of His chosen ones, and to make all the eyes of the world as one eye and draw that eye to His horizon of manifestation. In such case that which no eye hath seen nor ear heard will be made manifest. Such entreaty and supplication is befitting to be offered unto the Lord of Names, for His generosity has encompassed the world and His mercy has taken precedence. Exalted is our Lord and the Lord of earth and heaven! Exalted is our Goal and the Goal of all created things! After reading and becoming informed, He proceeded to the Most Great Prison and it was presented before His presence. He said […]</p>
<p>We beseech God to fulfill what He has willed in His path and to manifest from it that which will reassure His servants and gladden the hearts of His creation. O thou who hast attained unto the unity of God and His remembrance! This is the Day of mention and praise and service. All must turn their gaze away from the world and its peoples and fix it upon this matter. All things are manifest and revolve around this station, though the deniers and the heedless are asleep and, in their imagination, spin spider’s webs which they deem to be mighty fortresses. Soon shall they find themselves in manifest loss. The religion of God and His Cause have become of no account. Most people have turned to alien pursuits and seek to acquire the customs of that group. Glory be to God! Where has vision gone and with what thoughts is the heart occupied, that at every moment the veils of heedlessness are seen to grow thicker? They have strayed from God’s straight path and clung to the ways of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Reflect upon the consequences of their deeds - most lands have been lost, and one who appeared from the Kingdom of justice and descended from the City of equity they deemed a corrupter and visited upon him that which the friends of God are unable to hear. Your honor knows well how much effort and endeavor we expended over limited years to remove corruption, conflict, disputation and the like, yet this mighty matter was in no way acceptable to Iran, for the country’s leaders are preoccupied and have not pondered, even for a moment, upon the matters at hand, nor do they now. Would that they had turned to the sacred verses and reflected upon what has been revealed. Alas! Alas! The riders of the steed of passion have other thoughts and other fancies. We beseech and implore the True One not to deprive His servants of this supreme adorning. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>This lowly one begs for your honor from the True One, exalted be His glory, such elevation and ascendancy as would cause the people of the earth to acknowledge and confess, for today it is the steadfast, firm, resolute and assured souls who have been and are the cause of the exaltation of the Blessed Word. He is the Protector and Encompasser of all things.</p>
<p>Concerning the incidents you mentioned that occurred along the way, and likewise the flooding of the Tigris - if the Tigris of Baghdad should flood, it matters not, but the sea of hatred has overflowed. We beseech the True One to protect His servants and to transform this turbulence into calm and assurance.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the lands and M., news has arrived but they have written that it passed peacefully. However, as long as wealth remains within one’s self, that person will never be considered pure from polytheistic doubts and infidel allusions in the eyes of the people of Iran. This brief saying suffices: “When gold and silver are complete, faith is established with them, though what they have is contrary to what God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, has.”</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about his honor and Muhammad Surur, upon him be [Baha’u’llah’s] glory, and the house where that beloved one resides - regarding this matter, after presentation, they said to write to his honor the physician, upon him be God’s peace and care: “In any case, you must deal with him with forbearance, for if any word should arise concerning the friendship and love of the past, it might cause some to gossip, since your connection is to this place. And God willing, whatever loss occurs, we beseech the True One to grant compensation in return.” […]</p>
<p>Mention was made of the spiritual friend, his honor Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’llah, may God’s peace be upon him. God willing, may he ever recline upon the couch of joy and dwell in the station of gladness and delight. Some time ago, this servant submitted something to his presence which was dispatched; God willing, it has arrived. Another letter from his presence dated the 21st of Jamadiyu’th-Thani was received. Praise be to God, repeated were the glad tidings of health and well-being, and renewed was the feast of remembrance. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant me the ability to fulfill my obligations of gratitude to His loved ones. But alas, alas! When does heedlessness grant respite, and when do deeds meet their requirements? I implore his presence to pray and seek divine confirmation from the Truth.</p>
<p>Regarding what was again written about the matter of ha and mim, at first it was very difficult, for they had written that the Vakilu’t-Tujjar, who is sometimes the governor’s deputy, had risen in opposition, the reason being that his honor the Traveler, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah], had a claim of two hundred tumans against him which they had requested. Hence these troubles arose, but afterward it passed. I beseech God to transform the essence of enmity and hatred into love and harmony, that all the people of the world may find rest. I send greetings to the friends of that land and beseech God that there may appear from them that which befits their station. The relatives of that Beloved One have been and are in mind. Conveying greetings to all depends upon the grace of that Beloved One. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings.</p>

These are the Hands of the Cause amongst the servants, and these are the lights of the horizons. Through them the light has shone forth and God’s commandments and laws have been spread among the people of the Dispensation. These are they who serve the chalices of divine bounties and heavenly gifts. In the name of Truth do they take, in remembrance of Truth do they drink, and to every seeker and questor do they give. These are souls who have had and have no will or purpose of their own. They gaze toward the horizon of the All-Merciful and act according to His command. The cause of their life is the mention of Truth, and the reason for their existence is the remembrance of the Peerless Friend. By the word “Arise!” they arise with such arising that sitting shall never overtake it. As He states in the prayer of the Fast, these are servants who, when blessed to hear the word “Fast” as a binding command, this decree becomes not bound by time or limit - they fast until their spirits leave their bodies. How glorious is this most exalted station and this supreme rank!</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O my God, O Thou by Whose name the horizon of power hath been illumined and by Whose remembrance the lights have shone forth! I beseech Thee by Thy Will which hath subdued all created things, and by Thy Purpose which hath encompassed all atoms, to assist this servant of Thine to mention Thee and to mention Thy Afnan whom Thou hast related to Thyself and elevated through Thy Most Exalted Word and made them the dawning-places of Thy love in the realm of creation. O my Lord! The servant acknowledgeth his powerlessness and shortcomings and his errors that have prevented him from that which beseemeth Thy days, and his transgressions that have made him heedless of the mention of Thy chosen ones. I beseech Thee, O Bestower of bounties, by the Most Great Name, to teach me that which Thou lovest and with which Thou art well-pleased. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the throne on high and of the dust below.</p>
<p>And then - may my spirit be a sacrifice for your steadfastness and your mention and your turning unto God! The servant has been blessed with a scroll filled with pearls of remembrance and praise. When I contemplated it, I was blessed by it and by its beauty and its purity and the delicacy of its hue. I approached the station of its Creator and Originator and Inspirer and Sustainer, and I presented it before my Lord and its Lord, my Sovereign and its Sovereign. And after it was blessed by the gaze of my Creator and its Creator, the gate of utterance was opened and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which nothing in all creation can equal. His blessed and exalted Word is:</p>
<p>He is the One Who exercises dominion over all who are in earth and heaven.</p>
<p>O Afnan! Upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy which have encompassed all horizons. The All-Merciful hath come with the Kingdom of proof, yet most of the people are in doubt and discord. Their eyes have been prevented from beholding the waves of the ocean and that which hath shone forth and appeared from the horizon wherefrom the lights have dawned. They worship vain imaginings and perceive not; they hear the verses yet understand not. For twelve hundred years they clung to the vain imaginings of heedless souls, and on the Day of Reckoning they pronounced sentence of death upon the Lord of all beings. They cling to the gulf of names while deprived and forbidden from the ocean of inner meanings. Glory be to God! Not one among the divines attained true understanding - from delusion they came and to delusion they returned. Every person of insight is bewildered and every possessor of heart is astonished.</p>
<p>Today the people of God must arise to serve the Cause with utmost endeavor, that perchance the servants may be preserved from former delusions and the tender saplings of the new garden may be protected from poisonous winds. By the life of God! The breath of the opposers is as deadly poison. Beseech ye God to protect all - He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Thy mention hath ever been and shall continue to be in the Most Holy Court. The servant in attendance presented thy letter and read it before the Wronged One. We found therein the fragrance of sincerity for God, the Lord of the worlds. We heard its contents and answered thee with verses that nothing in the world can equal. Verily thy Lord is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed. He is with thee and will aid thee through His grace, for He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Thus did the Light manifest its appearance and the Sun its radiance. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath attained unto that which hath shone forth from My luminous horizon. The Glory shining from the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those who love thee and are with thee and hearken to thy words concerning this irrevocable, mighty and wondrous Cause.</p>
<p>It hath ended. Praise and grace be unto Him Who hath ever mentioned and will continue to mention His Afnan, each having been blessed with the effects of the Supreme Pen, though God hath preferred some above others - this is what the tongue of God, our Lord, hath formerly uttered, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. In truth, a bounty hath been manifested that hath had and shall have no likeness or parallel. This evanescent servant beseecheth the Ever-Abiding Truth to increase His favors at all times and to keep him joyous and steadfast through the Kawthar of His utterance.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about the funds for the Most Exalted Leaf, upon her be the Most Glorious of all Glory - what was sent has been received, however the remainder should reach the Supreme [Lady] the Leaf, her mother. The choice of garments has also been left, as commanded, to that noble lady. They said if they can preserve some in a chest, it would be beloved and acceptable in the sight of God. And they said that the honored Afnan hath rendered complete service to the root of the Cause in attending to the needs of the Most Exalted Leaf, and this service was most acceptable before the Divine Throne, as this servant repeatedly heard from the Tongue of Grandeur. Well is it with you and pleasant it is.</p>
<p>As for the House, its custodianship has been entrusted to the exalted lady, the mother of His Holiness, and this is what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken at this time: “O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. The exalted lady, the mother of His Honour, is most entitled to reside in that House. We have entrusted its custodianship to her and bestowed it upon her, and after her to her descendants, that it may be a remembrance for her from God, the True One, and a memorial to her throughout ages and centuries.” Indeed, the favor of the True One, exalted be His glory, is of such magnitude that this evanescent one is powerless to describe it. Thereafter, that Most Great House must be maintained and renovated by the friends according to what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken and in the manner He hath commanded. Reverence for it is incumbent and obligatory upon all. This supreme gift hath today been specifically revealed from the Most Exalted Pen for the exalted lady. His bounty hath encompassed, His generosity hath taken hold, and His mercy hath preceded. Exalted is our Lord, our God, our Beloved, and our Desire! We beseech Him to assist us in His remembrance, His praise, and the promotion of His Cause. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>As for the tea sent by Your Honour, it truly arrived pure, distinguished and desirable, though not without some strength. Nevertheless, it has been and is being consumed. The package also arrived. In response to the petition of the exalted lady, the honored mother and leaf, upon them both be the Most Glorious Glory of God, two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets were revealed and sent. God willing, they will attain unto them and be gladdened and rejoiced by the rain-showers of divine mercy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Your Honour’s second letter, dated the 2nd of Rabi’u’th-Thani, renewed the world of remembrance and bestowed a wondrous adornment upon the tree of hope. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to grant me the blessing of meeting you and gathering with you beneath the shade of the Tree of His loving-kindness and the pavilions of His grandeur. In reading the letter, this servant was deeply moved, for there was delay in responding to it. However, God is witness and Your Honour knows that you are ever present before these eyes. Forgetfulness hath no place in this station, and oblivion hath no power. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Knowing Witness.</p>
<p>To the honored Afnan who are present in that land, and to the friends of God, I convey greetings and praise, and I beseech for all novel bounties and fresh favors. The Branches of the Blessed Tree - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - and the people of the pavilion of infallibility and grandeur, all convey their greetings and praise. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon Your Honour, upon those who are with you, and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>26 Jamadiyu’l-Avval 1303</p>
<p>Furthermore, in response to the honored Aqa Siyyid Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, a detailed Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of divine Will and sent. God willing, they will send it soon. A Tablet was also sent specifically for the honored Haji Mirza Muhammad-Taqi, upon him be the Glory of God. A Tablet was also revealed for the aforementioned person. God willing, they will attain unto it. I beseech the True One that the sealed wine may take hold of all and lead them to the praiseworthy station.</p>

<p>He is the All-Knowing, the Single, the Unique, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! How can I make mention of Thee, when I have become certain that the tongues of the mystics falter in Thy remembrance and praise, and the birds of the hearts of those who yearn after Thee are prevented from soaring to the heaven of Thy might and knowledge? If I say, O my God, that Thou art the All-Knowing, I witness that the Manifestations of knowledge were created by Thy command. If I say that Thou art the Wise, I behold that the Daysprings of wisdom were brought low by Thy will. If I say that Thou art the Single One, I observe that the realities of oneness were raised up by Thy creation. If I say that Thou art the All-Knowing, I witness that the essences of knowledge were realized by Thy will and appeared through Thy creation.</p>
<p>Glorified, glorified art Thou from being indicated by mention, or described by praise, or by any sign, for all of these are naught but descriptions of Thy creation, raised up by Thy command and invention. Whatsoever those who remember mention, or the mystics ascend unto the atmosphere of Thy knowledge, they return to that Point which hath submitted to Thy sovereignty, prostrated before Thy beauty, and been brought low by a movement of Thy Pen. Nay, I seek Thy forgiveness, O my God, for this, as it would establish a connection between the realities of created things and the Pen of Thy Command.</p>
<p>Glorified, glorified art Thou from any mention of their relation to what is attributed to Thee, for all relations are severed from the Tree of Thy Command, and all paths are barred from the Manifestation of Thy Self and the Dayspring of Thy Beauty. Glorified, glorified art Thou from being mentioned by mention, or described by description, or praised by praise. And whatsoever Thou hast commanded Thy servants of the wonders of Thy remembrance and the gems of Thy praise - this is of Thy grace upon them, that they might ascend thereby to the station which was created in their essences of the knowledge of their own selves. Thou hast ever been sanctified from the description of aught else but Thee and the mention of aught besides Thee, and Thou wilt ever be as Thou hast been from time immemorial. There is no God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the All-Powerful, the Most Holy, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou dost witness and see how sorrows have encompassed the Manifestation of Thy Most Merciful Self, and how tribulations have descended upon Him from all directions, to such extent that the righteous ones among the manifestations of Thy Chosen Name have rent their garments of patience, and the eyes of the secluded maidens have wept behind the veils of concealment. By Thy might, O my Beloved! I do not complain of what hath descended upon me from the clouds of Thy Command - the arrows of Thy decree - and what hath come upon me from the clouds of Thy leave - the spears of Thy destiny. For those who are filled with longing yearn for whatsoever descendeth from Thee and appeareth from Thy presence.</p>
<p>Therefore, O my God, this is Husayn who hath come with his own self and his kindred before the city of Thy decree, desiring what Thou hast willed by Thy fulfillment, and ever thankful for what came upon him in the path of Thy good-pleasure from time immemorial. Once, O my God, Thou didst entrust him to the hands of his brother who was named Cain, and he slew him with the sword of hatred between earth and heaven, whereupon tears flowed upon the cheeks of those near unto Thee and, beyond them, all things. Yet under the sword he gave thanks to Thee and called upon Thee with the tongue of those who remember. And once, O my God, Thou didst entrust me to Nimrod who cast me into the fire, and in that moment when I was suspended in the air above the fire, the angels of Thy Cause reached me and desired to help and assist me, but I turned not my gaze from the horizon of Thy bounties toward them, trusting in Thyself and acquiescing to Thy decree, until Thou didst make the fire for me a light, a mercy, glory, honor, coolness and safety. And once Thou didst entrust me to the hands of the enemies of Thy Self and […]</p>
<p>O my God and my Master! Once Thou didst deliver me into the hands of evildoers along with my family, whereupon they rose against me to such a degree that they warred against my person, slew those related to my essence and being, took my family captive, severed my head and raised it upon a spear, parading it through the towns and amidst the people. And my head upon the spear continued to remember Thee with wondrous praise and thank Thee with precious gratitude, calling out: “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having accepted from me that which befitteth not Thy station nor beseemeth Thy sovereignty. This is naught but one of the wondrous gifts bestowed upon Thy servant and manifestations of Thy grace unto the son of Thy handmaiden.” Until they brought it to the seat of the oppressors and the abode of the transgressors. After that, Thou knowest what befell it, and hast recorded it in Thy knowledge, until days and nights passed and Thou didst raise me up in truth and made me manifest under the name of ’Ali among Thy servants. I delivered unto them what Thou didst command me by the sovereignty of Thy Cause, and conveyed to them Thy messages and ordinances. Thereupon they rose against me without any proof or crime, until they suspended me in the air and pierced me with the bullets of hatred, whereupon my spirit ascended to the Most Glorious Companion and the Supreme Horizon. Thereby was rent asunder the veil of concealment from behind the pavilion of Thy glory and the tabernacle of Thy majesty, and the hearts of the Messengers were drawn to the retreats of Thy sanctity and the seats of Thy glorification. By God! The righteous and the pure wept at this, then the trees and fruits, then the seas and lights, then all that was and will be. And no sooner had those days passed than Thou didst raise me up in another attire and made me manifest under this Name in the kingdom of creation. Thou didst send me to all who are in earth and heaven […]</p>
<p>By My head! The Tongue of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted, proclaimeth: By God! O people, this is not from Mine own self, but rather from the presence of the All-Powerful at the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. O people! If ye believe not, deny not, oppose not, and be not among the idolaters. Thus have ye been commanded in the Kingdom of eternity by God, the Most High, the Most Glorious. O people! Have I forbidden what was permitted unto you, or permitted what was forbidden unto your souls, or altered what ye possessed of God’s ways, His religion, His law and His ordinances? O people! The traces of My blood are not yet effaced from the face of the earth, nor have the hearts of those in anguish found peace in My tribulations and sufferings. If ye have believed in My Self, this is My Self; if ye have believed in My signs, these are My signs; and besides these are My Revelation, My sovereignty, My power and My encompassing knowledge of the worlds. O people! Have mercy upon yourselves; deprive not yourselves of God’s sanctuary, withhold not from your hearts the breathings of His glorious mercy, nor from your faces the radiant splendors of His countenance. Fear God and be of the God-fearing. O people! Pervert not God’s words from their places, alter not His favors upon yourselves, and refute not the truth by what ye possess. Know God through God, then detach yourselves from all else. By God! Nothing of what hath been ordained in the heavens and earth shall profit you this day, nor shall the treasures of dominion enrich you, nor shall the hands of creation save you from the depths of delusion, nor shall the lamps of creation guide you, nor shall the suns of invention illumine you, except that ye believe in God and are assured of His signs, turn unto Him, seek shelter in His shadow, flee from yourselves unto Him, hold fast to His cord and cling to His handle. Thus doth your Lord counsel you. Whoso acteth, it shall be for his own self; whoso forsaketh - verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is independent of all the worlds.</p>

<p>O Sheikh Muhammad-’Ali-i-Qa’in, upon him be the everlasting glory of God!</p>
<p>The Tablet of God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting</p>
<p>He is the One Who shineth from the horizon of the heaven of bounty.</p>
<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but He, and He Who hath come with the Kingdom of verses is verily the Hidden Secret and the Treasured Mystery. Through His call the cry hath been raised from every direction, and at His Name the limbs of them that have denied God, the Manifester of clear tokens, have quaked. Through Him the Salsabil of utterance hath flowed throughout all possibility and all things have spoken: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.” Blessed is he who hath turned and hearkened and attained, and woe unto every heedless doubter. He is the One through Whom the earth hath recounted her tidings and revealed her treasures, and the sea of knowledge its pearls, and the heaven of utterance its stars and its lights, and the Lote-Tree its rustling, and the Pens their scratching. Blessed is he who hath drunk the choice wine of revelation and the Kawthar of inspiration from the cup of the bounty of God, the Lord of lords.</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned before the Sea! The Ancient Beauty hath turned toward thee with His Most Great Name, and desireth to make mention of thee with a remembrance whereby the realities of all things were attracted, and with verses that cannot be equalled by the treasures of earth and heaven, that He may draw thee unto Him and cause thee to speak and give thee to drink of the Kawthar of life, that thou mayest arise to promote the Cause with a power that no hosts in the world can weaken, nor the clamor of the nations diminish, and mayest speak that which will draw the servants nigh unto God, the Almighty, the All-Choosing. Say: O people! Behold, then be fair. By God, the ocean of utterance hath surged before the faces of all religions, and the breeze of the All-Merciful hath wafted over all possibility. Turn with radiant faces unto God, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection. O thou who gazeth upon the Countenance! Hear the call once again. He verily will aid thee and draw thee nigh unto Him in such wise that neither the gloating of enemies, nor the authority of princes, nor the clamor of divines, nor the mention of any frozen soul, nor the utterance of any fearful one shall hold thee back. Thy Lord verily is with thee, He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing. Turn with thy heart and thy spirit and thy inmost being toward the Kaaba of God and say: […]</p>
<p>My God, my God! I have turned to Thee with my whole being, and have desired naught on earth save to exalt Thy Word, manifest Thy Cause, spread Thy verses and reveal Thy bounty, generosity and bestowal. O Lord! Strengthen my heart through Thy Name and sovereignty, and my hand to grasp Thy Book, and my sight to behold Thy signs. By Thy might, O Thou the Desire of the world and the Manifest One through the Most Great Name, I desire naught save to aid Thy Cause through wisdom and utterance and to demonstrate Thy proof amidst all religions. O Lord! Thou seest this servant turning unto Thee and standing before the Kaaba of Thy manifestation. I beseech Thee by Thy power that hath conquered all things and by Thy mercy that hath preceded all created things, to adorn my head with the crown of detachment and my temple with the robe of godliness. Then make me, O my God, a standard of Thy Name amongst Thy servants and a banner of Thy remembrance in Thy lands. By Thy might! I love naught but what Thou lovest and desire naught but what Thou desirest. I have turned to Thee, detached from all else besides Thee, for I know of a certainty that all else besides Thee can neither profit me nor protect me nor aid me. I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Possessor of the Kingdom of Names and Creator of heaven, by the hidden pearls in the shells of the ocean of Thy grace and the mysteries treasured in the Book of Thy knowledge, to enable me to perform such deeds as will cause all created things to turn to the heaven of Thy favor, and to aid me in that which will cause all things to acknowledge Thy Manifestation, Thy power, Thy grandeur and Thy sovereignty. O Lord! Thou seest me attracted by Thy verses, speaking Thy Name and turning to Thy horizon. I beseech Thee not to deprive me of what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and the lovers in the cities of Thy love, who have sacrificed their spirits with joy and radiance in Thy path in such wise that neither the ornaments of the world nor the treasures of the wealthy deterred them. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest and in Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Hear thou the divine call in the Persian tongue. This call is, in one station, the Fire of the Sinaitic Tree, for by it are ignited the hearts of the sincere ones and those near unto God, and in another station it is the Living Waters for the life of the world. Blessed is the one who attaineth unto it. Verily, he shall reach a station wherein no hosts shall frighten him, nor shall the power of the world weaken him. And at times it is a shining Light, guiding those who turn unto it to the straight path and the mighty announcement. Give thanks to the Desire of the worlds Who hath mentioned thee in the Most Great Prison with such mention before which books bow down. Through the power and might of God, glorified be His majesty, arise thou upon the Cause and with spirit, radiance, wisdom and utterance, awaken the heedless and guide the wayward to the straight path. Say: O people! Know ye the value of this Day. Today the Sun of bounty hath dawned from the horizon of the world and is manifest, and the waves of the ocean of utterance are visible before the faces of all religions. Deprive not yourselves. By the life of God! A feast hath appeared and an assembly hath been raised up in the Concourse on High, for today He Who conversed on Sinai is seated upon the throne of manifestation, and the people of God have attained His presence, and the blessed, goodly City hath descended from heaven. Its sun is ever at its zenith; no cloud can veil it and no eclipse can overtake it. Its moon is ever shining and luminous, its rivers ever flowing and coursing, and its trees adorned with countless fruits. This Day is the Day of supreme joy. Blessed are they that attain, blessed are the sincere ones, and blessed is he who hath taken in his right hand the Living Waters through this Name whereby the gate of bestowal was opened to all in the world of creation, and the nightingale of faithfulness sang upon the branch of glory. Dominion belongeth unto God, the Lord of all worlds, and sovereignty unto God, the Goal of the mystics, and command unto God, the Possessor of this mighty Day.</p>
<p>O thou who standest before My face! Glorify on My behalf him who was named Nabil before Akbar, unto whom We have sent down, both aforetime and thereafter, that which shall endure through the sovereignty of God, the Mighty, the Great. Recite thou once again these verses in his presence. O Nabil, upon thee be My glory! Hearken unto that which We revealed in thy Tablet once again, that thou mayest arise to aid the Cause of thy Lord through wisdom and utterance. It behooveth thee not to turn thy gaze to the past or future. Make mention of this Day and what hath appeared therein, for verily it sufficeth all the worlds. The declarations and allusions regarding these stations quench the fire of being. It is for thee to speak forth today that whereby hearts may be set ablaze and the bodies of them that have advanced may soar. Whoso is assured of the new creation this day and beholdeth the Most Exalted Truth as the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting over all things, verily he is among those endued with vision at this Most Great Prospect. Every discerning believer beareth witness to this.</p>
<p>Walk thou above the world through the power of the Most Great Name, that thou mayest behold the mysteries of pre-existence and discover that which none hath discovered. Thy Lord is verily the Helper, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Be thou like unto an artery pulsating in the body of creation, that through the heat generated by this motion there may arise that which shall quicken the hearts of them that hesitate. Thou hast indeed associated with Me and beheld the suns of the heaven of My wisdom and the waves of the ocean of My utterance when We were behind seventy thousand veils of light. Thy Lord is verily the True One, the Faithful.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who hath attained unto the outpourings of this Ocean in the days of his Lord, the Most Bountiful, the All-Wise. We expounded unto thee, when We were in Iraq in the house of him who was named Majid, the mysteries of creation, its origin, its end and its cause. When We departed, We limited Our utterance to: “There is none other God but I, the Ever-Forgiving, the Bountiful.” Be thou a promulgator of God’s Cause with an utterance which will cause fire to blaze forth from the trees, proclaiming: “There is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Unconstrained.”</p>
<p>Say: Utterance is a substance that seeketh penetration and moderation. As for penetration, it dependeth on subtlety, and subtlety is conditioned upon pure and unencumbered hearts. As for moderation, it must be combined with wisdom, which We have revealed in the Books and Tablets.</p>
<p>We beseech God that He may graciously aid him who is mentioned, upon whom rest My glory and loving-kindness, to achieve that which hath been specifically sent down for him from the heaven of God’s bounty. This day no garment is more excellent, more radiant and more beauteous for man than the garment of steadfastness in the Cause of God. Ye must hold fast unto it and occupy yourselves with the service of God’s Cause. This Wronged One hath ever been and is still in grave peril. Whatsoever He hath mentioned or may mention hath been and is intended for the elevation of the station of His loved ones. The world and all that is therein is, in the eyes of the people of Baha, as something non-existent and transient. Yet in this Most Great Revelation, His bounty and grace are boundless. He bestoweth that which the Pen is powerless to recount. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those whom the swords of hatred have failed to turn away from turning unto God, the Lord of this mighty and exalted Station.</p>

<p>O Afnan and Afnan, upon both of you be the Glory of God!</p>
<p>The Tablet of God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. He is the One Who speaks from His Most Exalted Horizon.</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down by the Wronged One that He might draw all near unto God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. That which was hidden in God’s knowledge and veiled from hearts and eyes hath been revealed. The Day hath come, yet the people have denied God’s proof and His evidence, following every heedless rejected one. They have cast the Book of God behind their backs and committed that which hath caused the near ones to lament. They have done what they were forbidden in God’s Book and abandoned what they were commanded. They are indeed among those who have violated the Covenant and the pledges.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of the earth! Fear God and follow not the manifestations of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Behold, behold how the Sun speaketh before your faces and calleth you to its praiseworthy station. Fear God and deny not Him Whose appearance was heralded in God’s Books of old and yet to come, and of Whose praise the Messengers have spoken.</p>
<p>O Husayn! The Wronged One calleth thee from the precincts of the Prison and consoleth thee in what hath befallen thee. Thy Lord is verily the All-Patient. He biddeth thee to be patient and steadfast, and He is the Commander over what was and what shall be. Hearken unto the Call from the direction of ’Akka. Verily, it speaketh in every condition that there is no God but Him, the Lord of the unseen and the seen. Nothing escapeth His knowledge. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Loving.</p>
<p>Beware lest the happenings of the world grieve thee or the doubts of those who have denied God’s Book and His Manifestation cause thee to slip. They, verily, perceive not. Take hold of the Book with the strength from God. He commandeth thee to righteousness and godliness, and He is the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. He hath appeared and revealed that which draweth people nigh unto His extended path. Arise to serve the Cause, then mention Him with wisdom and utterance in such wise that hearts and souls are attracted thereby. Beware lest the clamor of the people or the veils of those who have disbelieved in the Witness and the Witnessed prevent thee.</p>
<p>Say: By God! The veils have been rent asunder and the All-Bountiful hath come at the return with a Cause before which ranks and hosts cannot stand. Say: This is the Day ye were promised in the Books of old, and of which Muhammad, the Messenger of God, gave you glad tidings in His words: “The Day when people shall stand before the Lord of the Kingdom.” We have sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs, yet most of the people understand not. This is the Day of turning unto God, but the people have turned away from it. They have forsaken their God and followed their desires. They perceive not. They have denied God’s favor after its appearance and rejected His signs after their revelation. The Tongue of Grandeur in the Most Exalted Horizon beareth witness to this, yet the people hear not. By God’s life! Had they heard, they would have hastened to a station whereof every atom proclaimeth: The Promise hath come, and this is the Promised One.</p>
<p>Verily My Most Exalted Pen desireth to make mention of His Afnan who hath ascended unto the Supreme Companion through God’s irrevocable decree. We testify that he hearkened unto the Call when it was raised betwixt earth and heaven, and attained unto that which the honored servants have attained, acknowledging His oneness and His singleness and that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken from His exalted station. He hath, at the time of his ascension, purified him and forgiven him as a token of His grace, and hath ordained for him in the most exalted Paradise a station that thoughts and minds cannot comprehend. Blessed art thou, O My Afnan, for that which befell thee in the earliest days. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. He hath witnessed what befell thee and preserved thee through His sovereignty until the promise was fulfilled and that which was ordained for thee in the Preserved Tablet came to pass. O Abu’l-Qasim! Upon thee be the glory of God and the glory of His Prophets and His chosen ones, and the glory of them that circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn. The first wave that hath risen from the ocean of grace from the presence of the Ancient King be upon thee, O thou who hast held fast unto the cord of grace in the days of God, the Lord of the Kingdom. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to send down upon thee at all times a mercy from His presence and to ordain for thee that which shall gladden thine eyes. Thus hath the Tongue of the Wronged One spoken on this darksome night, as bidden by God, the Lord of all being. We are God’s, and unto Him shall we return.</p>
<p>We have turned from the Arabic tongue to Persian, that all may comprehend the meaning and come. O Afnan! Be not grieved by that which hath befallen. At all times doth the world display its own scroll and proclaimeth with the most exalted call its own evanescence, counseling and advising its people. Blessed is the ear that hath been privileged to hear its call, for if man would truly observe and perceive the changes and vicissitudes of the world, he would find himself reposing upon the throne of tranquility, would return from extinction to everlasting life, and would set his heart upon supreme glory rather than utter abasement. The world and all that is therein would not change him. Praise be to God, there hath been ordained for you that which hath no peer or likeness. The Blessed Tree hath mentioned you among the Afnan and hath accepted you. This is a great bounty and an exalted station. Preserve it in the name of the one incomparable Powerful One. Your station is to promote and teach the Cause of God. This Wronged One hath, from the earliest days, extolled the mention of the Afnan. The Sacred Scriptures and revealed Tablets bear witness. Reflect upon the tribulations and afflictions that have befallen the Wronged One. From the earliest days He arose before the faces of all men, both rulers and divines, and summoned all, for the sake of God and without any veil or covering, to the most sublime horizon. The purpose of His rising was to exalt the Word, and of His call to draw creation nearer to the Lord of the seen and unseen. It is clear and evident to the people of insight and the companions of the Most Great Vision that in no matter did He seek any purpose for Himself. To this testify My deeds before the faces of the world and the rising of My call amongst the nations. When the effulgences of the Sun of Truth dawned from the horizon of the heaven of manifestation, all parties arose in opposition and protest, and brought about that which none but the True One knoweth. Glory be to God! From the people of the Bayan there occurred that which hath rendered the Pen powerless to mention. Some have objected to the mention of Divinity and Lordship. Say: O people of the Bayan! By the life of the All-Merciful! He desired no mention from among all mentions except for the drawing near of the servants and their turning to God, the Lord of the Day of Return. Silence hath been beloved and still is beloved by the Wronged One, for ears worthy of this call are rare in this day. To this testifieth every fair-minded and perceiving one. However, His Holiness the Herald, that is to say the Primal Point, states at the beginning of the Bayan: “He Who speaketh in every condition, verily I am God, there is no God but Me, the Lord of all things, and all besides Me are My creation. O My creation! Worship ye Me.” Likewise, in reply to one of the Letters of the Living, regarding Him Whom God shall make manifest, He saith: “Verily, I am the first of them that worship Him.” He hath repeatedly made such statements. By the Sun of Truth! Were it not for His mention, this Wronged One would have chosen silence in these matters, save for those who are worthy. Glory be to God! The understanding of the people of the Bayan is observed to be lower than that of the people of the Furqan, for that party accepted the words “Verily, I am God” from the Tree, while this group accepteth not these words from the Tree of Being and the Lord of the seen and unseen […]</p>
<p>Those who cast doubts through such words - their purpose is evident and manifest before God. Verily He is the Concealer, the All-Patient, the Compassionate, the Generous. Say: Nothing escapes His knowledge and no matter is beyond His power. He witnesses and sees, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. O My Afnan! We beseech the Most High to assist you, to strengthen you, and to ordain for you that which will gladden hearts and bring joy to eyes. And at the end of this Tablet We counsel you with that which is the cause of elevation and advancement, namely consultation in affairs. Should you consult with the honored Afnan, upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness and My mercy, in your affairs, this would be well-pleasing and acceptable before God. God will soon set right your affairs and draw you near unto Him and reveal to you that which was hidden from the eyes of the beholders. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Convey to all the kindred My greetings on behalf of the Wronged One. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon My Afnan who have not broken My covenant and My testament and who have acted according to that which was commanded in My perspicuous Book. The command is God’s, the Powerful, the Strong, the Triumphant, the Almighty.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Impregnable, Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>Praised be God for the deeds of those who have arisen to serve the Cause and who have uttered that which the All-Bountiful hath revealed in the Book. Blessed is he who hath drunk the choice wine of steadfastness from the hands of the bounty of his Lord, Who hath manifested whatsoever He desired with a sovereignty that the hosts of tyranny could not impede, nor the suppositions of the exponents of learning, nor the vain imaginings of the sources of discord and corruption.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O Cleaver of the dawn, Sender of winds, and Revealer of prosperity! I beseech Thee by the Lamp which was kindled in Thy name amidst the world, and by the light of Thy countenance whereby the faces of the nations were illumined, to assist Thy servants, Thy leaves, Thy handmaidens, and Thy chosen ones to arise to serve Thee, to turn toward Thy horizon, and to act according to that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. O Lord! Aid them through Thy bounty, then protect them from those who have violated Thy Covenant. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the servant received your later letter after completing my letter in response to your first letter. When I read it and found therein the fragrance of sincerity, I ascended to the Station and presented myself before the Throne and submitted its contents. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which diffused the fragrance of loving-kindness among all created things.</p>
<p>Concerning what you had written about Jinab-i-Aqa ?abibu’llah and his intention, and the perusal of the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet which indicated prohibition, these matters were presented before His presence. This is what the Lord of Eternity spoke in the Most Great Prison:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed</p>
<p>O ?abibu’llah! Be not grieved at what hath befallen. Praise be to God that that which was not acceptable in the sight of God did not come to pass. In this case, divine forgiveness hath encompassed and continueth to encompass. Through one exalted word the ocean of forgiveness hath appeared and surgeth. Grieve not, neither fear. Rather, rejoice in My loving-kindness, My bounty, and My mercy which have preceded all created things. We have verily pardoned thee, forgiven thee, and mentioned thee that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. God willing, thou shalt henceforth move according to the will of God and manifest the most great steadfastness, and know with firm certitude and established knowledge that the attributes of savage beasts have never been and never shall be worthy of the loved ones of the All-Merciful. The people of Baha must be adorned with the ornament of goodly deeds and spiritual qualities, in such wise that they may be the emblems of trustworthiness and righteousness throughout all lands and the standards of reformation. Thus doth the Wronged One counsel His loved ones and chosen ones from this glorious station. The souls who are gathered in ?adba (Mosul) must all partake of the pure water of wisdom from him who is named Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin and consult with him in all matters. The heaven of wisdom is illumined and radiant through the sun of consultation, and Zayn, upon him be the Glory of God, hath ever been trustworthy and one who consulteth in the sight of God. Blessed is he who loveth him, remembereth him, and drinketh from the cup of his utterance in this wise remembrance. The Glory be upon thee and upon the captives of God in ?adba and upon those who have cast away vain imaginings through the name of their Lord, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>We make mention of the kin who faced in the path of God what was faced by My Name in the land of Taff. In all eternity My Most Exalted Pen heareth mention of the martyrs who quaffed the chalice of martyrdom through My love, My remembrance and My Name, the All-Compelling over all who are in the heavens and earth. And We make mention of My loved ones there who witnessed in the path of God what no one before hath witnessed, and We remember them in such wise as their names shall endure through the permanence of My impregnable, exalted Kingdom.</p>
<p>O chosen ones of God and His loved ones! Ye have borne what none hath borne and heard what none before you hath heard, and We cause you to hear in this hour that whereby the horizon of utterance hath shone forth in all possibility. Exalted is your Lord, the Most Merciful, Who hath turned toward you and faced your direction and giveth you to drink, as a token of His grace upon you and as a mercy unto you. Rejoice ye in this supreme station and render thanks unto your Lord for this clear remembrance. From this station We pronounce blessings upon your faces and upon the faces of My handmaidens who have found the sweetness of My utterance, who have circled round My will, and who have acted according to what was sent down in My Mighty Book. The glory shining from the horizon of My loving kindness be upon My loved ones, upon them, and upon those who have attained unto the Most Great Sign when it was sent down from God, the Lord of all beings and the Sovereign of the hereafter.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The loved ones of God and His friends have time after time attained unto the true bounty and spiritual feast which is the mention of the Beloved of the worlds. God willing, may all be mindful and act in accordance with what beseemeth this greatest favor, and be occupied with the praise of the Beloved of the worlds. The choice wine of utterance is present and the Cup-Bearer is the Truth Itself, exalted be His glory. Blessed are they that drink thereof, and joy to them that attain!</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds! […]</p>
<p>Verily, We make mention of My servants and My handmaidens who have attained unto My days, and have quaffed the choice wine of steadfastness from the hand of My bounty, and have spoken My praise amongst My servants, and have preserved that which hath appeared from the tabernacle of My glory and the treasuries of My knowledge. Upon them be My glory and My mercy and My all-encompassing loving-kindness which embraceth all who are in the heavens and on the earth.</p>
<p>O Ali! Stand firm in the Cause of thy Lord, and be steadfast in such wise that the clamor of the heedless shall not deter thee. O Ali! Great is the Cause, and many are the manifestations of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Beseech God to protect thee and to deliver His servants from the abyss of doubt and uncertainty. We make mention of thee, and We mention thy wife, as a command from Our presence, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Remembering. We have forgiven those for whom she sought forgiveness from ’Amman, through the mercy of her Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate.</p>
<p>Likewise, concerning the two accepted handmaidens - upon them be the Glory of God - thou didst mention that they had served the Ascending Leaf - upon her be the Glory of God. Mention of them was made before the Throne. This is what the Tongue of the Most Merciful hath spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance - exalted be His majesty:</p>
<p>In the Name of the Eternal, the Everlasting</p>
<p>O handmaidens! Your mention was made in the presence of the Wronged One, and these exalted words dawned forth from the Dayspring of favor, the Source of verses. Hearken unto the call of the Peerless Friend, and know the worth and station of that which floweth from the Most Exalted Pen, and preserve the precious pearl of divine love in the treasury of your hearts, and let it not slip from your grasp through the vain utterances of the doubtful ones. Praise be to God that ye have attained unto the most great honor, which is the recognition of Him Who is the Truth. Your turning unto Him hath been accepted, and your service hath been mentioned before the Throne, and through His boundless grace ye have been adorned with the ornament of forgiveness, and the word of forgiveness hath been revealed from the tongue of the Most Merciful concerning your father and mother. Rejoice ye with exceeding gladness in that ye are mentioned from the direction of the Most Great Prison.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant conveyeth wondrous greetings to each of the servants of God and His handmaidens. God willing, may all receive their portion from the outpourings of the True Bestower and be illumined by the spiritual Sun. The Glory be upon thee and upon them all.</p>

<p>O Siyyid Mahdi! This is the Sacred Mount - look and thou shalt behold Me. He is the Wondrous One in this exalted horizon. Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the sacred precinct, the seat of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, from this Most Wondrous and Most Glorious Beauty: I am, verily, He Who speaketh in all things, declaring that there is none other God but I, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. I have created all things by My command, and My will hath prevailed over all who are in the heavens and on earth, and the lights of My beauty over all who dwell in the kingdom of command and creation. All were created by My word, and all bow down before My face, though they perceive it not.</p>
<p>O thou who art the manifestation of My oppression! Hearken unto My call with the ear which God hath sanctified from the words of all else, that thou mayest hear what no ear hath heard throughout all that was and shall be. Thus do We bestow upon thee that which shall purify thee from the mention of all created things and make thee the embodiment of My remembrance between earth and heaven, that thou mayest recount the tale of this Hidden and Luminous Beauty. Sanctify thy heart from all created things and from whatsoever hath been created between earth and heaven, then adorn it with My love, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>Know thou that there hath come before Us a tablet bearing thy mark, wherein thou didst call upon thy Lord with those who ascend unto the heights of nearness. This is more pleasing unto thy Lord than that which hath appeared from those whom ye imagine to know, could ye but perceive it. Strive then within thyself that thou mayest ascend, in this Day of thy Lord, at every moment, unto a praiseworthy and wondrous station. Then send forth before thy Lord that which is cast upon thy heart, and remain steadfast in the Cause through My sovereignty, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>When thou seest the letter ‘J’, say: O servant! We have sent unto thee each year that which no letter thereof can be equaled by the creation of the first and the last ones. Yet thou hast not comprehended what was treasured therein of the pearls of thy Lord’s knowledge, and wert among those who remain veiled. Therefore, judge thou fairly within thyself, then read what We have sent down unto thee and what was revealed unto ’Ali before, and before him unto the Beloved, and before him unto the Son of Mary, that thou mayest call to mind within thyself and be of them who, when the verses of their Lord are sent down unto them, fall prostrate upon their faces in submission. By God! The Pen weepeth at what hath proceeded from thee against its Lord - nay, all things weep, could ye but hear. Yet, despite My sovereignty and power, I have forgiven thee through My loving forbearance. By God! My mention of thee was naught save out of My compassion for thee, whereunto beareth witness my honored servants. Arise then from the slumber of thy heart and make good what hath escaped thee. By God! This is better for thee than all thou hast done or shalt do until the Day when the trumpet shall be blown.</p>
<p>O servant! Rend asunder the veils of idle fancy, then recite what the Spirit hath uttered unto this pure and elevated Breast. Say: The paths unto God are beyond counting, yet the path unto this Ridvan which I have raised up in truth is but one, would ye but be assured.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! If thou detectest the sweet savors of justice, meet with him and present unto him the revealed words. Otherwise, avoidance is necessary, for in this Day consorting with deniers is accounted among the gravest sins and is displeasing unto God. By deniers are meant and shall ever be meant the rejectors from among the people of the Bayan.</p>
<p>O Word! One ocean is seen with a thousand dissimilar waves, one sun with a thousand differing shadows, one earth with infinite manifestations therefrom. Now all people are occupied with the waves and remain veiled from the Sovereign of the sea, of which all these limited forms are but examples. They seclude themselves in transient shadows and are deprived of the waves of the divine Sun which shineth from the holy and merciful horizon. Yet give thanks and be joyous in thy soul, for this enduring wine is not destined or decreed for every soul. It is the portion of pure hearts and the share of sanctified souls. In all conditions, hold fast to God’s grace and regard all peoples under thy protection. Be not content with what people have done. At all times await novel bounties. Turn not thy gaze from the direction of hope. Enter from mortal pavilions into the eternal tabernacle of glory, and from the hosts of the idolatrous souls choose thy dwelling in the sanctuary of God’s protection.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Make thyself ready that the heat of the Paran flame and the manifestations of the holy divine Beauty may take effect in the Sinai of thy heart. O Mahdi! A fire hath been kindled in the Sinai of all contingent beings such that wert thou to perceive but a spark thereof, thou wouldst find the tongue of all things uttering the well-known words of Sinai. Yet it hath not yet affected the people of dust. Verily, dry wood is susceptible to fire, not the heart-stone of every deceitful polytheist.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Sanctify the beauty of unity from the dust of imitation and raise thy tent upon the heights of detachment. Thus doth thy Lord counsel thee that thou mayest be among the doers.</p>
<p>Be it known that certain exalted Tablets have been revealed and sent. Make copies of all of them and afterward deliver them according to the requirements of the time and the capacity of the people. For these are days in which even the near angels are in distress and agitation, how much more so these people who are constantly undergoing strange transformations. Let not the story of the calf and Samiri, which was mentioned at the time of the migration, fade from sight. Some Tablets were sent without names - let them be delivered to whomsoever is deemed suitable. And certain wondrous and exalted Suras were sent which must be copied with the utmost diligence upon arrival, especially the Surih of Pilgrimage, for which not the least delay or postponement is permissible. Make copies and have them carried to the land of Shin and the land of Alif and the land of Sad by whoever intends to travel, for this is among the greatest acts of drawing near to God, did ye but know it. Beware lest ye delay in this matter. Thus hath it been ordained by the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. The revealed Suras require much reflection and meditation - nay, this is more obligatory than all else, would that ye might understand. Two Tablets were specifically revealed for Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin - deliver them, and he should review all that was sent. Thus hath the Command been sent down from the heaven of wondrous knowledge, that perchance there might be understood what none in all the worlds hath understood. None else need see them except such as have attained a station enabling them to view them with a penetrating and radiant vision.</p>
<p>A Tablet had previously been sent from one who followed the Interlocutor of old, and its reply was revealed, but it was delayed. However, since it was revealed in such terms as exceeded the capacity of minds and souls to bear, it was not sent. But now a brief Tablet has been sent anew - if deemed advisable, let it be copied in another hand and delivered, while the original Tablet remains with you. Thus doth God erase what He willeth and confirm what He willeth, and give and withhold, and with Him is the knowledge of all things in the Mother Book, and none knoweth this save those possessed of keen insight.</p>
<p>In all circumstances maintain the greatest concealment lest the hypocrites become aware of the sending of missives, whereby harm might befall the divine Tree itself. Furthermore, the Surih of Pilgrimage was specifically revealed for the land of Shin and must be implemented with utmost haste. Besides this, a lengthy visitation prayer was revealed last year but has not yet been sent, until such time as may be suitable. God sendeth what He willeth and He, verily, doeth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>Convey exalted mention to all the loved ones. Adorn Mirza Muhammad and his brother and Haydar-’Ali with the robe of remembrance, and likewise the Arabs and others among the friends, both male and female. Thus have We sent down the command that thou mayest be among those who act. At all times be vigilant in safeguarding the Cause of God and strive mightily for the unity of the friends, that God may thereby bring about a new matter. The Spirit and Glory be upon thee and upon those who follow thee unto the Day which no decree precedeth, nor any knowledge comprehendeth, nor all that was and will be, if thou be of those who know. Say to Haydar: Be as Haydar in the love of thy Lord, then proclaim between earth and heaven this Name which none in all the worlds hath known.</p>

<p>O ye that envy Me and seek My hurt! The fury of your wrath against Me confound you! Lo, the Day Star of Glory hath risen above the horizon of My Revelation, and enveloped with its radiance the whole of mankind. And yet, behold how ye have shut out yourselves from its splendor and are sunk in utter heedlessness. Have mercy upon yourselves, and repudiate not the claim of Him Whose truth ye have already recognized, and be not of them that transgress.</p>
<p>By the righteousness of the one true God! If ye reject this Revelation, all the nations of the earth will laugh you to scorn and mock you, for it is you that have produced, before their eyes, and for the purpose of vindicating the truth of your Cause, the testimonies of God, the Sovereign Protector, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing. And yet, no sooner was His subsequent Revelation, clothed with the glory of an all-compelling sovereignty, sent down unto you, than ye cast it behind your backs, O ye that are numbered with the heedless ones!</p>
<p>What! Believe ye in your hearts that ye possess the power to extinguish the radiance of the Sun, or to eclipse its splendor? Nay, by My life! Ye will never and can never achieve your purpose, though ye summon to your aid all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth. Walk ye in the fear of God, and render not your works vain. Incline your ears to His words, and be not of them that are shut out as by a veil from Him. Say: God is My witness! I have wished nothing whatever for Myself. What I have wished is the victory of God and the triumph of His Cause. He is Himself a sufficient witness between you and Me. Were ye to cleanse your eyes, ye would readily perceive how my deeds testify to the truth of My words, how My words are a guide to My deeds.</p>
<p>Blinded are your eyes! Perceived ye not the greatness of the power of God and of His sovereignty? Beheld ye not His majesty and glory? Woe unto you, ye congregation of the malicious and envious! Hearken unto My speech, and tarry not though it be for less than a moment. Thus biddeth you He Who is the Beauty of the All-Merciful, that haply ye may detach yourselves from the things ye possess, and ascend to the heights from which ye can discover the whole creation sheltered beneath the shadow of His Revelation.</p>
<p>Say: There is no place of refuge for you, no asylum to which ye can flee, no one to defend or to protect you in this Day from the fury of the wrath of God and from His vehement power, unless and until ye seek the shadow of His Revelation. This, indeed, is His Revelation which hath been manifested unto you in the person of this Youth. Glorified, then, be God for so effulgent, so precious, so wondrous a vision. Detach yourselves from all else but Me, and turn your faces towards My face, for better is this for you than the things ye possess. The Tongue of God testifieth to the truth of My words, through Mine own Word that speaketh the truth, and embraceth and comprehendeth all things.</p>
<p>Say: Think ye that your allegiance to His Cause can ever profit Him, or your repudiation of its truth cause Him any loss? No, by My Self, the All-Subduing, the Inaccessible, the Most High! Tear ye asunder the veils of names and cleave ye their kingdom. By My Beauty! He Who is the Monarch of all names is come, He at Whose bidding every single name hath, from the beginning that hath no beginning, been created, He Who shall continue to create them as He pleaseth. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Beware that ye divest not yourselves of the raiment of Divine guidance. Drink ye your fill from the Cup which the Youths of Heaven have raised above your heads. Thus biddeth you He Who hath more mercy upon you than your own selves, He Who asketh not any recompense or thanks from you. His reward is from Him Who hath, through the power of truth, sent Him down unto you, and singled Him out and proclaimed Him as His own Testimony unto the whole of creation. He it is Who hath empowered Him to manifest all His signs.</p>
<p>Repeat the gaze, that ye may perceive the things whereunto the Tongue of the Ancient of Days hath summoned you, that haply ye may be of them that have apprehended the truth. Heard it ye ever reported by your fathers of old, or by the generations that preceded them, even unto the first Adam, that any one coming in the clouds of revelation, being invested with manifest and transcendent sovereignty, having on his right hand the Kingdom of God and on his left all the power and glory of His everlasting dominion, any one preceded by the hosts of God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Most Powerful, and uttering continually verses whose import the minds of the most learned and wisest of men are powerless to fathom, should yet be the bearer of a message that is not of God? Be discerning, then, and speak ye the truth, the very truth, if ye claim to be honest and high-minded.</p>
<p>Say: The verses We have revealed are as numerous as those which, in the preceding Revelation, were sent down upon the Bab. Let him that doubteth the words which the Spirit of God hath spoken seek the court of Our presence and hear Our divinely-revealed verses, and be an eye-witness of the clear proof of Our claim. Say: By the righteousness of the Almighty! The measure of the favors of God hath been filled up, His Word hath been perfected, the light of His countenance hath been revealed, His sovereignty hath encompassed the whole of creation, the glory of His Revelation hath been made manifest, and His bounties have rained upon all mankind.</p>

<p>In the Name of Our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>All praise, sanctified from the conditions, manifestations and appearances of the nations, befitteth the Ancient Lord Who, through His Most Great Name, hath adorned the world of meaning with the springtime of spirituality, Who through “No” hath negated the manifestations of vain imaginings and through “but” hath adorned the daysprings of affirmation with the ornament of acceptance. Exalted be His grace, exalted be His grandeur, and exalted be His favors. There is no God but He. Glory be unto Thee, O Quickener of the graves through the breathings of revelation! I beseech Thee by the cities that were honored by Thy footsteps, by the gates that were opened through Thy Name, and by the bounties which Thou hast ordained in the most exalted Paradise for them that are nigh unto Thee among Thy servants and the sincere ones among Thy creatures, to assist Thy loved ones to stand firm in Thy Cause and to hold fast unto Thy cord in such wise that the doubts of the nations and the manifestations of the world shall not withhold them. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Lord! Thou seest one of Thy servants who hath turned toward Thee in the early days. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy generosity to ordain for him that which shall abide with him in every world of Thy worlds. Make his deeds, O my God, as treasures with Thee. Verily, Thou art the Powerful One Whom the might of the world cannot withhold. Thou givest and Thou withholdest. Verily, Thou art the Ancient Commander.</p>
<p>And then, the letter of that spiritual friend arrived. Praise be to God, it spoke of health, love, steadfastness and arising to serve. In truth, each word thereof was a volume concerning what had befallen that soul in the path of God. Though outwardly brief, inwardly each letter was a mirror reflecting conversations, hardships, migration and estrangement. In one place He saith, blessed and exalted be He: “Man seeth therein what he desireth not to see and heareth therein what he desireth not to hear” - that is, in this world. Verily, thou hast borne hardships in the path of God and hast followed the Ancient Lord in tribulations. I beseech God, exalted be He, to aid and assist you in that whereby His laws and commandments may be spread abroad. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>In brief, after reading the letter and becoming acquainted with its contents, I turned toward the most exalted Kingdom, attained the presence of His countenance, and after complete permission, all of it was presented. This is what God hath revealed in reply, He, the Lord, exalted and sanctified be He:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Speaking One, the All-Knowing […]</p>
<p>O thou who journeyest in the lands and travelest from thy native country in the path of God, the Lord of all religions! Hearken unto My call, for it draweth thee to the pavilions of My majesty and the tabernacle of My glory. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the All-Attractive. Neither the denial of the world nor the doubts of those who have disbelieved in the Hereafter can withhold Him. We have manifested that which was hidden in knowledge and have sent down the proof which, when revealed, caused all the proofs of the world to bow down before it. Yet the people are in doubt and dissension. The concourse of the Bayan have cast the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to idle fancies and vain imaginings.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! New deceptions have appeared and old rejected utterances have come forth. The people of the Bayan have adopted precisely the words of the Shi’ihs and walk in the same paths. They have fashioned a false ’Ali and turned away from One through Whose word a thousand true ’Alis are created. Consider the lack of understanding of these souls. For one thousand two hundred years they clung to vain imaginings, and when He appeared not a single one of the leading divines of that party attained to faith. Rather, they manifested such unbelief that they pronounced sentence of death upon the Lord of the world. It was never known what the fruit of that party’s beliefs and the results of their deeds would be - in truth, it was loss in this world and the next. Now again the deniers of the Bayan have resorted to the same things as before. They speak as did the former party, at times speaking of the corruption of the Book, at times clinging to idle fancies and vain imaginings.</p>
<p>Say: O company of the veiled ones! Today the lights of true unity have encompassed the world. Pass beyond the river of names that ye may attain unto the ocean of inner meanings. O Muhammad! The immature ones of the world were not and are not worthy of mention by the Supreme Pen. It behooveth men to find their like and cling unto them. Throughout the ages and centuries there have been idol-worshippers. How can such a party be worthy to become intimate with the mysteries of the Kingdom or to discover the fragrances of divine verses? Today every soul must sanctify the tablet of his heart from former impressions, that it may be adorned with the seal of “Verily I am God’s.” How remote is this station from the conditions of men and the levels of their understanding! Glory be to God! Have they no eyes? Have they no ears? Nay, they are deprived of both. The prejudices of former times have appeared a hundredfold greater. Ask of God that He may bestow a portion of the ocean of knowledge upon the ignorant people and deprive them not of the lights of the Sun of Justice.</p>
<p>Hadi Dawlat-Abadi hath arisen in opposition and, like unto the Shi’ih divines, speedily sendeth his followers to hell. Say: O ye who are devoid of understanding! The chief of your divines was Shaykh Muhammad-Hasan-i-Najafi. He wrote religious rulings for fifty years, yet when the divine Tablet was sent to him, he turned away and occupied himself with leading the people astray. Likewise did all the divines of Iran in the early years - all turned away and gave verdict for the shedding of His most pure blood. Now Mulla Hadi hath appeared with a new staff and a new turban, desiring to establish another party for another thousand two hundred years and send them to the abode of perdition.</p>
<p>Say: O my God, my God! Thou seest me advancing toward Thee and clinging to the cord of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the lights of the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation and the mysteries of Thy Book and what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, to assist Thy servants to act with justice and equity. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O my Lord! Aid them to behold the Tree and its fruits, and the Sun and its effulgence. Verily, Thou art the Protector of those who are in earth and heaven. In Thy grasp is the reins of all servants. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou desirest. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Most Praised.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, our Lord, the King of Names and Creator of heaven! The pearls of His ocean of knowledge have ever been manifest and visible, and the fragrances of His grace diffused and wafting. Yet the servants remain heedless, save for a few who have truly rent asunder the veils, scattered the ranks of names, shattered the idols of fancy, and with their whole being joined themselves to the Truth. Such is the station of the horsemen of this field. The immature ones of the world must wallow in the clay of idle fancies and return to their abode.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about being in the state of seeking and crying “Show me!”, after this matter was presented in the Most Holy Court, these exalted words descended from the heaven of Will - blessed and exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>“O Muhammad! This Wronged One bears witness that the words ‘Thou shalt not see Me’ have been transformed to ‘Look and thou shalt see Me’, and you have attained and achieved this. O Muhammad! By the life of God, the servants are more content with ‘Thou shalt not see Me’. Consider the deniers of the Bayan. They have preferred the owl to the eagle, and the lizard to the phoenix. Those feeble souls were not and are not worthy of the effulgences of the Sun of Power. They consume dust and are occupied with dust. We beseech God to protect His loved ones from their doubts and their croaking. Verily, He is powerful over all things.”</p>
<p>This evanescent one testifies that that spiritual beloved has ever been and continues to be remembered, has not been and will not be forgotten. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant another meeting, that we may gather in the shade of the Blessed Tree, to speak and to listen. Previously this servant sent a letter to you containing divine verses, but as it was during the time of upheaval, it did not reach you. All that you sent, both money and otherwise, before and after, was received according to your recent letter. Wherever you meet the loved ones of God, convey greetings on behalf of this servant. I beseech God to set them all ablaze and grant new effect to their burning, that the whole world, from East and West and South and North, may attain to the warmth of divine love through that luminous flame. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you, upon those with you, and upon every steadfast believer.</p>

<p>He is God–exalted be His station, the Most Great, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>Praise be sanctified above the recognition of all created things and the comprehension of all beings, befitting the court of nearness to the Holy Presence of the Desired One, Who has ever been and shall ever be sanctified above all names and attributes. The entire creation speaks His praise and acknowledgeth His bounty and generosity, yet none has claimed to have truly accepted Him, for how can they who are bound by limitations enumerate that which exists within the court of the Lord of the invisible and the visible? The private chamber of the unseen is sanctified above the gathering of manifestation and witness. Nevertheless, we servants submit with the utmost lowliness and supplication:</p>
<p>O Lord! O Self-Sufficient One! O All-Bountiful! O All-Merciful! Thou art He Whose mercy has preceded all and Whose generosity has encompassed all peoples and nations. Should the breeze of Thy wealth pass by, it would erase the very name of poverty from the world, and should the ocean of Thy forgiveness surge, it would remove all distinction between the sinful and the obedient. Thou hast loved oneness and unity, yet this evanescent one testifies that none hath truly understood Thy oneness. O Generous One! Deprive not Thy weak servants of Thy profound grace. Accept these unworthy mentions through Thy bounty. The world of being is but a token of Thy generosity, and the manifestations of all things are but signs of Thy manifestation. O Peerless One! Sanctify Thy servants and summon them to the seat of Thy loving-kindness. Deprivation from all else is possible, but from Thee it is neither fitting nor possible. O God! The eye is expectant, the face is turned toward Thee, and the heart is attracted. What Thou didst grant at first, withdraw not at the end. Thou art the All-Powerful, Thou art the All-Seeing. Praise be unto Thee, O Creator of heaven and Possessor of all names!</p>
<p>O Beloved of my heart! The perfumed spiritual leaf that was adorned with the mention of the people of inner meaning gave new life to the soul and strength of vision to the eye. In truth, each of its words was a messenger from the right hand of love and affection, and a fragrance from the rose-garden of longing and desire. It gave the power of smell to the nostrils and taste to the palate. Allah-u-Akbar! Such is the influence of the messengers and the penetrating power of the words of the sincere ones that a single word can transform hell into paradise and retribution into blessing. Thus it was that in the midst of sorrows that descended in these days, the gate of joy was opened and delight and gladness took hold of our very being. His is the praise and the favor. He created both fire and light, and this contrast has been the cause of our recompense; otherwise His generosity would not accept punishment, and His mercy would not be followed by wrath. Glorified be His majesty, universal be His bounty, exalted be His station, and there is no God but Him! In all conditions the people of truth are patient and gaze toward the horizon of submission and contentment. After reading and becoming apprised of the esteemed letter, We proceeded to the exalted station and presented it before His Countenance. He said […]</p>
<p>This Prisoner has ever besought and continues to beseech God, exalted be His glory, for their confirmation, and assuredly this prayer shall be answered, for He is the Hearer and Answerer of prayers. From Him is supplication and in His grasp lies its acceptance. The mysteries of the words “He doeth whatsoever He willeth” are beyond reckoning. Convey greetings from this Wronged One to all the friends in that land. We beseech God to protect them all and make them the sources and manifestations of His most excellent names. The petition of Ghulam-Qabli-Husayn was read before the face of this Wronged One in the prison. Blessed is he and joy be unto him. We beseech the Almighty to make him ever-mindful of Him, speaking His praise and standing firm in His service under all conditions. The peace of God and His mercy and blessings be upon you.</p>
<p>This evanescent one expresseth utter nothingness and evanescence before each of the loved ones and friends of God. To the beloved of my heart, His honor Aqa Siyyid ’Ali, upon him be 96 [Baha’u’llah], this evanescent one’s mention of nothingness is beloved, for if true evanescence is achieved, perpetuity is present in that moment. In such case, the decree of attainment is clear and established. God willing, may you ever adorn the garden of utterance with wondrous and exalted trees. The trees of loving-kindness have arrived. O beloved of my heart! The tree is present, the earth is present, the water is present - the matter rests with the planter and cultivator. We beseech God that by His blessed will and good-pleasure, He may bring about the means that are expedient. He is the Helper and Succourer in all things.</p>
<p>At this hour, when four hours of night have passed, this evanescent one, like lightning, was at times at the wharf and at times by the sea, and likewise near its gift-bearers. Through abundant searching, praise be to God, its palm trees, before bearing fruit, yielded in wondrous and lofty array fruit whose taste was love and whose flavor was the savor of life. How excellent was its fragrance which gave strength, and its mention which bestowed joy! If, for example, it seems trivial to true friends, God knows that with the Friend it is accounted as precious gems. Other trees were also seen and present. As time had passed and night had advanced beyond four, therefore the searching and investigating and observing and admiring and giving thanks were all deferred to the spiritual dawn. The mention of dawn was made, and the elephant remembered India. From this mention was inhaled the fragrance of the dawn of the Day of Manifestation. Exalted be that Day wherein God was manifested unto all things through all names! By the life of our Beloved, in this station I am both mute and dumb. Another sight is needed and another power of hearing. Although it is hoped that through the prayers of those beloved ones, through patience every difficulty may become easy and every hardship become comfort. In truth, with His generosity no task is difficult. In any case, I hope that tomorrow morning, through the endeavors of the gentlemen, I may be occupied with taking and carrying and digging and planting and arranging, and surely through the noble efforts of those beloved ones its fruit will appear, its stature will become lofty, and its shade will become brilliant. In truth, each was a palm grove that truly captured hearts and dispelled grief. It seemed as though the garden of delight had turned from Alexandria to Bahji, and from there to that small plot which His Honor knows contains the lamentation of the world and from which the tumult of nations is manifest and evident. However, I state with sincerity and declare with the tongue of truth that in these days this servant has no means beyond what they have sent, and there is fear that, God forbid, there may be delay in the assigned service and inability may become apparent. I petition those beloved ones not to forget this evanescent one in times of leisure. This is the hope of this evanescent one. Convey greetings on behalf of this evanescent one to those blessed, assured, enkindled souls and those detached, attracted spirits. I have besought and continue to beseech from God, exalted be His glory, blessing and bounty and health for each one, being certain that He is the Hearing, the Responding One, and praise be to God, the Mighty, the Watchful. In Persia I used to hear them say: A new flower has come to market, My soul’s beloved has come.</p>
<p>However, it was not known who was the lover and who was the beloved, for in truth they were uttering meaningless words. But now it is observed that a whole world of meaning hath appeared from that which seemed meaningless, inasmuch as Jinab-i-Aqa Abu’l-Qasim arrived bearing a fresh flower whose fragrance was more delicate than the human spirit and whose sight was a hundred thousand times more sublime than beholding garden roses. After observation, examination and investigation, it became clear that this too was one of the favors of those beloved ones. Another night it came to bloom; truly it was a wondrous sight. This one flower excelled all flowers, for it had attained the presence [of the Beloved] and was adorned with the ornament of acceptance. These are the attributes of this sweet-natured flower which, according to the Beloved of hearts, His Holiness ’Ali–may God ennoble his countenance–was called Malonia. As long as the power of renewal exists in springtime and moisture in the morning breeze, may ye remain joyous and triumphant, hale and whole, abiding beneath the shade of the Sacred Tree. Truly a wondrous thing hath come to pass. For several years this flower was planted, yet neither its blossoms nor its fruit were known, until in these days they appeared. And by chance, it was on a night when at dawn this servant was to recite in the Shrine the revealed sermon specifically for the new Most Great Joy. Taking up the sermon and the flower, I set out from ’Akka toward Bahji. All began to utter words of praise and glorification. And in God’s handiwork, His is the praise in all conditions, and He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. There is no God but Him, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Almighty and the All-Powerful</p>
<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the Most Glorious, the All-Praised. My limbs and members bear witness that there is none other God but Him. He guideth whom He willeth and leadeth astray whom He pleaseth. He is the Omnipotent over all things, and in His grasp are the reins of all affairs. Neither the turning away of men, nor their deeds, nor the utterances of every heedless and veiled one can hinder Him. He is the One Who created creation for His knowledge, made known unto them His path, perfected His proof, and manifested His clear evidence, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart, thou who art mentioned in my inmost being and reality! In all conditions there appeareth that which beareth witness to your love, your turning to God, and your arising to serve God and His loved ones - they who have cast behind their backs all else but God and have committed what their passions have commanded them. These, verily, are among those who have gone astray.</p>
<p>The spiritual messenger and embodied temple of wisdom, namely the honored Shaykh-’Ali, hath arrived - an arrival like water to the withered saplings in the garden of inner meanings. Blessed be God Who hath aided His loved ones to make mention of Him, to praise Him, to serve His Cause, and to arrange what He hath willed through His bounty and grace. Verily, He is the Most Generous of the generous ones and the Most Merciful of the merciful ones.</p>
<p>The one mentioned was in truth like soil and the Euphrates to that which was planted in the garden. At first his virtues were concealed, but later they became manifest in such wise as to cause wonderment among the dwellers of that place. A hundred thousand thanks be unto the True Object of Worship Who confirmed His loved ones in that which is the cause of everlasting remembrance. Indeed, the person mentioned was peerless in the science of cultivating palm trees and their offspring, as evidenced by clear and manifest proof, namely that his service was rendered in such a station that every knowledgeable scholar and wise sage would testify to it, both outwardly and inwardly. Glory be to God! As his deeds were for the sake of God, they illumined the world of deeds at this station. Now is the station of the blessed word which declareth: “Verily, He doth not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish.” It is hoped that the fruits of his deeds will remain preserved in the scrolls of glory. A testimony that testifieth to the truth and uprightness of his deed is his attainment unto His presence before his desire. A good deed hath a pleasing reward, for the Judge of Justice is God, exalted be His glory. Praise be to God, the unexpected divine bounty encompassed him. Though he is now unaware of it, the time will come when he shall become conscious thereof. Verily, He is the All-Wise Teacher and the All-Knowing Expositor.</p>
<p>The letter from your honor, which contained wondrous and sublime mentions, brought joy to all limbs and members, for it was adorned with that which all today behold. Should he and all the pens in the world attempt to describe its virtues and fruits, verily the pens would be exhausted while it would remain steadfast in its station. However, I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to perfume and illumine the world with the fragrance of love of that beloved of the heart. Verily, He is powerful over all things. I ask and hope from the True One that He may transform the difficulties of your honor into ease and grant a portion thereof to the people of the earth. Verily, He is the Munificent Bestower.</p>
<p>And after expressing greetings before His presence, He said: O Muhammad! The sea and its waves, the sun and its effulgences, and the Kingdom of utterance and its verses are manifest, radiant and shining before all faces, yet the blind hath no share or portion thereof. This Wronged One hath, throughout the nights and days, spoken forth loving counsels and wise exhortations, and hath had, and hath, no purpose save the manifestation of fellowship, unity, love and harmony. Nevertheless, from the beginning of His days until now, He hath been afflicted in the hands of the heedless. Every possessor of sight and hearing hath hearkened unto the call of the Wronged One and beheld the horizon of Revelation. We beseech God that through the endeavors of those endowed with sight and hearing, He may guide and awaken the heedless to the holy, pure and luminous City. O Muhammad! On this triumphant day the attraction of the Call hath seized all things, and ere long shall wondrous and exalted creatures, brought forth by the Most Great Word in the All-Highest Paradise, adorn and bless the earth with their footsteps. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Mighty. The river of mercy hath encompassed all, and the light of utterance hath illumined all creation. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto His recognition and freed itself from all else. O Muhammad! Upon thee be the peace of God and His loving-kindness. Ere long shall the fruits of thy deeds become manifest in the schools of the world and the gatherings of nations. Thy Lord, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. Give the friends in that land their portion of the flowing river of mercy and the effulgences of the new and wondrous Luminary, and gladden them with exalted and decisive verses. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid and strengthen them to exalt His Cause through wisdom and utterance. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>That which is the cause and means of God’s infinite bounties hath ever been mentioned and continueth to be mentioned, and that dear one hath, with complete assurance and perfect devotion, held fast unto that which is itself the cause of the opening of all sealed doors. Our Lord is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Gracious, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the Wise. I convey greetings to the friends in that land and beseech God to grant each one such endeavor that their deeds and actions may be accepted in the sight of all, though the essential purpose is that deeds be adorned with acceptance by God, exalted be His glory. Yet since in all things the means are present and their relation to God is evident, whatsoever is spoken is beloved and acceptable. We beseech God to aid them, assist them, and make them of those who have achieved the supreme steadfastness in His most holy, most luminous, most exalted Cause.</p>
<p>The beloved of the heart of ’Abdu’l-Baha hath ever been and continueth to be remembered. In truth, their prayers, which issued from the tongue of Truth, to this day remain sweet and established in the soul. It is hoped that in all conditions they may be assisted in raising aloft the Word and in exalting the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds. Verily our Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in His grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Glory and majesty belong unto God, the Mighty, the Most Praised.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that the sent palms became the ornament of the luminous garden with utmost honor. We moved them with infinite prayers and salutations, and in the name of God deposited them in God’s treasure which is the earth. This deed was accomplished through His favor; its elevation, manifestation and fruits now rest with God, exalted be His glory. Praise be to God, two palms were planted in the name of ’Abdu’l-Baha, upon Him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, and it is hoped that, as the intention was pure, their manifestation will bestow a portion upon the realm of trees, and God, exalted be His glory, will make them the dawning-place of the growth of the world’s trees. Verily, He is powerful over all things. And two more were planted in His name. The outward deed is complete, and the inner manifestation is in the hand of God, Lord of the mighty throne.</p>
<p>Furthermore, truly His Honor Aqa ’Ali, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], has labored greatly in this journey and his work was evidently for the sake of God, therefore it was accepted, as witnessed by his repeated attainment of the presence and his being received once or twice at night, and his supplication to God for the mention of good for all. And now that it is the twentieth night of the honored month of Shawwal, their mention flows from the tongue of the Beloved thus: This is true bounty and eternal preceding mercy. Blessed be he, then joy be unto him. He has attained the presence and returned by leave of Him Who possesseth all, and this is the manifest triumph. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to cause him to attain that which befits the station of the unitarians and the sincere ones. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. Peace and praise and remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those with you and those who love you for the sake of God, the Goal of all worlds and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and the earths.</p>

<p>O Queen in London! Incline thine ear unto the voice of thy Lord, the Lord of all mankind, calling from the Divine Lote-Tree: Verily, no God is there but Me, the Almighty, the All-Wise! Cast away all that is on earth, and attire the head of thy kingdom with the crown of the remembrance of thy Lord, the All-Glorious. He, in truth, hath come unto the world in His most great glory, and all that hath been mentioned in the Gospel hath been fulfilled. The land of Syria hath been honoured by the footsteps of its Lord, the Lord of all men, and north and south are both inebriated with the wine of His presence. Blessed is the man that hath inhaled the fragrance of the Most Merciful, and turned unto the Dawning-Place of His Beauty, in this resplendent Dawn. The Mosque of Aq?a vibrateth through the breezes of its Lord, the All-Glorious, whilst Ba??a trembleth at the voice of God, the Exalted, the Most High. Whereupon every single stone of them celebrateth the praise of the Lord, through this Great Name.</p>
<p>Lay aside thy desire, and set then thine heart towards thy Lord, the Ancient of Days. We make mention of thee for the sake of God, and desire that thy name may be exalted through thy remembrance of God, the Creator of earth and heaven. He, verily, is witness unto that which I say. We have been informed that thou hast forbidden the trading in slaves, both men and women. This, verily, is what God hath enjoined in this wondrous Revelation. God hath, truly, destined a reward for thee, because of this. He, verily, will pay the doer of good his due recompense, wert thou to follow what hath been sent unto thee by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. As to him who turneth aside, and swelleth with pride, after the clear tokens have come unto him from the Revealer of signs, his work shall God bring to naught. He, in truth, hath power over all things. Man’s actions are acceptable after his having recognized (the Manifestation). He that turneth aside from the True One is indeed the most veiled amongst His creatures. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Almighty, the Most Powerful.</p>
<p>We have also heard that thou hast entrusted the reins of counsel into the hands of the representatives of the people. Thou, indeed, hast done well, for thereby the foundations of the edifice of thine affairs will be strengthened, and the hearts of all that are beneath thy shadow, whether high or low, will be tranquillized. It behoveth them, however, to be trustworthy among His servants, and to regard themselves as the representatives of all that dwell on earth. This is what counselleth them, in this Tablet, He Who is the Ruler, the All-Wise. And if any one of them directeth himself towards the Assembly, let him turn his eyes unto the Supreme Horizon, and say: “O my God! I ask Thee, by Thy most glorious Name, to aid me in that which will cause the affairs of Thy servants to prosper, and Thy cities to flourish. Thou, indeed, hast power over all things!” Blessed is he that entereth the Assembly for the sake of God, and judgeth between men with pure justice. He, indeed, is of the blissful.</p>
<p>O ye the elected representatives of the people in every land! Take ye counsel together, and let your concern be only for that which profiteth mankind and bettereth the condition thereof, if ye be of them that scan heedfully. Regard the world as the human body which, though at its creation whole and perfect, hath been afflicted, through various causes, with grave disorders and maladies. Not for one day did it gain ease, nay its sickness waxed more severe, as it fell under the treatment of ignorant physicians, who gave full rein to their personal desires and have erred grievously. And if, at one time, through the care of an able physician, a member of that body was healed, the rest remained afflicted as before. Thus informeth you the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>We behold it, in this day, at the mercy of rulers so drunk with pride that they cannot discern clearly their own best advantage, much less recognize a Revelation so bewildering and challenging as this. And whenever any one of them hath striven to improve its condition, his motive hath been his own gain, whether confessedly so or not; and the unworthiness of this motive hath limited his power to heal or cure.</p>
<p>That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument for the healing of all the world is the union of all its peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith. This can in no wise be achieved except through the power of a skilled, an all-powerful and inspired Physician. This, verily, is the truth, and all else naught but error. Each time that Most Mighty Instrument hath come, and that Light shone forth from the Ancient Dayspring, He was withheld by ignorant physicians who, even as clouds, interposed themselves between Him and the world. It failed, therefore, to recover, and its sickness hath persisted until this day. They indeed were powerless to protect it, or to effect a cure, whilst He Who hath been the Manifestation of Power amongst men was withheld from achieving His purpose, by reason of what the hands of the ignorant physicians have wrought.</p>
<p>Consider these days in which He Who is the Ancient Beauty hath come in the Most Great Name, that He may quicken the world and unite its peoples. They, however, rose up against Him with sharpened swords, and committed that which caused the Faithful Spirit to lament, until in the end they imprisoned Him in the most desolate of cities, and broke the grasp of the faithful upon the hem of His robe. Were anyone to tell them: “The World Reformer is come”, they would answer and say: “Indeed it is proven that He is a fomenter of discord!”, and this notwithstanding that they have never associated with Him, and have perceived that He did not seek, for one moment, to protect Himself. At all times He was at the mercy of the wicked doers. At one time they cast Him into prison, at another they banished Him, and at yet another hurried Him from land to land. Thus have they pronounced judgement against Us, and God, truly, is aware of what I say. Such men are reckoned by God among the most ignorant of His creatures. They cut off their own limbs and perceive it not; they deprive themselves of that which is best for them, and know it not. They are even as a young child who can distinguish neither the mischief-maker from the reformer nor the wicked from the righteous. We behold them in this Day wrapt in a palpable veil.</p>
<p>O ye rulers of the earth! Wherefore have ye clouded the radiance of the Sun, and caused it to cease from shining? Hearken unto the counsel given you by the Pen of the Most High, that haply both ye and the poor may attain unto tranquillity and peace. We beseech God to assist the kings of the earth to establish peace on earth. He, verily, doth what He willeth.</p>
<p>O kings of the earth! We see you increasing every year your expenditures, and laying the burden thereof on your subjects. This, verily, is wholly and grossly unjust. Fear the sighs and tears of this Wronged One, and lay not excessive burdens on your peoples. Do not rob them to rear palaces for yourselves; nay rather choose for them that which ye choose for yourselves. Thus We unfold to your eyes that which profiteth you, if ye but perceive. Your people are your treasures. Beware lest your rule violate the commandments of God, and ye deliver your wards to the hands of the robber. By them ye rule, by their means ye subsist, by their aid ye conquer. Yet, how disdainfully ye look upon them! How strange, how very strange!</p>
<p>Now that ye have refused the Most Great Peace, hold ye fast unto this, the Lesser Peace, that haply ye may in some degree better your own condition and that of your dependents.</p>
<p>O rulers of the earth! Be reconciled among yourselves, that ye may need no more armaments save in a measure to safeguard your territories and dominions. Beware lest ye disregard the counsel of the All-Knowing, the Faithful.</p>
<p>Be united, O kings of the earth, for thereby will the tempest of discord be stilled amongst you, and your peoples find rest, if ye be of them that comprehend. Should any one among you take up arms against another, rise ye all against him, for this is naught but manifest justice. Thus did We exhort you in the Tablet sent down aforetime, and We admonish you once again to follow that which hath been revealed by Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Wise. Should anyone seek refuge with you, extend unto him your protection and betray him not. Thus doth the Pen of the Most High counsel you, as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Beware lest ye act as did the King of Islam when We came unto him at his bidding. His ministers pronounced judgement against Us with such injustice that all creation lamented and the hearts of those who are nigh unto God were consumed. The winds of self and passion move them as they will, and We found them all bereft of constancy. They are, indeed, of those that are far astray.</p>
<p>Rein in Thy pen, O Pen of the Ancient of Days, and leave them to themselves, for they are immersed in their idle fancies. Make Thou mention of the Queen, that she may turn with a pure heart unto the scene of transcendent glory, may withhold not her eyes from gazing toward her Lord, the Supreme Ordainer, and may become acquainted with that which hath been revealed in the Books and Tablets by the Creator of all mankind, He through Whom the sun hath been darkened and the moon eclipsed, and through Whom the Call hath been raised betwixt earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Turn thou unto God and say: O my Sovereign Lord! I am but a vassal of Thine, and Thou art, in truth, the King of kings. I have lifted my suppliant hands unto the heaven of Thy grace and Thy bounties. Send down, then, upon me from the clouds of Thy generosity that which will rid me of all save Thee, and draw me nigh unto Thyself. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Thy name, which Thou hast made the king of names and the manifestation of Thyself to all who are in heaven and on earth, to rend asunder the veils that have intervened between me and my recognition of the Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Dayspring of Thy Revelation. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Bounteous. Deprive me not, O my Lord, of the fragrances of the Robe of Thy mercy in Thy days, and write down for me that which Thou hast written down for Thy handmaidens who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs, and have recognized Thee, and set their hearts towards the horizon of Thy Cause. Thou art truly the Lord of the worlds and of those who show mercy the Most Merciful. Assist me, then, O my God, to remember Thee amongst Thy handmaidens, and to aid Thy Cause in Thy lands. Accept, then, that which hath escaped me when the light of Thy countenance shone forth. Thou, indeed, hast power over all things. Glory be to Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth.</p>

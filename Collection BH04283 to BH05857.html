<p>O Muhammad-Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God! In the name of the one incomparable God. From time immemorial the religious leaders have deprived the people of the world from the purpose of creation. The greatest veil hath been and continues to be the divines at the time of Divine Manifestation. Their leadership hath prevented and continueth to prevent them from turning to the supreme horizon. Consider the Shi’ih divines throughout the ages and centuries - they were vocal in remembering God, exalted be His glory, and from their pulpits would recite “Would that I were with Him” - that is, with the Qa’im. Yet when the Most Great Gate was opened and the Ancient Luminary appeared, they occupied themselves with cursing and reviling Him, and finally pronounced and carried out the death sentence against Him - such that the Bridge trembled and the Balance wept. Now Hadi of Dawlat-Abad from among the people of Sad clingeth to those same vain imaginings and hath trained and continueth to train the helpless people in the manner of the Shi’ih sect, although on the Day of Judgment he witnessed that former sect to be the most lost among all peoples. The faculty of hearing and sight hath been taken from him, and this is his recompense. We beseech God that He may guide thee to remain steadfast in such wise that the doubts of the transgressors and hints of the opposers may not deprive thee of the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this Most Great Remembrance and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds, Who hath appeared among the nations, in that Thou hast turned toward me from the direction of Thy prison and remembered me in such wise that the remembrances of all others cannot equal it. There is no God but Thee, the Protector, the All-Bountiful, the Generous. I beseech Thee to ordain for me through the Pen of Thy Command that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>In the Name of the one true God!</p>
<p>From time immemorial hath the Ever-Exalted, the All-Sufficient, made mention of His loved ones and continueth to do so. Though some may not, outwardly, have been blessed with the verses of the Supreme Pen, know thou of a certainty that their remembrance hath been uttered from the Tongue of Grandeur and recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Tablet. The gaze of Him Who is the Goal of all worlds is fixed upon hearts and deeds. Blessed is the heart that is a treasury of the pearls of the love of God, and blessed is the soul that holdeth fast and acteth according to the Book of God.</p>
<p>His honor Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, who hath ascended unto the Supreme Horizon - verily We have made mention of him in numerous Tablets. Praise be to God that the Concourse on High inhaled from him the fragrance of love for the Best-Beloved of the worlds, and there was sent down for him from the heaven of grace that which no pen can recount. Well is it with him! Happy is he! His kindred who have passed on have been and continue to be beneath the gaze of His loving-kindness. Convey to them all My greetings and give them the glad-tidings of God’s bounty. By the life of God! There hath been ordained for them that which no thing can equal. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>The people of the village, upon them be My glory and loving-kindness, must be occupied with service throughout the nights and days, and be illumined with the lights of the Day-Star of steadfastness. We beseech God to assist them with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, and to aid them to champion His Cause, the Mighty, the Wondrous. God hath forgiven thy father and thy mother. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Exalted, the Sublime, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Glorified is He, who hath manifested Himself in His splendid Glory through the power of truth, thus all that dwell in the heavens and on earth were adorned with His presence, save those who turned away from His Face, and were in truth sure to perish. Blessed is he, whom the fragrances of the Day of God hath quickened and caused to be detached from all else.</p>
<p>This is the Day of Prophetic Cry, well is it with him who, with wisdom, calleth out This exalted and mighty Name. Thus hath been prescribed unto you by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>It doth not beseem man to become a source of sedition; nay, rather, he should endeavor towards that which will cause the affairs of all that dwell on earth to prosper; thus hath the True One proclaimed, He, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving, the Compassionate.</p>
<p>Aid thou Me with good deeds - this truly behooveth ye, if ye be of them that comprehend this truth. For every day a portion hath been ordained in the Book of God. When the appointed time is come, that which He willeth is achieved. He verily reigneth over whatsoever He pleaseth.</p>
<p>Those who had cast away the Cause of God, they had verily abandoned the stronghold of justice, and are among the heedless.</p>
<p>The King of Eternity hath come for the betterment of the world. If the people but knew, they would have circumambulated His Throne. Verily, your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. They are like unto mere children, and our Lord is the Educator of the world. If We but willed, we could have seized them with a single word from Us, yet the mercy of the Lord, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Powerful, supersedes His wrath.</p>
<p>Walk in the path of thy Lord, for He is the most merciful.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who, wholly for the sake of God, calleth the people to the path of His Lord. Be thou shepherds unto His sheep and guard them from the ravening wolves. Thus instructeth thee He with Whom is the knowledge of the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Well is it with thee that thou hast forsaken thyself and turned towards the exalted realms, and attained unto the days of God and the knowledge of this Announcement, at which the mountain of corrupt desires was crushed and the Day-Star of divine guidance shone from the horizon of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the Resplendent.</p>

<p>O Muhammad Husayn! In the name of the One, the Incomparable! The chalice of tribulation hath ever been reserved for the faithful, and through trials and afflictions are the steadfast distinguished from the doubters. Yet every jewel is cherished and valued by those who recognize it. The sun hath no intimacy in the city of the blind, and pearls are counted as pebbles by those lacking discernment. Those souls who are deprived of the Merciful One’s presence by the blowing winds of trials are like autumn leaves that fall from the tree at a single gust. Know thou that trials are like winds which, after their passing, cause weak souls to fall from the divine Tree. Blessed, therefore, are those leaves that have clung so firmly to the Tree that no winds in all the world can prevent them from remaining attached to the divine Tree. Though outwardly the tribulations endured in the path of God appear as fire, their inner reality hath been and ever shall be light. I swear by the Ancient Beauty that were this blessed word to be fully expounded, all would turn their faces to the horizon of tribulation in the path of the Beloved. God, exalted be His glory, shall, God willing, aid His loved ones and draw them to the kingdom of His good-pleasure, that all may be content with His will and thankful. Be not grieved at the calamity that hath occurred, for this is a calamity wherein the Ancient Beauty Himself hath been the chief mourner. How blessed are they, for the Sovereign of grandeur and majesty, and then the angels nearest to God, pray for them. And upon thee and those with thee be glory, and praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>To Abulhusayn in Kazirun: O thou who beholdest the Everlasting One! Thy letter was presented before the Most Great Horizon and attained unto the court of the Lord of Names. Thou hadst expressed grief - yet this is the Day of supreme joy, for the Sun of Revelation hath dawned from the horizon of God’s Will and the ocean of bounty is surging. Turn away thine eyes from the ways of the world and its people, and fix thy gaze upon the movements of the leaves suspended from the Divine Lote-Tree. I swear by the Sun of grace shining from the horizon of the prison - if thou attainest unto that which hath been mentioned, neither the world nor all that is therein shall prevent thee from this supreme joy made manifest today through the appearance of the Lord of Power. This is the Day whereon “The All-Merciful is established upon the throne,” not the day of “Lord, Lord!” God willing, thou shalt taste the sweetness of the All-Merciful’s utterance. By My life! If thou findest it, it will draw thee to a station wherefrom thou shalt never be heedless, even should all the hosts of earth seek to prevent thee. With complete trust, supreme steadfastness and manifest certitude, occupy thyself with teaching God’s Cause, that perchance thou mayest guide the lost to the divine homeland and give the thirsty to drink from the living waters. His grace shall become manifest and His assistance shall reach thee. Be thou assured and be of the thankful ones. He hath imparted that which is truth and graciously bestowed it, and what is required of you is to act according to that which hath been sent down in this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet from the Supreme Pen. Give thanks unto God for having been mentioned in His presence and for having attained unto this Tablet which shall testify for thee in all the worlds of thy Lord. This is a mighty station - preserve it through His Name, the Preserver, the Ancient.</p>

<p>O Murta?a-Quli, upon him be the Glory of God! He is God, exalted be His station in wisdom and utterance. Your letter, photograph and poem were all presented before the Most Holy Court and attained the honor of being seen and heard. God willing, you will be confirmed to take from that which is not seen and that which does not exist, and that which is not seen and that which does not exist, and to capture the Fleeing One through the name of the Chosen One, and to extract the pillars from a single thing. Then nothing will remain except purification and promotion. A Persian treatise was revealed - verily it is an ocean wherein are concealed the pearls of knowledge and wisdom from God, the Lord of the worlds and Sovereign of nations. Blessed is he who brings forth its pearls from the ocean and its jewels from the treasury. Praise be to God that you have attained unto pearls of divine knowledge for which there hath been and is no likeness or equal. Whosoever possesseth these jewels hath possessed and doth possess all good things. The oceans of the elixir circle round it and the treasuries of knowledge bow down at its manifestation. Your letter testified to your acceptance and love. Blessed art thou and blessed the mother who nursed thee. The portrait of the Imam was presented through a servant and attained the most exalted station and supreme heights. We beseech God to confirm you in preserving that which He hath bestowed. Verily He hath power over all things. This is the station of steadfastness and is the greatest of all stations. Glory be upon you and upon those whom the hosts of the world could not prevent from the Ancient Lord - they arose and said: “God is our Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne.” Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>

<p>O handmaiden of God, wife of Ramadan Khan! By My Name through which hearts and minds have been attracted, thy call hath attained to the hearing of the Lord of Names, and that which thou didst present was laid before the Throne by this servant. The fragrance of thy love was inhaled by the Beloved of the world, and thy remembrances were accepted in the presence of the Intended One. Blessed is the handmaiden who hath attained to the recognition of her Lord and hath uttered His praise. And as for thy request for forgiveness for those souls thou didst mention - all have been adorned with the ornament of forgiveness and have attained unto the bounties of God. In this Night of Ridvan, the ocean of forgiveness hath embraced all. Give thanks, O My handmaiden, for this great favor. Say: O my God, my Beloved, my Lord, my Support, and my Heart’s Desire! My soul, my spirit and my tongue bear witness that Thou hast ever been One, and no peer or likeness hath been, nor ever shall be, for Thee. All tongues are powerless to describe Thee, and all hearts fall short of comprehending Thee, now and forever. O my Lord! Thou beholdest the weakness, poverty and evanescence of Thy handmaiden. This is a supplicant who hath turned toward Thy door, a poor one who hath sought the ocean of Thy riches. I beseech Thee by Thy ocean of bounty, by the sun of Thy favor and the heaven of Thy grace, to ordain from Thy Most Exalted Pen for this handmaiden of Thine that which beseemeth Thy greatness. God willing, thou shalt drink of the choice wine of utterance that lieth hidden within the words of the All-Merciful and attain unto that which God hath desired for thee.</p>

<p>O Mulla Baqir, son of his honor Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin! The Most Holy, Most Holy Grace of God hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of your Lord, the Most Merciful. Verily thou seest it embodied in human form. Thus hath the matter been ordained. O people! Gather ye around this table which We have sent down in truth, and be not like those who turned away from it. Thus doth the Ancient Pen command you, for it hath power over all things. Say: O concourse of polytheists! From whom do ye flee? Have ye found for yourselves any helper or protector? By My life! There is no refuge for anyone save under the shade that hath been extended in the name of God. Say: Cast behind you your vain imaginings. This is your Lord, the Most Merciful, Who hath come with the truth - He Who was promised to you in a Tablet that was preserved in truth. Follow not those who have joined partners with God, nor turn to him who hath disbelieved in God and been an obstinate oppressor. Believe in God Who created you and sustained you - God sufficeth as a Helper. Say: We desire for you naught but the eternal life, yet ye have chosen for yourselves the abyss of wrath. Why do ye not understand this utterance? Grieve thou not over anything. Put thy trust in God - verily He is near to the sincere ones. Remember thou My tribulation and imprisonment and trials, then rejoice in the manifestations of My majesty and grandeur. Verily thy Lord remembereth him who hath uttered His remembrance - He is merciful to His servants. If harm befalleth thee in My path, grieve not. By My life! Your names and whatsoever hath befallen you have been inscribed in the Tablet, and God thy Lord sufficeth as a Reckoner. Remember thou those who are with thee from Us - those who have taken the Most Merciful as their Helper.</p>

Exalted is the All-Bestowing One Who sent it after He revealed it. He, verily, is the All-Choosing One. O people of the earth! Hearken unto the call of God from the direction of Paradise - the spot which hath been named at one time the Most Great Prison and at another the Most Exalted Paradise, and it hath other names with God, the Possessor of all things, in the Scriptures and Tablets. Doth that which ye possess prevent you from the Most Glorious Horizon, and doth the world occupy you from turning toward God, the Creator of heaven? Make it clear and be not of them that err. By the life of God! The world and whatsoever is therein of kings and subjects, of gold and silver, and whatsoever is above them and below them, and whatsoever attracteth the eyes - all shall pass away. Take ye from it according to your needs, then leave what exceedeth. Thus hath the Sovereign of Verses commanded you from this station. O concourse of princes! Turn ye unto the poor. God hath created you and them from one thing. Make ye in your possessions a portion for them. This will profit you throughout ages and centuries. Spend some of what God hath bestowed upon you through His grace - thereby will that which ye possess increase. The Mother Book with Him doth testify to this. Thus hath My tongue spoken and My verses been revealed as a grace from Me upon thee, that thou mayest be of those unto whom the Tongue of Grandeur and Glory hath borne witness. Read thou the Book of God, then read it unto those on whose faces thou findest the radiance of the All-Merciful. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the bounty of their Lord, the Possessor of existence.</p>

This is a remembrance from Us to him who turned toward the Qiblih of the lovers but was prevented by the idolaters from attaining the presence of the Throne. Thereby was he consumed by the fire of separation. Say: O people! He hath come from the heaven of eternity with His Most Great Name to draw you nigh unto God, the Lord of the Day of Meeting, yet ye denied Him after He came with proof and testimony. I know not by what cord ye hold fast, nor to what hem ye cling, O company of the wicked! Do ye imagine for yourselves any place of refuge? Nay, by the Luminary of the horizons! None hath any protector this Day save those who have turned to the Dayspring of Revelation and detached themselves from every idolatrous infidel. Thus doth the Pen of Revelation make mention of thee, from thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Grieve not that thou wert prevented from attaining His presence. God hath ordained for thee the reward of those who attained the presence of the Throne. He, verily, is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. We bear witness for thee of the reward of those who attained His presence, heard His call, and beheld His countenance. Rejoice in what God hath testified for thee in this Tablet, from which the faces of the righteous have been illumined. Thou didst enter the City through love of thy Lord, and departed through what the hands of the infidels who denied God, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning, had wrought. Make mention of God amongst His servants - this is the most excellent of all deeds before the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Mention of you and what befell you hath been sent down in various Tablets from thy Lord, the Revealer of verses. Be thou assured through the grace of thy Lord. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou through Whom the horizon of Revelation was illumined and the earth and heavens were made to shine! Thus have We addressed thee and revealed for thee verses from this Pen at which all other pens were thunderstruck.</p>

The breezes of the All-Merciful have wafted from the direction of the All-Glorious, and by them are attracted the hearts of all who have believed and fear God. Say: The Spirit hath once again descended from the Most Exalted Horizon with My Most Glorious Name, and this is better for you, O people, than the kingdom of earth and heaven. Say: Do ye dispute with the Ancient Beauty concerning that which He witnessed in the most remote dwelling places near the Divine Lote-Tree, when He beheld of the greatest signs of His own Self? By God! The Mighty Spirit inspired Him in the Most Glorious Pavilion with mysteries that can neither be witnessed nor seen. O Muhammad! Step forth from behind the veils by My sovereignty that encompasseth all created things, and say: “Glorified be my Lord, the Most High!” Leave all beings behind thee, then move thy tongue in praise of My Self, and fear not him who hath disbelieved and transgressed. Say: O people of the Bayan! Do ye dispute with Him Who hath come unto you with a proof wherewith all who are in the highest heavens could not prevail? Fear God and be of the righteous. O people! Open your eyes that ye may behold the Kingdom of God above your heads and His omnipotence before you, and be not of them who turned away and forsook Him. Hold fast unto the cord of God and the handle of His Cause, and differ not in that which appeareth from His presence, for verily He hath appeared with truth in the midst of noon-tide, and none shall deny Him save every heedless one who hath gone astray and been blinded.

Thus hath the matter been decreed by One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. And remember the Bayan, when We created it anew and sent it unto the chief of the oppressors. By My life! We breathed into it a spirit from Our presence and manifested it through might and power, and dispatched it like a mountain of fire, such that neither the hosts nor the might of those who disbelieved in the Lord of the worlds could hold it back. Were We to command it, it would by itself confront all who are in the heavens and on earth. Say: Verily my Lord ordaineth what He pleaseth and doeth what He willeth. He bestoweth power upon whomsoever He pleaseth among His creation. Verily, He is powerful over all things. It behooveth every soul to be detached from all that hath been created on earth and to be ready for God’s command. He is indeed of the people of Baha, inscribed in a preserved Tablet. Blessed is he who calleth the people unto God and guideth them to the straight path. I am verily the path of God amidst all else and His sovereignty over all who dwell on earth. Leave those who have turned away from the Cause, and take this wondrous Tablet. Should you find one who is receptive, turn to him and remind him of thy Lord’s sovereignty; and should you find one who turneth away, leave him and turn to the Lord of the worlds. Beware lest anyone’s rejection sadden thee. Be pure-hearted for thy Lord’s sake. He will suffice thee and aid His servants who turn unto Him.</p>

Make mention when thou didst enter the City and the hosts of the wicked seized the prison gate. We blinded their eyes and brought thee into the seat of the Throne through power and sovereignty, until thou didst attain the presence and didst hear the call of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Thine eyes were solaced by the meeting with God and His beauty, and thou didst attain unto that which most of the people of the land were debarred from, and didst drink the choice wine of utterance from the lips of the All-Merciful and the Kawthar of purity from this Revelation whereby faces became radiant and eyes were consoled. Blessed is he who hath turned with his heart toward the Qiblih of the lovers and hath attained unto the lights of the Countenance whereby the horizons were illumined. Thereupon did Nabil-i-Qabl-’Ali circle round the Throne after We had admitted him into the prison. Verily thy Lord is He Who ordaineth what He willeth. We gave him leave to seclude himself in the vicinity of his Lord for a certain number of days as a token of grace from Us. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Forgiving. Make thou mention of My loved ones on My behalf, then remind them of what thou hast known and witnessed. Thus hast thou been bidden by thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We have named thee with Our name, the All-Merciful. Strive thou that there may be manifested through thee that which We have desired from this exalted Name. And when thou receivest the Tablet, place it upon thy face and say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having admitted me into the seat of the throne of Thy grandeur and for having revealed Thyself unto me through the lights of Thy countenance. I beseech Thee by Thy Self to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Compelling.</p>

Fear ye God, and spread not corruption in the land, nor follow any rejected idolater. Know thou that at the outset of this Revelation We forbade the servants from tyranny and wickedness, and from the shedding of blood. Yet they abandoned that which they were commanded and committed that which they were forbidden, and they are at this moment unaware. Say: O people! By God the Truth, I have come to you from the Orient of the Cause for unity, did ye but know it. Say: If ye desire to strive against anyone, then strive against your own selves - this would be better for you, could ye but understand. We ordained victory through the Bayan, did ye but know it. Thus hath the Command been sent down in all the Tablets, but the people do not comprehend. Hearken thou unto My call and shun those who have disbelieved and associated partners with Him Who revealed the Bayan by His binding, transcendent and inevitable command. Say: O people! Fear ye God and commit not that which causeth the hearts of the denizens of the most exalted Paradise and honored servants to burn. We desire naught from you and summon you to that which is better for you than all that was and shall be. Be not silent in remembrance of thy Lord. Arise to praise His Self amidst the heavens and the earth, that perchance the people may arise from the slumber of heedlessness and become aware.

Say: O people! If ye believed in Ali aforetime, by what proof do ye slay Him Who hath come to you with the Kingdom of God and His dominion, then with God’s power and His mercy which hath preceded all worlds? Nay, by the Self of the All-Merciful! They believed not in the Beauty of the All-Glorious and denied God from time immemorial and were among the idolaters. Say: O people! We clothed some of Our servants with the garment of names in the kingdom of creation that they might aid their Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, in this Beauty Who hath appeared once again with His Most Glorious Name, and that they might be among those endued with certitude. Yet when they witnessed the spread of their names, they became veiled by leadership and turned away from the Beauty of Divine Unity and were among the heedless. Thus have We recounted the mysteries with brevity that the righteous might become aware thereof and learn of what hath befallen the Beauty of the Chosen One in these grievous days. And thou, O servant, look not unto names and their glory, but look unto Him from Whom was manifested the Kingdom of names, and be of them that know. Beware lest thou consort with them who have denied God, thy Lord and the Lord of all things and the Lord of all creation. But consort with them on whose foreheads hath been inscribed by the Pen of Eternity: “By God, this is of the people of Baha who hath embarked upon the Crimson Ark in the name of his Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and hath detached himself from the world.” Thus have We commanded thee in truth that thou mayest be among the successful ones.

Then I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, by those who were martyred in Thy path and who advanced to the place of sacrifice in Thy love, O Lord of all beings, and by the light of Thy Manifestation whereby Paradise trembled with longing for Thy presence, to assist me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Then grant me the good of this world and the world to come. Verily Thou art the Lord of the Mighty Throne and the Exalted Seat. O my God! Send Thy blessings upon Thy loved ones and chosen ones who broke not Thy Covenant, who took the cup of steadfastness in Thy Name and drank therefrom in spite of Thine enemies and the divines of Thy earth who disbelieved in Thee and in Thy signs and disputed Thy proof. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Powerful.</p>

<p>O loved ones of God! Be not of those who, when the breezes of might blow, say “We believe in God, the Lord of all creation,” but when trials come are so shaken that the fire of divine unity is extinguished in their breasts. Hearken unto My call from this Prison and stand firm in the Cause of God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, in such wise that neither trials nor tribulations shall hold you back. In these days when darkness hath encompassed all regions, it behooveth you to shine forth with the lights of the countenance of your chosen Lord. Know ye that death cometh to all, and each hath his destined portion. Its arrow pierceth and its sword is sharp. It altereth all conditions, and wealth availeth not against it. This being so, it behooveth every seeing one to detach himself from the world and all that is therein, and every wise one to turn away from it and all that is upon it, and to turn with his whole being and essence toward God, his Lord, the Sovereign of earth and heaven. Consider, then remember what ye have heard from the chosen ones. By God! Had the world any worth or station, they would not have abandoned it and chosen tribulation for themselves in the path of their Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High. And We, despite the afflictions We endure, such as no eye in all time hath witnessed the like thereof, would not exchange an atom of these trials for all the treasures of the earth. We are content with what God hath ordained for Us. Would that My loved ones might taste the sweetness of this Kawthar which floweth from this Pen in this darksome night! By God! It is the quickener of all worlds. O thou servant! Drink, and fear not the oppressors. Say: All praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Summoner! O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. The letter of the honored Afnan T.Q., upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, which he sent to thee was read in the presence of this Wronged One. Through its mention, the gate of bounty was opened, and through its heart’s yearning, the ocean of mercy surged. From the horizons of its words shone forth the lights of the Day-Star of divine love, and from the heart of each of its letters blazed the fire of longing. His letter was a scroll of praise and a book of faithfulness. The Tree of Faithfulness has ever yielded and will continue to yield choice fruits. These appear through God’s grace, the Lord of all worlds. By God’s life! Through the presence of his letter, God ordained for him in the Crimson Book, from His Most Exalted Pen, that which none has discovered save His own Self. As regards his turning towards the Desired One, outwardly there exist two obstacles: if he shows reserve towards the new governor, it will cause offense, while if he continues as before, he will be prevented from attaining the presence. However, God is witness and all atoms testify that specially for him the reward of attaining the presence has been revealed in the Book and remains fixed and established through God’s will. Let him rejoice in this clear remembrance. He has been and remains oriented towards Us. Whenever time permits and wisdom allows, let him turn towards Us. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist him in what He loves and is pleased with, to reinforce him with the hosts of the seen and unseen, and to draw him near to Him in all conditions. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. The glory from Us be upon him and upon those with him and those who love him and heed his word in this clear Cause.</p>

<p>Thou beholdest, O my God, how bewildered in their drunkenness are Thy servants who have turned back from Thy beauty and caviled at what hath been sent down from the right hand of the throne of Thy majesty. Thou didst come, O my God, in the clouds of Thy spirit and Thine utterance, and lo, the entire creation shook and trembled, and the limbs of them who repudiated Thy testimonies were made to quiver, O Thou in Whose grasp is the lordship of all things!</p>
<p>Thou art He, O my God, Who hast summoned all men to turn in the direction of Thy mercy, and called them unto the horizon of Thy grace and bounties. None, however, heeded Thy call, except such as have forsaken all things save Thee, and hastened unto the Day-Spring of Thy beauty, and the Dawning-Place of Thine inspiration and Thy revelation.</p>
<p>Thou knowest, O my God, that none can be found on the face of the earth to remember Thee except them. Thou seest how the oppressors among Thy creatures have laid hold on them. Some, O my God, have shed their blood in Thy path, others have abandoned their homes and set their faces towards the seat of Thy throne, and were hindered from stepping into the court of Thy great glory, while still others have been cast into prison and are at the mercy of the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p>I implore Thee, O Thou Who holdest in Thy hands the reins of unconstrained power, to succor them through the wondrous potency of Thy might. Misery, O my Lord, hath taken hold on them in Thy path, exalt them by the power of Thy sovereignty; and weariness hath afflicted them in their love for Thee, render them victorious, through Thy strength and Thine omnipotence, over Thine enemies.</p>
<p>Aware as I am, O my God, that Thou hast decreed for them that which excelleth whatsoever is in Thy heaven and on Thy earth, I still cherish the desire that Thou mayest behold them in Thy days exalted and honored by Thy creatures. Supreme art Thou over Thy creation. All are held within Thy grasp, and lie prisoned in the hollow of Thy hand. No God is there but Thee, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O handmaiden of God! Hear thou the voice of the Wronged One. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of sanctification that each of His members, each of His elements, each of His veins, and each of His hairs hath testified and doth testify to the oneness of God, His singleness, His bounty, His sovereignty, His power, His might, and His all-encompassing nature. He hath not uttered a word except that word hath been as the greatest elixir for mankind, and its purpose hath been the salvation of humanity and their comfort, glory and exaltation. Nevertheless, heedless ears are prevented from hearkening to the call of the Lord of creation and are deprived of comprehending it. Finally, through sheer tyranny they seized Him and imprisoned Him in the most ruinous of the world’s lands. Such is the state of the heedless souls and their station. Observe how many distinguished ones and learned men are seen today intoxicated with the wine of pride, such that they have turned away from the Truth and are debarred and deprived from the Sun of Reality which shineth at its meridian. And how many handmaidens have adorned themselves with the ornament of divine knowledge and have turned with heart and soul and spirit toward His horizon. Verily, grace is in the hand of God. He ordaineth whatsoever He willeth for whomsoever He willeth. None can question His doings. He is indeed the Ruler, the One Who doeth as He pleaseth.</p>

Verily, there is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We wish to recount unto thee tidings of him who was named Mahdi in the Crimson Book from My Most Exalted Pen. He traversed land and sea in his longing to attain the presence of God until he entered the shore of the right-hand valley in the blessed crimson spot. We called out to him from behind the pavilions of grandeur, and when he heard it, the sweetness of the call so overwhelmed him that he was transformed. Then We shed upon him the lights of the countenance, and when he beheld the Most Great Sign, he surrendered his spirit at the advent of his Lord, the Lord of all beings. Days passed, then We proceeded to the sepulcher, and when We arrived We stood before the grave and said: “O thou who didst race in the arena of the love of God! The fragrance of thy Lord’s robe, the Lord of all names, stirred thee until thou didst seek the Most Exalted Horizon to attain the presence of the Throne and stand before the Gate. Now We see thee sleeping while the Beloved hath come and remembereth thee with a remembrance at which the clouds weep. I testify that thou didst drink the choice wine of mystical knowledge from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and didst hear the call and respond and turn and hasten until thou didst enter the noble station by the leave of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Blessed art thou, again blessed art thou, for thou didst remain faithful to God’s Covenant when most of His servants broke it and most of His creation cast it behind them. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hearkened to thy words concerning the Cause of God, thy Beloved, and found solace in thy company, and heard with submission and contentment what thou didst utter regarding the Cause of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Verily we are God’s and unto Him shall we return.”</p>

The Wronged One doth testify at this moment that whatsoever was sent down aforetime from the heaven of the Divine Will was in truth sent down for My Own Self, yet most of the people remain heedless. Through My Will hath God’s Will been manifested, yet the people have denied this mighty Cause.</p>

The exalted one, upon him be My glory, and his kindred have ever been and shall ever remain beneath the sheltering care of God, exalted be His glory. By My life! He hath indeed taken his seat upon the throne of glory in a station where tongues and pens fall short of describing it. This is of the bounty of his Lord unto him - verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Be thou at all times filled with supreme joy and occupied with the remembrance of God. There hath befallen you in the path of God that which hath caused every seeing eye to weep, every tongue to lament, and every heart to be filled with utmost grief.

Be thou thankful unto thy Lord for this enduring blessing and this eternal, everlasting table. In every age and dispensation, when the Dawning-Places of Revelation and the Manifestations of divine inspiration rent asunder the veil and appeared from the horizon of the divine Will, the people arose in protest and opposition. Verily, they are accounted among the most lost in the perspicuous Book.

This is a Call in yearning to hear which the hosts of Revelation and Inspiration have perished - to this doth your Lord, the Great, the All-Knowing, bear witness. Recognize ye this bounty, then give thanks unto your Lord, the Most Merciful, at all times. Beware lest ye be frightened by what ye behold of the ranks.

Come ye forth and arise, O people of Baha, with illumined hearts. Thus doth the Lord of Names command you, as He hath established Himself upon the throne with a sovereignty that hath encompassed those in the heavens and earth. Thus hath the sun of bounty shone forth from the horizon of generosity as a favor from Us unto you, that ye may be among the thankful ones. By God!

<p>He is the Hearer, the Answerer</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! We have mentioned thee time and again, and have sent down for thee that which hath diffused the fragrances of utterance throughout all contingent being. Thy Lord, the All-Merciful, beareth witness to this, and He, verily, hath power over all things. We console thee in what hath befallen thee and beseech God to pour forth upon thee patience from His presence - and He is the All-Patient. He hath commanded all to show forth beautiful patience. The world and whatsoever existeth therein is evanescent, as beareth witness to this He Who is the Possessor of existence from His praiseworthy station. All in the world have witnessed and continue to witness change and variation, yet despite this they remain heedless and veiled. Beseech ye God that He may make His servants aware and grant them a portion from the ocean of knowledge. He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty.</p>

That honoured one should peruse it and send it to the aforementioned Siyyid. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid him to remember Him and serve His Cause, and to ordain for him every good thing which He hath sent down in His Book. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Possessor of great favor. We make mention of the loved ones and counsel all to observe wisdom. Wisdom is the cause of the exaltation of the Word and the preservation of being. All must recognize its worth and station and hold fast unto it. Peace and glory be upon thee and upon God’s sincere servants. Praise be to God, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance and art present before the Throne! Hearken unto the Call from this most exalted, most holy and most glorious Quarter. God, there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

We give thee glad tidings at this hour of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds, and We beseech Him to ordain for thee that which shall bring solace to thine eyes and the eyes of thy loved ones, and to send down upon thee from the heaven of bounty a mercy from His presence and a blessing from His side. He is verily the Hearer, the Answerer. By the life of God! That which none save the All-Knowing, the All-Informed hath knowledge of hath been ordained for thee. When thou attainest unto the Tablet of God and its trace, say:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Desire of the world, for having guided me unto Thy path and the court of Thy chosen ones and the Dawning-Place of Thy revelation and the Dayspring of Thine inspiration, and for having given me to drink of the choice wine of Thy utterance from the cup of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Most Bountiful Name, and by Thy Most Generous Name, and by Thy Name through which Thou hast illumined the world and guided the peoples, and by the rustling of the Tree of Thy utterance on the Mount, and by the manifestations of the lights of the Lord of Revelation, to open before my face the door of Thy munificence and Thy generosity. O my Lord! Thou seest me in all conditions clinging fast unto Thee, turning unto Thee, and turning away from all else besides Thee. Thou hast verily strengthened me to shatter the idols through Thy power and might and to rend asunder the veils through the finger of power by Thy command and Thy will. Ordain for me that which will exalt me amongst Thy servants and make me mighty through Thy Name and willing through Thy Will. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest.

<p>After the matter of the land was mentioned verbally to Jenab-i-Amin, it is stated that the intention was for this matter to be accomplished in secret, although some disclosed it. However, God doeth whatsoever He willeth. Verily His Will hath prevailed over the worlds.</p>

However this was not intended for these days, as the means for it are not available - that is, no soul who would arise to accomplish this matter and convey it is to be seen. It remaineth concealed within the veils of the unseen until such time as God shall manifest it through His command. However Jenab-i-Ismu’llah Mahdi submitted the details and mentioned that person’s intention and acceptance of whatsoever would appear from God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.

We have sent down unto thee aforetime verses manifest and clear, whereof a single word sufficeth all who are in the heavens and on earth, and We have now revealed unto thee this Tablet as a token of Our grace unto thee and unto Our near-serving servants. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou hast recognized the path of truth and held fast to the cord of God, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Soon shall the world pass away, and thou shalt find thyself in exaltation. By God! Were those on earth to behold thee, they would fall prostrate upon their faces. This, verily, is the evident truth. Make mention of thy Lord amongst the servants, that perchance they may inhale the fragrance of the divine garment and turn unto the Qiblih of them that know. Say: O people! Do ye deny Him Whose countenance hath dawned from the horizon of the will of your Lord, the Most Merciful, and Who hath come from the heaven of utterance with a manifest proof? Would ye slay Him Who hath sacrificed His soul in the path of God and made known unto you what the Most High, the Most Great, hath desired for you? Fear ye God, and make not His Cause a mockery among you. Turn ye unto the Most Merciful with spirit and with fragrance. This is better for you, did ye but know. Think ye that what ye possess will profit you? Nay, by My resplendent Beauty! Think ye the world will enrich you? Nay, by the Self of Baha, were ye of them that are certain! Open your eyes: verily He is before your faces, and seeth what ye do. He desireth for you naught save that which draweth you nigh unto God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Thus have We caused to rain down from the clouds of thy Lord’s will the waters of meaning and utterance, that there might grow thereby in the hearts of them that turn unto Him the plants of wisdom and exposition.

Be thankful that the Ancient Beauty makes mention of you, having found from you the fragrance of the love of God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Grieve not over anything, but trust in Him in all matters. Verily, He loves those who put their trust in Him. Blessed are you for having given protection to him who sought your shelter, and for being among the beneficent ones.

Let not the might of those who disbelieved disturb you, nor the intimations of the polytheists who, when the Truth came, denied the Lord of the worlds. Arise and be steadfast in the love of God in such wise that the whisperings of the deniers will not cause you to slip. Whoso is steadfast in His Cause is among the most exalted of creation - thus hath it been sent down in a preserved Tablet.

Blessed are you for having turned to the Countenance after every deceitful sinner turned away. Hold fast to the cord of God and associate with His loved ones, then turn away from those who turn away. Blessed are you and your mother who believed in God, the Single, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. O my handmaiden!

I testify that this Day is Thy Day, wherein Thou hast manifested what Thou didst promise unto Thy servants. I beseech Thee to assist me to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee and to serve Thy Cause in such wise that the doubts of any remote scholar shall not withhold me. O Jafar! Observe, then call to mind when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, appeared - the divines of idolatry, the doctors of the Torah, and the people of the Gospel and the Psalms turned away from Him. And when We sent forth the Spirit, there rose against Him Annas, who was the most learned of the divines of his age in his country, and who pronounced judgment against the Spirit with such injustice that all things lamented, and beyond them every discerning soul. We seal Our utterance with that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an through His words: “No apostle cometh unto them but they laugh him to scorn.” By God! The first to deride Him were the divines of the earth and its doctors. The Books of God, both past and present, and that which hath been sent down from My Most Exalted Pen at this moment, bear witness unto this. Thy name hath been presented before the Prisoner, and He hath revealed for thee this Perspicuous Tablet. When thou art blessed with it and perceivest the fragrance of the utterance of the All-Merciful, arise and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Glory of the world! I testify that Thou hast appeared and manifested that which Thou didst desire with a sovereignty that neither the hosts of the world nor the opposition of the nations who violated God’s Covenant and Testament and were numbered among the deniers in My wondrous Book could prevent.</p>

I beseech Thee by Thy Prophets and Thy chosen ones, and by Him through Whom Thou didst open the door of Thy mercy unto the faces of Thy servants and through Whom the Sun of Unity shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy Cause, to aid me to remain steadfast in Thy love. Then open, O my God, before my face the door of Thy bounty and bestowal. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thou art, in truth, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>All the loved ones in that land are remembered before the Wronged One, and for each we seek and beseech that which will cause the exaltation of God’s Cause, glorified be His majesty. Peace be upon thee and upon God’s sincere servants.</p>

We have turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison and have remembered thee with that which was a light for the darkness of the earth, a Kawthar for all who thirst, and a spirit for the bodies of the worlds. Glory be to him who attains to My utterance, and exaltation to him who arises to serve My firm and mighty Cause. Rejoice thou in this Most Great Remembrance, then give thanks to thy Lord, the One Who rules over all who are in the heavens and the earths.</p>
<p>O Fadlu’llah! Praise be to God that thou hast attained to the grace of God [and thy remembrance hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen]. Blessed is the soul that hath today attained to this greatest bounty. Whatsoever thou hast done in the path of God is evident and manifest before God. Thy reward is with Him Who created thee and fashioned thee and aided thee in what thou didst accomplish on this straight path. In the days of life, whatsoever thou hast done in truth returneth unto God. Praise be to God it hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. If thou wert to arise to offer thanks for this blessed word which hath shone forth from the Dayspring of the mouth of the Divine Will, for as long as the kingdom and the heavenly kingdom endure, it would verily be as naught. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the world and Desire of the nations, for having enabled me to recognize Thee and serve Thy chosen ones who have cast away the world in Thy days and turned to Thee in such wise that their blood was shed in Thy path. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by them, to make me in all conditions steadfast in this Cause whereby the feet of the mystics have slipped. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>

Aid thou the Cause of God through wisdom and utterance, lest the clamor of those who have turned away be raised when the Countenance of the Ancient One came with a manifest light. Know thou that victory lies in teaching the Cause and in steadfastness in that which thou hast been commanded by the One Who is the Strong, the Ancient. Beware lest the affairs of men prevent thee from Him Who hath come with the truth with mighty sovereignty.

Yet until now all remain heedless save whom God hath willed - thy Lord, the Lord of all worlds. Thy name hath come before the Wronged One. We have revealed for thee that which all the treasures of those in the heavens and earth cannot equal. Say: O God, Most Generous, Most Merciful! I testify to Thy oneness and singleness, and I beseech from Thee that which endureth through the eternity of Thy names and attributes. Thou art the Possessor of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and unseen. O Lord! A poor one hath turned toward the ocean of Thy wealth, and a supplicant hath approached the door of Thy generosity. Deprive him not. Thou art He through Whose bounty all atoms of creation bear witness, and Thou art He to Whose giving all created things confess. This servant of Thine hath detached himself from all else and hath clung to the cord of Thy bounty and the hem of Thy generosity, and in all conditions gazeth toward Thee and is thankful to Thee. If Thou answerest, Thou art praised in Thy command, and if Thou rejectest, Thou art obeyed in Thy decree. Thou art He before Whose manifestation all are seen as powerless and wanting. O Generous One!

Abandon that which the populace posses and what Thou seest today. Proclaim unto the people the glad tidings that arose and shone forth from the horizon of God, the Lord of all creation. Say: By God!

Deprive not yourselves of the Lord of all names in these days through vain imaginings. Strive that ye may attain unto that which diffuseth the fragrance of the divine mercy.

Verily He forgets not His servants who have presented themselves before His Face with humility and turned unto Him. Blessed art thou for having attained the presence of the Youth in days wherein the sun of thy Lord’s beauty hath shone forth from behind the veil. Beware lest thou forget what thou hast witnessed of God’s favor and power; then make mention of what thou hast seen amongst the company of the loved ones, that they may arise from the slumber of passion and remember their Lord at eventide and dawn. Guard thyself and follow not those who have disbelieved in God on a Day wherein He hath established Himself upon the throne and set up the balance of justice and fixed the Path, and all have presented themselves for the reckoning. Thus have We made mention of thee in this Tablet that it may attract thy heart and the hearts of the loved ones. And glory be upon thee and upon those who have arisen for the Cause of God and whom no trepidation hath seized.</p>

<p>In the Name of the One True God! The effulgences of the Sun of the horizon of Revelation have appeared and become manifest in the form of these words: We have enjoined wisdom upon all the loved ones, that all may partake of and receive their portion from the wine of the will of the King of Oneness. In this Most Great Revelation, the heaven of wisdom hath been raised up and adorned and illumined with the stars of utterance and expression. Therefore all must act according to that which God hath ordained, and from no one must any deed appear that would cause corruption. Verily He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Ere long the fire of the Divine Word shall ignite all. For no one hath there been nor shall there be any escape. Well is it with that soul who in this Most Great Day hath attained unto the good-pleasure of God and from whom hath appeared that which would cause the reformation of the world. By My life! All that is visible shall soon be rendered non-existent and perish, while that which appeareth for the love of God hath been and shall forever remain. Most of the people are weak, while the True One, glorified and exalted be He, is powerful and mighty. However, He hath loved and gazed upon His Name the Most Merciful. Therefore hath He commanded all with wisdom and kindness and compassion. Otherwise, with but a single word would He have seized them all. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Give thanks unto God for His having turned unto thee the Face from the direction of the Prison, and for His remembering thee with this wondrous remembrance. By the life of God! Nothing can equal His remembrance, and it shall profit thee in this world and in the world to come. There is none other God but Him, the Ordainer, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>I bear witness that there is none other God but Him, in acknowledgment of His oneness and in recognition of His grandeur and His uniqueness. And prayers and peace be upon His Prophets and His Messengers who arose to serve His Cause and aid His Faith, until the paths culminated in the Most Great Path and the Messengers were sealed with the Most Noble Prophet, through whom the countenance of the world became radiant and that which was hidden in God’s knowledge, the Lord of Eternity, was made manifest. And upon His family and His companions who aided the Faith of God with their wealth and their souls and strove until the Faith was made manifest, though the infidels detest it.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter of that honored master arrived. Praise be to God, the fragrance of love was inhaled therefrom. God willing, may you ever drink from the choice wine of knowledge and receive your portion from the fountain of wisdom. In all circumstances one must be mindful of wisdom. This evanescent servant beseeches and implores God, exalted be His glory, to aid and grant that honored one whatsoever befits His bounty. Verily the servant asks and He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Should the means for return to your homeland become available and should you honor it with your presence, there is and has been no objection. Your attention and devotion are evident and clear. God, exalted be His glory, will grant the reward. Verily He has power over all things and is worthy to answer.

<p>O My Afnan! Upon you be My peace and My glory. You were mentioned before the Wronged One previously, and at this moment when the fragrance of utterance has been wafted throughout creation through that which the Tongue of Grandeur has spoken: “The Kingdom belongs to God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.” You have attained to the mention of God and His praise in the earliest days. We beseech Him to aid you with the hosts of inspiration and to send down upon you from the heaven of His bounty a blessing from His presence and a mercy from His own Self. Verily, there is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all return unto Him.</p>

I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy utterance and the potency of Thy will, to assist Thy Afnan at all times in such wise that the fragrance of Thy Word may be diffused among the religions. Thou seest him, O my God, having taken for himself a station near to Thee. Ordain for him every good that was in Thy Book. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest through Thy word “Be” and it is.</p>
<p>We make mention of the son in this station and give him the glad-tidings of God’s mercy, the Lord of existence. The glory from Us be upon you and upon him and upon those who hearken to thy word and love thee for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>

All these matters have been revealed in the divine Tablets in Persian, that all may understand and none be deprived in His days of the light of His countenance, nor be barred by people’s vain imaginings from the river of mercy.

We beseech God to assist you in that which is befitting. We ask Him to protect you from the evil of your enemies, to aid you with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, and to exalt you through His Name amongst His servants. Verily He has power over all things and is worthy to answer prayers. Glory be upon you and upon those who love you and remember you for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>

<p>O Ali-Muhammad, upon thee be the Glory of God! In My Name, the Manifest, the Trustworthy! Today the Book crieth out with the most exalted call that the Mother Book hath come, all things herald the appearance of the Lord of all beings, and the Concourse on High speaketh this word:</p>
<p>For the veiled ones - death! For the frozen ones - pain!</p>
<p>The King of Kings of days hath come, that Hidden One by name hath come!</p>
<p>And so forth as hath issued from My tongue in the kingdom of Mine utterance. O Ali-Muhammad, upon thee be My glory! We made mention of thee before, and at this hour with a mention whereby the hearts of them that are nigh have been attracted. Beware lest the veils of names hold thee back from their Creator, and the colors of the world from its Fashioner. Cast away what is with the people, then turn thy face to the Kaaba of My loving-kindness and say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me and mentioned me and illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Book whereby Thou hast guided the peoples, to confirm me in that which befitteth Thy Revelation and Thy establishment upon the throne of Thy mighty Name. O my Lord! Aid me to be so steadfast that the veils of the ignorant ones and the allusions of the clamorous ones shall not prevent me. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I beseech Thee by Thy bounty that hath encompassed existence and by the light of Thy Cause whereby hearts and minds have been illumined, to make me steadfast in Thy love, firm in Thy Cause, established in Thy praise and unwavering in Thy remembrance. Thou art indeed the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We make mention of thy wife who hath turned with her heart to her Lord. We beseech God to preserve her through His power and sovereignty. He is verily the Preserver, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>

He, verily, from within the Most Great Prison, summoneth the peoples unto His holy kingdom, the Mighty, the Luminous, and remembereth the loved ones of God for having turned unto the Dawning-Place of Revelation - they are indeed among the triumphant. When thou hast attained unto the Tablet of thy Lord and found from it the fragrance of God, say: O my God! All praise be unto Thee for having turned Thy gaze toward me. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name to make me steadfast in Thy love in such wise that neither the veils of them that have been heedless of Thy remembrance in Thy days, nor the onslaught of them that have manifested oppression in Thy realm, shall withhold me.

Make them, then, to be stars in the heaven of Thy detachment, that through them may be manifested that which shall serve as evidence of the sanctification of Thy commandments among Thy creatures and the glorification of Thy laws between Thy earth and heaven.

Blessed is the ear that turneth toward it and heareth therefrom its sighing and lamentation at what hath befallen its Planter from the hosts of the malicious ones. Thus hath the matter been decreed on the Day of the Covenant. Then hearken, O My handmaiden, unto My sweetest melodies once again, that they may purify thee from all else besides Me and draw thee nigh unto My presence and bring thee to My dawning-place wherein the lights of My beauty have shone forth from the direction of My throne. Then take in My name the cup of My mercy and the chalice of My favor, then drink thereof thyself and give to drink unto My handmaidens that they may be drawn to My direction and be purified from mentions in their search for My remembrance and be detached from all things in their longing for My presence. Then arise to remember and praise Me amongst My handmaidens. Thus doth command thee in this prison the Sovereign of thy Lord’s will, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

It beseemeth not one like thee to turn unto mere indications, but rather unto God, the Revealer of verses. He calleth thee to the supreme horizon. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the Loving. Ask those who were present before the Throne when the ocean of verses surged. By My life! They are sent down in such wise that all in the realm are powerless to compose their like, yet most of the people know not. Leave behind all that is with the people and arise to serve thy Lord. Say: O people! By God, that which had never appeared in creation hath now appeared, and the All-Merciful hath come with the kingdom of proof. Turn ye unto Him and follow not every veiled learned one. This is the Source from which all knowledge hath appeared and every determined matter. Say: Beware lest desire prevent you from the supreme horizon, or what the people possess bar you from God, the Lord of existence. Know thou the worth of these days, then seek the grace of thy Lord, the All-Compelling over those in the unseen and the visible. It behoveth thee to manifest that whereby thy mention shall be established in Our Preserved Tablet. Grieve not on account of the people and their clamor.

There hath come before Us a letter from thee, and We have answered thee with a reply that shall bring gladness to the eyes of those who have turned unto God and then unto the sanctuary of nearness do turn, who hear the melodies of Paradise and gaze upon the countenance of Beauty. These are they who have mounted the cloud of love and speed through the atmosphere of the spirit. These are they for whom the word of immortality hath been fulfilled, and who abide forever in the heaven of holiness. They pay no heed to aught else but hasten to do good deeds and walk the paths of truth. When questioned about anything they close their eyes as though they had not heard, for they dwell in the pavilion of detachment.

This servant of God calleth you only unto Him and guideth you to the path which hath been raised up in truth, and teacheth you the ways of piety in that which ye know not, and giveth you glad tidings of Him Who shall come after and of Him Whom God shall make manifest, that ye may attain unto every grace. O people! Deal not with him as those dealt with them who were guided by the light of God in the unseen and who drink from the breast of beauty. Say: O people! Fear ye God in His days, and harm Him not through your imaginings, and take no counsel regarding His Cause. Open your eyes and purify your souls that ye may be sustained by His presence.

This is that Husayn Who was promised to you aforetime, did ye but know it.

And have ye not heard that the Qa’im would be sent forth once again and would enter beneath His shadow? Thus did the tongue of revelation inform you aforetime, yet now ye all remain veiled.

Fear ye God, then be ashamed before His beauty, and shed not this pure and radiant blood. But for Him, God’s Cause would not have been made manifest in all else, nor would the cock of the Throne have crowed, nor would the Dove have warbled upon the twigs of the Lote-Tree of the Bayan, nor would those brought nigh have been created.” We commanded you not to hesitate in His Cause at the time of His appearance, yet ye committed that which hath caused the hearts of the sincere to be consumed.

At every moment I walk while Shimr walketh behind Me, and the spearmen are on My right and on My left - tyrannical servants.

Glory be upon you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Inaccessible! O Muhammad-Qabl-i-Baqir! Hearken unto the Call from the direction of Him Who is encompassed by tribulation, from the Divine Lote-Tree set in motion by the stirring of the verses of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Compelling. Thy name hath been mentioned before the Countenance, and there hath been sent down for thee that which causeth spirits to soar and breezes to waft. This sufficeth thee, if thou be of those endowed with insight. Give thanks unto God for this bounty, with which nothing on earth can compare. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Grieve not for being prevented from attaining His presence. The schemes of the schemers have come between Us and thee. Be content with what God hath ordained in His Book. He hath decreed for you the reward of those who have turned towards Him. He, verily, is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. Blessed are ye for having migrated and journeyed and turned towards the Dawning-Place of the revelation of your Lord, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Return to your lands by God’s command and decree, then give the servants to drink from the choice wine of the remembrance of the name of your Lord, the Lord of all mankind. Blessed is he who obeyeth the command of his Lord - he hath attained unto all good. Thus doth testify the Supreme Pen, and behind it thy Lord, the Master of the Day of Mutual Calling. Know ye that We have forbidden the servants to shed blood and to slay those who have denied God, the Lord of lords. For this cause hath the matter reached such a pass that one who hath no authority hath assailed Us, and one who is smaller than a fly hath transgressed against Us. Thus have We recounted unto thee and sent down from the heaven of command that which will gladden thy heart and the hearts of the righteous.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Taqi! Blessed art thou for having turned thy face unto My presence and for having had thy name mentioned before My throne, after that which befell Me in the path of God, the Lord of all names, when I was immersed in oceans of tribulation. Arise through thy Lord’s power and say: O people! This is not a day for hesitation. Turn with your hearts unto God, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Say: This is God’s grace amongst you which hath appeared in truth - turn ye, O people of insight! This is God’s path amidst you - advance, O ye who possess understanding! This is a day whereon it behoveth every soul, upon hearing the call from the direction of his Lord, the Most High, to cast aside all else and say: “Here am I, O Lord of earth and heaven!” Take thou the chalice of salvation in the name of Him Who sendeth the winds and Who cleaveth the dawn, and sprinkle thereof upon souls and spirits, that perchance the peoples of the world may arise to fulfill what thy Lord, the Lord of all possibility, hath desired. Be thou in all conditions observant of wisdom and utterance - this is what ye have been commanded by the All-Merciful in most of the Tablets. Blessed art thou for having cast away and taken up that which thou didst when thou didst attain unto the Tablet of thy Lord. Take it with the hand of acceptance and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Self-Sufficing, the Most High! I testify that Thou hast desired him who desired Thee and dost answer him who calleth upon Thee. And I testify that by Thy light the horizons were illumined. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord’s loving-kindness and pay no heed to those who turn away and object. Soon shall they pass away and find for themselves no refuge, and the smile of the world shall brighten with your remembrance. Thus hath the Pen of the Ancient of Days been moved - verily He is the Mighty, the Glorious, the Bountiful.</p>

<p>O Mahdi! Verily, this man is moved by vain desires. Thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Therefore have We commanded thee not to dwell in his house, for thy Lord is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing. Avoid him, for he desires to sow corruption among the servants, and all that he utters is manifest falsehood. We beseech God to aid all to remain steadfast in His Cause - verily He is powerful over all things. Should he speak again, arise to respond through the power of thy Lord, that there may appear from thee that which will give assurance that thou art upon a straight path. The man’s purpose is corruption. For some time he has sought two emblems from the Branch, but it was not permissible that either be given to him. Then he united with an outsider to sow hatred, and during this time he never made any inquiry. In any case, whatever he has said was false - his purpose being to cause fear in some for his own ends. After responding, it is necessary to avoid him. As for what he said about Yahya’s letters, say: “We have seen more of them than you, and even now we will give you as many as you wish. All these letters were not and are not worth a penny. And that person who told you these things was himself the first to turn away from Yahya. Now, due to the rancor hidden in his breast, he has conveyed these words to you. Soon you will understand and confirm what has been mentioned. Do not attribute this to us - speak from yourself and do not mention anyone’s name.”</p>

Say: He is in such tribulation as hath no parallel in all creation. Were it to be mentioned, the tongue of all things would proclaim: Verily, this is a grievous tribulation. We desired not the sorrow of the loved ones, and therefore We concealed it, for We are the Concealer, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Grieve not over anything. Arise to make mention of your Ancient Lord, that perchance the breaths of verses may waft over all created things and draw them to God, the Mighty, the Peerless. Among the people are those who in the days of God have occupied themselves with their own desires, and among them are those who have cast aside all else, taking fast hold of the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Wise. It behooveth the people of Baha to be in such wise that neither the cawing of the people of the world nor the hypocrisy of those who have denied this manifest Cause will affect them. Be ye assured of God’s grace and mercy, and be as one soul. Thus doth He command you Who is imprisoned in the land of exile - the Powerful, the Trustworthy. Blessed is the face that hath been illumined by the lights of the Countenance, and the eye that hath been solaced by gazing upon the horizon of submission. O Breeze! Art thou able to arise to convey the Cause of thy Lord, or dost thou find thyself among the fearful? Melodies have their modes, and songs their measures. None can hear and understand save those whom We have made the ears of the world. We have caused the Ark of Inner Meanings to sail upon the sea of utterance, that thy heart may rejoice thereat and thou mayest be of the thankful.

<p>We have desired at this time to make mention of him who made mention of Me and turned towards My horizon on a day whereon was revealed that which had been hidden in the knowledge of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne - a day whereon the concealed was unveiled and the treasured was brought forth, and every wise command. Say: O peoples of the earth! Fear God and dispute not His verses. Judge fairly concerning that which has been revealed in truth, and be not of the wrongdoers. Through the nights and days you were beseeching your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, to send unto you one who would guide you to His straight path. When the promise came to pass, He came with grace, and on His right was the banner of “He doeth what He willeth” and on His left the standard whereon was inscribed by the Pen of Grace: “The Lord of Justice hath come with a manifest and radiant light.” Thereupon you rose up against Him and pronounced sentence to shed His pure and luminous blood. When thou hast taken the chalice of Mine utterance in My Name and drunk therefrom in remembrance of Me, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy utterance and the light of Thy knowledge and Thine establishment upon the throne of Thy proof, to ordain for me and for Thy loved ones that whereby Thy Cause may be exalted amongst Thy creation. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning away from all else save Thee and turning towards the horizon of Thy grace. Ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto the court of Thy might and the precincts of Thy holiness. Then write down for me the good of this world and of the world to come.

How beloved is utter nothingness before absolute Being! Consider how many afflictions and tribulations have befallen the Cause of God and His loved ones in this Most Great Revelation, successively and continuously, and that the purpose of bearing these hardships hath been the exaltation of God’s Cause and the elevation of the manifestation of His divine will. Now must the friends who have drunk from the Kawthar of the love of God arise with the utmost effort and endeavor to establish that which is the object of His purpose and to purify the people from their former idle fancies through the Kawthar of divine remembrance, that all may attain unto that which God hath willed. Observe ye the paucity of people’s understanding - some behold in the divine Tablets naught but paper and ink. Well was it said that the blind eye perceiveth naught of the sun save its heat. By the life of God! Were anyone to gaze with the eye of insight upon a single Tablet, he would witness rivers of life flowing and coursing through it, each drop thereof the quickener of all things.

One such as yourself must at all times remind the friends and companions through wisdom and utterance of God’s all-embracing Word, that all may become united in the divine Cause and attain unto the station of a single being and essence.

<p>O father! The Most Exalted Pen commands: Ponder now upon your son and gaze with the most pure vision toward the Greatest Scene. After all, every flower has had its fragrance and every light its radiance and manifestation. Consider what fire has enkindled your son and what light has attracted him. The fragrance of the divine paradise is clearly distinct from all else, and the taste of honey is manifestly different from that of colocynth. The divine Cause has never been confused with aught else, and the Word of God has ever shone bright and radiant like the sun. Yet people have confused themselves and continue to do so. Bilal was an Abyssinian and had no knowledge of learning - how is it that today you accept and believe in him, while considering all the Jewish and Christian divines who lived in the time of the Messenger of God (may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him) to be ignorant, irreligious and infidels? Now that same Cause has appeared and that same Word has shed its radiance. Let not the opposition of the divines and the people prevent you from the truth. In this luminous morn, deprive not yourself of the outpourings of the All-Merciful. Know thou the value of this Tablet. Were it not for consideration of your love for your son, you would not have attained to such a bounty even if you had given away all that is on earth. Though it has been revealed briefly, yet oceans of meaning lie concealed within it. Reflect, that you may know and say: “Praise be to God for what I have attained unto, and I am of those who have repented.”</p>

The ocean of divine knowledge, which adorneth the heavenly tablets, hath appeared in creation with perfect manifestation and surging waves, and the sun of wisdom and inner meanings hath risen, shining and evident, from the dawning-place of the divine Will. Yet veils have prevented hearts, and the disease of selfish desires hath deprived eyes from beholding. Thus it is observed that although the divine Call is raised at all times, the people remain debarred and withered, nay rather dead, save for a few who have quaffed from the Kawthar of the All-Merciful’s recognition and, intoxicated, occupy themselves with the mention of the One Beloved in the gathering of contingent beings. Blessed are they, then blessed are they! By My life, theirs shall be a goodly return. The friends in that land all stand before the Gate and dwell beneath the shade of the Tree of Providence. The Most Exalted Pen commandeth them all to the Most Great Steadfastness, for the satans lie in wait and every falsehood, clothed in the garment of truth, leadeth the people astray. Therefore the souls who have accepted the Cause of God must remain steadfast in such wise that, having recognized the Truth and been blessed by His grace, they shall see themselves independent and in no need of the world. This is the station of the people of Baha which hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book. Blessed are they that know, and joy be to them that have attained!</p>

<p>He is the One Who has dominion over all names. This servant has ever remembered the friends and summoned all to the supreme horizon, yet most have remained deprived of the fragrances of these days, for they have fixed their gaze upon the manifestations of fancy and idle imaginings. Glory be to God! The Sun of Revelation has dawned from the horizon of Sinai in such wise that none has any excuse to hesitate or delay. We beseech God to erase the traces of heedlessness and not to deprive His loved ones of the fruits of the Tree of Knowledge. O Ha’ before Shin! Upon thee be My glory! Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto that which was mentioned and recorded in the divine Books. We hope that on this Day of God the loved ones will not be held back from the depths of the ocean of oneness and the effulgences of the Sun of Truth, and will remain protected from the barking ones, the doubtful, and the deniers. The world is bewildered, for it is observed that the servants, out of love for two fleeting days, have closed and continue to close their eyes to everlasting, eternal blessings. Thus it is that the intoxication of heedlessness hath seized most of them. Say: My God, my God! Aid me in Thy days to truly witness and hearken, lest the idle fancies and vain imaginings of the people hold me back from drawing nigh unto the gate of Thy mercy, which Thou hast opened unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. Then ordain for me, O my God, that which will make me powerful through Thy power and willing through Thy Will. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Commanding, the All-Wise. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have held fast to this mighty cord. 9 Rabi’u’l-Avval 1307</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the One, and peace be upon him after whom there shall be no Prophet. This is an epistle from the Wronged One to him who hath attained unto recognition, acknowledged the oneness of God, and confessed that which He hath revealed in His perspicuous Book. O Zayn! Glad tidings of concord and unity have a mighty effect in the world. All factions among the peoples have attained unto lofty stations, save the odious Shi’ih faction. Each day, like unto Pharaoh, they sink one or two spans deeper, and perceive it not. Glory be to God! The change in the taste of that faction every morning consists of one, two or three curses which emerge from the treasury of denial. They consider themselves the most exalted people in the world, and likewise the most learned, the most excellent and the most high, whereas in the estimation of those possessed of insight they were and are not even mentioned, and in the sight of the Concourse on High they are regarded as lower than animals. In any case, beseech ye God that He may enable all to attain unto that which is the cause of elevation and exaltation. In these days news hath arrived from the land of Ta concerning the unity and concord of the friends. Praise be to God, that faction hath abandoned corruption and contention, and hath laid hold on that which conduceth to the reformation of the world and the education of the souls of nations. Make mention of the friends on behalf of the Wronged One. God willing, may they be set ablaze with the fire of the love of God and illumined by the light of His knowledge. The peace shining forth from the horizon of the Abode of Peace be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and hearken unto thy words concerning righteousness and piety, and upon every one who is steadfast and upright.</p>

<p>O Siyyid Zaman, upon him be the Glory of God! In the name of the one true God! One must hearken with the soul to hear the call of the Beloved of the worlds which has been raised from the Prison. And whoever has attained to this supreme honor and mighty gift will not be held back from the Most Great Horizon and the Lord of Power by the adornments, riches and might of the world. The beauty of the world will not captivate him, nor will its dominion and majesty frighten him. He will drink of the Choice Wine that had been sealed through the name of the Self-Subsisting, in such wise that neither the clamor of the world nor the tumult of the nations will deprive him from the presence of the Friend. O friends! Hear ye the call of the Wronged One, and act in accordance with what befits the Day of God. The rising and setting, the dawning and declining of the world proclaim on His behalf and make all aware of its change, transformation and evanescence. Blessed is the soul that is not occupied with its vain and transient conditions, nor with its unprofitable and worthless manifestations, and is not held back from the one true Goal. Thy mention hath been made before the Throne, and this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath been revealed in the most wondrous Persian tongue, that thou mayest drink from the chalices of the words of the All-Merciful the living waters, and remain firm and steadfast in the Cause of God. Be thou thankful and among those who give thanks. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Glory be upon the people of Baha who have not broken God’s Covenant and His Testament, and have done that which they were bidden in His mighty Book.</p>

But today who can console Thee in this calamity before which all calamities bow down, and this sorrow which hath stunned all sorrows? I used to behold Thee, O Wronged One of the horizons, comforting Thy chosen ones in tribulation and adversity. But from this day forward, who shall comfort Thee in this anguish which hath transformed the lands and melted hearts? Alas beyond all alas! Alas which hath shaken the world and melted the hearts of nations, for I see Thee in such grief that Thou dost not wish to hear mention of the Ridvan, and how couldst Thou desire to see what hath been enumerated therein of Thy bounties and favors? O Lord! The fire of tyranny hath been kindled in the world - where is the light of Thy justice, O Ancient King? By Thy glory, O Thou imprisoned Wronged One! It grieveth me to see the Temple of Justice beneath the claws of tyranny, and it grieveth me to see the Dawning-Place of faithfulness in the hands of the wicked. I know not, O my God and God of earth and heaven, whether he hath drunk from the chalice of martyrdom or remaineth under the will of those through whom the standards of tyranny were raised amongst creation. By Thy sovereignty, O Beloved of the world and Desired One of the seen and unseen! Were the eyes of the world to weep and the hearts of nations to burn, it would not befit this catastrophe wherein all things hear the cry of Thy heart and the lament of Thy soul.

<p>In the name of the Mighty, the All-Powerful! By the testimony of all divine Books, this Day is the Day of God and this Cause is His Cause. Through the Most Great Word He adorned all things from nothingness with the ornament of being, and through another Word which in this moment floweth from the Supreme Pen He counseleth all, and this blessed Word which is the cause of the salvation of the world and the unity of nations is this: O friends of God! There are many emigrants who, after arrival and observation and hearing, return to their countries. Some speak of the truth, that is, of what they have heard from the tongue of the Wronged One, while others are occupied with vain imaginings. Should any word of discord appear from any soul, that word was not and is not from the Truth. The Dispensations have culminated in this Most Great Manifestation. Beseech ye God that He may adorn souls with the ornament of fairness, lest they again become the cause of discord and the shedding of blood. This is what the Wronged One hath ordained and counseled unto the friends of God and His loved ones. Blessed is he who hath heard and attained, and woe unto the heedless. When thou hast received My Writings and My Tablet, say: “My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having enabled me to turn towards the Dayspring of Thy Cause, and shown me Thy path, and made me hear Thy verses. I beseech Thee by them who hastened unto the place of sacrifice and offered up their souls and all they possessed in Thy path, O Lord of all being, to ordain for me the good of this world and the world to come. Verily Thou art the Lord of the Throne on high and of the earth below. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.”</p>

He hath spoken the truth and summoned the people with the most exalted call to the praiseworthy station. Among them are those who hastened to the supreme horizon, and among them are those who turned away and disbelieved in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed is he who hath attained to hearing, and woe unto every heedless and veiled one. Say: O concourse of the earth! Do ye not behold the ocean and its waves, and the sun and its radiance?

Cast behind you your vain imaginings and your idols beneath your feet, and say: O God of the worlds and Desire of the nations! I beseech Thee by the fragrance of Thy garment, and the station of meeting Thee, and the Kawthar of reunion with Thee, that Thou mayest rend asunder the veils that have come between us and the lights of Thy countenance, and prevented us from that for which we were created in Thy days. O Lord! Thou art the Generous, possessed of great bounty. Withhold not Thy servants from the ocean of Thy knowledge, nor distance them from the shores of Thy nearness. They are Thy servants and Thy creation, possessing for themselves neither benefit nor harm, neither standing nor sitting, neither life nor resurrection.

Give thanks and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast caused me to know Thyself and made me one of those who are strong in the Cause.” By My life, O Husayn, it behooveth thee to turn with radiant vision toward the Most Great Scene, detached from all that hath been mentioned in the realm of creation. Thus hath the All-Merciful spoken out of His love for thee, that thou mayest arise to serve the Cause through this Name which hath in truth encompassed all things. Convey My greetings to thy family and say: “Be not disturbed by what thou hast heard and hearest. Verily the Cause is mighty, mighty. Today there is no relationship between anyone except those who have held fast to this Cord which hath been known by the name of God. Put thy trust in God, then manifest such power that the handmaidens will be amazed by their love for thy Lord.” Thus doth He Who hath loved thee for the sake of God command thee, and God is witness to what I say. Verily the Glory be upon thee and upon thy progeny and upon those who are with you among the loved ones of thy Lord. Thus hath the matter been decreed.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Ever-Speaking One! New words have appeared and old sayings have emerged from the sacks of heedlessness. They say the Bayan has been corrupted, just as the previous party said and were cast into hell. Say: By God’s life, ye have fabricated against Him Who created you and sustained you, and ye are accounted this day among the wrongdoers in God’s Book, the Lord of all worlds. Say: O heedless ones! By what proof and evidence did ye acknowledge the Bayan? Depart not from justice and equity. Do ye wish to be like the people of the Furqan (Muslims), speaking falsehood from pulpits and denouncing one another as infidels, until in the end the fruit of your deeds becomes like unto those heedless souls? Leave aside these calumnies. By God’s life, the Bayan lamenteth for what ye have perpetrated. Though divine counsel leaveth no impression and heavenly admonition beareth no fruit, for God’s wrath hath seized them and the recompense of their deeds hath deprived them. Beseech ye God to protect you from such heedless souls. By God’s life, their mention is a deadly poison and their utterance a consuming fire. They seek to prove the authority of a drop while turning away from the Most Great Ocean. Such is the condition of those heedless and veiled souls. Yet be patient and calm in all conditions, for verily He loveth the patient and the calm ones. Praise be to God that thou hast attained to His remembrance, glorified be His majesty, and been illumined by His Word. Preserve this and be among the thankful ones. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds and Goal of them that know Thee!</p>

<p>O Mirza Abu’l-Qasim, upon him be the Glory of God! In His Name, the Protector over all names! The Seal of the Prophets, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, appeared from the Dayspring of God’s Command and, with supreme grace and infinite bounty, summoned the people to the blessed Word of Unity. His purpose was to awaken heedless souls and deliver them from the darkness of polytheism. Yet the people arose in rejection and protest, perpetrating that which caused the company of the Prophets in the Most Exalted Paradise to lament. Reflect upon the Prophets of the past: each was afflicted by the rejection of the people. Some were accused of madness, others were called sorcerers, and yet others were denounced as liars. Like the divines of Iran who for years beseeched God, exalted be His glory, for the appearance of these days, yet when the horizon of the world became illumined and bright, all turned away and issued the decree for the shedding of His most pure blood. When thou hearest the cooing of the Dove of My utterance upon the branches of the Tree of My knowledge, say: “My God, my God! I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and that Thou hast no partner in Thy dominion nor any equal in Thy kingdom. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy power and the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of Thy oneness to protect me from the evil of Thine enemies and to draw me nigh unto Thee. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thy horizon, turning away from all else beside Thee. I beseech Thee by the fire of Thy Sacred Tree and the light of Thy Cause to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Forgiving, the Generous. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>

We counsel you, O people of unity, to be trustworthy and religious and chaste, and to that whereby your stations may be exalted among the idolaters who have denied God and His signs and have surrounded the unitarians with such tyranny as hath caused the people of the cities of justice and equity to lament.

The penetrating power of this blessed Word hath no peer or likeness, despite those who have denied the penetrating influence of the Word and its power.

Through My command the light of penetrating influence hath shone forth and the mysteries of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, have appeared.”</p>
<p>O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. The heedless ones have spoken and continue to speak according to their desires. They have passed by the station that God hath made the point of adoration of the most exalted Paradise and the highest Heaven, and have remained and do remain worshippers of the idol of fancy and imagination. Blessed art thou for having cast away vain imaginings and taken hold of the Book of God, the Sovereign of days and the Master of all peoples. We beseech God to preserve thee and guard thee and to send down upon thee that which will draw thee nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>

And further, mention was made of the friends in your letter and was presented. Kindness was expressed toward all. This servant conveys greetings to all. This petition is presented very briefly because that honored one is coming, and since the decree of nearness is established, extensive submission would be presumptuous. The Glory be upon you.</p>

<p>O Kadkhuda Yegan, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the One dawning from the horizon of the heaven of the Kingdom! Glorified is He Who hath sent down the verses and revealed the clear proofs and made plain the Way for those possessed of insight and caused the Dove of the Cause to warble upon the branches that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Bestower! There hath come before the Wronged One in the Most Great Prison mention of thee. We have revealed for thee this Tablet that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. This is a Day wherein the veils have been rent asunder by the fingers of the power of thy Lord, the Possessor of all being, and the Cry hath been raised in truth, and the Call hath been lifted up between earth and heaven, and the Bridge hath been laid, and the Balance set up. Blessed is he who heareth and respondeth unto his Lord, and woe unto every doubting scholar who hath turned away from God and disputed His verses when He came with power and sovereignty. Hearken unto that which My Most Exalted Pen counseleth thee in this Most Glorious Station and commandeth thee that whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of lords, may be exalted. Let not the affairs of men grieve thee. Arise and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast made me to know the Dayspring of Thy Revelation and the Dawning-Place of Thy verses! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name, whereby Thou hast subdued the lands, to confirm me in steadfastness in Thy Cause and to preserve me from the evil of those who have turned away from Thee in the end.” The Glory be upon thee and upon thy son and upon those whom the veils of glory have not withheld in the end. Give him My glad-tidings and greet him on My behalf that he may rejoice and be of those who have cast the world behind them, turning unto the Most Sublime Horizon - the Station wherein the atoms proclaim: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of all mankind!”</p>

Glorified be He Who remembers His handmaid at a time when sorrows have encompassed Him from near and far, to such extent that His lips do not open in remembrance - and none knoweth this save God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing - while His fingers move the Pen to make mention of His sorrowful name. O handmaid of God! Blessed art thou, for thy son hath attained the presence of the Throne and been honored to meet his Lord, and was among those who attained His presence. By God! His visitation is regarded by God as better than those who have visited and do visit in these days the shrines bearing Our names and are counted among the visitors - for they visit mere names while remaining veiled from their Creator and Originator, and are among the heedless ones. Well is it with thee, O handmaid of God, that God hath brought forth from thee one who hath attained His presence and entered His vicinity and upon whom the lights of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful, have shone. Thus doth God single out whom He willeth through His grace, and verily He is the Forgiving, the Generous. He hath made mention of thy faith and thy love for thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great, and hath sent down unto thee these verses, the most wondrous, impregnable and wonderful. We send them to thee that thine eyes may be consoled thereby, thy heart may rejoice, thy being may be gladdened and thy soul may quiver with longing for God, the Beloved of them that know. Remember thy Lord and what hath befallen Him of tribulations such as have befallen none else in the world. And the Glory rest upon thee and upon the handmaids of God who are steadfast. Remind them on Our behalf, then clothe them with the garments of glorification from thy Lord, the Revealer, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>Glorified be God! The Author of the Bayan declares: “Let not the Bayan veil you from Him, and turn not away from Him on account of its letters. The entirety of the Bayan is as but a leaf before Him - if He accepts it, it is accepted, and if He rejects it, verily He is to be loved in His Cause and obeyed in His decree.” Nevertheless, those who turned away from the Bayan clung to names while remaining heedless of and turning away from their Creator and Lord. By what command, by what proof, and by what evidence did they accept the Bayan while inflicting upon its Revealer and Sender that which the Pen is powerless and incapable to mention? Every fair-minded one has testified and continues to testify to the power of the Most Exalted Pen and the Most Sublime Word, and every person of insight has been and remains witness. O people of the Bayan! Fear the All-Merciful and oppose not Him Who has made every command dependent upon His acceptance and every decree upon His approval. Fear God and be not among the wrongdoers. This Wronged One has accepted the harm of the world for the exaltation of the Word and the manifestation of God’s Cause. From the earliest days until now, He has been in the hands of the oppressors and the heedless, as all have seen and heard, were they to be fair. We beseech God - exalted be His glory - to grant His servants fairness and to adorn them with the ornament of truthfulness.

Thus did the All-Merciful come with great sovereignty and sent His angels to all regions to give the people glad tidings of this wondrous Day. In their hands were Tablets that surpass all the books of the ancients, wherein was revealed that which came upon the Prophets and Messengers. Among the people are those who denied them and cast them behind their backs - these are indeed in manifest loss. And among them are those who inhaled from these Tablets the fragrance of their Lord, the All-Merciful, and were illumined by this Lamp through which the heavens and earth were made to shine. Were the veil to be lifted, those who disbelieved would cry out: “Alas for us, for what we neglected towards God!” Thus was the matter decreed, and the pronouncement came from thy Lord, the All-Merciful, encompassing all worlds. O servant! Be thou assured of God’s grace and mercy. Soon will the unitarians behold the banners of victory from all directions through My Most Great Name. Know then that the Youth hath not grieved at what befell Him in the path of God’s love, and His face hath shone from the horizon of tribulation with a light from which the dwellers of the cities of eternity and the near angels derive illumination. Place thy trust in God in all matters, then aid thy Lord, for in such days as these the gaze of God is fixed upon those who have stood firm in His love and aided His Cause.

Blessed is your father who attained in the earliest days when the Call of the King of Names was raised between the heavens and the earth. He turned after hearing, when every remote scholar turned away from the Most Exalted Horizon. He heard and responded, saying “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of all seekers!” Thus has the Most Ancient Pen moved in the arena of the Tablet by the command of God, the Ancient Commander. When thou dost behold the waves of the ocean of My utterance and art attracted by the choice wine of My bounty, say: “My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me unto Thy straight path and Thy mighty announcement. I beseech Thee by the Word through which Thou didst reveal the decree of the Trumpet, causing those in the kingdoms of knowledge and learning to swoon away, to teach me that which will benefit me in every world of Thy worlds. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the Lamp of Thy Cause which Thou hast preserved from the winds of rancor and hatred that blew from the hearts of Thine enemies who adorned their heads with that which elevated them among Thy servants and usurped Thy right in Thy name, to make me attracted to Thy verses, speaking forth Thy praise, and steadfast in Thy Cause. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Compelling, the Ancient.”</p>

<p>Blessed art thou, O Sadiq, for thou hast been faithful to My Covenant, and hast not forgotten My pledge, and hast not cast aside My remembrance. Thou didst turn unto My face and didst taste the sweetness of My remembrance and praise until thou becamest a captive in My love and a prisoner in My path and an exile in My atmosphere and a stranger in the lands for My name and the greatness of My Cause. By My Self, all the paradises belong to you - soon shall ye behold yourselves in manifest glory and dominion. By My Self, the Truth! Were anyone among those who circled round My pavilion and were touched by hardships for My name to look with Mine eye, he would see all beings behind him. Thus have We taught thee with truth, and none can inform thee like One Who is All-Aware. We were with thee when thou wert seized and imprisoned and left thy homeland. Let not what hath befallen thee sadden thee - verily My Cause is mighty, mighty. Say: O My loved ones! Abandon that which causeth the Word to be divided, and take hold of that which uniteth hearts and giveth rest to the breasts of the sincere ones. And remember when thou didst enter Iraq and God through thee broke the might of the aggressors. Blessed is thy mother when she entered the house of her Lord, whereby the hearts of the female polytheists and male polytheists were thrown into commotion. We have informed the servants in the Tablet We revealed to Our servant the Mahdi of what befell the House. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Say: All that hath appeared and shall appear is in the Book of my Lord - verily my Lord encompasseth all things. And the glory be upon thee and upon whosoever hath heard My call and followed that which was commanded by One mighty and great.</p>

Praise be to God, the fragrance of steadfastness was wafting from it. Ask of God to make this fragrance lasting and enduring, for the treacherous lie in ambush and thieves wait at the watchtowers. Make the friends of God aware that they may attain to such a station that the prevention of preventers, the croaking of croakers, and the doubts of doubters may not deprive or forbid them from the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Each of the friends mentioned in the letter attained the remembrance of the Wronged One.

<p>Though ere this I was foremost among the wise.</p>

<p>If Thou wishest me to live, breathe into me a breath,</p>
<p>For I am dead these hundred years, while Thou art Life like Christ’s.</p>
<p>First art Thou and Last art Thou, Manifest art Thou and Hidden art Thou,</p>
<p>Veiled from every eye, yet in plain sight art Thou!</p>
<p>But through divine might and heavenly power and the grace of the Eternal Lord, one must be seated upon the carpet of light and traverse the expanse of spirit, until all limitations are witnessed without limitation, and all names and traces are seen without stigma or designation. This is the station of the highest horizon and the Most Glorious Tree and the Tree of Paradise and the Ultimate Fruit.

Therefore, gather My loved ones in remembrance of Me, then make mention to them of that which hath been sent down from the direction of My Throne, that they may soar in the atmosphere of My nearness and ascend unto the heaven of My grandeur.

<p>O Jamal, upon him be all the most glorious and resplendent Baha! He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most High! There hath come before the Throne that which thou didst send to the servant who standeth before the Face, and We have answered thee through this Tablet from which the near ones inhale the fragrance of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as We behold thee steadfast in the Cause and speaking forth this Name through which the unitarians have hastened to the Kawthar of eternity, and the near ones to the Supreme Horizon, and the sincere ones to the Dawning-Place of the Light of Baha, which none hath known save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. He, verily, is He; whoso hath acknowledged this hath acknowledged that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of his Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Know thou, O thou who hast emigrated unto God and turned thy face toward Him, that there hath befallen Us that which hath grieved the Concourse on High and caused the Spirit of Holiness to lament in this exalted Station. By the life of God! The horizon of trustworthiness hath been darkened, and the bow hath been taken from its Maker, and the House from its Builder. Understand thou the melody of these words, that thou mayest be of them that are informed. We have commanded all to observe the Most Great Trustworthiness - to this beareth witness My tongue, My Pen, My limbs, and those who circle round Me, then this luminous Book. Among the people are those who have cast it behind their backs, and thereby have violated the sanctity of God, the Most High, the Mighty, the Protected. Convey My greetings unto the faces of My loved ones and say: Beware lest ye cast the Book of God behind your backs. Hold fast unto it, then act according to that which the All-Merciful hath revealed therein. This, verily, is a mighty triumph. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have turned toward God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>He is the One Who has dominion over all who are on earth and in heaven. Your letter has come before the Wronged One, and the servant who is present before His face made mention of it and was blessed to hear what the Mother Book contains from His presence. We have heard that which you called out to God. Blessed be your tongue, in that it has acknowledged what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke before the creation of all things - that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. We bear witness that you have detected the fragrances of revelation and turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon when the learned ones of the earth and its divines turned away from it, on a day when the Herald proclaimed: “The Kingdom belongs to God, the Lord of Lords!” When you gained the blessing of your Lord the All-Merciful’s utterance, say: “My God, my God! Thou art He through Whose signs were set in motion the spheres of existence, and through Whose bounty appeared the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge. O Master of the seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the mysteries of Thy Book, and by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue Thy earth and Thy heaven, to assist me to make mention of Thee and praise Thee, and that whereby my remembrance shall endure in Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. O my Lord! I sense the fragrance of Thy manifestation, which has so taken hold of me that I have turned toward Thee and spoken Thy praise. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy verses and the dawning lights of the Daystar of Thy Cause to ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of the hereafter and of the first life, and to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy service, speaking Thy praise, turning toward Thy horizon and orienting myself to the lights of Thy countenance. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of what lies with Thee. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.”</p>

The breezes of revelation have wafted and the winds of the All-Merciful have blown, yet most of the people perceive it not. The gate of reunion hath been opened before all who are in the heavens and on earth, yet the people have turned away from it. The ocean of attainment hath surged before the faces of all who are in creation, but none hath gained it save whom thy Lord, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting, hath willed. Say: O people!

Beware lest ye deprive yourselves through the disputations of the contentious from the ocean of reunion. Draw nigh unto Him and follow not those who have denied the All-Merciful when He came with manifest sovereignty. That which ye possess of idle fancies and vain imaginings will profit you not this Day. Say: O people! Answer Him Who calleth you for the sake of God - this is better for you, did ye but know. We have perceived from thee the fragrance of faith and have sent down for thee this Hidden Tablet. Verily it maketh mention of him who hath turned towards Him and aideth him who hath desired to assist His Cause.

The proof itself calleth all who are in the realm of possibilities unto God, yet the people comprehend not.

We commanded the servants of God in Iraq and other lands not to oppose anyone, and even if they were killed, not to kill.

Reflect, then observe how the secrets of hearts have been revealed, yet despite what people see of their deeds and hear of their words, they follow them unawares. Say: Be fair, O people, concerning the Youth and those with Him. Did He ever rely upon anyone, or seek help from any soul, or unite with those who have denied God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy?

Thy servant beareth witness to Thy unity and oneness, and beseecheth from the wonders of Thy bounty that which beseemeth Thy generosity, and whose manifestation and appearance shall never be erased from the book of the world, which no cloud of vain imaginings shall conceal, and which no mists of idle fancies shall prevent from shining forth. O Generous One! Every possessor of insight and hearing hath testified to Thy generosity and borne witness to the precedence of Thy mercy. Deprive not Thy servants from the ocean of recognition, and withhold them not from the lights of the countenance of Thy Revelation. Thou art the Bestower, the Compassionate. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>A Book sent down by the All-Merciful to one of His handmaidens, that she may remember Him Who created her. He is, verily, the Helper, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Today the Sun of certitude is shining and manifest from the horizon of the world. It behooveth every soul to turn unto it and find through its rays the straight path. Who is He by Whose name was raised the banner of “There is none other God but Him”? And Who is He at Whose appearance the Cry was raised, and the Trumpet was sounded, and all that are on earth were thunderstruck, save those whom God pleased? And Who is He Who arose with the Cause and manifested through His sovereignty whatsoever He desired in the kingdom of creation? Who is He Whom the might of princes did not deter, and the hosts of the powerful did not weaken, and Who spoke forth what He was commanded between earth and heaven? And Who is He through Whom the back of the Evil One was broken and the traces of idle fancies and vain imaginings were obliterated? O handmaiden of God! God willing, thou shalt observe and ponder with illumined vision and pure heart that which hath appeared, that perchance thou mayest become radiant and enlightened among the handmaidens through the lights of the Sun of inner meanings. Hearken unto the voice of the Wronged One. Take with the hand of certitude the chalice of steadfastness and drink therefrom - at times in My name, at times in remembrance of Me, and at other times in praise of My beauteous attributes. God willing, thou shalt partake of the Kawthar of life that lieth concealed within the words of the All-Merciful, until thou beholdest thyself detached and independent from all who are on earth, and engaged in the mention of thy peerless Beloved. Thus hath the tongue of the All-Merciful spoken that which nothing in all creation can equal. Blessed are they that have recognized, whether men or women.</p>

Blessed is the tongue that hath spoken in praise of God, and the face that hath turned toward Him, and the heart that hath turned to His luminous horizon. Give thanks unto God for having aided thee unto this most great bounty and guided thee unto His straight path and sent down for thee that whose fragrance shall never cease throughout the eternity of His most excellent names. To this doth My Most Exalted Pen testify in this wondrous Tablet. Be thou steadfast in the service of My Cause and speaking My praise amongst My servants. Thus doth command thee He with Whom is the knowledge of all things in a clear Book.

Thus have We adorned the kingdom of the Tablet with the mention of Him Who is the Lord of the realms of might. Read it and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all mankind! Glory be upon thee and upon them that are with thee among those who have believed in God, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.</p>

I beseech Thee by Thy power which the hosts and ranks cannot weaken, and by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the worlds of the unseen and the seen, to make me in all conditions moved by Thy will, holding fast unto Thy cord, and acting according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord and my Support, for having remembered me time after time, and adorned me with the ornament of Thy knowledge, and enabled me to turn unto Thee. I beseech Thee to aid me under all conditions to be steadfast in Thy Cause and to arise to serve Thee. Verily Thou art the Almighty over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Commander, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O my God! Send Thy blessings upon Thy loved ones and chosen ones who have not broken Thy covenant and Thy testament, and whom the clamor of Thy creatures and the doubts of those of Thy servants who have changed Thy bounty, turned away from Thy beauty, and denied Thy manifestation and Thy verses have not hindered. I beseech Thee, O God of Names, to send down upon me from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will draw me nigh unto Thee.

<p>A Tablet revealed with truth from Him Who is manifest in the Prison to Farah [Muhammad-Taqi, upon him be the glory of God]. Verily We address at all times them that are in the realm of possibility, and summon them to the All-Informed One. Some among them have followed their desires and turned away from the Dawning-Place of utterance when it shone forth with this brilliant, resplendent Light. The people have become heedless of their abiding-place, in that they have followed every wicked and ignoble one, casting the blessing of God behind their backs and turning unto that which is putrid. They are assuredly among the losers. Blessed is the stranger who hath sought his most exalted homeland, and the poor one who hath clung to the hem of riches, and the distant one who hath drawn nigh unto this mighty ocean. Had the people known, they would have hastened with their hearts toward the court of the Beloved. Heedlessness hath so seized them as to debar them from this straight path. O My loved ones! Gather ye together in the love of God. Beware lest ye differ in any matter. He desireth for you love and unity. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Hold fast unto that which ye have been commanded. It will profit you in the Hereafter and in this world, and will draw you nigh unto His resplendent horizon. Thy name hath attained unto the presence of thy Lord, and this wondrous Tablet hath been revealed for thee. Know thou the value of this station. By My life! It is truly an exalted station. Grieve not that thou didst not reach the place which thou didst desire. He hath accepted thy deed in His path and hath witnessed thy arrival at the court of His throne. Thus hath He Who is the Desire of the worlds decreed. Rejoice thou and be of them that are thankful.</p>

God forgives what you desired from Him - rejoice and be among the thankful ones. These are days when the ocean of generosity is surging, the heaven of bounty is exalted, and the winds of grace are blowing. How blessed is the soul that has become perfumed by the fragrances of the days of God, and has become detached and free from the worlds. As for what you desired regarding service to your Lord, We beseech God to assist you in all conditions and make you among those who have become renowned for serving His Cause among the worlds. Regarding what you desired about the trace of My pen that was sent to you - We have made it this station: that you should acknowledge what God has acknowledged and what the tongue of revelation has confirmed from this remote place. And regarding what you mentioned about meeting - it is indeed difficult and arduous because the Beloved is in the hands of the oppressors. Do not grieve at this, put your trust in God. He will ordain for you from His grace what He desires. He is the Guardian of those who turn to Him. Then mention Me to your mother and give her the glad tidings of this wondrous remembrance. Say: Blessed art thou for God has provided thee with one who remembers his Lord and has turned to Him when most of creation turned away. This is from My favor upon you and upon her. He is verily the Forgiving, the Generous. Then convey My greetings to your wife and your son that they may rejoice in what the tongue of revelation has spoken in their remembrance, and that the Countenance of the Ancient of Days has turned toward them from this noble horizon.</p>

<p>O spiritual leaf, upon thee be the Glory of God! In the name of the loving Lord! The Books of the world’s peoples have given glad tidings of the appearance of the Most Great Name, and all the Messengers and near ones have spoken of His mention and uttered His praise. He is the hidden bounty and the treasured food and the concealed secret and the determined mystery. Isaiah says: “The everlasting Father and eternal God shall come.” The Spirit (Christ) says: “The Comforter and the Perfecter and Spirit of Truth shall come.” The Qur’an calls out His Name and makes all aware. And the Author of the Bayan with loudest call counsels and with utmost humility and supplication mentions that perchance they may not through vain imaginings remain deprived of the Lord of all beings. He says that He is not confined by the intimations of the Bayan and what is revealed therein. All the Bayan is but a ring on His finger and a mention from Him and a leaf from the leaves of the gardens of His knowledge. Nevertheless His people did that which caused the dwellers of Paradise to lament. We beseech God that He make steadfast the servants and handmaidens of that land in such wise that the cawing of the crows and the clamor of the transgressors prevent them not. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to all and say: Blessed is the handmaiden who has taken the wine of steadfastness in the name of Him Who conversed on Sinai and has drunk thereof in His name, the Mighty, the Beloved. Thou art she who has drunk thereof and attained thereunto. Blessed art thou and blessed are they who have attained unto this mighty announcement. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon thee and upon every handmaiden who, when she heard, arose and said: “Here am I, here am I, O Desire of the worlds!”</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Most Ancient, the Most Powerful, the Most Exalted!</p>
<p>The Word of God hath been revealed in truth with such splendor that all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck thereby, save a numbered few. From it wafted the fragrance of God, thy Lord. Well is it with him who perceiveth the divine fragrances therefrom and is drawn by the holy breezes. By the True God! Were people to discover what radiates therefrom, they would detach themselves from their own selves and from all that hath been created between earth and heaven, and would hasten to the spot which God hath sanctified from the touch of the polytheists.</p>
<p>Say: O people, hasten with your hearts toward the direction of God and tarry not for even a moment. Seize these days, for the eye of creation hath not witnessed their like. Thus do We impart unto you from the wondrous precepts of God’s Cause, that ye may turn unto Him with purified and exalted countenances.</p>
<p>And thou, O servant, hearken unto the call of thy Lord, then stand firm in His Cause in such wise that neither the violent winds of hatred nor the tempests of destiny shall move thee. Thus doth He decree for thee in truth, that thou mayest stand firm in the Cause. Remember within thyself, then remind the people of the verses of God, thy Lord, and that which hath appeared from His presence, that they may arise from the slumber of self and passion and drink from this ocean. Thus have We commanded thee and bestowed upon thee, as a grace from Us, and upon every possessor of luminous vision. And glory be upon thee and upon those who have turned toward the divine paradise with pure and tranquil hearts.</p>

<p>O Haji Muhammad Hasan, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah]. He is the Hearing, the Answering. The truthful and the false have ever existed in the world. The Shi’ih sect considered themselves the most truthful and learned in the world. There was no test, and likewise no distinction between the servants. Therefore for one thousand two hundred years they accepted some and established for them the station of divinity, while others they denounced as unbelievers. The cause of this was the turbaned ones. The helpless servants followed the words of those false ones and throughout the ages were pleased and delighted with their own deeds and words. But when the appointed time came and the test appeared, all cursed and reviled the Truth, and finally issued the decree for His death. Reflect upon these matters so that thou mayest find the truth and become aware, for whoever becomes aware will no longer cling to those vain imaginings and will find himself free and unfettered. His honor Amin, upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness, mentioned you and beseeched God that He might assist you and grant you success in that which is befitting the Days of God. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. We convey Our greetings to the friends in that land and give them the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness. Blessed is he who hath heard and responded. Woe unto the heedless. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. [There are some phrases written in red ink in the margin of the blessed Tablet which cannot be clearly read.]</p>

But observe and remember that We forbade everyone from shedding blood, as all the Tablets testify - and you are among those who know. Wickedness reached such a point that suddenly the Most Exalted Pen cried out with the loudest cry between earth and heaven, after the doors of meeting were closed before His face: “The necks have been stretched forth in hypocrisy. Where are the swords of Thy vengeance, O Destroyer of the worlds?” When the verses were revealed, all things were shaken. Therefore We took hold of the reins of wrath with a sovereignty from Our presence. But what leaked leaked, and what appeared appeared. Say: Praise be to Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp of power lie the reins of the worlds! O My Name! We forbade all people from such matters to such an extent that when the fire of wickedness became inflamed and there occurred what occurred in certain years, We continuously kept those evil souls under the cloak of protection. Nevertheless they were not at peace, and every day some corruption and sedition appeared. The matter reached such a point that We withdrew from all and closed the doors of association. The angels of divine wrath suddenly seized them and made them a lesson to the worlds. May the All-Merciful not have mercy on their graves!

The parties of the world, meaning the diverse peoples, sought throughout the nights and days to attain His presence, and with utmost humility and supplication they begged and hoped for the understanding of the Day of God. Yet when the Sun of Truth dawned from the horizon of Will, all arose in opposition and strove with the utmost effort and exertion to extinguish the divine light.

If humanity had perceived the sweetness of the divine words which descended from the Source of the Command, they would surely have acted according to what they were commanded. The concealment of God has so prevailed that even if a hundred thousand errors were to be observed from someone, mention of it would never flow from the Pen of the Command; rather it would be forgiven - except for those souls who have turned away from the Truth. This action of God, as all bear witness, were it not that their desires prevent them from truth and sincerity - in such case the servants who are focused on the Most Great Horizon must follow the Truth, let alone speaking of what they have not seen and mentioning what they have not heard. The Supreme Pen has ever been and continues to be engaged in mention of the loved ones of God. If they would look at the revealed Tablets, it would become evident and manifest to all.

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed</p>
<p>Your honor’s call was heard and the fragrances of the love of the Goal of all the worlds were inhaled from the letter that was sent. All who dwell on earth today have been tested by the blessed Word that has dawned from the horizon of the merciful Will. Some, following their desires, remained veiled from the Lord of all beings, while others turned with utmost longing and yearning toward the divine horizon of manifestation. Blessed is the soul whom the veils of the world did not prevent from the Lord of Names and who was illumined by the lights dawning from the most exalted horizon. This is a sovereignty that shall not be seized by extinction but shall endure and persist through the eternity of the most beautiful Names and most exalted attributes. Praise be to the Beloved of the world Who confirmed your honor in this greatest gift and mightiest bounty. Preserve this station through His Name, the Protector over the worlds. Say:</p>
<p>O my God! I beseech Thee by the Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of Thy Will and by which the people of Thy Kingdom and Thy Dominion were illumined, to make me one who soareth in the atmosphere of Thy love and is set ablaze with the heat of Thy Word in such wise that the people of Thy realm may be enkindled thereby, that all may turn to the horizon of Thy oneness and may acknowledge Thy singleness. O my Lord! I have turned, by Thy power, to the heaven of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Then assign me a seat of truth in the vicinity of Thy greatest mercy. Verily Thou art the Lord of the Throne and the dust. There is none other God but Thee, the Powerful, the Bestower, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>

The divine silver bell has joined with the heavenly trumpet, and the song of the Eternal King’s dove has warbled upon the branches of the divine Lote Tree, that the essences of all created things and the realities of all beings might become manifest in the inmost hearts of the pure and sincere ones, and that sanctified hearts might be freed from darkening veils and limitations, and dance with joy in the arena of glory before the never-beginning, never-ending Beauty of the Countenance. This is the portion of existence from the world of appearance. Happy are ye, and your companions, and your loved ones, and those who have drunk from the cups of the love of God and the goblets of the affection of God. How excellent is this bounty of grace from the hands of exaltation! How delicate is this wine of glory from the crimson Countenance! How beautiful is this crystal of light from the spiritual Face! I swear by God, whoever tastes a drop thereof shall witness what none in all the worlds hath witnessed. And further, I counsel you to preserve the Cause of God from all directions, and to gather the people upon the all-embracing eternal Word, that perfect love might surge forth from illumined breasts. And establish unity with his honor Ha. Utterly remove discord from among the companions, and for the love of God put into practice the world of limitations, for the corruption of the people will not be stilled except through this Cause. And keep the Cause of God in view with perfect love. I remember all the attractive Countenances and enraptured Faces in the melodies of attraction.</p>

Say: This is a Day wherein the world hath been adorned through the effects of the Pen of the Lord of Eternity, and the breezes of forgiveness have wafted over all contingent beings. Arise from the couches of heedlessness and behold what hath shone forth from the horizon of utterance. Say: Do ye imagine there is any peer unto Him? Nay, by the Lord of creation! Do ye fancy there is any likeness unto Him? Nay, by His Name, the All-Pervading throughout all regions! Rejoice ye in these days of God - these are days of gladness for you. Take ye the chalice in His Name, then drink in remembrance of Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. Let not My imprisonment and abasement and banishment grieve you. By God! I am in My native land which no exile can affect, and in a might which no abasement can assail. The Tongue of the Unseen beareth witness to this from this Spot which God hath made the point of adoration for all who are in earth and heaven. Tribulation hath not hindered Me from the remembrance of God, the Lord of Names, nor have sorrows overtaken Me. I have sacrificed one of My Branches in the path of the All-Merciful. Verily, I am the Ruler over what I will, and am empowered through My sovereignty which prevaileth over the worlds. Were ye to taste the sweetness of the Kawthar of inner meanings which We have caused to flow from the Fount of exposition, ye would be so attracted as to become severed from all that ye possess, out of love for God, the One, the Peerless, the Mighty, the Choice One. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee, for through it there descendeth upon thee from the heaven of grace that which will draw thee nigh unto the Dawning-Place of inspiration. Make thou My remembrance thy companion, and the remembrance of those who have stood firm in this Cause whereby the lands have been illumined.</p>

Is there any refuge for anyone save, by My Self, this resplendent Station? Arise in My Name amongst My servants, then impart unto them what We have imparted unto thee from the heaven of Our favor, that they may soar in the atmosphere of My grandeur and recognize their Ancient Lord. We have manifested Our Self more greatly than We manifested it aforetime. Woe unto the heedless! We have changed the Name, whereat most of the servants remain veiled, though We commanded them to rend asunder the veils of names through the power of the Creator of heaven, Who came with the truth through this wise Remembrance. We behold some among them speaking as women speak, uttering what the widows of past religions uttered. Say: Fear ye God, and follow not the imaginings of them that have turned aside. Thus hath the gate of utterance been unlocked by the finger of the will of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. When thou attainest unto what hath been revealed unto thee, ponder what hath befallen Us, then thank thy Lord for having remembered thee before the Face when sorrows encompassed it through what the hands of them that disbelieved in God, the Most High, the Most Great, had wrought. Verily, the glory from Us be upon them who have stood fast in this Cause whereby feet have slipped save such as were preserved by the hands of thy Lord’s grace, the Inaccessible, the Most High.</p>

Verily thy Lord is the Powerful, the Almighty. Reflect upon those who have occupied themselves with the world and have turned away from their Lord, the Most Glorious. Can they consume of their wealth more than what God hath ordained? Nay, by thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! Or can they carry it with them after the angel of death hath come from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praised One? Nay, by thy Lord! They shall abandon what they possess with grief and sorrow and shall return to their abode in the nethermost hell. Say: O people! Let not the world delude you with its vanities. How many servants above you were deluded by its ornaments, yet when their time came naught thereof profited them. Verily thy Lord is the Ruler over what He willeth. Leave those who have disbelieved and be manifest among the servants through the name of thy Lord, and call out among them with My remembrance, the Mighty, the Wondrous. He will verily protect thee through the truth and nothing shall prevent Him from what He desireth. But the people are in a mighty veil.

Blessed is He Who hath revealed it with truth and made it the Dayspring of His Cause amongst the servants and the Rising-Place of His Revelation throughout all lands. Well is it with them that understand. At times by the Remembrance We mean the Most Great Remembrance, and by the Book We mean this Mighty Book, and by the City We mean that which We have manifested upon the temple of man and sent forth with evident sovereignty. And at times We mean by it that which floweth from His Most Exalted Pen and from His Tongue which God hath made the Dawning-Place of His Revelation and the Dayspring of His mighty and impregnable knowledge. And at times We mean by it that which none hath comprehended save God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Say: The Tree hath been raised up in truth, and the birds of the hearts of them that know cannot attain unto its heights save whom thy Lord willeth. Verily He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who hath heard its rustling and the warbling of the birds that circle round it. As for those who are heedless, they are truly among the dead. They have deprived themselves of the pure wine that giveth life to the sincere ones. Say: O my God!

And unto each is appointed in the Book a portion according to their deeds - a just decree from God, the Mighty, the Loving. O David! Reveal that which was buried beneath the tree through the schemes of them that join partners with their Lord, that the deception of them that practice deceit in this Cause may be made manifest among the people. And if thou art not able to bear this, then wait until God shall manifest it even as He hath manifested through His irrevocable decree. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord in the days of God and be thou of them that render praise. Grieve not over anything, but find solace in the remembrance of thy Lord.

After thy ascension thou didst witness God’s power and sovereignty, and wert immersed in the ocean of His mercy, yet the people remain veiled and have no share today from thy cup. Thereupon doth the Tongue of Grandeur testify that thou didst turn unto the Face and didst respond to thy Lord when He called thee, and didst attain His presence in this earthly life, and didst hear with thine own ear His most mighty, most holy and wondrous call.

Is there any one possessed of power who will shatter the idols of vain imaginings through the sovereignty of My Name, the All-Compelling over the worlds? Is there any one possessed of knowledge who will cast aside knowledge, hastening to Him Who is Known, Who hath dawned from the horizon of His Name, the Self-Subsisting? He is assuredly among those near to God. By God! The Youth in the midst of tribulation summoneth mankind unto the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Were people to become aware of the state in which the Tongue of the Intended One speaketh, they would lament for what hath befallen this Wronged One, this Stranger. O servants of the All-Merciful! Be not saddened by the world and whatsoever hath escaped you of its ornaments and bounties. Soon shall it and all that is therein perish, and permanence shall remain for those who have stood firm in this Cause, through which the feet of them that hesitated have slipped in this manifest Matter. Blessed is the seeker who hath hastened to the Sought One, and the hearer who hath heard the melody of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Blessed is the soul that hath been severed for My love, that hath arisen to aid Me, that hath appeared through My detachment and soared in My atmosphere. Such a one is of the people of Baha and the possessor of names. The angels of Paradise circle round him every morn and eve. Arise to serve thy Lord in such wise that the power of every remote oppressor will not weaken thee. Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee as a grace from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.</p>

Hearken to His Call from the direction of the Prison, then speak forth in praise of His Self among the chosen ones. Proclaim the Cause of thy Lord with wisdom and utterance. Thus doth thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Choosing, command thee. Say: O people! Hearken to the rustling of the Most Exalted Pen. By God! Through it are drawn the hearts of those near unto God to the Dawning-Place of lights. How long will ye slumber upon the couch of heedlessness? Raise up your heads, for the Sun of Eternity hath shone forth from the horizon of the Most High and illumined thereby are the faces of the learned. Protect the loved ones of God with wisdom, then assist them according to thy capacity. Thus did We command thee before and in this time wherein secrets are revealed. How sweet is thy mention in this Cause! Verily thou wast created for this, as doth testify the Tongue that speaketh in all things that sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Powerful, the All-Compelling. Beware lest thou deprive thyself of that which hath been ordained for thee. By God! The clouds have been rent asunder and God hath come with power and might. Turn not unto the world and its conditions, then shun the evil ones. Be thou attracted by the Call of thy Lord, then seek His aid through His power and grandeur. Arise amidst the servants, then speak forth in His praise. Thus doth command thee the Pen of the All-Choosing. Wert thou to hear what We have counseled thee with, thou wouldst surely subdue all created things through one of the names of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.

Give thanks to the All-Bestowing for having aided thee to recognize Him and for having caused thee to turn towards the City round which circle the denizens of the Supreme Concourse and the favored servants of God. We bestow upon thee from this distant horizon that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Whoso remembereth his Lord is accounted among those who are near unto God in the Preserved Tablet. Seize thy days and make mention therein of Him Who was the Educator of all things visible and invisible. Immerse thyself in the ocean of inner meanings which hath appeared through this Hidden Name. Leave the polytheists to their vain imaginings and turn with thy heart to the Lord of all existence. Say: I have turned towards Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the reins of all created things, and I have believed in Thee, O Thou through Whom the command of the Kaf and the Nun was made manifest. When thou hast attained unto the Tablet of thy Lord, remind all possibility of the verses of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful, that perchance they may arise from the slumber of passion at the mention of the Lord of Names and be numbered among those who have turned towards Him. Say: Abandon vain imaginings, for the Self-Subsisting hath appeared with clear sovereignty. It behooveth every soul on this Day to manifest that which is worthy of the Cause of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Say: O concourse of polytheists! How long will ye cry out and unto whom will ye turn? The Hidden One hath appeared and these are His verses, and the Treasured One hath risen and these are His banners which have been hoisted above the standards of kings. Say: He Who is upon the dust maketh mention of the Lord of Lords, and in abasement hath manifested the might of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Be thou steadfast in the Cause through the power and might of God. He, verily, aideth him that aideth Him. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.</p>

<p>O son of Dhabih! You are beneath the gaze of your Lord’s loving-kindness, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Know ye the station of this mighty, this exalted Station. O Habib! Reflect upon Dhabih - upon whom be My glory - and that which proceeded from him. After hearing the Call, he tarried not for less than a moment, but turned his face toward the realm of oneness. And this occurred in days when the people of the Bayan were heedless and veiled from the root of the Cause, inasmuch as divine wisdom required concealment. God willing, may you engage in the remembrance of God - glorified be His majesty - with utmost sanctity and detachment, and gaze toward the horizon of His Will. We have made mention of Dhabih and those related to him in the hidden and treasured Tablet, which in one place is referred to as the Crimson Tablet. At the beginning of the Cause, God - glorified be His majesty - regarded acceptance alone, for before the revelation of divine ordinances and laws, He revealed and cast forth the Word. Whosoever accepted it without hesitation attained unto all good. But after the heaven of divine decree was raised up and the sun of the Cause shone forth, it became binding and obligatory upon all to hold fast unto it and act according to it. The Command is in His hands - He doeth and decreeth as He pleaseth and as He willeth. He is the Commander, the Possessor, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Glory be upon thee and upon him who attained the presence [of God] in the Most Great Prison, and upon those who have testified to that which God hath testified: that there is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

We were with him on the day he was born and at the time when he soared on the wings of detachment to the All-Highest Horizon and attained the blessing of nearness and sanctity and the presence of his Lord, and witnessed His greatest signs. By My life! The most great joy seized him in such wise as transcendeth the comprehension of men. The Tongue of Grandeur now maketh mention of him, saying: O Husayn, He Who is the H and the S remembereth thee from His mighty prison, that through His remembrance the chosen ones of God and His loved ones may remember thee - they who have testified to that which God Himself hath testified: that there is none other God besides Me, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. I bear witness that thou wast born in sanctity and didst ascend unto God with a countenance unaltered by earthly conditions and tribulations, until thou didst enter within the precincts of the mercy of thy Lord, the All-Loving, the All-Merciful. I bear witness that thou wert mature before attaining maturity, and wert strong in the Book of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. Blessed is he who turneth towards thee and standeth at thy resting-place and visiteth thee through that which hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen in this glorious station. We counsel Mine Afnan to patience and fortitude, and We console them in what hath befallen the Divine Lote-Tree through God’s irrevocable decree.

We have heard the mention of him who mentioned Us and the call of him who called upon Us, and We answered them before and after their mention, and We assigned to each one a station, and God hath preferred some over others and ordained for whomsoever He wished whatsoever He wished.

And whatsoever was sent hath arrived and continueth to arrive. This servant and you should write of its receipt so they may be informed. Through the Afnan, that which concerned Muhammad Khan was accepted. Permission to stay was granted that he might rest in the shadow of the Tree. Were it not for the movement and inner turmoil of this land, some would have attained unto this station. Likewise the pilgrimage of two souls was also adorned with the ornament of acceptance. The Afnans have borne and continue to bear burdens in service to the Cause. God willing may they be assisted and be engaged with utmost joy and fragrance and complete steadfastness. Blessed is he who in the Day of God hath attained unto His mention and service to His Cause, for these two shall not pass away but shall endure as long as the kingdom and the heavenly realm endure. Regarding the purchase of property and its cost which thou didst inquire about - We did not wish to mention this matter as it would cause hardship to some.

They mentioned Jinab-i-Alif and Sin. If he acts according to what was commanded and according to that which We counseled him in an instant, the divine assistance will undoubtedly aid him without delay. Beseech God that the outward conditions of the world, which in truth are reckoned as vain imaginings, may not withhold him from the immortal Kingdom. If he discovers the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful and partakes of the fruits of the immortal Tree, a hundred thousand worlds will not prevent him nor keep him back from the Friend.

<p>O Ashraf! The ocean of utterance has surged, and the fragrance of the All-Merciful has wafted, and the scratching of the Pen and the rustling of the Tree have been raised high, yet the people do not hear. They have cast the Book of God and His Cause behind their backs and taken for themselves lords other than God. Verily they are worshippers of vain imaginings and do not understand. They have turned away from Him through Whom appeared what was hidden in the eternity of eternities and treasured in God’s knowledge, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the earth! Fear the All-Merciful and follow not the desires of those who have turned away from the Face, having followed the daysprings of heedlessness and idle fancies. Say: Behold, behold how the Sun has dawned from the horizon of proof and proclaims: “There is none other God but I, the Protector over what was and what shall be.” Beware lest the conditions of vain imaginings prevent you from the Day of God, the Possessor of existence. This is the Day which God’s Messengers and His Books have testified to, did ye but know. Say: Hear the call of Him Who is wronged and deprive not yourselves of the breezes of Revelation.

And He announceth unto the servants the Day of Mutual Summoning, whereon the Summoner shall proclaim: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of what hath been and what shall be! That which was treasured in the storehouse of knowledge hath appeared and been made manifest, and He hath spoken before the faces of kings: The Kingdom is God’s, the Possessor of the Kingdom! The tribulations prevented Him not from making mention of God, the Originator of the heavens. He arose and proclaimed: The Promise hath come, and this is the Promised One!</p>
<p>When thou art illumined by the lights of the Luminary of utterance in the days of the manifestation of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having given me to drink from the cup of Thy knowledge and guided me to Thine all-highest horizon and the most exalted summit, and for having made mention of me in the prison of ’Akka. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I acknowledge Thy most great signs and the traces of Thy Most Exalted Pen, whereby the limbs of the polytheists among Thy creation and the hearts of the transgressors among Thy servants have trembled. I beseech Thee by Thy Cause through which Thou didst manifest Thyself unto Moses on the Mount of Thy knowledge and unto Abraham in the fire of Thy love, to make me in all conditions detached from all else save Thee and holding fast unto the cord of Thy bounty. O my Lord! Aid me to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee, and to arise to perform that which hath escaped me in Thy days. Thou art He through Whose power all created things have testified, and through Whose loving-kindness all beings have borne witness. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Thy name hath been mentioned before the Wronged One, and He hath revealed for thee that which God hath made a sign of His might between His heaven and His earth, and a manifestation of His sovereignty to all who dwell in the unseen and the visible realm. Beware lest the doubts of the world or the clamor of the nations prevent thee. Arise to serve the Cause with such resolution that neither the hosts shall frighten thee nor the veils of them that have disbelieved in God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting, shall hold thee back. This is the Day which Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and before Him the Spirit, and before Him He Who conversed with God, made mention of, yet most of the people understand not. Observe what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of all being and all that is to be.” We commanded Him Who conversed with God to lead the people out of darkness into light and to give them the glad-tidings of this Day wherein the Hour hath appeared and its signs, and that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Loving. The Truth hath appeared and revealed what He desired, despite the divines of the earth and its doctors of law who turned away from God and pronounced judgment against Him with such tyranny as caused the dwellers of the Kingdom to lament. We counsel thee to remember God and praise Him in thy days. The world and all that thou beholdest today shall pass away, but there shall endure for thee what hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen in thy name in this forbidden station. Thus have We illumined the horizon of the Tablet with the sun of utterance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee, then render thanks unto thy Lord at eventide and at dawn, at nightfall and at morn.</p>

How many were the servants who, both before and after, yearned for the divine presence and heard its glad-tidings in the holy Books, yet when the divine morn dawned and the sea of reunion surged, all were deprived save a few. Some among the people were held back by pride, others by worldly ornaments, some by idle fancies and vain imaginings, and yet others by tyranny and wickedness. The cause and reason for all this were and are the divines of the age. Give thanks unto God for having protected thee, confirmed thee, drawn thee nigh unto Him, and given thee to drink of the choice sealed wine through His Name, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting.

How many were the divines, mystics and princes who yearned and longed for the Day of His Manifestation, and who beseeched God night and day for the privilege of attaining His presence. Yet when the dawn of that Day broke forth from the horizon of the Will of the King of Oneness, all turned away and remained veiled. Would that they had been content with merely this! Nay, by God! Rather, they pronounced sentence of death upon that Essence of being. Such is the condition of the servants. Yet God has been and ever shall be the All-Encompassing, the All-Pervading. That which He has willed, He shall assuredly bring to pass. The rejection and turning away of all the peoples of the world cannot prevent Him from that which He has purposed. He is established upon the throne of “He doeth what He willeth” and speaketh the word “He ordaineth what He pleaseth.” His sovereignty hath no need of hosts. He giveth and taketh away as He pleaseth, and He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. May you drink, God willing, of that most pure wine which lieth concealed within the words of the Lord of destiny, and share it with those who are seeking and turning unto Him. Convey the greetings of this Wronged One to all the friends in that land and say: Fix your gaze upon this blessed, mighty and conclusive word: “God summoneth to the abode of peace.” How excellent is the state of that soul who hath turned with his heart to the abode of peace and been freed from dwellings more frail than the web of the spider.

In the earliest days We arose, with no veil or covering, before the faces of the followers of all religions and proclaimed the Cause of God. We opened wide the gates of utterance to all the peoples of possibility. Some attained eternal life through the living waters of utterance, while others, due to the requital of their deeds, were debarred and deprived. The divines of the earth and the rulers, one and all, arose in opposition and brought to pass that which caused the denizens of the highest Paradise and the exalted Garden to weep and lament. How numerous were the afflictions and tribulations that were visited upon the Wronged One, most of which We concealed lest the loved ones and chosen ones of God be saddened thereby. And when the light of the Cause had encompassed the horizons, the objectors of the Bayan emerged from behind the veil with designs against the Wronged One. Such is the conduct of the servants and the fidelity of that people. Now in most lands the barking ones are spread abroad, and this was among the tidings We mentioned in Zawra and the Land of Mystery and this land, whereof We informed all. All must take refuge in God, exalted be His glory, from the trials of these days and the corruption of souls. Perchance in this land too a barking will be raised up. We beseech God to preserve you and His loved ones from the evil of those who love discord. We ask of the Truth that He may assist them to unity and harmony. Verily He is powerful over all things.</p>

We have remembered thee in various Tablets and have mentioned that which thou didst accomplish on this Straight Path. Thou art he to whom God’s Book hath borne witness, both before and after. Wert thou to become aware of that which hath been ordained for thee, thou wouldst cry out: “Praise be unto Thee, O Most Generous of the generous ones!” We have revealed for thee and for those with thee that through which the fragrance of My mercy, which hath preceded the heavens and the earth, hath been diffused. Remind My loved ones on My behalf and give them the joyful tidings of My loving care and glorious remembrance. Glorify thy Lord with praise and say:</p>
<p>O Thou through Whose Name the entire creation hath been subdued! I beseech Thee by Thyself and by Thy mighty signs to assist me and Thy loved ones to be steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that the tablets of fire shall not prevent them from beholding the lights of Thy countenance. O Lord! Thou art the Generous One, the Lord of great bounty. Thou seest me turning unto Thee, placing my trust in Thee, gazing toward the heaven of Thy mercy, and directing my face toward the sun of Thy loving-kindness and the ocean of Thy grace. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me and Thy loved ones of that which lieth with Thee. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou pleasest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p>O Muhammad, the One, the Single, calls thee from this station which hath at times been named the Kingdom, at others the Realm of Might, at times the Supreme Horizon, at others the Most Glorious Prospect, at times the Praiseworthy Station, and at others the heaven of this Heaven. Reflect how thy Lord hath adorned the Most Great Prison with the most excellent names and the most exalted stations. He, verily, is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is. Rejoice thou in this Tablet and say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the seen and unseen, for having made known unto me the heaven of Thy Manifestation and the sun of Thy firm and irrevocable Command.</p>
<p>O Muhammad, We have heard thy call, and the Most Exalted Pen hath been moved to make mention of thee. Consider this bounty to be great and be thou confident in His favor. Verily He hath absolved thee of thy misdeeds and guided thee unto His straight path. Say: O God of names and Creator of heaven, Who hast appeared from the Supreme Horizon! I beseech Thee by the light of Thy countenance and the splendor of Thy manifestation to ordain for me through the Pen of Decree that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and profit me in all Thy worlds. Verily, nothing is hidden from Thy knowledge. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>

I beseech Thee to ordain for me the reward of attaining Thy presence and arriving at the shore of the ocean of Thy reunion.

We have turned toward thee time and again and have sent down that which illumines hearts and brings solace to eyes. Take hold of thy Lord’s Book with His strength and say: O people of the earth! By God, the Truth has come and the Day of Reckoning has appeared. Come, that I may show you His most exalted horizon and His Balance which has been established in His Name, the One Who holds dominion over all who are in the earths and heavens. Beware, O people, lest ye deprive yourselves of the choice wine of revelation. Leave behind what ye possess and take what has been given you by God, the Cleaver of Dawn. This is the Day that was promised you in the Books of old and in the Furqan which was sent down unto Muhammad, the Messenger of God, from God, the Lord of Lords. Beware lest ye do what the people before you did. Fear God and follow not every doubtful idolator. Leave behind vain imaginings, then hasten with radiant faces to the Most Great Ocean which has appeared in the name of your Lord, the Goal of all desire. Blessed art thou, O Mahmud, for having uttered the praise of thy Lord when most of the servants turned away from Him.

Fear ye God, then judge with fairness concerning this Unlettered One, to Whom testify the Books of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The tongue of utterance in the Kingdom of knowledge declareth: O concourse of divines! Fear ye the one true God. This Wronged One hath neither associated with you and your like, nor seen your books, nor entered your classes. His hat, His locks, and His attire all bear witness to what hath been said. Where hath fairness gone? In what place doth the embodiment of justice repose? Open your eyes, look with the eye of insight, and ponder, that ye may not be deprived of the rays of the Sun of Utterance nor be barred from the surging waves of the ocean of knowledge. Some among the princes and common folk have objected that this Wronged One was not among the divines and descendants of the Prophet. Say: O people of fairness! Were ye to reflect even briefly, ye would consider this station a hundred thousand times more exalted and greater. God hath manifested His Cause from a House wherein was found naught of what the divines, the jurists, the mystics and the learned possessed. The Breath of God awakened Him and commanded Him to raise His voice. When He awoke, He arose and called all to God, the Lord of the worlds. This utterance hath regard to the weakness of the people of the contingent world; otherwise His Cause is sanctified above mention and exalted above thoughts. To this testifieth He with Whom is the Mother Book.</p>

We heard your call and have answered it with this Most Mighty, Most Holy Tablet. O Mahdi! Today none but God is mentioned. This is that Day concerning which He spoke to the Son of Imran on the Mount of Knowledge, saying: “Lead forth the people from darkness into light and remind them of the days of God.” And the Seal of the Prophets gave glad tidings of it, saying: “The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.” All books and scriptures, psalms and tablets speak of this Revelation and what hath been manifested therein. Blessed is the soul that hath heard and attained unto it.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Time and again hath thy mention been made at the Most Holy Court, and there hath been revealed and sent down from the Divine Pen that whose fragrance shall endure and persist. Blessed art thou and blessed are they who have heard and said: “Praise be to Thee, O Lord of the worlds, and glory be to Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth.” We make mention of thy father and beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to draw him nigh unto Him and to send down upon him, at all times, mercy from His presence, grace from His own Self, and a sign from His direction. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

Say: No, by thy life, except through Thy might and power! I bear witness that Thou hast subdued all created things with a power before which the hosts of those in the heavens and on earth cannot stand. He who loved Me and soared in My atmosphere hath made mention of thee. We make mention of thee in this perspicuous Book. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of God and in His love, such that neither the hints of the learned nor the power of princes shall cause thee to slip. Verily thy Lord is the Ordainer, the All-Wise, and the All-Knowing Counsellor.

Grieve not over anything, but in all matters place thy trust in God, the Lord of Lords.

Rather, by this “ram ram” We mean that which increases love for God and love for His chosen ones and love for His friends, and which kindles in hearts the fire of God and His love, then His glory and His grandeur. For it is of that wine which, should anyone drink a drop thereof, would draw him to the precincts of holiness and nearness and bring him to the presence of God, the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful. And verily it is that wine by which the signs of limitation are erased from the hearts of lovers and the verses of unity and detachment are inscribed, admitting them into the pavilion of the Beloved before God, the King, the Protector, the Forgiving, the Generous. And by this wine We intended the Kawthar of God and His outpouring, and the Salsabil of God and His Tasnim, and the wine of God and His grace, even as was revealed in the Furqan, if you be of those who know. He said - and His word is the truth - “wine delightful to those who drink.” And by this wine He intended naught but what We have mentioned to you, O concourse of the assured ones.

God willing, may the saved community be assisted to perform such deeds as will cause the exaltation of the Cause. In all ages, the helper of truth has been goodly deeds and spiritual qualities. Blessed is he who holds fast unto them, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>O friend! Thou art mentioned in the presence of this Wronged One. Due to the weakness of certain souls, at times the Pen is forbidden from writing and likewise the tongue from speaking. We beseech God to assist and confirm thee in that which He loves and is pleased with, and to ordain for thee the good of this world and the next. Verily He is the Lord of all creation and the Sovereign of the throne on high and of earth below.</p>

<p>In My Name, the Warbler upon the Branches</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath manifested that which was hidden through a power that neither the hosts of the world nor the ranks of the nations who cast the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to their vain imaginings and idle fancies, could withstand. I bear witness to that which God did testify before the creation of earth and heaven, that there is none other God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. He hath spoken, and caused all things to speak His praise and remembrance, yet most of the people hear not. The Light hath shone forth and the Fire hath called out from the Divine Lote-Tree: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Possessor of all that was and shall be.” We have heard thy call and have answered thee, revealing unto thee that which the treasuries and riches of the earth cannot equal. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Truth at a time when the people turned away from it - they who have violated the Covenant and the pledges. Let not the affairs of men grieve thee or prevent thee from beholding the Most Great Horizon, this holy, mighty and exalted Station. When thou hast quaffed the choice wine of revelation from the hand of bounty, say: “Glorified art Thou, O Creator of the heavens and Sovereign of the Kingdom of Names! I beseech Thee by the arising of the Hands of Thy Cause to serve Thee, and by the mysteries concealed within the hearts of Thy near ones among Thy loved ones, to make me steadfast and vocal in Thy service and praise. I further beseech Thee by Thy Will which hath subdued all who are in earth and heaven to assist me in all conditions to act as befitteth Thy days. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp lie the reins of all affairs.”</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath brought forth from the shells of the ocean of His Most Great Name the pearls of wisdom and utterance, and made them a proof from His presence and a testimony from His realm. Verily, He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth, and in His grasp is the dominion of all the first and the last.</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down in truth from the heaven of God’s Will, the Lord of the worlds. Herein is mentioned he who hath cast away ignorance and turned toward the celestial dominion of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Thy name was present before the Wronged One, and he who loveth Me made mention of thee. We make mention of thee through this remembrance by which the Call hath been raised from the Supreme Horizon and that which was hidden in God’s knowledge, the Lord of the mighty Throne, hath been made manifest.</p>
<p>When thou hearest My call, turn thy face toward Me and say: “My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me to the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Manifestation of Thy clear tokens. I beseech Thee by the Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of Sinai and by the Fire that blazed within the Tree of Revelation, to make me in all conditions enabled to remember and praise Thee and to call out Thy Name amongst Thy servants.

He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We have turned toward those who have turned toward Us, and have forsaken every deceitful oppressor. Blessed is the servant who hath cast away vain desire, clinging to the hem of the robe of his Lord’s mercy, the All-Bounteous. We have heard thy mention and have remembered thee, and have witnessed thy turning toward Us. We have sent down for thee that which hath caused the seas to surge and the fragrance of God, the Lord of the beginning and the end, to waft abroad. Say: O people! The Self-Subsisting is come, and the command is God’s, the Almighty, the All-Choosing. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of this most great bounty. Cast away what the people possess and take what ye are bidden by God, Who illumineth the horizons. Thus hath the Pen spoken by command of the Ancient King. Blessed is he who hath heard, and woe unto every denier who hath turned away from God, the Lord of creation. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty be upon thee and upon those whom the censure of the censurer or the tyranny of the oppressor hath not kept back, who have turned with radiant hearts to the Most Sublime Horizon, despite those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all men.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who shone forth with the luminary of His grace in the world of oneness, whereupon appeared the Primal Point, and manifested it through four lines. Through one line He created the realm of divinity and through another the kingdom of might, until the four worlds were completed. The first letter that told of these was indeed the standing ‘Alif’, and when it revolved around itself, the letter ‘Kaf’ appeared, from which He created the greater world and then the lesser world. Exalted is the Lord of Power, through Whom the sun was eclipsed and the moon darkened, and every stone and clod proclaimed that there is no God but Him, the Omnipotent, Who has ever been self-subsisting through the self-subsistence of His Essence over all created things, and all-prevailing through the dominion of His Self over all contingent beings.</p>
<p>When He desired to separate and distinguish, to gather and endear, He spoke the Most Great Word, whereupon all things were set in motion, each kind was joined with its kind, each thing hastened to its horizon, each form to its station and origin, and each spirit to its dawning-place. This indeed is the Most Great Balance that hath been set up among men, whereby every soul is reckoned without being aware within itself, and all things are gathered without perceiving it within their essence. Exalted, exalted is the Fashioner of all things out of nothing through His power. Exalted, exalted is the Creator of names out of nothingness through His will.</p>
<p>He created the Most Exalted Pen and taught it what no earthly knowledge can encompass. At times there flowed from it the Water of Life, whereby He quickened whomsoever He willed among the people of creation, and at other times He caused it to yield the sweetest melody, whereby were attracted the dwellers of the cities of names and those who abide in the Most Exalted Paradise. Sanctified and exalted is our Most Glorious Lord above any mention, description or praise, through Whom earthquakes seized all the tribes of the earth, and those in earth and heaven were thunderstruck, the idols of vain desire were shattered, and the pillars of the divines were shaken–those who cast behind them the Preserved Tablet and clung to idle fancies and vain imaginings. By God’s life! They are the idols, though people perceive it not, and they are vain imaginings, though the people understand it not. Through them the Fountain of Divine Presence was barred and the Ocean of Reunion was veiled. These are the most great veils. Blessed is the one who is strong enough to rend them, powerful enough to tear them, and steadfast enough to remove them. Such a one is among the most exalted of creation before God, the Lord of Names, and is indeed established upon the Crimson Ark. Upon him be the glory of God and the glory of the Concourse on High, who remember God in all conditions. There is no God but our Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Help in Peril.</p>
<p>Thereafter, while the servant was occupied with the revelation of verses and enkindled with the fire of the love of God, the Lord of Names and Attributes, one of the friends entered with a letter. When it reached the servant’s hand and I opened it, I discovered from it the fragrance of the roses of inner meanings. Then I read it and became aware of what was contained therein regarding your mention of our Beloved and the Beloved of all the worlds. By thy life! Thy letter brought me such joy that I am unable to describe, for I recognized from it thy rising to serve the Cause and thy utterance for the sake of God, the Lord of all worlds. I presented it at a special time before the Throne and submitted its contents, whereupon from the horizon of the grace of the Lord of creation, the sun of loving-kindness shone forth and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which I cannot recount. And afterward in Persian they said: “God willing, through the loving-kindness of the All-Merciful, may they bestow eternal life upon the heedless souls from the Kawthar of recognition of the Lord of Oneness and may they be occupied with service to the Cause.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God that thou art remembered in the Most Great Prison and art honored and privileged with divine favors. And regarding what thou didst write about arriving in Astarabad and proceeding to the home of Mirza ’Abdu’r-Rahman - blessed is he for having honored thy dwelling purely for the sake of thy Lord. We beseech God to protect him and make him steadfast in the Cause whose greatness God hath testified to, and to grant him the good of this world and the next. In truth, the mere fact that they have been honored with the privilege of faith, have drunk the living waters, and have been mentioned before the Presence means they have attained all good things and blessings. Blessed is he, again blessed is he!</p>
<p>And regarding what thou didst write mentioning Mirza ’Abbas and Aqa Muhammad-Taqi Aqa and others - their names were presented, and this is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke: “We love those who have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and have directed themselves toward God, the Creator of earth and heaven. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to grant them the sweetness of His remembrance and to strengthen them in steadfastness in His Cause, that there may appear from them that whereby their names shall endure in His Kingdom and His Dominion. Verily He is the Powerful One, Whose sovereignty all in the heavens and earth have acknowledged.”</p>
<p>And regarding what was written about Ibn-i-Shin, God willing he has been and will continue to be protected. This servant submits that whoever today attains the honor of recognizing the Beloved of the worlds, all honor and good is directed toward him, and if at times there is some delay, this too is in accordance with divine wisdom - they should not be saddened by it, for they are under the glance of God’s loving-kindness and His infinite favors will surely encompass them. Especially regarding Ibn-i-Shin, I swear by the Sun of the heaven of divine grace that such favor has been shown him that its mention shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. However, the friends must be mindful of such souls, for excessive association with the likes of these may cause disturbance among some. Since all are commanded to wisdom today, they must therefore be mindful in these matters. And whatever they have given him, there is no harm in that - verily the Generous One gives generously what He possesses. Indeed, boundless generosity was manifested from that person. We beseech God to grant thee double what thou hast given in His path.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, that he has arrived in the land of Jadhba and Tabas, and according to what has been reported from him that he is commissioned with a special mission - this servant was greatly astonished, for in all the divine Tablets, conflict, contention and corruption have been forbidden and all have been commanded to wisdom, as you yourself have heard from the blessed tongue during times of attendance. This servant submits only this much: that nothing except teaching, and that too with the wisdom revealed in the Tablets, has been or ever will be acceptable before God. By the life of the Beloved! This is the truth, and after truth there is naught but error. Today all are commanded to sanctification, detachment, goodly words, righteous deeds and pleasing utterances. The heedless people must, God willing, be invited to the choice wine of wisdom and utterance at the horizon of the All-Merciful. Repeatedly this servant was present before His countenance when He would counsel Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Muhammad-’Ali to wisdom and to that which would draw near the hearts of those who were far removed.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning the cawing of the crows - this matter was revealed in the divine Tablets during the days of migration from Iraq, and likewise in the Land of Mystery, and likewise in the Most Great Prison. All have been informed that the cawing of crows shall be raised and the birds of night shall be stirred to motion. And it is very clear that what is meant has been and will be the false claimants and heedless souls who summon the servants to Satan. This matter has been announced to most of the friends so that all might become aware and avoid such souls. And in your Tablet this matter was revealed that you should inform the loved ones. And likewise in most Tablets to Jinab-i-Ism-i-Ha, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, in the land of Sad and in the land of Ya and other countries, specific persons have been informed.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning Jinab-i-Mulla Zaynu’l-’Abidin, it was submitted. This is what shone forth from the horizon of utterance: O Rahim! Such as he who has ascended to the kingdom of knowledge and been illumined by the lights of the Muhammadan Sun - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - must detect the fragrance of the garment which today is diffused throughout the world and distinguish it from aught else. Convey greetings from this Wronged One, and since his mention was made in the Most Great Prison, this itself is evidence of his turning to God, the Lord of the worlds. One must not make turning to the Truth contingent upon anything save what God has revealed in His clear and decisive Book. If for an hour, for the sake of God, they would reflect upon the Sun of the Cause which has appeared from the horizon of the divine Will, they would surely consider as non-existent all who are in the world and would turn to the Object of worship. In this case the grace of God would encompass their condition and whatsoever is good for them would be ordained by the Pen of Destiny. Verily thy Lord guides whom He willeth to the straight path.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention regarding Mulla Hasan, it was said - and His word is the truth: “O Hasan! Be not troubled, but be thou assured and turn to God, the Lord of the worlds. Deprive not thyself of the fragrances of the days of God. Seize thou this opportunity and be of them that have attained. Give thanks that thou wast mentioned in the Prison before the Wronged One, and that this wondrous remembrance was sent down for thee.” Although this station is not apparent today owing to mankind’s lack of capacity, by Him Who hath caused me to speak the truth, all the treasures of the earth cannot compare with this remembrance, for that which appeareth from the presence of God endureth forever, while all else is transient and perishable. Reflect upon the days of the dawning of the Muhammadan Sun, may the spirit of all be a sacrifice unto Him, and upon the heedlessness, rejection and neglect of the divines, men of letters and leaders, and likewise upon the appearance of Christ and the cause of the objections of the Jewish divines and the people of that time, that the truth may become manifest unto thee. God willing, thou shalt grasp the Kawthar of inner meanings with the hand of certitude and drink thereof in the name of God. Truth hath never been, nor shall ever be, confused with aught else. The vain imaginings of men have held them back from the Lord of creation. Rend asunder the veils of glory through the name of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, that ye may attain unto your goal. This is not difficult for God.</p>
<p>And as to what thou didst mention regarding Shaykh Ibrahim, this is what was revealed for him: O Shaykh! Strive thou that thou mayest not be deprived of the outpourings of this Day and that thou mayest attain unto that which is recorded in the divine Books and sacred Scriptures. On this day neither knowledge, nor mystic insight, nor piety, nor righteousness, nor seclusion shall be of any avail. For instance, if a soul should today be learned in all branches of knowledge yet fail to recognize Him Who is the Known, no benefit from that knowledge shall ever reach him; and if one should be unlettered yet attain unto the recognition of the Truth, no harm shall come to him from his lack of learning. Consider the past: the divines of that age turned away in the early years from the Day-Star of the heaven of inner meaning, while Abu-Dharr, who was but a shepherd, attained to the recognition of the Faith and partook of the pure wine from the hand of the All-Possessing Lord of Destiny. It would be a pity for souls such as thyself to remain deprived of the breezes of the All-Merciful and shut out from the horizon of grace. Reflect at last upon how this Wronged One, though all the rulers and leaders and most of the people have turned away from Him, calleth out at the top of His voice, detached from all else, at the midmost heart of the world, summoning all mankind unto the Truth. If one would but look with fairness upon this matter alone, the Truth would become as manifest as the sun. If anyone should deny this Cause, to what could he cling, and what hem could he grasp? This is a Day whereon it behooveth every soul, upon hearing the Call, to turn towards and respond to his Lord in this most holy, mighty and wondrous Revelation.</p>
<p>Another matter: convey from this evanescent servant sublime greetings to the friends of God and them that have turned unto the horizon of the All-Merciful, who have drunk from the Kawthar of steadfastness and are turned unto the countenance of God, and likewise to Aqa Mulla Muhammad-’Ali who was mentioned in thy letter. God willing, may they all abide beneath the tree of divine oneness and drink at all times from the Kawthar of mystic knowledge. The glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have turned, detached from the world and all that is therein, with their hearts toward the court of God, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the All-Knowing! Today all the loved ones of God must be mindful of what benefits the Cause and reflect and deliberate upon matters that will lead to the exaltation of the Word of God. Most people, though human in form, are far removed from the human world, occupied with their own desires, while few have attained to the goal and are gazing toward the horizon of the Cause. Now these few souls must, with the utmost endeavor and diligence, engage in the reformation of heedless souls and the education of diverse peoples. This is especially true if opposition and conflict arise between themselves, that is, among the friends. In such cases it is incumbent upon all to strive earnestly to resolve it. In most Tablets We have enjoined wisdom upon all, and naught else hath been or ever will be acceptable unto the Beloved. However, if a person who hath been blessed with divine favors and whose name hath been recorded in the Tablets by the Most Exalted Pen should manifest something contrary to wisdom, following him is not and hath never been permissible. Yet regarding such a one, nothing should be uttered except words of good, lest two harms occur. God willing, be mindful of the command of the All-Merciful at all times. Be not grieved by the abasement and tribulations of these days. By the life of God! The days of your glory shall come, and all who dwell on earth shall speak in praise and glorification of the loved ones of God. Know ye the value of this most great, this most exalted station.</p>

<p>The Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious! Hearken unto what the Tongue of Grandeur calleth out to thee from the horizon of tribulation: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Stranger, the Wronged One. Say: O people! Ye have been promised in the Tablets this Manifestation. Now hath He appeared with truth - wherefore do ye not understand? And He Whom ye were promised by the tongue of truth hath now come with truth - wherefore do ye not see? Arise from the couches of heedlessness by this Name through which all things have arisen, and follow not every rejected ignorant one. They who have wronged this day - these shall not be helped. Hold fast to the cord of justice and deprive not yourselves of this manifest bounty. Draw nigh with your hearts unto the Beloved and follow not every hateful outcast. This is the countenance of God amongst you, and His manifestation within you, and His sovereignty unto you, did ye but know. This is the root of all good - He hath come to you with signs, then proof, then evidences that none in the unseen or visible realms can equal. Leave behind what ye possess of ancient tales and take hold of this praised announcement. The Pen hath nearly taken flight from the call of God while the idolaters wander bewildered in the desert of hesitation. O servants of the All-Merciful! This is the springtime of the All-Merciful, did ye but know. The Lord of Seasons hath come, did ye but perceive. The Sovereign of Days hath appeared - blessed are the people who see. O servant! Rejoice in the remembrance of God. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose command was created what was and what will be to come.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious! Hearken unto My call from the direction of the Throne: He is, verily, none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Know thou that the idolaters drove Us out of the Land of Mystery, and one sacrificed himself in My path by cutting his own throat, and when the Most Great Ocean was established upon the Ark another cast himself into the sea, dreading separation from Me, and the Luminous One offered up his spirit at the time when he was bowed before My feet, until they brought Us to the most desolate of lands in this remote prison. Thus did We receive at the hands of those who invoke Us day and night - the stupor of heedlessness and passion hath seized them and they understand not. From the prison’s precincts I summon all who dwell on earth and call them unto God, the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Be thou steadfast in such wise that neither veils nor sorrows shall prevent thee from the remembrance of thy Lord, the Master of the Day of Judgment. Say: He is, verily, the Originator of the heavens and earth, were ye of them that know. Follow thy Lord in all conditions such that neither the oppression of the wrongdoers nor the rejection of the idolaters shall frighten thee. We have been with thee and are aware of what hath befallen thee. Thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have ordained for thee before the Throne a magnificent station. God shall soon exalt thy name in truth - He is, verily, the Protector of the doers of good. Hold fast to the cord of servitude unto God, the True One. Through it the Cause shall be established and the pillars of the transgressors shall be broken. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>Trustworthiness is a sun that, when it shineth forth from the horizon of the heaven of wisdom, illumineth all regions. And for it hath been ordained a heaven, and verily it is man himself. Blessed be the All-Merciful Who hath created all possibility and adorned it with the lights of this sun, shining from this station. He in whom the lights of this sun shine not forth cannot truly be called man. To this doth the Book of God, the Lord of lords, bear witness. Blessed is the city that is illumined thereby. By My life! It is the mother of cities and countries, and through it divine grace descendeth from God, the Lord of creation, and blessings grow in every season. Through it is man’s station elevated and his essence made manifest to all in creation. Through it are hearts expanded and souls assured and the righteous made joyful. He who hath attained unto it is remembered by the Concourse on High and is turned unto by people of understanding. He who hath opened his eyes with the light of recognition chooseth it above all else on earth. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Thus have We adorned the heaven of deeds with the sun of trustworthiness and recognition. He is verily the Mighty, the Bestower. Remind thou the people of this Tablet and acquaint them with what God hath intended for them in the Book. We have sent down these verses unto thee that thou mayest recite them to those who have turned unto God, the Revealer of Books and the Manifestor of proof, that they may act upon what is contained therein and hold fast unto that which they have been commanded in the Tablets. Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and upon those who have remained faithful to the Covenant.</p>

Verily this Tablet shineth between the heavens and the earth, and through it the Spirit was sent down and the Faithful Spirit did speak. They who have turned unto God, these are in an exalted station. We have made this Tablet the source of the new creation, yet the people remain in evident veils. They hear not the call of the Spirit, nor do they see that which hath dawned from the horizon of the Tablet - nay, they are as the dead. The Tablets have been detailed from this Tablet which hath appeared through this Great Name. Say: Did ye believe in the signs, then wherefore did ye not believe, and in that which was sent down from the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Wise? Did ye accept the clear proofs, then wherefore did ye turn away from Him through Whom every wise decree was manifested? The signs have humbled themselves before the countenance of their Lord, and the clear proofs before His all-compelling sovereignty over the worlds. We desire for you naught save that which God hath desired. Whoso heareth is saved, and whoso turneth away, his is disgrace this Day. Thus hath it been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen from One mighty and all-knowing. They who followed vain imaginings after the Sun of Certitude had dawned, these have no path to the Truth. Say: Seize ye the opportunity in these days, then turn ye to the Qiblih of all who are in the heavens and on earth. God hath heard thy call and revealed for thee that whereby the eyes of them that are endued with understanding are solaced. When thou attainest unto it, recite it and glorify thy Lord with praise.

We beseech God to aid you in His service and love, and to manifest through you that which shall endure in remembrance as long as God, the King, the Mighty, the Wise, endureth, and to make you dawning-places of certitude throughout all possibility and manifestations of steadfastness throughout all lands. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>

Therefore, cast off the sandals of wickedness and enter therein, that thou mayest hear from the Tree of thine own being what Moses, son of ’Imran, heard from the Sinai of the All-Merciful: “Verily, I am God!

Then strike with this Staff We have given thee upon the hearts of thy kindred, that there may gush forth from them the fountains of wisdom and knowledge, that perchance they may recognize Him Who revealeth Himself on Sinai in this luminous raiment. And if thou hearest My words, abandon the world and whatsoever is therein and thereon of its customs and creeds, for all these are one and the same in judgment, wert thou of them that comprehend.

Know thou then that thy letter hath come before Us and We have learned of what it contained of the yearning of them that are drawn to God, and We have answered thee with an answer through one letter of which the hearts of the sanctified are attracted, yet We have not sent it until now. And should God wish, We shall send it through grace, for He is the Protector of the righteous. And if thou perceivest the fragrance of thy Lord from this Garment which hath been sent in the form of a Tablet, it shall suffice thee and suffice all the worlds. Thus have We sent down upon thee from the cloud of holiness the heavenly table of the manna of grace and the quails of immortality, that thou mayest be sustained thereby and be of them that give thanks unto God Who created thee by a command from Him and sent unto thee that which He hath made a proof unto all created things.</p>

Remember thy Lord in the morning and the evening and in the watches of the night and the ends of the day, for by His remembrance hearts are purified and the fire of love surgeth in every pure and luminous breast. Turn thy face each day toward the court of thy Lord and say: O my Lord, I am he who hath turned his face toward the court of Thy grace and bounties. Therefore, O my God, deprive me not of what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, and make me steadfast in the Cause from which the feet of every rejected idolater have slipped.</p>

<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Speak forth in the kingdom of utterance and remind the people of this Day, the mention of which hath adorned the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds. Let not the multitude of enemies, nor the gloating of the wretched ones, nor the doubts of the divines prevent thee. Beware lest thou regard the creatures and their doings. Speak forth that which thou art bidden by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have created thee for My remembrance and praise, and for that which the Tongue of My Grandeur hath testified in the kingdom of My utterance - that there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the earth! That which was promised in the Scriptures of God hath appeared, and He Who was hidden behind the veils of the Unseen hath come. Fear God and be not of them that turn away. Beware lest desire prevent you from the Lord of all creation. Cast away vain imaginings, turning unto the horizon of certitude. Say: This is the Day of remembrance and utterance, did ye but know it, and this is the Day of steadfastness and certitude, did ye but recognize it. This is the Day wherein the tongue of mercy speaketh, did ye but hear it.</p>
<p>O thou who hearkeneth! Hearken unto the Call that hath been raised from the precincts of the Prison. Verily it guideth thee to a station wherein the hints of the perverse ones and the doubts of the deniers shall not grieve thee. From this spot We send Our glorification upon thee and upon them that are with thee, and upon those who have inhaled the fragrance of the Divine Vestment in that land. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

We have ordained for thee the reward of them that have circled round Me, soared in the atmosphere of My love, held fast unto My cord, and clung to My robe. Thus hath the decree been fulfilled and grace hath come from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Wise. Thou art of those who have kept faithful to God’s Covenant and have not broken His pledge, and have sought His face from all directions. Be thou assured and be of the thankful. They who have kept faithful to the Covenant are indeed of the people of Baha. Thus hath it been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen, and they shall have a seat of truth with One mighty and powerful. When sorrows encompass thee, remember the days of My presence and that which the tongue of might doth speak. By God! Through it are drawn the hearts of them that know. Act ye, O My loved ones, according to that which hath been sent down unto you from the realm of wisdom and utterance. They who have transgressed beyond wisdom are in the hollow of heedlessness, yet God hath pardoned them as a bounty from His presence. He is verily the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Be thou assured of My favor unto thee, My mercy towards thee, and My loving-kindness bestowed upon thee. Say: O my Lord! Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me in Thy Most Great Prison and sent unto me that which hath gladdened mine eyes, assured my soul, and attracted my heart. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Glorious Name to ordain what is best for me, for I know not what lieth within Thy Self, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>His Excellency the Minister [O] Muhammad! The divine fragrance has wafted from this glorious raiment, that thou mayest become among the faithful Josephs in the Egypt of the Meeting, written by the Pen of Glory upon the Tablet of eternity with the spirit. He is His Excellency the Minister who, praise be to God, hath been sustained from the cup of richness and hath drunk from the wine of independence. He hath entered the supreme garden and reposed beneath the Most Exalted Tree. He hath ascended from the dusty earth to the most glorious horizon, and from the lowest clay to the uttermost Tree. He hath traversed in a single step the stations of the attraction of longing that lie within “the distance of two bow-lengths,” and with a single breath hath attained the twin stations and the stations of rapture and taste. He hath journeyed through the pure city of the Sheba of love as it truly is, and hath fully comprehended the phoenix of the heaven of existence. He hath beheld the mighty ocean of unity as though it were a stream, and regarded the sun of the exaltation of glorification as though it were but a star. At times he hath observed the levels of the supreme throne in the depths of the nethermost earth, and at times he hath rent asunder the veils of the pavilions of might and majesty. With all these divine affairs and occupations with the manifestations of the Lord of Oneness, how can there be time to give news of the ancient friends who are outcasts in different lands and rejected among the servants? Yet God willing, an opportunity shall be granted unto you that they may remember the loved ones. And God loveth those who remember and those who are remembered.</p>

Blessed are they who have detached themselves from all that exists and have turned with illumined and pure hearts toward the All-Merciful. These are among the people of Baha, upon whom the dwellers of the cities of names shower their prayers.</p>

<p>O Leaf of Paradise! Your letter was present in the court of intimacy and the sanctuary of holiness, and from it wafted the fragrances of the love of the Beloved. We beseech God to assist you in all conditions in that which you are engaged in, namely His remembrance and praise, and to aid you in that which He loves and is pleased with. We have ordained for you what you desired in your letter, that you may be one who speaks His praise in the Kingdom of Creation and circles round Him in the Supreme Heaven. Verily your Lord is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Be not grieved at what has befallen you. By My life! I grieve not for the one who has ascended, but rather for the one who remains, for the one who has ascended in the love and remembrance of God has attained unto the Most Great Ocean and the Supreme Joy, while the one who remains is in the sorrows and troubles of the world and deserves prayers until they return to their place. Blessed is the leaf that has returned to its branch and root.</p>
<p>God willing, you should engage in the remembrance of the Beloved of the horizons with perfect attraction, eagerness, joy and yearning, in such wise that it may cause the attraction of all who are on earth, that all may turn to the most holy court of the Lord of Names. Convey wondrous and exalted greetings to all the kindred and loved ones of God, and gladden them all with the favors of God. Although Tablets have not been revealed this time except in answer to petitions, yet all are mentioned in the presence of God and exist beneath the glance of His loving-kindness. And glory be upon you all.</p>

<p>O handmaid of God Hajar, upon her be the Glory of God! She it is who sees and she it is who perceives. O leaf! We heard your call and your petition attained the hearing of the Goal of all the worlds. Blessed is the tongue that speaks His praise and blessed is the heart that has attained His love. Today the Maid of Paradise on high proclaims this most exalted word: “O handmaids of God! I give you glad tidings of the light through which the heavens and earth were illumined. Blessed is the handmaid who has turned to Him and attained the traces of His Most Exalted Pen and acknowledged that which His Tongue has spoken from the most exalted station.” Give praise to the Lord of Eternity Who assisted you and caused you to speak His mention and praise. The entire world cannot compare with this supreme bounty. We beseech God to set you ablaze with the heat of His love in such wise that it shall never be extinguished. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the handmaids in that land and beseech God that He may adorn all with the ornament of sanctity and detachment and aid them to be steadfast in the Greater Steadfastness. Say: “My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the breezes of Thy Revelation and the potency of Thy Will and the all-encompassing nature of Thy Desire, to make me one of the leaves of Thy Tree which neither the winds of Thy earth nor the tempests of the idolaters among the people of Thy realm can cause to fall. Then ordain for me, O my God, that which Thou hast ordained for Thy handmaids who circle round Thy Will and act according to what Thou hast commanded them in Thy Book. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy of answering prayer.”</p>

<p>O Muhammad-’Ali, upon whom be the Glory of God, son of him who has ascended to the Supreme Companion! He is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed. This night is among the nights of the blessed month of Ramadan. Wisdom has necessitated that We observe the fast. At night We speak, while in the day We are silent. Yet within speech lies concealed the treasury of silence, and within silence is stored the ocean of utterance. Is the world of ears destined to receive a portion of hearing this, or is the world of eyes assigned a share of beholding? Glory be to God! The mysteries are manifest before the faces of the righteous, and the Book speaks with the most exalted call. A secret that was forever hidden and stored in the treasury of divine protection has become evident and manifest. Beseech the True One that He may not deprive His servants of the outpourings of His days, nor withhold them from the pearls of the ocean of His knowledge. He is the Bestower, the Compassionate. When thou art stirred by the breezes of My verses and art given to drink of the Kawthar of My utterance, turn toward My direction and say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and my sight with beholding the traces of Thy Pen. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Signs and by the revelations of the Day-Star of Thy Cause from the Supreme Horizon, to make me one of those who have hearkened to Thy most sweet call and have said: “Here am I, here am I, O Creator of the heavens!” My Lord! Thou seest me gazing toward the horizon of Thy bounty and hoping for the waves of the ocean of Thy generosity and favor. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me what I have desired of Thy grace. Verily Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest through Thy word “Be” and it is.</p>

<p>The heaven is manifest with evident smoke, and the earth is vocal with the mention of events, and the mountains pass like clouds, yet most people remain veiled and lifeless. O friends! The seal of the Water of Life has been opened in the name of the Lord of all possibility, and the Sun of Guidance has appeared from the horizon of loving-kindness. Turn with heart and soul and recognize the Purpose. Today the power of the Hour has encompassed all, and trembling has seized all tribes save whom God willeth. We beseech God to assist His loved ones that they may, in this spiritual day, drink of the wine of divine favors from the true Beloved and turn with their hearts to the Countenance that endureth after the passing of all things. Thy letter was present before the Face, and the glance of divine favors was directed towards it. God willing, may thou ever be mindful of the Purpose in all thy days, detached and severed from all else. In the divine Tablets from the Pen of His Cause, in the Land of Secret and other lands, the cawing of the ravens hath been recorded in most cities. All the friends must guard themselves and at all times take refuge in God, that He may keep them firm and steadfast in His Cause, in such wise that they may regard all else as non-existent and count it as nothing. We beseech God to attract thee through the breezes of His days and make thee one who speaketh His praise and remembrance and who acteth according to what He loveth and is pleased with.</p>

<p>The Sun of Truth is the Word of God, upon which depends the training of the people of the city of inner meanings and utterance. It is the true spirit and the spiritual water through whose aid and bounty all things have had and will have life. Its radiance in every mirror appears according to that mirror’s color. Thus when it shone forth in the mirrors of the hearts of the philosophers, wisdom became manifest. Likewise when it cast its rays upon the hearts of craftsmen, wondrous and exalted arts appeared. And when it dawned in the hearts of the mystics, the wonders of divine knowledge and the mysteries of heavenly utterance were revealed. All the people of the world and whatsoever appeareth therein subsist through man, and appear through him, while man himself existeth through the Sun of the Divine Word. The most beautiful names and most exalted attributes have ever circled and will continue to circle round the Word. It is the divine fire which, when kindled in the breasts, consumeth all things besides God. The hearts of the lovers are aflame with this fire. This fire is in truth water appearing in the form of fire - outwardly fire, inwardly light. Through this water all things have had and will have life, for “from water doth all life come.” We beseech God that we may drink of this divine sweet water from this spiritual cup and that we may pass beyond the world and all therein for the sake of His love. And glory be upon the people of glory!</p>

In the name of the one true Friend: That which was previously revealed from the heaven of the All-Merciful Will is this: “Whoso leaveth his home as an emigrant unto God and His Messenger and death overtaketh him, his reward is incumbent upon God.” And that which is now revealed from the heaven of the mercy of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High is this: “They that have forsaken their country in the path of God and subsequently ascended unto His presence, such souls shall be blessed by the Concourse on High and their names recorded by the Pen of Glory among such as have laid down their lives as martyrs in the path of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsistent. Upon them rest the mercy of God and His favors, and the grace of God and His fragrances. He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Generous.” O Ali! God willing, through divine grace thou shalt attain unto that which God hath desired, and be detached from all else besides Him. Be not grieved at what hath come to pass. Consider the divine favor, how He caused him to attain the Most Great Horizon, and, purified and freed from all earthly conditions, summoned him to the Supreme Horizon. At the time of his departure he appeared before the Throne in such wise that all those circling round were moved to lamentation by his weeping. Blessed is he, then blessed is he! Console all the kinsmen on behalf of this Wronged One and convey greetings to them, and say that God is nearer and more kind, and in His presence grief is not permitted, for these are the days of supreme joy.

The intoxication of vain desire hath seized most of the people of the world, to such extent that they remain heedless and deprived of their true Purpose and Goal. That which they sought night and day with lowliness and supplication - from this they now turn aside when they behold it. Blessed is the soul whom the affairs of the world have not prevented from the Ancient Lord, and whom the intimations of the peoples have not deprived. All confess the transience of the world, yet still they cling to it. We beseech God to assist thee to aid this Cause through wisdom and utterance, and to bring thee to a station wherein thine eyes and the eyes of thy loved ones shall be solaced.

No ocean can quench His fire, and no veil can shut out His light. Verily He hath power over whatsoever He willeth.

O Lord! Aid him and those who have believed to do that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily, Thou art the Ruler over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>

<p>He is God, the Most Wondrous, the Most Wondrous</p>
<p>These are the verses of God, the King, the Truth, the Manifest, which have been sent down from the heaven of the will of your Lord, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. O people! This is a servant of God among you who calls you to Him at all times, and has sacrificed his spirit and his soul in the path of God, your Beloved and the Beloved of the worlds. And whenever tribulation intensified upon him, he proclaimed with the loudest voice the remembrance of his Lord between the heavens and the earth. No hindrance of any hinderer, nor the mockery of any mocker, nor the turning away of any rejecter, nor the blame of any blamer prevented him. He has appeared at the pole of the horizons and called all to the covenant, the station wherein the very atoms of its dust proclaim that there is no God but Me, the Most High, the Most Great. Say: O people! Unite amongst yourselves and gather around the one Law - this indeed is the purpose of this Great Announcement which has appeared in truth and has stunned all who are in the heavens and the earth save a numbered few of Our knowing servants. Say: O people! Fear God and spread not corruption in the land after its reformation, and be not of the wrongdoers. It behooveth you to manifest the signs of God and to diffuse from you the sweet fragrances of His sanctity amidst His heedless servants, that they might perceive from you the fragrance of truth and be guided by you to the paradise wherein its leaves proclaim that there is no God but He, the Omnipotent, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And the Spirit and Glory be upon you and upon God’s sincere servants.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted! These are the verses of God which have been sent down in truth from the heaven of mighty glory. Indeed they are God’s testimony amongst His creatures and through them His remembrance shall endure amongst all created things. Cast aside what thou hast and take what is with God with manifest power. Remember Me on earth that I may remember thee in My heaven. Thus hath the command been sent down in a preserved Tablet of glory. Judge according to what God hath ordained for thee, then rule by what God hath decreed, and be God-fearing in the Cause. Rend asunder the veils, then enter into the pavilion of the Cause which hath been raised up in the name of God. And if thou findest therein a cup of the Kawthar of life, take it in My name, the All-Merciful, then drink thereof as thou pleasest. By God! Through one drop thereof every decomposed bone shall be quickened. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen command thee from thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious, in these days wherein the Sun of Holiness hath dawned from a luminous horizon of glory. And when thou drinkest, the rapture of the Beloved shall seize thee in such wise as to detach thee from all who are on earth and draw thee nigh unto a kingdom of wondrous glory. Then thou shalt arise to praise and remember God and say: O people! This is the Great Announcement with which ye were promised in all the Tablets. He hath indeed come with the truth with mighty sovereignty. Beware lest ye be veiled from Him through Whom the Dove hath warbled and the Cock of the Throne hath crowed and this Morn hath breathed forth with resplendent lights. And upon thee be peace and upon him who hath taken unto the All-Merciful a way.</p>

<p>The verses are being sent down from God, the Mighty, the Wise, unto him who hath attained to the recognition of the All-Merciful when the All-Glorious came with manifest sovereignty. The City hath been sent down from the heaven of command, and he who hath held fast to the cord of God, the Mighty, the Great, hath drawn nigh unto the Throne. We behold the people of Baha in the Crimson Ark, while they that turned away are drowned - these are among the perishing ones. Blessed is he who hath clung unto God, detached from all else save Him. He is, verily, of the people of Baha - thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. The darkness hath been illumined by the light of the Days, yet most of the people remain heedless. We beseech God to move His loved ones through the stirring of His Most Exalted Pen, which moveth upon the Tablet in His Most Glorious Name, that all may arise to promote His Cause and make mention of Him with such remembrance as shall attract the hearts of the heedless who were numbered among those far removed. Draw ye nigh through My Most Glorious Name unto the Stream which floweth between earth and heaven, then drink ye therefrom by the leave of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The All-Merciful hath revealed Himself unto all who are in the realm of possibility - blessed are they that have attained. O My loved ones! Remember ye My days and what hath befallen Me at the hands of the oppressors among My creatures and the rebellious ones among My creation in this remote prison. We beseech God to assist all to stand firm in His love and to turn unto Him in all conditions. This is better for them than the kingdom of the dominion of the heavens and earth.

<p>The whole world awaited the Day of God and, with perfect humility and submissiveness, beseeched God, glorified be His majesty, night and day for the appearance of the Promised One. But when the Sun of Truth dawned from the horizon of manifestation and the Preserved Tablet was sent down from the heaven of loving-kindness, all clung to their own idle fancies and turned away from the Sovereign of certitude, save those who came unto God with an illumined, believing, and steadfast heart.</p>
<p>O friends! Strive ye, and through the blessing of the Most Great Name, attain in this divine Day such a station that ye may shine forth like unto the sun from the horizon of eternity. Act ye in accordance with that which befitteth this blessed Day. Turn your gaze away from that which is fleeting and transitory, whether little or much, and fix your eyes upon the ocean that hath neither beginning nor end. Say: O friends! Be not, like children, occupied with diverse colors nor take delight therein. Rather, with firm resolve, steadfast hearts, penetrating vision and the light of certitude, appear amongst men with the utmost trustworthiness and goodly character.</p>
<p>We have found thee turning unto the Kaaba of existence and have therefore sent unto thee this Book, which nothing that lieth concealed in the sea, or is stored up in the earth, or is treasured in the mountains can equal. Verily thy Lord speaketh the truth, and He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>

<p>In the name of the All-Knowing, the One: O Mirza Shukru’llah! All souls were awaiting the days of the Manifestation and all tongues were speaking in remembrance of the Beloved of all possibility. Yet when the thick and hindering veils were rent asunder by the finger of power of the Lord of creation, and the Sun of Truth rose and shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of manifestation, all were found to be veiled and deprived, save whom thy Lord willed. Some clung to vain imaginings and turned away from the Kawthar of certitude, while others grasped at idle fancies and remained heedless of the Lord of Days. They did not pause for a moment to consider why it was that in every age and dispensation, when the holy ones, the chosen ones, and the Prophets appeared, they drank the cup of martyrdom and ascended to the Supreme Horizon in utter submission. I swear by the Sun of utterance which today shineth from the horizon of the heaven of knowledge that if they were to show the least measure of fairness and reflect upon what hath come to pass, they would comprehend that of which they are now heedless, and all would utter the words “Would that I had not taken such a one for a friend!” Were these matters to be explained in detail, numerous volumes would not suffice. That which hath already flowed from the Most Exalted Pen is sufficient for all who dwell on earth. Ask thou God to enable thee and all who are on earth to recognize the Dawning-Place of Revelation, and to aid thee to make mention of this Remembrance through which faces have been illumined and the horizons made bright.</p>

Therefore, the pearls of wisdom and utterance that were hidden in the shells of the sea have flowed forth from the Most Exalted Pen as a bounty from His presence to His loved ones. Say: O concourse of divines! How long will ye follow your selfish desires? Say: In the name of God and by God!

Come forth from your homes at the bidding of the Ancient Commander. This is the Day of Arising, this is the Day of Divine Grace, this is the Day whereon men have stood before the Lord of the worlds. Read ye the Qur’an and then judge with fairness concerning that which hath been revealed in truth, and be not of the heedless.

Thus doth thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving, remind thee. Arise from the horizon of detachment in the name of thy Lord, the Creator of all things, and glorify thy Lord’s praise at eventide and at dawn. Be thou a servant unto His Cause and be thou ever mindful of His presence. Grieve not because of them that are heedless. Soon shalt thou behold the Cause resplendent throughout all regions. Be thou so steadfast in thy love for thy Lord that the veils of them that have disbelieved in the Lord of Lords shall not withhold thee.

They rejected Him and brought about that which caused the eyes of understanding to weep and the temple of justice to cry out. Then Hud came and called the people of the earth to the Lord of existence and the Sovereign of the unseen and seen. They denied Him and arose in opposition, although that Holy One gave the people glad tidings of the name of the Self-Subsisting and promised them the days of God. Then Salih came and with perfect joy and fragrance guided the people of earth to the horizon of the favor of the Desired One of the worlds. They deemed the pure waters of divine counsel to be error. Finally they hamstrung the she-camel and went to hell. O Baqir, the sight and hearing of the servants are prevented from witnessing and hearkening. The veils of idle fancies have intervened and deprived creation from the Truth. Blessed is the soul who with clear certitude held fast to the mighty cord and freed itself from the world and all therein.

<p>Praise, sanctified above all words, befitteth the Lord of all mankind Who was not deterred by the tribulations of the world and the clamor of the nations from His holy purpose. The ranks of the polytheists, the multitudes of the deniers, the might of the people of tyranny and error, and the tumult of the ignorant could not prevent His penetrating Will. At a time when the arrows of tribulations and afflictions were raining down like showers, He summoned all with the tongue of grandeur to the highest horizon. The clouds and mists, the rain and trees and fruits, all bear witness that the Supreme Pen was never still in any state. If at times it appeared outwardly to pause, inwardly it was engaged in spiritual motion, revealing to the world of being whatsoever was meet and seemly. Glorified be His greatness and His power!</p>
<p>Some of the ignorant ones of the earth have desired to prevent the effulgence of the lights of the Sun of Truth, to extinguish the divine light with the breaths of doubt and fancy, and to quench the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree. By the life of our Beloved and your Beloved! This station is the station of “far be it, far be it!” Until the Day of Resurrection, man will repeatedly ask: What profit did Nimrod gain, and what benefit did Pharaoh reap? Have they not heard the tale of Abu Sufyan, or learned of the oppression of Caiaphas who was the Jewish judge, and likewise of Pilate who was the governor of that place? Which oppressor ever benefited from his deeds or gained any profit? They have lost indeed who denied the right of God, broke His Covenant, turned away from Him, and pronounced judgment against the Manifestations of His Cause with manifest tyranny.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O my God, by the light of Thy countenance and the radiance of Thy presence, by the fragrance of Thy robe in Thy days, and by the breath of Thy revelation and the signs of Thy power, to send down upon Thy loved ones that which will protect them from the tyranny of Thy creatures, and upon Thy enemies that which will prevent them from what they have purposed in their rebellion against Thee and their transgression against Thy Cause. Though I know with certainty that all profit belongeth to the people of Thy love, and all loss to those who have turned away from Thee and opposed Thee, yet I beseech Thee by Thy generosity and bounty to hasten the days which Thou hast ordained for the exaltation of Thy Cause, the manifestation of Thy Word, and the spread of Thy verses.

<p>O thou beloved of my heart! The servant hath been gladdened by that which flowed from thy pen concerning what hath befallen your honor and the friends of God in the land of Ta. Although thy letter brought grief to all the world, since it described the tribulations of them that are detached and sincere, yet being adorned with the mention of the Best-Beloved of the worlds, it gave unto silence the power of utterance. A hundred thousand joys be sacrificed for such grief as is borne in the path of God, and a hundred thousand blessings circle round such hunger as is endured in prison for His sake. Chains in prison are more precious than the crowns of kings, and the world’s cruelties more dear than life itself when suffered in His path. The servant beseecheth his Lord to aid His loved ones and chosen ones to arise to serve Him and teach His Cause, let nothing whatsoever hinder them. The Truth beareth witness that the eyes of this servant were gladdened by those souls who in these days have diffused the sweet savors of steadfastness. They are the kings of the realms of certitude, tranquility, steadfastness and faithfulness. The opposition of the opposers, the denial of the deniers, and the might of the oppressors are even as the buzzing of a fly - it hath neither permanence nor duration. After reading and becoming apprised thereof, he directed himself to the most exalted Summit and the highest Station, and presented a detailed account before His presence. This is what the Tongue of the Intended One hath spoken, these are His - exalted be His glory - words:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing […]</p>
<p>O thou who journeyest in the lands! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One amongst the servants. He hath come with the truth and summoned all creation unto a station before which every lofty station hath bowed down, and hath revealed that at whose revelation every trustworthy scholar hath prostrated. We opened unto their faces the gates of goodly things, yet they rose up to harm Us in such wise as caused the Concourse on High and the dwellers of this exalted station to lament. Heedlessness hath so encompassed the slaves of passion that they have arisen with utmost tyranny and rebellion to extinguish the light of the Day-Star of knowledge. Woe and misery unto them! From every direction the fire of oppression blazeth and the smoke of tyranny is manifest. However, God shall extinguish the former and dispel the latter. The world hath found no rest from the deeds of the oppressors and tyrants.</p>
<p>O thou who drinkest the wine of My love! The oppressor sinketh into the earth each day like unto Korah, yet perceiveth it not. That which the All-Informed hath revealed shall soon be made manifest, despite every stubborn tyrant. Leave them to themselves, and their possessions, and their words, and their deeds, holding fast unto the cord of teaching. Thus doth command thee the Strong, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the friends. Say: God willing, arise to promote the Cause of God with utmost strength, might and power, in such wise that the fragrance of steadfastness may envelope the world. He is the Helper, He is the Almighty. Power and might have been expounded in all the Tablets. All must conquer the world through the hosts of virtuous deeds and goodly character.</p>
<p>Say: O loved ones of God! Time and again ye have been the target of affliction’s arrows in the path of the Lord of Names. Which prison hath not witnessed your presence, and which oppression hath not befallen you in the path of the Beloved? Ye have seen and borne countless trials. Preserve this most exalted station and most glorious rank. By My life! Were people to know, they would cast aside all deeds and circle round about you. But today they perceive not, neither do they understand.</p>
<p>Though the friends of God, exalted be His glory, have witnessed the faces of the companions of the left and of error like unto demons, yet they have also beheld and continue to behold the radiant countenance of God’s infinite favors. While on one side they have heard the clamor of the deniers, on the other they have hearkened to the most sweet call of the Beloved of the worlds in their remembrance. This bounty shall never cease. By the life of the Beloved! The servant presenteth and declareth with manifest truthfulness: Praise be to God for this mighty favor!</p>
<p>Concerning the imprisonment of His Holiness Ismu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God the Most Glorious, and the friends of God, as well as the intercession of some and the giving of funds to one of the women - all these details were presented before His presence. His blessed and exalted Word: The means for matters pertaining to the Truth appear from Him. Verily He confirmeth and inspireth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Those souls who have arisen to render service, which is among the requirements of the love of God and His loved ones, and who have endeavored and have not been remiss in expending their wealth and possessions according to their capacity - their reward shall not be lost with God, nor shall it ever be. Verily He recompenseth the doers and aideth the generous ones.</p>
<p>In such instances, nothing should be given beforehand. One who accepts a matter should be assured through a guarantor or other means, and after the matter’s completion and fulfillment, the promise should be kept. Although the honored ones have labored, yet the affair of the prisoners rests with God, exalted be His glory. Once these sublime words were heard from the tongue of the Lord of Names - His utterance, exalted be His glory: “The government had attained some measure of assurance, but certain lying tongues have spoken that which has again caused suspicion.” Thus did He speak. May God, exalted be His glory, recompense the liars. All know that the causes of contention and strife, and whatsoever is abhorrent to minds and souls, have been removed; yet they still say that which brings harm to the servants of God. May the Desired One guide them and show them the straight path.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the sinking of certain lands - similar occurrences have repeatedly happened in other places, but surely a great abasement awaits the people of the world as recompense for their deeds. We beseech God to awaken mankind, that perchance they may return and the world find peace. God has ever been and will continue to be lying in wait for the oppressors, as you have witnessed and will yet witness: verily He is ever watchful.</p>
<p>That other letter from that beloved one was indeed a brilliant lamp for the darkness of the world. It gave light to the heart and clarity to vision, for it was adorned and embellished with the lights of the love of the Beloved of the worlds. I beseech the Exalted True One and implore Him by the traces He has caused to flow from the pens of His friends, to rid the world of existence from the oppression of oppressors and adorn it with the lights of justice. Verily our Lord, the All-Knowing, is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the arrival in the land of Alif and Ba, and likewise concerning the enthusiasm of the friends of God, it was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. His words, blessed and exalted be He: He is the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! We have made mention of them and have revealed unto them that whereby the essence of the world hath been set ablaze. Erelong shall its light and radiance become manifest. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Chosen One. We have sent unto every name inscribed in thy book that whereby the lights have shone forth. Ask thou God to give the world to drink from the Kawthar of His knowledge and to manifest through His sovereignty that whereby eyes shall be gladdened. The ocean of hatred hath surged, and the Most Glorious Beauty saileth upon the crimson ark, moving upon it with power and sovereignty. By God! Neither the might of the idolaters nor the clamor of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of Lords, can hinder Him. Blessed are the companions of Alif and Ba. We have seen them and heard their call and their mention, and We give them the glad-tidings of God’s favor and His mercy. We have mentioned all with such mention as the treasuries of nations cannot equal. God willing, they shall attain unto it and drink from the ocean of inner meanings, that their ardor may increase. In all matters they must act with wisdom. That soul hath observed how effective and rectifying wisdom is. The people of the world are seen as beasts, save those whom God willeth. Their sole preoccupation is the acquisition and consumption of carrion. The chains of these beasts are wisdom. By My life! Wisdom hath a lofty station. Blessed are they that attain thereunto. Soon shall these tyrannous, rebellious, and insolent beasts find themselves impotent and abased beneath the claws of divine destiny - great is His power! Give glad tidings to My loved ones on My behalf. We counsel them to be calm and dignified. They should trust in God and commit all affairs unto Him. He is verily the Almighty, the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>Furthermore, mention was made of Fath. The mention of the souls of that land hath repeatedly flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, and in this year especially, divine Tablets were revealed and sent to each of the friends. This servant beseecheth the True One to assist His loved ones in such wise that the opposition and objections of the idolaters and deniers shall not withhold them from everlasting life. He is powerful and mighty.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about Zarqan and the friends of God, it was submitted, and this is what the Kingdom of Utterance hath spoken: If possible, thou shouldst proceed to that land and tarry there awhile, that perchance precious gems of meanings and utterance may be brought forth from the mines of that land through the hands of wisdom, and that they who possess vision may attain thereunto. Every locality needeth one to make mention, especially places that are ready and good lands. The mention of God, exalted be His glory, increaseth those who make mention, who are aware and who know, and it awakeneth and maketh mindful those who are heedless and asleep.</p>
<p>In the name of the oppressed One of the horizons!</p>
<p>Today the lights of the Sun of Justice have been obscured by the smoke of rancor and hatred, and amidst the warbling of the birds of truth and inner meanings, the cawing of ravens has risen. Say: O friends! Today is the day of steadfastness, and today is the day when all that was hidden in hearts and minds shall be made manifest. The Sun of Truth has risen and is shining forth; the deeds of every soul shall be witnessed and the station of each one revealed. Blessed are they who have clung to the cord of God’s Cause and have detached themselves from the world and all who dwell therein. Now that thou hast attained unto My Tablet and the traces of My Pen, render thanks unto God for this supreme bounty. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds and Goal of them that have known Thee.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for Jinab-i-Ghulam-Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>He is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful!</p>
<p>A mention from Our presence unto him who hath been awakened by the Call and hath turned toward the Supreme Horizon, that he may rejoice and be of them that are thankful. Thy mention was made in the presence of the Wronged One, and this perspicuous Tablet was revealed for thee. Verily He hath heard and answered, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We counsel thee to be steadfast and to act in such wise as would gladden the hearts of them that are nigh unto God - they who traverse the lands to exalt the Word of God and who rescue all who are drowning and cast down. Soon shall all power and might pass away, and power and might shall remain with God, the Almighty, the All-Praised. Leave behind what the people possess; take what thou art bidden with the fingers of submission and contentment, and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for Jinab-i-Haji Muhammad-Rida, upon him be the Glory of God […]</p>
<p>In His Name, Who shineth from the horizon of the Prison!</p>
<p>The Most Desired One – Who hath ever showered the rain of mercy upon creation, nurtured all through the radiant sun of His loving-kindness, and opened wide the gates of bounty and repose for all – hath been imprisoned in the most ruinous of cities. Would that matters had ended there! Rather, each day from the horizon of hatred some fresh tribulation appeareth and some new affliction becometh manifest. Yet through the grace of God, exalted be His glory, the tribulations of the world and the afflictions of the nations have not and shall never deter Him from His purpose. He counseleth His loved ones to manifest supreme steadfastness. These fleeting days are not worthy of mention, much less that their manifestations should preoccupy the people of knowledge and deprive them of everlasting bounty. Grasp with the fingers of hope the hem of thy Lord’s mercy, the Lord of Names, and say:</p>
<p>I beseech Thee not to deprive me of the mantle of Thy grace and the robe of Thy loving-kindness. Thou art He Who hath named Thyself by Thy name, the All-Bountiful, and by Thy name, the All-Merciful. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that those mentioned have attained the grace of God, exalted be His glory. Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Ahmad and Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Abdullah, upon them be the glory of God, from among the people of Ba who have settled in Shahrud – numerous exalted Tablets have been revealed and sent from the heaven of grace specifically for them, both before and after. God willing, through their luminous utterances and penetrating words that land shall be illumined, and new and wondrous flowers shall spring forth and become manifest through the water of their mention. O My Beloved! Would that the people of the earth might understand, comprehend and know! Alas! Alas! They will not awaken until they find themselves beneath the earth. The people sleep; when they die, they wake.</p>
<p>As for the mention of Jinab-i-Haji Seyyed Asadullah, upon him be the glory of God – praise be to God that he hath attained to the mention of the Beloved of the worlds. And again, after being presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, these manifest verses were newly revealed from the heaven of loving-kindness. His word, exalted and mighty is He:</p>
<p>He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing!</p>
<p>Verily remembrance is healing for hearts, mercy for souls, water for every truthful thirsting one, and a fire that speaketh in the Tree of Love: “Verily there is none other God but I, the Caller, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” He who circleth round Me and turneth to My horizon and ariseth to serve Me hath mentioned thee. We make mention of thee in such wise as no remembrance in the world can equal. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Let not the affairs of men grieve thee. Hold fast to the hem of thy Lord’s mercy, the Almighty. Verily the people have turned away from that which profiteth them in the worlds of God. Blessed is he who hath turned unto God, whom the hand of God’s grace, the Mighty, the All-Wise, hath delivered. Thus have We lit the lamp of utterance in the niche of knowledge. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto every heedless and remote one.</p>
<p>Likewise was revealed from the heaven of loving-kindness specifically for the son of him who attained and ascended. His word, mighty is His glory:</p>
<p>He is the Watchful, the Near One […]</p>
<p>O Ali! Blessed art thou and blessed is thy son who hath been honored with the mention of My Most Exalted Pen and hath heard My sweetest call when the Light was shining from the horizon of Zawra. Blessed be God, the Lord of this great bounty. He is among those who heard and hastened until he entered the pavilion of glory when the Temple of the Cause was established upon an exalted throne. Give thanks unto God for having enabled thee to associate with them who love Me and hold fast to the cord of My providence, and who have confined their affairs to My mention and praise. He is verily the one mentioned by My Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book. Thy Lord, the Wronged One, the Stranger, beareth witness to this. Blessed be thy mother and thy brother, and they who have attained unto this glorious and wondrous station. We counsel thee with that which beseemeth your relationship to this Cause, through which every oppressor hath lamented and every pure heart hath rejoiced. The glory be upon thee and upon them from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning thy brother, upon him be the glory of God, praise be to God, he hath attained to His grace, and the word that was previously uttered from the tongue of Grandeur - that word hath been and will ever be a help. There is no doubt it was sent down from the presence of One Who is Self-Sufficient, the Generous. The mention of thy other brother, upon him be the glory of God, was also presented before the Most Holy Court. Perfect kindness was manifested and They said that the mention of him and certain other known ones would best be kept confidential, as We have commanded wisdom and all must observe it. Otherwise, verily He protecteth whom He willeth by His command. This servant conveyeth greetings and salutations to them and beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, that they may be assisted in that which is lasting and eternal.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about the debts, God willing, they shall be paid. Verily, bounty is in His hands. He ordaineth what He pleaseth for whom He pleaseth. He giveth and bestoweth, and He is the Bestower, the Generous.</p>
<p>The other letter from that beloved one, dated the ninth of the blessed Ramadan, opened the gate of joy and closed the doors of sorrow, for it was adorned with the mention of the Beloved of the worlds and the health of that beloved of heart and soul. However, it also brought endless grief as it announced the martyrdom of him at whose steadfastness the very essence of steadfastness trembled, and before whose trust in God the reality of trust bowed down, and who resigned his affairs unto God, the Lord of the seen and unseen, the Master of the last and the first. This blessed blood hath not been, nor will be, shed in vain. We beseech the Almighty that He may enable all to return. Verily, He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful. Otherwise, the effect of that blessed blood shall become manifest and evident throughout all regions. This pure blood is effectual water for the irrigation of the divine Tree. I dare not say more than this in this regard. Knowledge is with God.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning Aqa Mirza Zaynu’l-Abidin and Aqa Mulla Muhammad, upon them be the glory of God, their mention was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur uttered […]</p>
<p>O Zain, upon thee be My Baha! O thou prisoner in foreign lands and exile in distant regions! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee and saith: Having tasted the sweetness of the love of the Best-Beloved of the worlds, every moment of that exile prideth itself over a hundred thousand native lands. No pleasure in all the world hath equalled or shall equal this pleasure. Thy tribulations are manifest and evident, shining bright as the sun. Since these afflictions are in the path of the Friend, there is no harm. I swear by the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful that great freedom followeth that imprisonment, and boundless glory succeedeth that abasement. The glory be upon thee and upon him who is named Muhammad, who was imprisoned, incarcerated and banished even as his Lord was imprisoned, incarcerated and banished. This mention sufficeth him, from which the fragrance of loving-kindness hath been wafted in such wise that its traces shall never be cut off from the world. The Command is in God’s hands, the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust below.</p>
<p>From the ocean of divine utterance, the pearls of grace and kindness have appeared in such wise as to require no interpreter, translator, expositor or assessor. The whole world be a sacrifice unto His bounty and His loving-kindness.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning those two adorned with steadfastness and acceptance - namely, the cotton-carders, upon them be the glory of God - and likewise concerning the collection of funds for the strangers, this matter was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what was spoken by the tongue of our Beloved and your Beloved, and the Object of desire of all who are in the heavens and the earth. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Face! They have borne many hardships in the path of God. The recompense of their deeds is an everlasting and abiding treasure with the Mighty, the Trustworthy. They have ever been and still are occupied with service to the Cause. Their reward is with God, the Forgiving, the Generous. We testify that they have attained unto righteous deeds and that which beseemeth the Days of God, the Lord of the worlds. We, from this station, pronounce Our glorification upon them and give them the glad-tidings of God’s grace and mercy, which have preceded all who are in the realm of earthly dominion and the Kingdom.</p>
<p>In truth, they have performed their labors for God’s sake, for whatsoever they obtain, they expend in the path of God, glorified be His majesty. In all that lay within their power regarding the honored lady, the mother of His Holiness the Sacred One, upon her be the Most Glorious Glory of God, they have shown no negligence. Until now several letters have been received from that noble lady, and in each one she hath made mention of them and of what they have accomplished in His path. The funds which that beloved one hath received were most timely and appropriate, and acceptable before the Throne. The servant beseecheth his Lord to assist them and confirm them in that whereunto they have attained in the Cause of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>As to the request of Mashhadi Muhammad-Rida, upon him be the Glory of God, for a Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet for his wife, upon her be the Glory of God, this matter hath been granted and illumined with the lights of divine acceptance. A most mighty and wondrous Tablet hath been revealed and sent. Deliver it unto him that he may attain unto it and partake of its fragrance. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. This is what hath been sent down from the Kingdom of utterance of the All-Merciful for His handmaiden who hath been named Narjis. His mighty Word:</p>
<p>In the Name of the Forgiving, the Generous […]</p>
<p>O my handmaiden! The handmaidens of the world are heedless of this supreme bounty and mighty benevolence. Their eyes are deprived of beholding the light of His countenance, and their ears are barred from hearkening to His call. All were created for this glorious and wondrous Day, yet they remain veiled and unmindful of it. Praise be to the Desired One of the world, that thou art adorned with the pearls of love and the gems of knowledge of the Best-Beloved of the worlds. This Tablet is as a crown for heads - adorn thy head of acceptance therewith, and remain firm and steadfast in the love of the Lord of Names. All the pearls and precious stones of the world are as nothing and shall perish compared to the pearl of thy love. Shouldst thou ponder upon this bounty, thou wouldst, throughout thy life, ceaselessly utter “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds!” The glory of God rest upon thee and upon the handmaidens who have believed in God, the One, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>And regarding what thou didst write about Aqa Mirza Husayn, son of the late and elevated Mulla Muhammad-Sadiq, upon him be the glory of God and His mercy, it was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what was revealed for him from the heaven of bounty. He, exalted and mighty be He, speaks thus:</p>
<p>He is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O Husayn! Count as a treasure the days of God. One deed performed therein is more beloved in the sight of God than the deeds of centuries and ages. Every possessor of insight hath witnessed this, and every bearer of ears hath heard it, for the call of Truth hath been raised at all times, and the Most Exalted Horizon hath ever been manifest and resplendent. Blessed are they whom the doubts of the suspicious have not kept back. Hold thou fast unto the cord of thy Lord’s bounty and say: Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me and made me known to Thee and for having sent down unto me from the heaven of Thy Will that which delighteth the eyes. I beseech Thee not to deprive me of what is with Thee. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise. The glory of God rest upon thee and upon thy mother who hath called upon her Lord, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>He is the Compassionate, the Helper!</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding the Land of K, it was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. Praise be to God, all have attained to the grace and favors of the Truth, and those few souls who have drunk from the Kawthar of the utterance of the All-Merciful were each previously honored with a special Tablet. This evanescent servant beseeches the Truth, exalted be His glory, and hopes that He may assist all to achieve that which He loves and with which He is well-pleased. As commanded, whenever you turn toward that land, convey to the mother of the sanctuary, the kinsmen, and other friends the greetings from the Truth and gladden them with His favors. Likewise, they commanded: “Make mention of the friends in the Land of Q and M on behalf of the Wronged One. All are remembered in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence and have attained His favors. We make mention of Ghulam-Rida who was imprisoned in My path and upon whom befell what befell My own Self in the Land of Ta. And We make mention of the people of Jasib whom the affairs of creation did not prevent from turning toward the Truth. We send Our greetings upon them and offer them glad tidings of that which God, the Lord of the worlds, has ordained for them. And We make mention of Mahmud as We mentioned him before, and We beseech God to assist him in serving the Cause as He assisted him in turning toward it. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Kind.”</p>
<p>This is the meaning of His exalted Word: “And for each there is a portion in the Book.” Every soul that has shown the slightest turning has attained to the Most Great Remembrance. Were all the pens in the world to attempt to befittingly describe the fruits and effects of the remembrance of the Truth, exalted be His glory, they would surely find themselves impotent and wanting.</p>
<p>And as to what you wrote regarding the Divine Tablets, yes, what your honor has done - praise be to God - that beloved one has been assisted in all manner of service. This is a mighty station, by the Lord of the Mighty Throne!</p>
<p>As to your mention of his honor Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah M N, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, it was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, blessed and exalted be His Word […]</p>
<p>Thou hast attained unto that which was recorded in the divine Books of the past and present. Thou didst turn thy face toward God and traverse cities and wildernesses until thou didst arrive at the great and blessed Valley, where thou didst hear the call of the Wronged One - the Wronged One Who arose alone to promote the Cause in such wise that oppression deterred Him not, nor did hosts and legions stay Him from His purpose. He arose with His transcendent power and, through the Most Exalted Pen, gave glad tidings to all on earth of the manifestation of the Hidden and Treasured Name, and proclaimed it. The Most Exalted Pen in this station is the Tongue of Truth, exalted be His glory. Should anyone reflect even briefly upon the evident power, despite the opposition of the peoples of the world - from kings and subjects, from rich and poor - he would be moved to proclaim with majesty, might and power: “Unto God!” Verily, the Wronged One beseeches God to grant thee success and draw thee nigh unto Him in all conditions, and to record for thee the reward of thy deeds in His straight and manifest path.</p>
<p>From every letter and from every word flow rivers of bounty. I beseech and supplicate the Truth that He may grant them success. Likewise, I especially convey greetings and glorification to them.</p>
<p>Mention was made of his honor Aqa Muhammad Kazim and his honor Aqa Muhammad Hannasab, upon them be 96 [Baha’u’llah]. The mention of both was honored to reach His hearing, and the Sun of loving-kindness was directed toward them. Blessed are they in that they purposed, visited, attained, and drank. And peace be upon him who follows guidance.</p>
<p>With regard to what was written concerning Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Maqsud, upon him be the bestowals of God, he arrived in this land and for a time dwelt beneath the sheltering grace of God, exalted be His glory, blessed with His favors. We met with him repeatedly, and likewise he attained the presence numerous times and was honored with the blessing of meeting. He demonstrated love, affection and sincerity. After departing from this land, several of his letters reached this servant and replies were sent. He has been traveling and journeying to various regions. This servant beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to aid him and keep him steadfast in His remembrance, praise and service. This matter was also presented in the Most Holy Court, whereupon it was stated: “Our favor was manifestly bestowed upon him to such degree that We repeatedly summoned him to Our presence, conversed with him, and counseled him as befitted and was worthy of him.” However, as commanded, that beloved one must associate and converse with every soul in such a way that if any breach in friendship should occur, no evidence would remain, for it has been stated that most matters are contingent upon their means. While in the presence, he demonstrated the utmost love and sincerity, and he himself intended to spare no effort in serving the Cause to the extent of his ability. What else God, exalted be His glory, may ordain remains to be seen. The Most Great Branch - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps - also told him that if he were to choose to serve the Letter N, it would be closer to wisdom, that he might perchance be confirmed in conveying the renowned Word. What is said here is in accordance with wisdom. For instance, they have forbidden mention of the names of steadfast and assured souls in various regions, as harm might result, just as occurred in the Land of Ta, where they mentioned all souls both within and without, causing fear and alarm. Would that they had spoken truthfully - rather, they spoke utter falsehoods, God forbid, attributing rebellion and corruption. God protect us and you from the evil of these who know not what they say, who are as chaff before the winds of self and passion. We beseech God to guide all and adorn them with the ornament of truthfulness, purity and justice. Regarding what you wrote about Jinab-i-Mulla Husayn, upon him be the glory of God, having guided several souls to the ocean of divine knowledge - this account, as well as mention of various souls, was presented before Him. This is what the All-Merciful revealed in response, exalted be His grandeur: He is the Helper, the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>O Husayn! The Wronged One remembers thee as He remembered thee before, and counsels thee with that whereby the Cause of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, may be exalted. Thou art the one who entered the luminous Spot and heard the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree, and attained unto that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection. The Cause of God hath come, and that which was hidden from eyes hath been revealed, and those in the graves have been raised. Blessed is he who hath cast away idle fancies, holding fast to the cord of God that hath been stretched out. Blessed art thou for having praised thy Lord and mentioned to the servants that whereby hearts were attracted. We make mention of him who was named Ahmad who visited the House, and We give him glad tidings of the remembrance of God, the Mighty, the Loving. O Ahmad! Hold fast unto the Sure Handle. Thus doth the Lord of creation command thee from His prison fortress. And We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Qabil-i-Hashim who visited a House built by the Friend of God through the power of the Glorious One, that he may rejoice and give thanks unto his Lord, the Possessor of existence. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One - verily He remembers God during the nights and days, at sunrise and sunset. And We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Qabil-i-Rida and give him glad tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all names, and We counsel him to be steadfast in this exalted Cause. This is a Cause at whose appearance the world was shaken, save whom God willed, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Blessed is every steadfast one whom neither clamor frightened nor affairs deterred. O Mahmud! Give thanks unto God that the Wronged One remembereth thee in such wise that every possessor of scent perceiveth therefrom the fragrance of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of the seen and unseen. We counsel thee and those who have believed in that which God hath revealed in His Book that hath been sent down. Cast behind your backs all that is with the people, turning with your hearts to the horizon of Light. Say: This is a Light which, when it shone forth from the horizon of Will, all other lights submitted to it. To this testifieth the God of the Kingdom. The glory shining from the heaven of My will be upon him who mentioned you, and upon you, and upon him who guided you to the path of God, the Mighty, the Witnessed.</p>
<p>“They have attained what they desired through His grace. Can anyone enumerate the bounties and loving-kindness of God? Nay, by His Name, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting!”</p>
<p>This servant beseeches confirmation and assistance for each one, and likewise offers greetings and praise. God willing, may they arise to serve the Cause in such manner that their mention shall endure throughout the duration of names. Verily He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about Haji Muhammad Hassan and Aqa Siyyid Hashim and Aqa Ali-Naqi, upon them be the glory of God, it was presented before His presence and a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of His Will for each one. God willing, may they drink from the ocean of His utterance and be illumined by its lights. This is what was revealed for the first one, His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In the Name of the One God […]</p>
<p>Every soul that hath in this Day turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon and attained the knowledge of the Lord of Names is recorded as one of the people of Baha in the Books, Scriptures and Tablets. The Truth hath been made manifest, and with a single Word He hath tested all who dwell on earth. Likewise through that Word the reckoning of creation hath been completed, the accepted ones have been gathered together, the Balance hath been appointed, the Path extended, the Cry raised, and the mountains seen to move. Blessed is the soul that hath witnessed these mighty signs and become assured of and acknowledged that which God hath revealed. Know thou the worth of this station and beseech God, exalted be His glory, to keep thee steadfast and to confirm thee in deeds that are praiseworthy. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Hashim:</p>
<p>In His Name, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing!</p>
<p>This is the Day of deeds. Whosoever acteth in accordance with the divine ordinances is recorded before God as the most noble of all creation and inscribed in the Book. O friends! This is a Day the like of which hath not been, nor ever shall be conceived. Strive ye that there may appear from you that which befitteth the Day of God. The world is adorned with diverse colors. Its ornaments, embellishments and hues are, in the estimation of them that possess insight, like unto a mirage, and shall ere long return to nothingness. Beseech ye God that these fleeting things may not deprive you of His everlasting bounty, nor leave you bereft. Blessed art thou and thy father who hath attained unto that which was ordained. Strive thou to make up for that which hath been lost. Verily He is the True One, the Trustworthy. He commandeth His servants that which shall be a treasure for them in His mighty and impregnable Kingdom. The effulgent glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon the people of Baha who have not broken God’s Covenant and His Testament, and who have acted according to that which they were bidden in His perspicuous Book. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Jinab-i-’Ali-Qabl-i-Naqi:</p>
<p>He is the Guide to His straight Path […]</p>
<p>The time of words hath passed away, and the age of deeds hath dawned. Blessed is he who hath clung to pure deeds in the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed is the servant whom neither hopes nor riches have withheld from his ultimate destiny, who came forward when the Call was raised between earth and heaven, and answered his Ancient Lord. How many a wealthy one hath been hindered by his possessions, and how many a poor one hath attained the ocean of riches when it surged in My Name, the Generous, the Bountiful. How many a man of eloquence hath been prevented from praising Me through following his passions, and how many a stammerer hath gained My beauteous praise. How many a sun hath been darkened at the dawning of the lights of the morn of My Revelation, and how many a star hath fallen at the rising of the luminous Day Star of My Name, the Shining. Where are the eyes and ears that have been prevented by their occupations from beholding the Most Exalted Horizon and from hearkening to this Most Sweet Call on a Day wherein the lights of the Countenance have illumined after the passing away of all things, and wherein earthquakes have seized all, both small and great. Thus have the spheres of utterance revolved through the name of thy Lord, the Merciful. When thou hast succeeded and witnessed, say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the world, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who art wronged by the nations, and splendor be unto Thee, O Splendor of those who are in the heavens and on earth.”</p>
<p>God willing, may they attain through His boundless favors - He Who is the Sovereign of existence and the Possessor of the seen and unseen - and act in accordance with what hath been enjoined upon them in the Book. The smoke of idle fancies hath prevented the world from recognizing the Best-Beloved of all creation. We must all, with hands of longing, cling to the hem of His grace, that perchance through the breezes of mercy and the rains of bounty, the dead in the valley of heedlessness and desire may obtain life and attain unto life everlasting.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>O servant! Thou art favored by the grace of God and art mentioned in His presence. Mention by the Supreme Pen is among the great, pure, enduring, and special divine bounties for the servants. Whosoever attaineth unto it hath attained unto all good. However, the measure of success and prosperity hath ever been deeds performed in accordance with the commandments of God. Blessed are they who have attained thereunto. This is the Day wherein whatsoever is hidden shall be made manifest and every concealed thing shall become evident. This is the Day wherein secrets shall be brought to light, and this is the Day wherein all shall rise up. Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto the recognition of God, exalted be His glory, and hast drunk from the cup of His love at a time when all the world was deprived save for a few souls. Beseech God to assist thee in preserving that which hath been bestowed upon thee. Ibrahim hath repeatedly made mention of thee. We, from this station, send Our greetings upon thee and upon them that are with thee, and upon every believing man and believing woman who hath believed in God, the Lord of earth and heaven, the Desired One of all beings, and the Sovereign of the hereafter and of the former world. End. Praise be to God, thy brother is occupied in service and thou too hast attained unto recognition, and this servant, clinging to the hem of grace and bounty, beseecheth the Lord of Names to preserve this servant and thee and thy brother beneath the shade of the Tree of divine providence from the heat of self and passion, and to assist you in that which beseemeth His days. Verily, He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>And regarding the mention of nine names at the end of thy letter - Jinab-i-Aqa Abdul-Husayn and Aqa Ja’far and Aqa Mahdi and Muhammad-’Ali and Aqa Mahdi and Aqa ’Ali and Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Hashim, Aqa Sha’ban-’Ali and Aqa Mirza Muhammad, upon them be 96 (Baha’u’llah) - these were presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. This is what was revealed for them from the heaven of the grace of our Lord and your Lord, and our Goal and your Goal, and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth. His word, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One, the Stranger […]</p>
<p>O Party of God! Ye are the oppressed ones of the world. The enemies of this blessed party lie in ambush, and the oppressors watch from their outposts. From every direction fly the arrows of rancor, and the swords of hatred are unsheathed. They have had and have no helper save God. They have attained unto the light of His countenance and have scattered the pearls of life at His feet. Some gave up their lives, others their possessions, and some expended all they had. How many days and nights they found no rest from their sorrows. Yet all that hath befallen the party of God, exalted be His glory, is recorded and inscribed by His Most Exalted Pen. Soon shall they who have committed iniquity, infamy, rancor and hatred become aware of their own loss and the triumph of the Party of God, and shall witness it. O friends! Be not sorrowful, nor be ye shaken by the deeds of the oppressors. Praise be to God, ye have attained unto that which the divines of the earth, its rulers and learned ones are debarred from, though they were created for it. Blessed are ye, for ye have attained unto the knowledge and recognition and praise and glorification of God, exalted be His glory. Now strive ye, that heedlessness may not follow this awareness, and ignorance may not overtake this knowledge. Verily, He hath remembered you and counseled you with that which shall profit you in all the worlds of His worlds. He, verily, is the Sincere Counselor, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>The bounty of God is more manifest than this servant can mention. The rays of the Sun of His generosity have encompassed the world of being. This is a station wherein the feet of the mystics and the accomplished are seen to falter, unless divine protection confirmeth and keepeth them firm and steadfast. The preservation of this station, too, dependeth upon His grace and bounty. Without His grace, we are non-existent, null, and unmentioned. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>The other letter from that beloved one, dated the 13th of the blessed Ramadan, illumined the heart like light and perfumed the mind with the fragrance of wild roses. Praise be to God, the heavenly food of love descendeth continuously from the heaven of affection like the spring rains of mercy. May the true Sovereign bestow the reward of this friendship, love, attachment, kindness and unity. Concerning what you wrote about assisting the friends of God, news hath arrived from the land of Sh. and Abadih and other places. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid the friends in rendering important services.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the mount of Ustad Mihdi, upon him be the Glory of God, and the small amounts, it was submitted. He said that what was done is acceptable, for had it not been done, it surely would have caused sorrow. And this is what was revealed for him from the Most Exalted Pen, His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Compassionate, the Generous […]</p>
<p>O Mahdi! The diverse peoples of the world and the scattered parties among the nations were all created for the recognition of God, exalted be His glory, and for the remembrance, praise and service of His Cause. When the call was raised and the Most Exalted Horizon was illumined with the lights of His manifestation, all were found heedless and turned away. Nay more, they pronounced sentence of death upon the pure blood of the Dawning-Place of God’s verses. Fie upon them and upon those who went astray and led others astray! I beseech God to assist thee under all conditions to serve His Cause. Thou art remembered in the presence of the Wronged One, and these manifest verses have appeared from the horizon of the heaven of bounty especially for thee. Know thou their worth and preserve them as thou wouldst thy life. Every soul who today hath attained unto the mention of God, exalted be His glory, is accounted and mentioned among the people of Baha. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty be upon those who have hearkened to My call, turned to My horizon, and arisen to serve My Cause, and upon thee and upon everyone who hath remained steadfast and whom the hosts of the Pharaohs have not frightened - they who slay Husayn and then weep for him at eventide and at dawn.</p>
<p>Concerning your mention of the exalted leaf, the mother of Aqa Mirza Inayatu’llah, upon them both be the Glory of God, their remembrance was presented at the Most Holy Court, and this is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, exalted be His grandeur: “We have mentioned her in various Tablets and have revealed for her that through which every person of insight discovers the immortality in the paradise of their Lord, the All-Forgiving. We send Our greetings upon her from the prison, and upon the members of the household who have endured in the path of God that which caused all atoms to lament, and every possessor of an illumined heart.” We give them all the glad-tidings of His special favors and command them to that which befits the Days of God, and We counsel them to patience. The station of patience is most exalted. In the Qur’an He says, blessed and exalted be He: “O ye who believe! Seek help with patient perseverance and prayer, for God is with those who patiently persevere.” He mentioned patience before prayer, even though prayer is a pillar of the divine tabernacle of glory. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you, upon your elder and your younger ones, your first and your last, and upon those who love you, by the command of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The favor of God, exalted be His glory, towards them is more evident than the sun at its zenith and than fire upon the heights. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. No one can say why or wherefore, for He is the Mighty, the All-Choosing. This evanescent servant conveys greetings and salutations to the family members and the leaf, upon them be the Glory of God. May they all attain, God willing, to that which God loves. If there is sometimes delay in responding, this is due to the volume of correspondence. I beseech God for success for myself and all. He is powerful and mighty over all things.</p>
<p>I presented at the Most Holy Court that which was befitting regarding the newborn. The favor of God concerning them is manifest and evident. Blessed is the newborn who has attained to the mention of God, the Most Great, and blessed is the father whose service the Supreme Pen has testified to, and blessed is the mother who has attained His beautiful mention. O Amin! While you drink milk from your mother’s breast, the world of the seen and unseen makes mention of you. You were born in His days and have attained His favors. The pens of the world are incapable of properly describing this station. Blessed art thou and thy father and mother, from God, the Possessor of the Kingdom of the hereafter and the former times, the Lord of the Throne and the exalted Seat.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! This child has traversed in one night the path of a hundred years, nay rather, has attained to God’s favor and mention in days when faces, scholars, nobles, and mystics were all deprived, save whom God willed. This is a great bounty and a tremendous favor. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, that they may ever dwell beneath the shade of the Divine Tree and drink from the Kawthar of meanings and utterance.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon His countenance and standest firm in service to His Cause! Convey My greetings to all members of the family, both male and female, from the Wronged One, and give them the glad-tidings of God’s all-embracing mercy, exalted be His glory. The Leaf is present before His countenance. Each of the leaves hath made mention of God. God willing, that leaf shall be the cause of universal triumph. Well is it with them, and blessed are they! We have made mention of all in various Tablets through verses that have enraptured the Concourse on High and the denizens of Paradise. We beseech God to aid them all, both men and women, in that which He loveth and is pleased with. In all matters let them act with justice. Poverty and wealth have ever been in the grasp of divine power. Ere long shall all good things return to that household, and the tongues of the world shall be loosed in its praise.</p>
<p>And as to their intention to pay the Huquq, excellent is what they have intended thereby. Their station shall be exalted and blessings shall descend upon them. Verily their Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. They are adorned and illumined with the lights of the Sun of grace and favor. A door hath been opened unto them which all the powers and forces of the world are powerless to shut. This is from God’s grace, which He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>It is submitted that one year or more before the martyrdom of the King of Martyrs, he sent a letter to His Holiness Ismu’llah (upon him be all the most glorious Glory), wherein he beseeched that this servant had a property belonging exclusively to himself, in which no one else had any share, and requested that out of kindness and generosity they accept that it be sold and its proceeds be sent. And His Holiness Ismu’llah submitted this before the Presence. They accepted it, but concerning its sale a prohibition was issued. His blessed and exalted Word: “We have accepted it, but let it remain in their possession. They are trustees on behalf of God, let them dispose of it.” The intention was that some arrangement be made regarding that property and a specific use be determined for it. Now let that beloved one consider - whatever the heirs wish shall be done. This matter is mentioned because, since it was accepted, they should determine its disposition and in all circumstances take into account the satisfaction of the heirs.</p>
<p>As to what they wrote regarding the sum of two being for the Huquq and the property, what should be done - it was submitted and They said to act in whatever way they deem advisable, and these general matters are, according to the Command, dependent upon and subject to consultation.</p>
<p>Concerning what they wrote about Aqa Bigum who attained, the servant testifies that she was and is mentioned before the denizens of the pavilions of chastity and virtue and the tents of grandeur. And whatsoever that beloved one wrote was submitted before the Presence and achieved the honor of being heard. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, His word, exalted and mighty be He: “We have made mention of her and given her to drink of the choice wine of attainment, and We have counseled her with that which beseemeth the days of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. And We send Our greetings upon her and counsel her once again with that wherewith We counseled her before. She must hold fast unto the handle of the Cause and give thanks unto her Lord, the Generous.”</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about the epistle of the kindred of His Holiness the King of Martyrs’ sacred household, and likewise their successive tribulations and afflictions, and the degrees of their yearning and longing, their humility and supplication, and their cries and lamentations, and their hopes and aspirations - all of which have adorned the Holy Books, Psalms and Tablets - these matters were presented during two and a half hours on Monday night when the Ancient Beauty was alone and established upon the Throne. This is what the Tongue of Revelation spoke in reply:</p>
<p>God bears witness that not for a single day have they been absent from His sight. In all conditions, the glance of His favor has been directed towards them. None but God can enumerate their sighs in divine love. The Teacher of the realm of love and affection could fill numerous volumes with their tears of separation. The extent of their yearning and longing is evident and clear, but since the prison land is inwardly disturbed, permission for their presence was not granted. You know how many souls from all directions, with countless lamentations, humility and supplications, have begged for and continue to beseech permission to attain His presence. Nevertheless, only a few have been blessed with the effulgent rays of the Sun of Permission. Despite this, the heedless have said what they have said. Oppression has taken the place of justice, ignorance the seat of knowledge, and tyranny the station of equity. They speak without understanding, and verily they are among the most lost.</p>
<p>This year, trusting in God and detached from all else, let them intend to come. If the way is open and the paths are clear of satans, they shall attain their goal. Otherwise, they must turn with complete resignation and contentment toward the House and attain to pilgrimage. Verily, He accepts the deeds of the doers and does not suffer the reward of the righteous to be lost.</p>
<p>All the members of the pavilion of chastity and virtue have repeatedly beseeched His presence regarding this matter, but due to the opposition of the opposers, the burning fire of the fanatics, the prevention of the preventers, and the oppression of the oppressors, permission was not granted. Now He has said: Let them proceed, trusting in God and content with His command and will, toward the ultimate goal, but they must act with perfect wisdom and hold fast to prudence. Repeatedly from the Tongue of Grandeur this most exalted word was heard: He says the Manifestation of Truth is for the revelation of the Most Great Bounty and the Greatest Joy, that all might attain His presence and drink from the Kawthar of reunion, but enemies and the bearers of hatred have become like clouds between the Sun of Truth and His loved ones.</p>
<p>And likewise in one instance He uttered this most exalted word: Just as the loved ones of God, exalted be His glory, seek His presence and meeting, God too seeks to meet them. Verily He loves those who love Him, and they love Him. This evanescent servant beseeches and hopes from God, exalted be His glory, that He may cause those honored ladies to attain that which is recorded and inscribed in the Book of God. He is the Bestower, the Powerful. After hearing these exalted words from the Source of Command, such joy was experienced that none greater could be imagined, for the leaves of the Blessed Tree have never ceased […]</p>
<p>After these exalted words were heard from the Source of the Cause, such joy was experienced that none greater can be conceived. For always have the leaves of the Blessed Tree and this evanescent servant hoped and yearned for permission for this station from the Ocean of the Pre-existent Lord’s generosity. His is the praise and bounty, His the gratitude and favor.</p>
<p>Another letter from that Beloved One arrived which was a radiant and brilliant light dispelling the darkness of separation, and a luminous joy for the world of sorrow. It was like a spiritual messenger bringing glad tidings of reunion to the body. Well is it with your honor. And that mention was made of the beloved of the heart, his honor Varqa, upon him be the glory of God, opened wide the gates of gladness and delight. The armies of joy arrived and the hosts of sorrows fled like frightened zebras. Praise and gratitude be to God that the oppression of the oppressors, the hatred of the corrupt divines, and the swords of the deniers had no effect. After his capture, a word was revealed from the Supreme Pen to his honor Afnan, his honor A.H., upon him be all the most glorious glory, indicating his protection. A hundred thousand thanks to the Goal of the worlds that He granted the glad tidings of his release, bestowing upon the ear a wondrous delight from hearing it and upon the heart boundless joy from its truth. He is the Kind One and He is the Ultimate Hope of the friends.</p>
<p>And regarding what was written about the arrival of the leaves, three leaves were sent - may they be bestowed upon their owners. Blessed are they for having fulfilled God’s Covenant and His pledge, and for having acted according to what He revealed in the Book. And regarding what was written that these funds should be sent to whomever is designated, let them be used as commanded and let some debts be paid. In this regard, this supreme blessed word was uttered from the tongue of the Lord of Names: “Excellent is what they have done in the love of God and His path. Their deeds have been accepted and blessed is he who has not forgotten the one named Ja’far.” The funds that reached him, that is his honor Ustad Ja’far the mason, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, were most acceptable before the Throne. We beseech God to assist all to do what is right.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant submits that that beloved one should be very careful in recording names and certain matters. In one letter Jinab-i-Isma’il Khan was written, and in another letter Aqa Isma’il ’Ali Khan was written. There have been other discrepancies as well. Although the reason is known and clear - that your honor’s complete attention at the time of writing has been and is directed toward that which is sanctified above all directions - nevertheless, since this servant must write what is true, especially regarding names and other matters, lest differences arise in what is said among the servants, therefore he requests that great care be taken in such matters when writing.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about the spiritual beloved, his honor A.T., upon him be the glory and favor of God, his letter arrived and multiple correspondences had arrived before as well. May he be blessed through the infinite favors of the Goal of the worlds. Indeed his honor […]</p>

<p>Praise be to Him Who is sanctified above all mention and utterance, the Goal of all worlds, Who illumined the universe with the lights of oneness and raised high above the loftiest horizon the Most Great Standard of “Verily there is none other God but Him.” The might of princes hindered Him not, nor held Him back from His purpose. He sent forth His Messengers and revealed His Books that all might attain unto the straight path and be made ready to recognize the momentous News on the Day of Resurrection. His is the praise and bounty, His the grace and bestowal. He created and showed the way that all might attain to that which was the purpose of creation. Exalted be His favor and exalted be His all-embracing mercy and His mighty generosity. Blessing and peace be upon the Lord of the world and Educator of the nations, through Whom messengership and prophethood were concluded, and upon His family and companions, forever and ever eternally.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali, upon him be the peace of God, arrived and made mention of you. Therefore this Wronged One hath once again turned toward that direction, that He might give thee to drink of the Salsabil of love from the cup of faithfulness. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid thee and make thee successful in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily He is the Lord of the Day of Judgment and the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Should thou find a friend, convey greetings from the Wronged One, that the greeting might draw him nigh unto the Lord of all beings and confirm him in that which hath been revealed in the Book.</p>

Blessed is the soul that has sought it and turned to it and drunk therefrom in His Name, the Mighty, the All-Wise. And woe unto him who hath turned away and hesitated before this supreme bounty. Thereafter, your letter was received which brought the utmost joy. I beseech God, glorified be His majesty, that He may ever keep you protected and joyful beneath the shade of the Tree of His loving-kindness. Although the recent news caused infinite grief, yet whatsoever occurs in the path of divine love, even if it be sheer detriment, is assuredly pure good. Blessed is he unto whom hath happened in His path that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an through His words “Then wish for death, if ye do speak the truth.” In any case, whatsoever occurs in the path of the Friend’s good-pleasure is beloved. The essence is the knowledge of God and love of God. Whosoever attaineth unto this station, by the life of God, death shall not grieve him, nor shall armies prevent him, nor shall earthly conditions sadden him, nor shall ranks frighten him. As for the permission that was sought - affairs are bound to their appointed times. It is hoped that permission will be granted and they shall attain unto it. The glory be upon you, and we beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for you the good of this world and the next. Verily He is the Giver, the Responsive.</p>

<p>In these days when in the heavens of manifestation the spiritual suns have risen from the horizons of visibility, and the effulgences of the Sun of the Most Glorious Countenance shine forth from the dawning-places of existence, and the dawnings of divine knowledge gleam from the eastern horizons of the Kingdom, the moons of wisdom, in accordance with their illumination from the Ancient Sun, are giving light in every direction, and the stars of eternity are shining with perfect radiance from the heavenly spheres of existence. It would be a pity if one possessed of insight and knowledge should still be illumined by the light of a setting star of idle fancies and seek enlightenment from the moon of imagination which is in eclipse. Nay, the Sun hath shone forth from the pole of the heaven of the world with wondrous new effulgences of light. O friend! In these days the Ancient and Imperishable Beauty, the Unknowable Essence, Who was concealed behind a thousand thousand subtle veils of light, hath now appeared from behind the veil, and with but a single gleam from the effulgences of His countenance hath caused those who stood at Mount Sinai to swoon away and become as though they had never existed. Say: Verily, I have turned my face toward Him Who hath created the supreme heavens and hath rent asunder the lands of the Pharaohs, and I am not of those who join partners with God. Oh, oh! The Sun of Beauty hath made the world of hearts more radiant than the luminous day, and hath wiped clean from the tablets of hearts the rust of rational knowledge’s manifestations.

God willing, may all attain unto that which God has intended, and he who attains shall not be frightened by the might of those on earth, nor shall he be made to stumble by the deceptions of the deceitful ones and the schemes of the transgressors. That honored one must in all circumstances be mindful of wisdom. The sword of utterance has been and ever will be sharper than the sword of steel, and the fruit of reformation more delectable and pleasing than the fruits of the world. Therefore must the sincere ones occupy themselves with planting the trees of reformation. If the root of this tree becomes firmly established through the grace of the Lord of creation, the roots of corruption shall be lifted from the world. You must, to the extent possible, remind the loved ones of God so that all may act according to that which they have been commanded, and all may become mines of love and affection and dawning-places of fellowship and unity. We beseech God, exalted be He, to make you one who remembers Him with His remembrance and who speaks forth His praise in such wise that hearts are attracted thereby and servants arise from the slumber of passion and turn toward God, the Lord of Names.

Verily he hath taken for himself a station before the eyes of his Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. By the life of God! This is of His most great favor, yet most of the people are heedless. Thus hath the matter been decreed and the utterance come forth in this holy, mighty and wondrous Tablet.</p>

<p>He is the Hearer, the Answerer</p>
<p>A mention from Us to him who hath turned to the Wronged One while He was in prison through what the heedless had wrought, that the fragrances of remembrance might attract him to a station wherein he seeth naught save God, the Lord of all worlds. This is a Day wherein is heard from the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all mankind,” and from the murmuring of the Water of Life: “By God! He hath come through Whom the eye of the Bayan was solaced throughout all possibility,” and from the whistling of the winds: “He hath appeared concerning Whom the Books, the Psalms and the Tablets have testified, from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath turned to God when every ignorant one remote from Him turned away. As We were walking in the House, the servant who was present entered with thy letter and read it before Our countenance. We have sent down for thee this Perspicuous Book which calleth out with the most exalted call between earth and heaven and summoneth all unto the One, the All-Informed. When thou hast attained unto the traces of My Most Exalted Pen and found the fragrance of utterance from the garment of My loving-kindness, give thanks and say: “Praise be unto Thee for having caused me to hear Thy call and enabled me to turn to Thy horizon when the people were veiled by a thick veil.” I beseech Thee by Thy most beautiful names and the manifestations of Thy power in the kingdom of creation to aid me to be steadfast in Thy Cause whereby the limbs of the learned trembled and the pillars of the idolaters were shaken. Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds.</p>

A mention from Us to him who has turned to the lights of the Face when the Desired One came with manifest sovereignty, that he may know that for which being was created to know Him, and hear that for which ears were created to hearken unto Him, and bear witness to that which God did testify before the creation of earth and heaven, that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Abu-Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali, hear the call of the Wronged One Who hath stood before all faces with power whereby the feet of princes and divines have slipped, and with a sovereignty that hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thy son made mention of thee; We make mention of thee in this mighty, wondrous Book. We have aided thee and caused thee to know and have cast upon thee a favor from Us, and We have forgiven thee as a mercy from Us. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Say: My God, my God! Unto Thee be praise and glory, and unto Thee be thanks and splendor, for having guided me to Thy straight path and Thy mighty announcement. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance and the pearls of the sea of Thy knowledge, that Thou write down for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen what Thou hast written for Thy chosen servants. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden. I acknowledge my grievous sins and great transgressions before the Dayspring of Thy generosity and the Dawning-Place of Thy bounty and the Manifestation of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee to make me sanctified from all that Thou lovest not and approvest not. Verily Thou art the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, and in Thy grasp is the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>

A mention from Us to the one whom We mentioned before, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. O Faridun! We have remembered thee and do remember thee as a favor from Us, and We remember him who turned to My horizon and soared in My atmosphere. Verily he was named “The Exalted” in My Mighty Book. O Rafi’! Rejoice in My Most Great Signs, then stand firm in the Cause of thy Lord, the Master of all beings. By the life of God! We shall raise up the Cause through a clear sovereignty. Grieve not over that with which the children play in the land of Ta. Verily He shall manifest His Cause as He pleaseth. All the hosts of the earth cannot prevent Him. To this beareth witness that which hath appeared from the presence of a Mighty, Ancient Being. We have seized him who pronounced judgment against My loved ones, then We seized one who was greater than he. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Be thou steadfast in His Cause, speaking forth His Name and guiding unto His Straight Path. O Badi’! Shouldst thou find the sweetness of My utterance, the wine of the river of My knowledge would so intoxicate thee that neither the clamor of all the world nor the murmuring of every far-off mystic would hinder thee. Soon shall the world and all that is therein perish, and there shall endure that which hath been sent down for thee from My Most Exalted Pen in this glorious station.

<p>A remembrance from Us unto him that hath hearkened unto My Call, and whose response to the Lord of all mankind We have heard, that he may be overtaken by the joy born of Mine utterance, notwithstanding that sorrows have encompassed the entire creation. O thou proclaimer of My Cause, and beholder of My Countenance! Grieve not at that which hath befallen the Cause: thy Lord, truly, lieth in wait. He shall lay hold on the wrongdoers, even as He laid hold on him that was their chief; He, truly, is severe in punishing! They have kindled with their own hands the fire of affliction; yet are the people in a wondrous stupor! So besotted have they become in the drunkenness of their evil passions that they have perpetrated that whereat the cloud hath cried out. Say: Was it Hasan who disbelieved in God, or was it that which he possessed? If it was he, why then didst thou pillage his possessions, O thou false dissembler? Think they that they will consume what they have amassed? Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of Lords! They have committed that whereat the inmates of the Kingdom have lamented, and beyond them the Day of Reckoning. O My companion! Consider thou, and reflect upon, the grace of God, and His loving-kindness. He, verily, raised them up in truth, and adorned them with the best of ornaments. He so ennobled them that men’s tongues spake forth their praise; He honoured them with that Supreme Sacrifice which hath from everlasting been the hope of them that have drawn nigh unto Him; and the Pen of God hath been moved to commemorate them in such wise that all hearts have melted. The servant in attendance hath come before Our Countenance, and read out that wherewith thou didst call upon this Wronged One; and We have answered thee with this Epistle. Beware lest aught sadden thee; thereto admonish My branches, and those who have sought My Countenance, that it may bring them joy after their sorrows. The Glory of God rest upon thee, and upon whosoever reflecteth upon that which hath been revealed by God, the Lord of the Return. This is that which was sent down in reply from God, the Almighty, the Most Bountiful.</p>

We have remembered thee before, and remember thee in this Tablet which proclaimeth that there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

Blessed be thy verse and prose - from both We have inhaled the fragrance of thy love for thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. He shall verily reward thee with truth.

Where are they who turned away from God, who warred against His sovereignty, who disputed His signs and denied His proof? We seized them unawares.

But there shall endure for thee and for those who have stood fast that which shall not perish so long as the Kingdom and the realm above endure.

Whoso hath attained unto My recognition hath sacrificed himself in My path. This is what hath been set down by the Pen of Revelation in the Scriptures and Tablets.

<p>The All-Sanctified, the Most Great, the Most Glorious! Glorified be He Who hath manifested the Manifestation of His Cause as He pleaseth, and caused Him to speak forth verses whereby all atoms were attracted, that all might be assured that He is the Powerful, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Omnipotent. Verily in the imprisonment of the Ancient Beauty among the nations and His establishment upon the Most Great Throne are signs for those who know. He spoke when cut off from all means, and delivered the Cause while in the hands of the oppressors. In tribulation He called upon the Lord of Names, in hardship He remembered the Lord of all beings, and in sorrows He summoned all in the contingent world unto the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who hath acknowledged, woe unto the deniers. Behold, O servant, how God seized those who cast the Tablet of God behind their backs and killed him who came unto them with clear authority. We sent forth the Wonderful One with authority from Us, and dispatched Him with a mercy from Our presence unto him who turned away from the Truth, that God’s proof might be completed against him. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. When he appeared before him, he was seized with injustice and there befell him that which caused the dwellers of Paradise to lament. Therefore did God seize those in the lands and sent down upon them hunger and fear that they might awaken and be of those who repent. He awakened not at God’s might; soon will He seize him with vengeful power from His presence. Verily He is the most severe of avengers. Nothing whatsoever escapeth thy Lord’s knowledge. He doeth what He willeth through His authority and decreeth what He pleaseth. Thus have We informed thee and imparted unto thee that which gladdeneth thy heart, that thou mayest be of the thankful ones.</p>

<p>Glorified be He Who hath rent asunder the veil and manifested Him Who was hidden within the veils of the unseen and concealed throughout all eternity. Yet when He came with the truth, the people opposed Him and all in the land were troubled, save those who discovered the fragrance of the Beloved and turned to Him with illumined hearts. The Most Great Ocean hath surged in the name of the Ancient King, yet most of the peoples remain heedless. The eyes have been afflicted with the ophthalmia of vain imaginings, whereby they are prevented from beholding the face of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. All things have perished save His Face that shineth from this manifest horizon. Blessed is the eye that hath beheld the Most Great Vision, and blessed the heart that hath turned unto the Object of the desire of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>Thy letter hath come before the Throne; therefore hath the Pen of Command moved to make mention of thee in this glorious Tablet. Give thanks for having attained unto the recognition of God and for having been mentioned in the Tablets. This is naught but a mighty favor. Say: O my God! Praise be unto Thee for having enabled me to recognize Thy Cause and for having made known unto me the Dayspring of Thy Self and the Dawning-Place of Thy signs, on a Day whereon all creation hath been seized with the drunkenness of vain desires save those whom the hand of Thy favors hath delivered. Thou art, verily, the Almighty over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Generous. O my Lord! Make me steadfast in Thy love in such wise that the affairs of the world shall not disquiet me, nor shall the veils of them that have disbelieved in Thee and in Thy signs hinder me. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Subduing, the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>

Thus hath the matter in this Tablet been ordained by the Finger of the Spirit. Give thanks unto God for having ordained for thee what thou desired, and for not depriving thee of the wondrous tokens of His grace, for He hath ever been merciful unto His servants. Beware lest thou take anyone besides Me as thy protector, or as thy beloved. Be steadfast in the Cause, then remember Me at eventide and at dawn, and be firm in thy Lord’s Cause.

How many a servant hath heard and responded, and hastened unto the ocean of His Most Great Name, the All-Glorious; and among them are such as have turned away from God and denied His verses and rejected His proof and pronounced judgment against Him with manifest injustice. We counsel thee and those who have believed even as We have counseled all in My Preserved Tablet: Abandon that which the people possess, then turn ye unto the Most Sublime Vision, the station wherein the Lord of Destiny hath proclaimed: “There is none other God but I, the Manifest, the Speaking, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” Beware lest the doubts of the people of the Bayan prevent you, or the allusions of those who are heedless of this momentous News withhold you. Say: This is the Day of Arising, did ye but know it, and this is the Day of remembrance and praise, were ye to understand. By God! The mention of a single mention from My Most Exalted Pen equalleth the worship of all who dwell on earth and in heaven. To this beareth witness the Lord of all creation in His preserved Tablet. Thus hath the ocean of knowledge surged forth as a bounty from His presence. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Give thanks and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of them that know!</p>

<p>O Master Baqir the Carpenter in the City! He is the Most Mighty, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious! God bears witness that there is no God but Him and that this One Who has appeared with the name Husayn-’Ali is His splendor to those in the Concourse on High, then His radiance to those in the Kingdom of Names, then His power to those in the cities of light, then His manifestation and beauty to all the worlds. O servant! Preserve what God has testified of Himself, by Himself, to Himself in this Tablet, then recite it nine times each day according to the number of this Name by which the heavens of names were cleft asunder, then the earth of hatred was split, then the hearts of every sinful polytheist were troubled. O servant! Arise in the Cause of God with such steadfastness that all who are in the heavens and earth cannot make you slip - thus befits your station if you hear the melodies of your Lord in these days when all ears have been made deaf and were deprived of hearkening to the Word of God, save those who heard the mention of their Lord, the All-Merciful, from this Beauty Who has ascended the throne with a sovereignty that encompasses all the worlds. And if you wish to know what has befallen your Lord, know that all the evils of the first and the last have been sent forth in one soul, and it has risen against My wronged Self, if you be informed of this. O servant! When you find yourself alone in your house, then remember My loneliness. And if you find sorrow in yourself, then reflect on My sorrows. And if you journey to other lands, then remember My exile and My tribulation. And if you see a prisoner with chains of iron around his neck, then remember My imprisonment and what I have suffered from those who have denied God and were far from the holy path. Would that My tribulations were only to the extent that We have mentioned to you! By Him Who holds Baha’s soul in His hand, were I to mention what has befallen Me from the enemies in the innermost mystery, the heaven would be rent asunder, the earth would be cleft, the mountains would crumble, the trees would be stripped of fruit, and the seas of their waves. By God the Truth! If you were to clear your vision you would witness the denizens of the Supreme Paradise beating upon their heads, and were you to turn with another vision you would behold the Ancient Beauty having rent from His temple the cloak of patience. Thus does the Pen of the All-Choosing mention to you what has befallen Me from these wicked ones, that you may become seeing of the truth. But We have veiled the matter lest the veil of concealment be rent from all created things and the cry of those near to God be raised in the pavilion of mighty glory. And you, O servant, be content with Me instead of others and break not God’s covenant and His testament, for besides Him nothing will suffice you - none denies this save every wretched polytheist. Then know that We have named your son in the Kingdom of Names ’Abdu’l-Baha. Therefore mention him by this name. By God the Truth! When this name issued from the tongue of your Lord, all who were immersed in the depths of names called out to him with this name, which was mentioned in the Mother Book by God Himself. And the Glory be upon you and upon those with you who have taken God as their Guardian. Then know, O Baqir, that We have named your son outwardly with the first pillar of My name, which is Husayn, and inwardly with ’Abdu’l-Baha. Thus was the matter decreed by the Pen of the Spirit.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Ja’far! He is the Mighty. God hath testified within His Own Self, unto His Own Self, before the manifestation of His attributes and names in the dominion of His creation, that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. His is might and sovereignty, His is grandeur and grace, His is power and testing. He testeth whom He willeth among His creatures, and He is the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. He it is Who hath sent forth the Messengers with truth that there is none other God but Him and that ’Ali is the Manifestation of His Self in what was and what shall be. Say: He is the King of Kings and the Merciful unto the servants. He distinguisheth whom He willeth with His mercy, and verily He is the Forgiving, the Compassionate. And thou, O servant, give thanks unto God for what hath been sent down unto thee - a Book inscribed. Verily it hath been sent down with truth for people who understand. Then remind others of what is therein, for it sufficeth thee beyond all who are in the heavens and earth, and guideth thee to the right-hand Mount in this blessed and praiseworthy spot. Say: By God, this is a detailed Book, detailed from the presence of God, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Say: The Holy Spirit speaketh in this polished and burnished breast, and calleth the loved ones of God to what was ordained in the Bayan, and this is an irrevocable decree inscribed by the Finger of Power upon a preserved and mighty tablet. Thus have We sent down unto thee this Tablet that thou mayest rejoice therein and be of those who warm themselves at the fire of God. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon every patient servant.</p>

Whoso hath attained unto Him hath attained unto the presence of God, and whoso hath turned away is accounted among the idolaters in the Preserved Tablet.</p>
<p>Thy remembrance was mentioned before the Wronged One. There hath been sent down for thee that which hath caused the hearts of the chosen ones to soar and all things to speak. The Cause hath come, and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Loving. Rejoice thou in My remembrance and arise to serve the Cause of thy Lord, the Possessor of the seen and the unseen. Convey My glorification to My loved ones who have cast away all else but Me and have drunk the choice wine of steadfastness from the hand of My bounty, and say: By God! This is the Day wherein the Self-Subsisting hath come with His irrevocable decree. Beware lest anything withhold you from God. Verily, He hath appeared in truth and unto Him shall all return. Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have cast aside vain imaginings and idle fancies. These are My chosen ones in My realms and My loved ones throughout My lands.

<p>O Nasru’llah Khan, upon him be the Glory of God! In the name of the One Friend. Divine favors have been directed towards you and you have been engaged in the mention of God and service to His Cause. All matters are remembered before His presence and recorded in the Preserved Tablet. The reward of no one has been lost. Know thou the value of this exalted station and preserve it as thou wouldst thy life. God willing, may the coldness of the earthly world not prevent thee from being enkindled, nor deprive thee from the eternal station. Know thou the value of this bounty and speak forth in praise and thanksgiving. The Tablets which you had requested in previous years and which were promised, were revealed in those same days until they were sent this year in the company of Mulla Muhammad-’Ali. Verily, He fulfilleth what He hath promised. The Divine Tablet has been and will ever be a helper and supporter in all conditions - that is, in life and death, in presence and absence. For the living it is the Water of Life, and for the dead it is eternal and abiding remembrance. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the Word of God in his life and after his death. This is why the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - hath said that all exists for the sake of being mentioned but once in His presence. Therefore be thou grateful for thy Lord’s favor and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of all who are in the heavens and the earth, for having honored me and granted me what I desired from the ocean of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous.”</p>

Then thou didst enter once again this land, wherein every atom of its atoms lamenteth by reason of what hath befallen the Youth without clear proof or illuminating Book. Grieve not at this, for verily the Youth is in supreme joy and gladness. By God! He yearneth for tribulations in the path of His Lord even as the sinful yearn for the mercy of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. And the more intense the tribulations become, the more doth the fire of His love increase - and thy Lord is witness to what I say. If thou shouldst meet My loved ones, glorify their countenances on My behalf, then recount unto them what thou hast known and learned and witnessed, that they may soar in the atmosphere of detachment and be severed from all who dwell on earth. Convey My remembrance unto Kamal and say: Be thou steadfast, then hold fast unto the Ark of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, for the waters of heedlessness have encompassed all lands - soon shalt thou find their inhabitants among the drowned, save whom thy Lord willeth, for He preserveth whom He pleaseth, and He is powerful over all things.

<p>O my mother! Your letter has reached this servant, adorned at its head with the crown of the Most Great Name, beginning after mention of this servant with: “I am yearning, I am grieving, I am needy, I am fearful…” and so forth.

Heedless souls have chosen transient ornaments over everlasting bounty. The fair-minded are seen to be afflicted and oppressed at the hands of the oppressors. That which occurred in the land of Sad is a truthful witness to what We have mentioned. Blessed is the one whom the whisperings of the people of error did not prevent from the Self-Subsisting Lord. O handmaiden of God! Thou dwellest in thy place while the Wronged One of the world hath turned toward thee from the Most Great Prison and maketh mention of thee. If thou wert to render thanks with all the tongues of the world, it would be seen as non-existent and null before this supreme bounty. Know thou the value of this favor and hold fast to the cord of His grace. Convey My greetings to the handmaidens of that land - the bondsmaids of God - and We give glad-tidings to all of the mention of God, that they may all occupy themselves with praise and glorification in the days of His manifestation with the utmost joy and delight. At this moment the Supreme Pen maketh mention of thy daughter. How excellent is the state of one who in this divine Day hath drunk from the choice wine of His love and hath turned toward His horizon.

The divine nightingale winged its flight from the heavenly garden to this mortal world, and for a few days, perched upon the branches of time, warbled its soul-stirring, melodious notes. Then it soared to its ultimate goal. Verily He knoweth its return, its origin and its destination. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Those songs and melodies brought assurance to the faithful and increased the fear of the treacherous. Therefore the sword was drawn and trembling seized all the tribes, and most of those souls who had turned to the most exalted horizon attained martyrdom and quaffed the deadly poison as though it were spirit-giving honey in the path of the Friend. And when the Luminary of the horizons illumined the horizon of Iraq, no voice was raised from any direction, and no movement was observed from any body. All were found to be dead or withered while living, and were concealed behind veils from the severity of the days and the wrath of men. When these things were witnessed, We arose to promote the Cause - an arising after which there was no sitting down. And when, through divine power, the banners of the Most Great Remembrance were raised upon the highest station of the world, the buzzing of flies emerged from behind the veil. Verily thy Lord knoweth what befell the Temple of the Cause at the hands of the oppressors.

However, O my God, since he believed in Thee through Thy First Beauty, whom Thou didst distinguish above Thy servants, making Him the Seal of Thy Prophets, the Beginning of Thy Chosen Ones, a Light in Thy lands, and a treasure and honor for Thy trusted ones - therefore Thou didst make the end of his days the beginning of Thy days, and the ultimate attainment of his maturity the attainment to the Manifestations of Thy unity and arrival in the precincts of Thy oneness.

<p>In the Name of the All-Knowing Expositor! The Promise hath come, and He Who is Promised declareth: O thou who art mentioned before the Throne and who standest before the Face! If today a single word were to appear from the treasuries of the love of God’s chosen ones, the ignorant ones of the earth would arise to extinguish the lights of the Manifestation of Him Who conversed on Sinai. For a time, silence must needs be observed. Mirza Baqir, who is now called Sadr’ul-’Ulama, once attained Our presence in Iraq. Verily, We found him bereft of knowledge and wisdom. Later in the land of Taff he became an associate of Siyyid Muhammad. What he heard thereafter is evident. By God’s life, it was and is not worthy of mention. Siyyid Muhammad, Hadi and he were not with Us and are ignorant of the root of the Cause. Likewise, Ibn-i-Mas’ud met Us but once. These souls have been mentioned and counted in the Book of God by the Divine Pen as being like the narrators of Jabulqa and Jabulsa and the realm of falsehood. Glory be to God! What were the signs of the Manifestation, and from where did the Qa’im appear? Say: O people of the Bayan, speak with justice and fairness. Do not again afflict the helpless people with vain imaginings. Today the Finger of Power hath rent asunder the veils of glory and removed the coverings. Be not occupied, like the former people, with tyranny, oppression and the shedding of blood. These have taken vain imagination as their lord instead of God. By My life, they were and are deprived of truthfulness and sincerity. The foul odor of deceitful souls hath altered and destroyed the cities of truth and purity. Praise and thanks be to God that such souls who are the dawning-places of hypocrisy in the world have not entered the luminous garden of inner meanings. In times of fear they are the first to deny, and in times of security the first to believe. The life and conduct of such souls is an eloquent witness and truthful testimony to their falsehood and hypocrisy. For were they truthful, they would have attained martyrdom. Nay, by God! They were not and are not worthy of this station and deserving of this most great favor. He who hath been named Sadr’ul-’Ulama without merit partaketh of the king’s salt, yet from head to foot manifest signs of his ingratitude are evident and visible. In the mosque and in the presence of the divines he is counted among the defenders of religion, while before the government authorities he is mentioned as being of that party. Strange it is that to this day the government authorities have not recognized such souls. Night and day they are occupied with deceit and cunning. They led Ahmad Kirmani astray through false accusations that caused the lamentation of truth and the wailing of justice to be raised up, yet His Excellency the Deputy, despite being informed, issued no judgment in accordance with justice. You and the fair-minded know that Dawlat-Abadi and Mirza Baqir Isfahani - who without merit was named Sadr’ul-’Ulama - are the instigators, and each day they are occupied with digging pits for the government and these wronged ones. God will soon reveal what is in their hearts through His exalted Word in the Surih of Luqman: “If it be the weight of a grain of mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth…” to the end of the verse.</p>
<p>O thou who art remembered before the Wronged One! This is the Day wherein hidden things shall be made manifest. The treachery of the eyes and the secrets of the hearts have been and shall be revealed. Blessed are the fair-minded ones! For forty years this Wronged One hath held the reins of affairs and summoned the people of God to tranquility, dignity and love for the sovereign, taking from them a firm covenant that they would not, under any circumstances, molest anyone in the dominions of His Majesty the Sultan - may the All-Merciful assist him - even should the heedless tear them asunder, piece by piece. A clear witness and faithful testimony to this is the recent incident in the land of Yazd, where the steadfast and assured souls folded their arms while those bereft of justice and fairness cut seven souls to pieces, then stoned them, then extracted their pure and holy bodies from beneath the stones, set them aflame with oil and burned them, and then commanded the Jews to carry away their bones and cast them into pits. Glory be to God! First they seized whatever worldly goods they possessed. Verily, such tyranny was manifested as hath had no parallel from the beginning of the world until now. Then they martyred His Eminence Khalil with the most grievous torment. They have drunk of the blood of the monotheists in such measure as neither the Tigris nor the Euphrates, neither the Oxus nor the Sihon can equal.</p>
<p>O son of Abhar! Say to the Greater Nabil and Fadil: By the life of God! The cord of divine prevention hath bound their mighty hands, and the chain of the firm decree of the Lord hath held them back from aggression. In the early dawn, the breezes of the All-Merciful’s mercy passed over what remained of those bodies, and from their rustling was heard that which caused tablet and pen to weep. Some of these wronged ones had no mother to weep and lament for them; therefore did the Mother of the Bayan lament and the Mother of the Book weep. Have the tyrannical souls not yet awakened? Say: O people! Hold fast to justice and fairness, and cling to the hem of God’s religion. Religion is a manifest light and an impregnable fortress for the protection and preservation of the people of the world. How excellent was that which was formerly spoken:</p>
<p>Whatever thou seest save His love - that is religion, paint it in thy heart;</p>
<p>Whatever thou findest save God - that is an idol, break it to pieces.</p>
<p>O son of Abhar! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Destiny! Today the people of Baha must cleave unto unity and concord, and through wisdom and utterance adorn the people of the world with the light of justice and fairness. Glory be to God! Until now His Majesty the King hath not become aware of the good intent of this Wronged One, though the people of God are well aware of it. This Wronged One hath, in most of His Tablets, made mention of His Majesty and hath beseeched from God–glorified be His mention–justice for him and sought fairness on his behalf. We beseech the Most High at this moment to illumine him with the light of justice which shall endure as long as the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Wondrous, shall endure. It is hoped that His Majesty the sovereign will consider the Covenant of this Wronged One as binding. That which hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen cannot be effaced, nor will it be altered by the passage of time. The Book itself beareth witness to this in this glorious and resplendent station. O son of Abhar! We beseech God in these days to sanctify and purify the gatherings of His loved ones from the hypocrites, and to illumine and adorn them with the light of power and certitude, that perchance the world may be illumined by this brilliant and radiant light. This is the Day of steadfastness and the Day of utterance. The pearls of wisdom and utterance and the gems of knowledge and understanding have appeared and continue to appear from the mine of man. Blessed is he who hath forsaken all else, holding fast unto My Strong Cord. With thy Lord is the knowledge of all things in a Clear Book.</p>
<p>O son of Abhar! The ocean of divine utterance is seen to be surging, and the effulgences of the Sun of Truth are so radiantly manifest that the eyes of those near unto God fall short of beholding them. Beseech the True One that He may cause the people of Baha to appear in such wise that none shall find occasion for turning away or objecting. That which is the cause of supreme joy in the Most Holy and Most Glorious Court is that in these days, when various factions in Iran have each clung to that which is contrary to the government, the people of Baha, through God’s grace, have held fast to the cord of patience and clung to the hem of resignation. No act that would cause mischief or give rise to discord hath appeared from them, despite the fire of oppression that was kindled in the land of Ya and the smoke that encompassed the land of Ta. Would that the government were aware of the intention and commandments that have been sent forth to all regions from the heaven of the will of the Most Exalted Pen. The people of Iran had no educator and reached maturity without training. Therefore their badge and garment have been and continue to be ignorance and discourtesy. Say: O people! The first ornament for the temple of man is courtesy. Hold fast unto it and be not of the heedless ones. In the Tablet of the World, the degrees and stations of courtesy have been revealed and sent down from the heaven of knowledge. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto. Verily it is among the pearls of the shells of this mighty ocean. Well is it with him who hath witnessed, seen and acted according to that which was commanded in the Tablets of God, the Lord of the worlds. Should anyone ask thee about the Glory, say: He is under the claws of hatred; and should anyone ask thee about the Ark of God, say: It is amidst the waves. By God’s life! We behold the lamp amid the winds. Despite the afflictions that have befallen Us and the calamities that have descended and encompassed Us, the tongue of grandeur in the prison speaketh forth with manifest verses, and the Most Exalted Pen moveth in remembrance of the loved ones. The loved ones and leaves in that land have been and are remembered in the court of the Wronged One. In accordance with the requirements of wisdom, We have concealed their names. Say: This is the day of steadfastness, this is the day of triumph, and this is the day for the appearance of the gems of human meaning from the mine of man. We beseech and implore God that He may protect the Hands of His Cause and make them manifest with that which beseemeth His days and adorn them therewith. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. In truth I say: whosoever appeareth today with the light of supreme steadfastness is recorded and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book as being of the company of the exalted ones.</p>
<p>As to those in the land of whom thou didst make mention, We have heard and hearkened. The friends in that land occupy the first rank in the Divine Book. We fervently hope that in that exalted land vain imaginings will not spread and that all may be illumined and attain unto true divine unity. We are with Our loved ones, We hear and see, and verily We are the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. All the friends of that land have been and are remembered in the Most Holy Court. Adorn thou kindred T and A with the essence of divine glorification and say: Verily, We are with thee in all conditions. The fruits of the tree of man are trust in God and steadfastness. Hold fast unto these through a command from God, the Ordainer, the All-Wise. Each one of the friends must be as firm and steadfast as a mountain and must regard the opposers and deniers as non-existent. If someone attains unto the station of hearkening to the Most Exalted Word, they should convey it. If it is accepted, the purpose is achieved; if not, contention is vain. We beseech God to aid the people of Baha in that which conduces to unity, concord, love and fellowship. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. In these days, due to the absence of hearing faculties, silence is preferable until such time as God creates another people - a promise from Him. He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Ere long shall the pavilion of divine glory encompass the world. O people of God! These sublime words and resplendent verses were previously revealed specifically for one of the friends. It is beloved that the people of Baha should recite them in a state of detachment and devotion, that they may attain unto that which diffuses the fragrance of acceptance. Command and judgment are in the grasp of God’s will, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>He is the One Who speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance</p>
<p>The essence of praise and glorification and the reality of thanksgiving and laudation befit the Most Holy and Exalted Court of Him Who is the Possessor of all existence and the Sovereign of the unseen and the seen, Who hath caused innumerable books to bow down before the ranks of letters, and through the hosts of words hath raised the banners of verses in the precincts of hearts and minds, and hath manifested the ocean of knowledge before the faces of all religions through the waves of wisdom and utterance. Through one point from the brocade of the Book of Grace He shed light upon the world; the trees and fruits spoke with most eloquent utterance the blessed word “The All-Merciful hath come.” Through one drop from the ocean of His mercy bestowed upon the lands of existence, the fruits of knowledge and wisdom and the mysteries of truth and recognition became manifest and evident. His is the grace and power, His the grandeur and authority. The might of the world could not weaken His strength, and the power of nations could not prevent His authority. In all conditions He spoke “The Kingdom is God’s, the Most High.” The cawing of the crows and the clamor of the transgressors could not prevent His will, nor impede the influence of His purpose. Despite the rancor of the divines and the might of rulers, the Supreme Pen moved in the nights and days, speaking these sublime words in most eloquent language:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou hast lit the lamp of Thy Cause with the oil of wisdom; protect it from contrary winds. The lamp is Thine, the glass is Thine, all things in heaven and earth are in the grasp of Thy power. Grant justice to rulers and fairness to divines. Thou art the One Who, through the movement of the Pen, hath aided Thy conclusive Cause and guided Thy loved ones. Thou art the Possessor of power and the King of might. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O Son of Abhar! Upon thee be My glory! Convey to his honour ’A.T. a most holy greeting from the Wronged One, sanctified from the defilements of the world. We have once again made mention of him, that he may detach himself from all else save God and hold fast to the cord of the Most Great Steadfastness, and cling to that which God hath ordained. O ’Attar! Upon thee be My glory! Convey greetings and salutations to all the members of that household. All are illumined by the fragrances of divine revelation and the sweet-scented breezes of inspiration. Of the Tablets thou didst request, some have been sent, and others will be forwarded later. In these days, the matter of mention and writing hath reached such a pass that time hath become like the philosopher’s stone for the scribes present. The remembered and the non-existent are alike. Make mention of the other friends who are scattered abroad. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Ever-Flowing, the Mighty, the All-Giving. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness and the light radiating from the direction of My grace be upon thee and upon those whom doubt hath not prevented from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. [At the end of the Blessed Tablet is written: “These pages were sent down as revealed by command. Send back their copy, O Ziya.”]</p>

<p>O Mulla Ramadan, upon him be the Glory of God! In My Name, He Who is established upon the Throne of Manifestation! The Call of God hath been raised, yet most of the people hear not. The Most Exalted Pen hath moved, yet most of the people understand not. The horizon of the All-Merciful hath been illumined, yet the people see not. Vain imaginings have held them back, and they perceive not. Blessed is the one who, with strength, hath rent asunder the veils in the name of his Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. And blessed is the one who hath arisen to serve the Cause of God, the Lord of what hath been and what shall be. How many a servant hath been prevented by idle fancies from God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling, and how many a servant hath cast away the world, turning unto the horizon of Manifestation, bearing witness to that whereunto God, the Sovereign over the seen and unseen, hath testified. We have indeed revealed the clear proofs and informed the people of what hath appeared and what shall appear hereafter. To this beareth witness this sealed Book which calleth out amongst mankind and uttereth in every state that there is none other God but Him, the One Who, through His word “Be”, and it is, hath power over whatsoever He willeth. When thou hast attained unto My verses and been seized by the wine of the choice nectar of My utterance, say: My God, my God! Thy call hath drawn me near, and Thy nearness is my hope and desire, and Thy separation hath consumed me, and Thy remoteness hath destroyed me. I beseech Thee by the mysteries of Thy Kingdom and the signs of Thy Dominion, and by the Point through which Thy Books and Thy Scriptures were differentiated, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause, speaking forth Thy praise, and holding fast to Thy Covenant and Testament. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling.</p>

<p>The Most Great, the Most Glorious! The heaven hath been raised up by this Name, whereby the hearts of the wicked were agitated when the Caller called out. A herald cried: “Hath the Desired One come?” It was said: “Yea, by the Beauty of the Worshipped One, with proof and evidence!” Say: “Today your idle fancies will profit you not. The Hidden One hath appeared through His Name, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed are they who possess insight!” They who hesitated - these are the companions of error, by thy Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Say: “Beware lest ye hesitate in a Cause unto which the hearts of them who are endued with understanding have hastened. This is He through Whom eyes were cheered and the horizons were illumined. Were it not for Him, the Ancient Beauty would not have appeared and the Tablets would not have been sent down.” Say: “The Bayan is but a leaf from among the leaves of this Divine Tree. Thus hath the All-Merciful testified in the Book.” It behooveth everyone, when hearing the Call, to say: “Yea, O Thou in Whose hand is the Kingdom of the dominion of earth and heaven!” We have manifested the Cause in such wise that it hath encompassed all who are on earth. To this beareth witness he who possesseth knowledge of both the hidden and the manifest. Blessed art thou, O thou who art mentioned before the Throne, for having turned unto God, the Mighty, the Bestower, and having turned away from them that disbelieved. By My life! Thou art of them that have attained unto the presence of God in the final return. Rejoice thou in God’s remembrance of thee and glorify Him with praise at morn and eventide. We are in the hands of the enemies. None knoweth what hath befallen Us from both factions save thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. The door hath been opened and what was to come forth hath come forth. Understand thou the tone of these words. This is what ye were promised in the Tablets.</p>

<p>O Jinab-i-Buzurg, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the All-Knowing Speaker. We have sent the Messengers and revealed the Books to give the glad tidings to mankind of this Day, which was mentioned in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds. But when the appointed time came and the dawn of the Day appeared, all who were on earth turned away from it except those whom God, the King, the Mighty, the Wise, willed. Among the people were those who turned away from the Countenance, and among them were those who pronounced judgment against the Wronged One with manifest injustice. We have borne for the sake of God that which no one before Us hath borne - to this every fair-minded and perceiving one doth testify. Thou art he who hath followed thy Lord and borne tribulations in this straight Path. Beware lest the might of men prevent thee from Him Who holdeth all power. Thus doth the Prisoner command thee from the direction of His Most Great Scene, that thou mayest rejoice and be among the thankful ones. By the life of God! All the treasures of earth cannot equal a particle of tribulation in the path of God, the Lord of Names - to this thy Lord, the All-Informed, doth testify. Say: O my God and the God of the world, my Lord and the Lord of the nations! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name, at Whose appearance all who are in the heavens and earth were thunderstruck, and all in the kingdoms of Command and creation were shaken, to strengthen me in steadfastness in Thy Cause, through which the feet of most of Thy servants have slipped. O Lord! Thou art the Generous One and I am the supplicant at the door of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee to ordain for me the reward of meeting Thee, whereof Thou didst give glad tidings through the tongues of Thy chosen ones in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy! From the horizon of tribulation hath dawned the Sun, upon which hath been inscribed by the Most Glorious Pen: “The Prison belongeth unto God, the One, the Peerless, the Mighty, the Unconstrained.” The moon of idle fancy hath been eclipsed, when the Self-Subsisting appeared with the standards of His signs. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou hast cast away idle desire and taken that which was commanded thee from the presence of God, the Cleaver of Dawn. This is not the day to tarry. Be thou as a bird soaring in the atmosphere of detachment in the name of thy Lord, the Originator of all creation. Thus doth the Pen of Command enjoin thee from the presence of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Should anyone inhale its fragrance, he would perceive from this Shirt the sweet savors of holiness through which the breaths of the All-Merciful have wafted throughout all contingent being. Grieve not today at what thou seest, the people turning away from God. Soon shall the standards of victory be raised upon the highest pinnacles. Thy Lord, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. These are verses by which the hearts of them that are endowed with understanding are attracted. By My life! Were their fragrances to pass over the hardest rock, it would cry out at the highest pitch between earth and heaven: “Glory be to God, the Mighty, the Compelling!” O Servant! Hearken unto the Call from the Sacred Shore in the Crimson Spot, from the Supreme Pen: There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Thy letter hath come before the Throne, and God’s gaze hath turned toward it, as a favor unto thee and unto His righteous servants. Thou hast attained all good through having turned to the Intended One on this Day whereon the Dove hath warbled and eyes have been gladdened. Preserve thou the Tablet, then read it in a spirit of fragrant joy. And the splendor be upon thee from thy Lord, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p>All things have been thunderstruck by the Call of God save those whom the hand of grace hath seized. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. To this all things bear witness, but the people understand not. The world hath been adorned with the ornament of justice, yet the people perceive it not. Every thing hath testified to that which God hath testified - that there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed is the face that hath turned unto the Face of God, and blessed are the hands that have been raised to the heaven of His grace, and blessed is the eye that hath been honored to behold His glorious and beloved countenance. O thou who gazeth upon the Face, give thanks unto God for having enabled thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of His Revelation and for having caused to shine upon thee such lights of the Manifestation as have bewildered the hearts of those who have inhaled the fragrances of revelation - verily they are honored servants. We testify that thou hast turned toward Him and drawn nigh unto Him and hast heard the call of the Wronged One in this forbidden prison. Thou wert in the presence of the Throne for successive days. Return now to thy place by the command of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. If thou findest in anyone the fragrance of the love of God and His chosen ones, convey to him My greetings. Say: O My loved ones! Let not the deeds of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of existence, cause you grief. Hold fast to the cord of steadfastness. By My life!

<p>O Haj Nabil Qabl-Husayn! In the name of Him Who dominates over what was and what shall be! We have adorned creation with the mention of Our Name, Whom We sent aforetime to give glad tidings to the people of this hidden Mystery. Indeed He warbled upon the branches with diverse melodies, with this mighty, forbidden Remembrance, and gave glad tidings to the servants of the Most Great Name, and called out to all from the Mount of the Bayan: “Verily there is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting!” The Bayan and all within it was made dependent upon My acceptance, and all was made but a leaf among the leaves of My Ridvan. Yet when We unveiled Beauty from the Dawning-Place of Glory, heedless souls objected to Us. Say: O people! By God, were it not for Him, the Bayan would not have appeared and the verses of God, the Mighty, the Loving, would not have been revealed. Through My Name was the Bayan adorned and the beauty of the All-Merciful appeared in creation, if ye would understand. Thus have We caused thee to hear the cooing of the Dove of Justice and the rushing of the winds of grace, that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and arise to serve thy Lord in such wise that none in existence shall deter thee. Stand firm then in the Cause and guide the people through this Most Great Name. Thus doth command thee He Who dominateth the seen and the unseen. Grieve not at anything, for thy Lord is with thee and heareth what proceedeth from thy lips in His remembrance and praise. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Purify the breasts through My Name that dominateth all names, and illumine the hearts through this ordained Remembrance.

We observed thy devotion and turned unto thee, and heard thy call and revealed for thee that which cannot be equaled by what is in the world nor by the remembrances of the nations. He in Whose possession is a mighty Book beareth witness to this. We beseech God to forgive thee and thy father and thine uncle as a grace from His presence. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. The ocean of forgiveness hath surged in the days of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of My utterance and hearest My call, turn thy face toward the House and say: “My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me when I was heedless, and remembered me when I was silent, and awakened me [when I was] sleeping, and taught me when I was ignorant. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen, by Thy Name through which Thou didst manifest that which was hidden in Thy knowledge and treasured in the repositories of Thy wisdom, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love in such wise that the cawing of the cawers and the clamor of the transgressors shall not deter me. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.”</p>

<p>That which hath caused all the Books of the world to bow down hath been revealed, and that which was hidden in the knowledge of God, the Lord of all worlds, hath appeared. This is a Day wherein God hath manifested Himself unto the people of Baha even as He manifested Himself on Sinai unto Moses, son of ’Imran. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe betide the heedless! Is there any possessor of hearing who heareth My call, and is there any possessor of sight who beholdeth My horizon, and is there any possessor of hands who taketh hold of the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Wise? Heedlessness hath encompassed those on earth by reason of that which their hands have wrought without leave from God, the Ancient Commander.</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned thy face toward the Countenance! We have turned toward thee from the precincts of the Prison and have sent down for thee that which causeth the hearts of them that are nigh to soar and the realities of the sincere to be drawn forth. When thou hast known and heard, turn toward the Kaaba of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, and say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Unto Thee be praise for having enabled me to turn toward Thee, and unto Thee be glory for having acquainted me with Thy announcement, and unto Thee be thanksgiving for having caused me to hear Thy most sweet call and the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen. I testify in this my station, by Thy bounty, O God of Names, and by Thy generosity, O Sovereign of kings and princes: O Lord! Thou beholdest me between the hands of the heedless among Thy servants and the oppressors among Thy creatures. I beseech Thee by the mysteries concealed within Thy knowledge and treasured within Thy Book to aid me in Thy remembrance and praise and in arising to serve Thee.

All creation hath been shaken when the Hour came, and the decree hath been fulfilled from before God, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. We behold the sincere ones in the Most Glorious Paradise, and the idolaters in the lowest depths. Verily thy Lord ordaineth as He pleaseth. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. The world hath been illumined with the lights of the Ancient of Days, and all things cry out: Hasten, O ye concourse of the seen and the unseen! This is a Day that shall not be followed by night, this is a Light that shall not be succeeded by darkness, this is a Certainty that shall not be assailed by doubt. Blessed the one who hath attained through his turning, and blessed the wealthy one whom riches have not withheld from God, the Lord of all that was and shall be. He who hath attained on this Day is, before God, his Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, among the companions of the Crimson Ark, and he who hath been prevented is among the most remote of creatures in a hidden Tablet. We have found thee turning unto Him Who is the Object of all existence, and have revealed for thee this Tablet and sent it unto thee that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Hold thou fast unto the cord of steadfastness and cleave unto this outstretched Path. Beware lest the might of the wicked frighten thee or the hints of every rejected ascetic disturb thee. Soar in the atmosphere of detachment by thy Lord’s leave, the Lord of Names. This is what shall profit thee in this world and the next.

The heaven hath spoken: “The Lord of Names hath come!” The Dove hath warbled: “The Lord hath appeared with His Most Glorious Name!” And the pebble hath cried out: “The Kingdom belongeth to the Lord of Attributes!” All things have voiced the remembrance and praise of God, yet most people remain in doubt and discord. The Most Great Ocean hath surged and spoken in the name of the Ancient Lord, yet most nations are as the dead. We call them to the Kawthar of life, but they have turned away from it, having followed vain imaginings. Blessed is the soul that hath been kindled with the fire of God and hath not been hindered by the veils of the people of hypocrisy. Such souls are of those whose names have been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen and whose mention hath been recorded in the tablets of their Lord, the Master of the Day of Judgment. Thou hast adorned thy tongue with My remembrance, thine eyes with beholding My verses, thy heart with turning toward My direction, and thine ears toward the Dawning-Place of utterance. Thus have We adorned thee with the ornament of remembrance and distinguished thee in this Day wherein eyes are solaced. Read thou the verses of thy Lord and turn not unto those who follow their desires and deny God, the Lord of Lords. Soon shall We seize them as We seized those before them. Verily thy Lord is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth. Forget not My favor and consort not with those who have turned away from the Countenance when it shone forth from the horizon of glory.

Remember when We sent Our messengers - the people opposed them and clung to what they possessed of idle fancies and images. Say: This is a Day the like of which the eye of creation hath not seen. Abandon what ye possess and turn unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Beware lest vain imaginings prevent you from the Lord of all beings.

Hasten, and be not of them that tarry. This is the Day which ye were promised aforetime by God, the True, the Faithful. Cast aside what is with the people, for the Self-Subsisting hath come unto you and summoneth you unto this Wine which calleth out, saying: “O friends of God and His party! Turn ye unto that which hath appeared in truth, and be not of the heedless.” When thou hast drunk from the hand of My favor the cup of My loving-kindness, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou beholdest me speaking forth Thy praise, seeking refuge in Thy presence, and hastening to the door of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee to ordain for me from Thy Pen that which will preserve me from all else save Thee and draw me nigh unto Thee. O my Lord! My tongue, both outward and inward, beareth witness to Thy oneness and singleness, Thy power, Thy grandeur, and Thy sovereignty. I ask of Thee that which befitteth the heaven of Thy generosity, the ocean of Thy bestowal, and the sun of Thy grace. Wilt Thou, O my God, deny this seeker who hath sought the ultimate goal beneath the pavilions of Thy greatness, and disappoint him after he hath acknowledged Thy grace which hath encompassed all things? Nay, by Thy glory! I bear witness in this moment that Thou hast never disappointed those who have hoped in Thee, nor turned away those who have sought Thee. Thou hast taken their hands with the hands of Thy power, delivered them from the pit of vain imaginings through Thy will and purpose, and given them what they desired from the heaven of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the Almighty Whom the affairs of Thy creation have never frustrated. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Single, the One, the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.</p>

The Book of God standeth before the faces of all who speak, and in every moment proof and evidence are manifest. A herald calleth out from the direction of the Throne and summoneth all who are on earth to the most exalted horizon. Blessed is the soul whom neither the chains of men nor the clamor of the wayward have kept back from the Self-Sufficing, the Most High. O people of God! Count ye as precious this time and strive that ye may gain a portion from the effulgent lights of this Revelation and attain unto the recognition of God, exalted be His glory. In this day the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise are all engaged in praise and thanksgiving to God, inasmuch as the lights of His Revelation have encompassed all things. Were but a single melody from the melodies of the people of Paradise to reach the ears of the servants in these days, all would find themselves wholly detached from all else save God and would set their faces toward the most sublime summit and most exalted horizon. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath heard the Call and answered his Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of bounty and bestowal, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Sovereign of earth and heaven! I beseech Thee by the penetrating power of Thy Will and the potency of Thy Purpose and the scratching of Thy Pen to ordain for this servant of Thine that which will draw him nigh unto Thee and profit him in every world of Thy worlds. Thou art, verily, the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>O Haji [Mulla] Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God! The Book of God at all times summoneth the peoples of the earth unto the Most Exalted Horizon with the loudest call. Today His mercy hath encompassed all, and the Sun of His grace shineth resplendent from the horizon of the heaven of His Will, and the light of His justice is radiant. Yet the heedless servants remain deniers and turn away. Glory be to God! They behold the signs yet deny them, they hear the call yet turn aside from it. In this day the Mount Sinai crieth out “The Manifestation hath come!” and the Divine Lote-Tree giveth to all the glad-tidings of That which hath appeared. Yet the people remain heedless and veiled. At this hour thy name was mentioned before the Wronged One, wherefore this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of favor and dispatched unto thee, that thou mayest drink therefrom of My sealed wine.</p>
<p>Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for that which hath flowed from Thy Most Exalted Pen in remembrance of me, whereby my name shall endure through the eternity of Thy Most Beautiful Names. O Lord! Withhold me not from the ocean of Thy bounty, nor from the heaven of Thy grace, and ordain for me all the good Thou hast sent down in Thy Book. Verily Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. O Lord! Thou seest the poor one seeking the heaven of Thy bestowals and the weary one yearning for the ocean of Thy utterance. I beseech Thee by Thy power and Thy sovereignty and Thy majesty and Thy might, that Thou wilt not disappoint me of that which I desire from the heaven of Thy bounty and the Sun of Thy generosity.

Thy letter hath come before Us, and We have taken it and read it, and have answered thee with this decisive Book that thou mayest thank thy Lord and arise to make mention of Him amongst His servants. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Protector over what was and what shall be. As to what thou hast asked concerning the honored stone - whether it be copper or lead or something else - know thou that it hath been called by all names, but most people understand not. The people’s intention regarding copper was not the copper of the common folk, nor their lead, nor their gold. Thy Lord is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have sent down concerning this knowledge diverse epistles in an eloquent Arabic tongue and a lucid Persian language, and We have sent thee that which will make thee independent of every possessor of knowledge and wisdom. Read it and ponder upon it, that thou mayest find the knowledge of thy Lord encompassing those who are in the heavens and on earth. We do not desire that any of the loved ones occupy themselves with it. Rather, it behooveth thee and those who have believed to make your chief concern in these days the remembrance of God and the promotion of His decisive and wise Cause. His love is verily the supreme elixir and the most glorious crown, whereby the base metals of hearts are transformed into pure gold. Thus have We explained for thee what thou didst seek from the bounty of thy Lord. He, verily, is the Bestower, the Expositor, the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing.</p>

Every confessor denied, every manifest one became hidden, every dweller fled, and every tranquil one was seized with fear from dread of those days. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. He whom the heedless had taken as lord besides God would flee from land to land and from place to place. Then when the Cause was made manifest he came forth and pronounced judgment against Him through Whom the Trump was sounded, the Standard of the Manifestation was raised, and the Straight Path of God appeared. By God! He could not speak in the presence of the Face and was as one of those who circled round the Throne, yet Satan led him astray and made him to be among the perishing ones. Thus do We recount unto thee that thou mayest be possessed of insight from God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Blessed art thou for having held fast unto that which is right in this mighty Cause. Aid thy Lord through wisdom, make mention of My loved ones on My behalf, and give them the glad-tidings of My grace, My care, and My gracious remembrance.

<p>The Supreme City to him who hath been named after the Desired One. He is the One Who hath dawned from the horizon of the world. This is a Book sent down in truth from God, the Lord of the worlds. Verily it acquainteth the people with the Dawning-Place of divine inspiration and guideth them to My straight path. Say: By God! The promise hath come to pass, and He Who was promised hath appeared, yet most of the people remain heedless. The world hath been adorned with the lights of the Most Great Name, yet most of the nations wander distracted. The wine of vain desires hath so seized them that they have been kept back from the Lord of all beings, Who speaketh the truth: “There is none other God but Me, the Forgiving, the Generous.” Blessed is he who hath heard the call of God and responded to his Lord, the Manifest, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. We have heard thy call and have called out to thee from the direction of the luminous Spot, and We have seen thy turning toward Us on this Day whereon the Lord of destiny proclaimeth from the Most Great Scene: “There is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” Say: By God! The Mother Book speaketh the truth, were ye of them that hear. Say: He hath appeared with that Justice wherewith mankind hath been adorned, and yet the people are, for the most part, asleep. Cast away what ye possess, in the name of your Lord, the Lord of all mankind, and take hold of that which ye have been commanded by One Who is knowing and wise. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken, while imprisoned in this mighty place. The glory of God rest upon thee and upon whoso hath heard My call and turned unto My horizon and circled round My will and acted according to that which hath been sent down in My Book that beareth witness in My Kingdom that there is none other God but Me, the Manifest, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>Your letter hath reached the Most Great Prison, and that which was mentioned therein hath been heard. May you ever drink from the Kawthar of the eternal Beloved’s loving-kindness, and abide beneath the shade of the Tree of grace. There hath appeared on earth that which was hidden from time immemorial and will remain concealed forevermore. Blessed are they that have attained thereunto and have received their portion from the divine ocean of revelation. All peoples rejoiced at the mention of this most holy, most exalted Day, yet when the Sun of loving-kindness shone forth from the horizon of grace and the world was illumined by the lights of His manifestation, all turned away save those souls who, with the arm of certitude, shattered the idols of idle fancies and were enabled to hearken unto the call of God, exalted be His glory. Whosoever hath this day attained unto the Goal - that is, hath recognized Him - is mentioned in the Perspicuous Book as being among those near unto God. Should you spend your entire life extolling God, it would still be as naught compared to this supreme bounty. Give thanks unto God thy Lord, for He hath remembered thee in the Most Great Prison through this luminous Tablet. Say: O my God! I beseech Thee by the Manifestation of Thyself and the Dayspring of Thy Cause to aid me to love Thee and to win Thy good-pleasure, and to stand firm in Thy Cause. I moreover beseech Thee, O my God, to ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit me in the world to come and in this world. There is none other God but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>Multiple books from you were presented at the Most Holy Court and attained the lights of His presence. Praise be to God that you have attained the enduring heavenly bounty which is the recognition of the King of Oneness. In truth, this is the fruit of the tree of existence. God willing, may all the trees of human temples attain and be adorned with this true fruit. However, today you must fix your gaze upon the Manifestation and what proceeds from Him, detached and freed from aught else. What you have expressed regarding the correspondence of numbers, letters and words was noted, but it would have been better if the time you spent on these matters had been spent on teaching the Cause of God with wisdom and utterance. At all times, beseech the Beloved of the worlds to assist you in serving His Cause. There has been and is no grace greater than this. Whosoever today quickens the dead of contingent being with the outpourings of the ocean of divine knowledge is accounted before God among those who draw nigh and his name is inscribed in the Preserved Tablet. Blessed is he who attains to this exalted station. God willing, you will present proofs for the servants through the divine verses and heavenly manifestations that have shone forth from the Dawning-Place of Revelation. Verily, He is with whosoever speaks in His Name and makes mention of Him among His creation. He is, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

The Most High and All-Sufficient Lord has ever gazed with the glance of loving-kindness and bounty upon men and been turned towards them. O ’Abdu’l-Husayn, upon thee be My glory! One of the Branches who is named Badi’ brought thy letter into the presence, and after it was presented at the Most Holy Court, this Tablet was revealed from the sacred heaven and sent forth, that thou mayest find from it the fragrance of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee, for thou hast attained unto the Most Great Word in thy love for the Lord of all humanity. Thy letter was adorned with these words: “If you wish to know the state of this servant, praise and thanks be to God that I am intoxicated with the mention of the Peerless One of the world, Who in these days of His presence and manifestation has enabled me to offer praise and achieve true knowledge of Him.” Praise be to God Who enabled thee to turn to Him in His days and caused to proceed from thee a word whose fragrance shall endure throughout the continuance of His names and attributes. Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for causing me to hear Thy call and guiding me to Thy supreme horizon, when most of Thy servants and creatures were debarred therefrom. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the effulgences of the Orb of Thy grace to make me in all conditions one who quaffs the wine of Thy Revelation, gazes toward Thy horizon, soars in the atmosphere of Thy love, and holds fast to Thy firm cord. O Lord! Aid me to serve Thy Cause and Thy loved ones, and ordain for me every good thing Thou hast sent down in Thy Book. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous.

The Tongue of Grandeur has in all times summoned the servants to the living waters and continues to do so. The Book calls out with the most exalted cry between earth and heaven, giving glad tidings to all and summoning them to the Hidden Name and the Treasured Secret. Blessed is the soul that has attained to this most great bounty and this most hidden mystery. Today another world has appeared and another carpet has been spread, yet the people of doubt and fancy remain occupied with their previous imaginings. Say: O God, my Worshipped One, my Adored One! Through a single word of Thy sublime words Thou didst create earth and heaven, and through one drop from the ocean of Thy generosity Thou didst bring existence into being. Thou art the One with such power that the might and strength of the tyrants of the earth and pharaohs of the lands could not prevent Thee from Thy purpose. O Generous One! A poor one has turned to Thy gate and a helpless one has clung to the cord of Thy power. He begs of Thee Thy ancient grace and beseeches Thy fresh forgiveness. Deprive him not from the ocean of Thy bounty and withhold him not from the living waters of eternal life. Thou art powerful and mighty. O Lord! The atoms of the world bear witness to Thy wealth and acknowledge and confess Thy grace. Would One like Thee, so rich, deprive one like me, so poor? Far be it! Never!

Praise be to the Beloved of the worlds Who, through His all-encompassing mercy and His pre-existent grace, caused thee to attain unto the original homeland which is the recognition of His Own transcendent Being. Thou art indeed among those who have attained unto Him and His presence, and heard His call, and stood before the Throne after most of the servants were debarred therefrom. This is of His bounty which no created thing in the universe can equal. Then remember when We caused thee to appear before Us yet again - this is another bounty. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of all who are in the earth and heavens! Grieve not over anything. Be as a bird soaring in the atmosphere of longing and yearning.

The pens of the oppressors - that is, the ignorant ones of the earth - did not prevent His Pen of justice, and the veils of creation did not conceal the radiance of His Word. With the most exalted call He proclaimed in the realm of creation and summoned the people to the supreme horizon. Clamor arose from all directions; from every side they assailed the Wronged One. Glory be to God! From the signs and clear proofs to which all the peoples of the world have clung and still cling, nothing has appeared save denial and turning away.

<p>It is known that the travelers unto God, after traversing the stages of all else besides Him, descended at the known place famous as Istanbul. Until now, nothing has been observed from its people except the customary formal courtesies, until what may appear later and what may be decreed from behind the veil of destiny. However, many withered trees and lifeless snows were observed. It seems this city was built of snow, and at every moment the warmth decreases and the cold increases. We had heard of the fire salamander, whose appearance was caused by fire, from the All-Wise, the All-Informed. However, a snow salamander had not been observed, but now many snow creatures are seen among the wondrous handiworks of the Creator. Let us see what the divine white hand of power and the radiance of the heavenly arm will manifest later. All are within His grasp and suspended by His will. There is no God but Him, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. Furthermore, until now no matter has appeared, meaning no word has been spoken, and after the discussion details will be sent. Let all remain at ease in their place until its time, which is in the hand of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. We remember all the loved ones and counsel them all not to become heedless of any remembrance of the remembrance of God, and not remain veiled from His love by love of aught else.

<p>In the name of the one incomparable, all-knowing Lord!</p>
<p>Your letter arrived and We heard your call, and in the Most Great Prison We besought from the Ancient King whatsoever would be beneficial for you. Man himself is not aware of what brings him profit or harm - knowledge of the unseen belongs exclusively to His exalted Essence. Often it happens that man desires something which appears good to him and requests it from God, glorified be His majesty, but afterwards the utmost harm results from it. Therefore the Supreme Pen has taught the station of trust and resignation. It is evident and manifest to every person of insight and understanding that whatsoever appears from God, glorified be His majesty, has proceeded and continues to proceed from the exigencies of His consummate wisdom. If someone resigns himself and places his trust in God, assuredly that which is best for him will be made manifest. One must hold fast to the means while placing one’s trust in God and engaging in action. Say: O my God, my God! I have turned toward Thee and directed myself to the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy bestowals and the dayspring of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Pen to ordain for me the good of this world and the next. O my Lord! I am he who has placed his trust in Thee and resigned his affairs unto Thee. I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which will profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Then cause me, O my God, to be steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that the ranks of the world and the clamor of the nations will not prevent me. Verily Thou art powerful to do what Thou willest.

<p>O Mulla Sadiq! The Most Ancient, the Most Great, the Most Glorious! How blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of the All-Merciful as it wafted through all creation, and how fortunate is he who hath drunk of this Kawthar which hath flowed from the Finger of Grace in the days of God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! Say: What aileth you, O people, that ye have turned to vain imaginings and turned away from Him Who hath come in the shadows of the clouds with manifest sovereignty? He is indeed the Beloved One Who was promised to you in the Tablets, were ye of them that know. He is indeed the One mentioned from all eternity, and by His remembrance hath every perspicuous Book been adorned. Ponder, O people, upon the verses of God and His proof, that ye may recognize that wherewith ye were promised by One mighty and knowing. We summon you unto God and seek from you no recompense - the Pen of Revelation beareth witness to this, were ye of them that hear. Occupy not yourselves with that which ye have been forbidden; rather, do that which ye have been commanded in the Book - this is better for you, were ye of them that know. Blessed is he who hath detached himself from all else and turned unto his Lord, after all the heedless and remote ones turned away from Him. Aid ye the All-Merciful through remembrance and utterance, that perchance they that slumber may awaken and turn unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Thus hath the Pen spoken, and the Ancient of Days hath borne witness thereunto, when He was imprisoned in the Most Great Prison by reason of what the hands of the oppressors had wrought. If thou hast found the sweetness of the remembrance that hath been raised from the Lote-Tree of Utterance, say: Praise be unto Thee, O my Lord, the All-Merciful, for having turned toward me the wonders of Thy favors and made me to be of them that have attained.</p>

<p>In the Name of the one true God! Those souls who in this Day have quaffed the sealed wine from the hand of the Self-Subsisting Sovereign must fix their gaze upon wisdom and hold fast to the cord of unity, for these two are the cause and means for the exaltation of the Cause of God. Likewise must they adorn themselves with the ornament of steadfastness, and this station is most great: after recognition of the Self of God, glorified be His majesty, steadfastness is the greatest and most mighty of all things. Blessed is he who attaineth unto it, and woe betide the doubters. Many souls are observed to be like particles of air, agitated and set in motion by the slightest breeze. God willing, ye must occupy yourselves with service to the Cause and remind the people of the exalted stations of steadfastness, that they may attain to such a station that neither the learned nor the ignorant of the world can cast doubt upon those souls. This truly is a noble station. Know ye the value of this station and strive that some service in the path of God may be manifested from you. This truly is the great attainment. We make mention of thee in the Most Great Prison that thou mayest rejoice thereby and give thanks to thy Ancient Lord. Be thou assured of God’s grace and mercy. He maketh mention of whomsoever He willeth and ordaineth for him what He desireth. Thy Lord is verily the Almighty, the Powerful. Then make mention of thy brother who is named Ahmad and give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance of him in this noble station.

The Wronged One has heard thy cry and has answered thee from the prison with this Perspicuous Tablet, whereby the realities of existence were attracted and the limbs of them that denied the Day of Judgment did quake. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of My mention and hear My call, say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! All praise be unto Thee for having remembered me from Thy most exalted horizon and for having sent down unto me that which drew unto it the Concourse on High. I beseech Thee, O Lord of all beings and King of the throne on high and of earth below, by Thy Command through which the Pen was set in motion in the world, and by Thy Name whereby Thou didst subdue the nations, to assist me to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee. O my Lord! Thou seest me clinging fast unto Thee and unto Thy verses. Ordain for me a seat of truth in Thy presence. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Blessed is the servant who has chosen for himself a station beneath the canopies of Thy grandeur and has attained unto the wine of certitude from the cup of Thy bounty.

Thus have We been afflicted time and again by those who disbelieved, and We give thanks to God for His decrees and show forth mighty gratitude.

Make mention of thy Lord at all times with such steadfastness that the calamities and the injustice perpetrated by those who disbelieve in God, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing, will affect thee not. Thinkest thou that their glory or what they possess of earthly treasures will endure? Nay, by the beauty of the All-Sublime! All on earth will pass away except the face of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Whenever thou are overtaken by sorrows, pass by the graves and meditate upon them, that thou mayest find thyself in manifest detachment.

When death overtakes him the hand of separation severs him from that which he had avidly amassed.</p>

We have designated thee a trustee of God, have bidden thee to observe that which shall exalt the Cause of Him Who is the Lord of the worlds, and have bestowed upon thee the right to receive Huququ’llah. Consort with the people in a spirit of amity and concord, and be unto them a loyal counsellor and a loving companion. Content thyself then with that which We have ordained for thee.</p>
<p>In this Day it is incumbent upon all to evince true resignation. The Primal Point Himself hath informed every soul and summoned them to this lofty and sublime station, that all may attain unto the good pleasure of God, may forsake their own desires, of whose ultimate consequence they remain ignorant, and may fix their gaze upon the will of God. Nor is this fleeting life of such worth that it should distract any soul from the True One or deflect him from that which is pleasing unto Him.</p>
<p>Convey Our greetings to all Our loved ones and remind them of this station, which in truth is the loftiest of stations. Thus hath this Wronged One bidden thee, that thou mayest yield thanks to thy God, the Lord of utterance and bounty. My glory be upon thee and upon them that have acted as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O My loved ones! Hearken unto My call and arise to aid My Cause and exalt My Word, through which the hearts of the mystics have been set ablaze and the backs of the idolaters have been broken. Grieve not at anything. Remember your Lord, the All-Merciful, in such wise that the limbs of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds, may quake with fear. Hold fast to the cord of wisdom in all conditions. We have, indeed, enjoined this upon all in Our mighty and wondrous Book. Beware lest the affairs of the world hold you back or the clamor of the nations veil you. Draw nigh unto God, then aid His mighty and impregnable Cause. We were walking in the mansion which God hath made the Most Great Scene on this Day that was promised in the Tablets of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have turned toward thee from this Spot and revealed unto thee that which hath caused the hearts of the mystics to soar. Beware, beware lest the hosts of the world frighten thee or the whisperings of Satan hold thee back. Cling to the hem of thy Lord’s favors and say: O God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen! Thou beholdest the Best Beloved of the world among the peoples and hearest the cry of His heart and the sighing of His soul at what hath befallen Him from those who claimed to know Him and to follow His Cause. O my Lord! Thou art the All-Hearing and Thou art He from Whose knowledge nothing escapeth. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue the cities of knowledge and didst reveal the treasures of the seen and unseen, that Thou protect me and make me detached from those who have disbelieved in Thy Great Name.</p>

<p>O My loved ones in Manshad! Praise be to God that through the grace of the Lord of creation you have inhaled the fragrance from the garment of utterance and turned to the horizon of the All-Merciful. Know the value of this most great favor and be occupied with His mention and praise amidst the peoples. Divine verses have rained down like copious rain upon that land and its people, such that in every year revealed verses have been sent to that region and other regions, that all might attain to what God has willed and receive their portion from the ocean of His generosity. Consider the favor of God - though He is wronged and imprisoned in the Most Great Prison amidst the peoples, at every moment He guides all who are in the world to the most exalted horizon. And anyone who has the slightest perception will surely know that there has been no purpose except the guidance of creation and no aim except the manifestation of the Cause of Truth. God willing, you will be set ablaze with this fire which is light itself - an enkindlement that the seas of the doubts and idle fancies of the people cannot extinguish - until all the world becomes enkindled by that newly kindled warmth which is the very love of God, and turns to the horizon of manifestation. Truly I say, in this Day steadfastness is accounted as one of the most mighty affairs with God, and likewise acting according to what He has ordained in the Book. Blessed are they that have attained! Blessed are they that act! And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

The Most Exalted Pen hath testified that he attained the Kawthar of life when the horizon of utterance was illumined by the Sun of proof, and he bore witness to that which the All-Merciful had testified before the mention of contingent being, that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O thou who hast turned thy face toward Mine, who hast soared in Mine atmosphere, and who hast voiced My remembrance! I testify that thou didst attain the ornament of acceptance before thy ascension and at the time of thy ascension the Concourse on High and those who dwell in the Kingdom of Names welcomed thee, and the mercy and loving-kindness of God were with thee. Thou art he at whose calamity the near ones lamented and grief overtook those servants who circled round the Throne. The glory, and the peace, and the mercy that hath descended from the heaven of thy Lord’s loving-kindness be upon thee, O thou who didst hold fast to the cord of God and didst cling to the hem of His generosity.

<p>Joy be unto thee for having taken the chalice of certitude with the power of faith and drunk therefrom despite those among the followers of religion who denied the All-Merciful when He came with the truth through His sovereignty which encompasses all who are in the heavens and on earth. We beseech God to make thee a lamp of guidance among His creatures and to open, through the key of thy remembrance, the cities of hearts. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Be thankful that thou hast been mentioned by My Most Exalted Pen. By My life, this sufficeth thee in truth and nothing on earth can equal it. Thy Lord is verily the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing. Know then that We heard thy call before thy letter arrived and answered thee with a mighty Tablet, and after thy letter came, with this wondrous Tablet. Arise to serve the Cause by My leave and My will, then convey unto the people this Most Great News. Blessed art thou and blessed is thy letter from which wafted the fragrances of thy love for God, the Beloved of those who know.</p>

Blessed art thou and blessed is thy father, through whom the fragrance of faith was diffused among the religions. He is among those whom God hath described aforetime in His perspicuous Book, saying - and His Word is most sweet - “honored servants who speak not until He hath spoken, and who do as they are bidden.” By the life of God! Thou hast been and art before the Face. We beseech God, glorified be His majesty, to cause thee to attain unto that which draweth faces toward the Most Exalted Horizon.

We beseech Him, exalted be He, to open a door before thy face and to rain down upon thee from the heaven of His grace the showers of mercy and blessing. Verily He is the Lord of creation and the One Who […] whereby the pillars of the transgressors were shaken and the faces of those near unto God were illumined. Never hast thou been absent from Our sight, nor shalt thou ever be. We testify that there is none other God but Him, in acknowledgment of His oneness and confession of His singleness. There is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Great. We convey from this station Our greetings unto the friends of God and His loved ones there, and We beseech God to cause them to hold fast in all conditions unto His Book and to act according to that which they have been commanded.

The Ancient Tongue speaketh in Persian that all the servants who dwell in that place and its surroundings may discover the Purpose and act according to it. Today every possessor of utterance is commanded to teach, and every possessor of speech is charged with making mention of the Cause of the All-Merciful. In this Most Great, Most Exalted Cause ye must exert mighty efforts, that perchance the dead may drink from the cup of life and the heedless may receive their share from the chalice of awareness. Today most souls are observed to be like uprooted palm-trunks.

However, in all circumstances they must fix their gaze upon wisdom, lest something occur that might cause perturbation among weak souls. O cupbearers of the world! With joy and fragrance bestow upon the people of possibility the Kawthar of divine knowledge in the name of the Purpose of the worlds. This is service to the Divine Cause.

<p>O Ali! The Most Exalted Pen hath testified concerning thee to that which cannot be equaled by the treasures of the earth and its ornaments, nor by the seas and their pearls, nor by the heavens and their stars, nor by the sun and its radiance, nor by the moon and its light. Thou art he who drew nigh and attained the presence and heard and beheld that which was withheld from all who are on earth save whom thy Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, did choose. Grieve thou not over anything. God will soon manifest that which hath been ordained for thee from His Most Exalted Pen. Verily He hath made thee a helper of His Cause, one who turneth toward His countenance, who speaketh His praise, who soareth in His atmosphere, and who remaineth steadfast in His Cause - the Cause whereby the limbs of all names did quake and the hearts of the chosen ones were agitated, except for those whom the hand of His power, which dominateth all that was and shall be, did rescue. There is not a single letter but that hath appeared and shall appear - to this the Tablet of Ra’is and that which was revealed from the Pen of God in the Tablets to the princes and kings do testify. Beware lest thou be saddened by the might of those who violated God’s Covenant and His Testament, or by the clamor of those who denied the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Be thou steadfast in all conditions in serving this Most Great Cause. Verily He will assist thee and help thee and manifest that whereof He informed thee in His preserved Tablet. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon those who hearkened unto thy words concerning this irrevocable Cause. Verily we are God’s and unto Him shall we return.</p>

<p>O ’Ali Afandi, upon him be the Glory of God!</p>
<p>He is the One Who speaks in the Kingdom of Utterance! O ’Ali! The servant was present with your letter and read it in the presence of the Wronged One. The fragrance of love was inhaled from it. Blessed is he whose sighs ascend and whose tears fall in longing for the presence of the Prisoner Who has summoned all unto God, the Lord of the worlds. The mystery of the divine Books is today manifest and evident, yet the people remain veiled from it. O ’Ali! For thirteen hundred years the divines of the earth, its jurists and all people lamented in separation and sought with their souls the Day of Manifestation. Yet when He Who conversed on Sinai dawned from the horizon of revelation, and the Kingdom of Meeting was adorned, and the ocean of reunion surged, all turned away and denied and remained heedless, save a few of the letters of the face. Such is the condition of the servants. We beseech God to aid thee in that which befitteth this glorious and wondrous Day, and to make thee steadfast in this Cause, for truly mighty it is. Take the cup of recognition from the hand of the bounty of Him Who is the Goal of the worlds and drink therefrom in His blessed Name. He is the Helper and the Succourer, and He is the Witness and the Beholder. There is no God but Him, the Witness, the Perceiver, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We beseech God to send down upon thee a blessing from His presence and to make thee steadfast upon this glorious and wondrous Path. Glory be upon thee and upon thy brothers and upon whoso hath attained unto this resplendent station.</p>

Sorrows have encompassed Me from all directions through that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought - they who have cast the Book behind their backs, clinging to idle fancies and vain imaginings.

Praise be to Thee for having enabled me to attain unto the traces of Thy Most Exalted Pen and for having made mention of me through the tongue of the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Manifestation of Thy Self while He was in the hands of His enemies. I beseech Thee, O Lord of eternity and Educator of the nations, by Thy Most Great Name, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy religion, such that neither the clamor of the ignorant nor the might of those who have denied Thy proof and Thy testimony and have violated Thy Covenant and Thy Testament shall prevent me.

Your verses have been presented before Us. We found from them the fragrance of orientation and devotion. We have turned unto you and mentioned you in this wondrous Tablet. This is the Day wherein the Mother Book speaks and the Preserved Tablet utters, and that which was hidden in God’s knowledge, the Lord of the worlds, is made manifest. Say: My God, my God!

Due to your departure, the matter of the Tablets has been delayed, the departure of Mulla Muhammad-’Ali has been postponed, the blessed Cause is in suspension, and both Barkih and Barkih are in regret. Indeed, due to your departure most matters are suspended and still, nay rather, they appear disordered. How excellent was what was said - that from its rising and setting two cities were turned upside down. Your letters from before and after arrived and the Most Great Branch sent them and they were seen.

I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by the Lamp of Thy Cause which findeth itself amidst tempestuous winds, to make me steadfast in Thy service and in Thy remembrance and praise, in such wise that neither princes nor divines may hinder me from drawing nigh unto Thee, O Lord of all men and Master of the throne above and the earth below. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have placed my trust in Thee and have committed my affairs unto Thee. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which Thou hast ordained for them that are near unto Thee from among Thy servants. Then forgive me and those with me, through Thy grace and bounty. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>O Mulla [Mamish], upon him be the Glory of God! He is the One Who gazeth from His most exalted horizon. O Mulla! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of all beings from the precincts of the Prison. Verily, it draweth thee nigh unto God, purifieth thee from disobedience, and giveth thee to drink of the Kawthar of life from the hands of bounty and bestowal. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. We have sent down unto thee on this night that which will draw thee unto God, the Lord of Lords. Say: O concourse of the Furqan! Open your eyes. The All-Merciful hath come with power and sovereignty. Beware lest the doubts of men hold you back from the Greatest Perspective, or the might of the oppressors frighten you–they who have broken the Covenant in the final end. When thou hearest the call of the Wronged One and drinkest the choice wine sealed with My Name, the Self-Subsisting, say: “My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having caused me to hear Thy most sweet call and shown me the traces of Thy Most Exalted Pen. I beseech Thee by the Word whereby earth and heaven were attracted, to make me one of those whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from turning toward the light of Thy countenance, O Creator of the heavens and Lord of the Kingdom of Names! O my Lord! Thou seest my tears and hearest my sighs. I beseech Thee by the rustling of Thy Lote Tree and the murmuring of the water of Thy bounty to aid me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, acknowledging Thy manifestation, Thy power, Thy grandeur and Thy sovereignty. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of any good that Thou hast sent down in Thy Book and ordained for Thy chosen ones. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest.

<p>In the Name of Him Who rules over all who are in earth and heaven! O peoples of the world, hearken unto the call of the All-Merciful, as it is raised in truth: There is none other God but Me, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Follow not your passions, but follow rather the Revealer of verses Who summons you unto God. This would be better for you, did ye but know. Burden not yourselves with that which prevents you from treading this outstretched Path. Be sources of fairness amongst the servants and manifestations of justice unto all in the lands. This behooveth you, could ye but understand. The world and all wherein ye take delight shall perish. Cast it behind you and turn with your hearts unto the Beloved. Should ye find one who turns away, remind him of God’s verses, that haply he may turn unto his Lord. And should he persist in his state, leave him to himself. Thus doth the Tongue of Grandeur command you, while in the hands of those who disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the All-Loving. We have sent down this Tablet for those who have believed in God and His signs, that they may arise to help the Wronged One. O servant! Grieve not at what hath befallen thee. Ponder My tribulation, My exile, My imprisonment and My affliction, after I summoned all unto God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Should a calamity touch you, be patient even as your Lord, the Possessor of the seen and unseen, was patient. Thus did the Tongue speak when sorrows encompassed the Lord of all that was and shall be. Glory be unto those who have acknowledged that which hath been sent down from God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>O thou who hast remembered Me! Know thou that He Who is remembered remembereth thee, and the Beloved speaketh that which rejoiceth thy heart and the hearts of them who have turned towards the Supreme Horizon on a day wherein souls lamented and feet did slip. Observe the people and their heedlessness: they wailed and cried out and supplicated at their separation from the Dawning-Place of the revelation of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Yet when the veils were rent asunder and the Promised One appeared, they rose up against Him with such tyranny as caused them who are nigh unto God to lament in their most exalted station. They recite the Qur’an, yet deny Him Who revealed it in truth. Thus did their souls prompt them, without any proof or Book. Blessed art thou for having rent asunder the veils and turned towards God, thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Say: O Fashioner of the heavens and Creator of names! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the sun of Thy grace hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy Revelation and the ocean of Thy bounty hath surged amongst Thy creatures, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in the service of them who love Thee. O my Lord! I am he who heard Thy sweetest call and turned towards Thy Most Exalted Horizon. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me the outpourings of the clouds of Thy mercy, nor to drive me from Thy door which Thou hast opened unto all who are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth. O my Lord! Aid Thy servants to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy signs and strengthen them to turn towards the lights of Thy countenance. Thou art, verily, the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest.

<p>O Nabil, son of Nabil! There hath come before the Wronged One that which thou didst send to Ismu’l-Javad, who was attracted by the verses of God and turned to Him, even unto visiting the Prison on a day when all on earth turned away from God save those rescued by the hand of Him Who ruleth over the worlds. Thou art he who traversed land and sea, and bore the derision of men and whatsoever proceeded from their mouths, until thou didst attain unto His presence and didst hear the call of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Remember when thou didst stand before the Gate, and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke unto thee that which God hath made the Kawthar of life for all who dwell in the realm of possibility. Thus doth He Who possesseth the Preserved Tablet make mention of thee. In these days We have sent a letter unto thy brother wherein We have made mention of thee as a token of My grace, for I am the Rememberer, the Hearer, the Beholder, and the Answerer in what hath been and what shall be. Blessed art thou and he, and those women who were with you both and who remember their Lord through what the All-Merciful hath sent down in His perspicuous and mighty Tablet. From this station We send Our greetings unto Javad who attained unto what his Lord, the Lord of existence, desired. He it is who heard the Call and answered his Lord whilst most of the people were as dead. Convey My greetings unto him and unto those who have believed in the One, the All-Informed. The Glory be upon you and upon every one who turneth unto God and whom the turbans have not hindered from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Niyaz! Upon thee be the glory of the Luminary of Hijaz, through Whom the Truth was made manifest and the traces of metaphor were erased. We were walking in the house and hearing the tale of the earth when suddenly a call was raised from the Most Exalted Paradise: “O people of Baha who are settled upon the Crimson Ark! Rejoice and be glad at the arrival of His Honor, the Trusted One, at a manifest station and mighty prison in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds.” Today in the city of love there is a melody for the lovers. Then another call was raised from the direction of the Supreme Paradise: “O concourse of lovers! Rejoice that ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar has arrived at the spot which God has made the Most Luminous Scene, where before him the Wronged One was imprisoned in the land of ?a, and attained to reunion and meeting. For We dwelt in cities with chains and shackles in that place and places like it. In truth, the homeland of those near to God has been and is the prison of the oppressors. Glory be to God! The wolves of the earth pride themselves on bloodthirstiness and have defiled the seat of judgment. We beseech God to purify it for the establishment of the throne of justice upon it. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. By My life! This seizing and torment in the path of the Peerless Friend is sweeter than the Kawthar in the taste of the lovers.

Time and again the Trustee, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of the worlds, hath mentioned thee and the handmaids of that land, and each one hath attained to that for which the world was created to recognize.

The Zamzam of Batha hath another melody, for the Lord of all being hath come without veil or covering, despite the desires of the people.

Some souls attribute themselves to the Truth while they follow the desires of self and passion. I am quit of them, as every fair-minded and discerning one doth testify.

<p>Praise be to God Who hath, through His sovereignty, revealed that which is hidden in the breasts and the treachery of the eyes, even as He revealed in the Qur’an to the son of Luqman: “O my son! verily, if there be but the weight of a mustard-seed, and it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth.” Wondrous is this Day! Both the hidden treasures of truth and mystical knowledge are made manifest, and that which lay concealed in the breasts of the polytheists hath become clear and evident. From the rocks of hearts hath appeared that which causeth the dwellers of the highest Paradise and the most exalted Heaven to weep and lament.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Quli! Upon thee be the everlasting glory of God! A few days ago, a Most Sublime Tablet was revealed from the Most Exalted Pen in thy name and that of the loved ones, and its bearer was Jinab-i-Dahaji. God willing, they will drink from the hidden oceans within the revealed verses and hold fast unto the peerless Friend, unlike the former people who each day took a different god, carved an idol, and worshipped it. True unity is to fix one’s gaze upon the horizon of the One Manifestation and to be detached and free from all else. In this most exalted station, thou and the other friends must beseech God for that which preserveth the people of God from diverse paths and ways devoid of light and guidance.</p>
<p>Husayn, upon whom be My glory and loving-kindness, forwarded thy letter through His Holiness the Most Great Branch to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and after it was heard, there was revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of Lords that which exalteth the Word of God and elevateth the stations of His loved ones. Especially for the loved ones of those regions have holy and prevailing verses been sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will, that all may attain to that which beseemeth the Days of God, exalted be His glory.</p>

I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance, by the pearls hidden in the shells of the ocean of Thy knowledge, and by the Word through which the horizon of the heaven of inner meanings and utterance was illumined, to make me in all conditions to hold fast to Thy cord, to cling to the hem of the robe of Thy bounty, and to be immersed in the depths of the sea of Thy oneness.

Blessed is the soul that has attained unto it, and blessed is the heart that has drunk of that wine. O handmaiden of God! Reflect upon the Cause of the Lord of Names, that thou mayest recognize Him with the eye of certainty and receive thy portion of His bounty. It is clear and evident that there hath never been, nor shall there ever be, any interruption in the outpouring of the All-Bountiful. Those souls who have remained deprived of this exalted bounty have done so because they have followed vain imaginings and remained devoted to the idols of self and desire. The Truth hath ever been, and shall forever remain, manifest in the sublimity of Its inaccessibility and the exaltation of Its transcendence, sanctified above all things. Whosoever hath beheld with His eye hath known Him, and whosoever hath remained heedless of this station hath failed to find Him. Beseech thou God that thou mayest not be debarred from the wondrous outpourings of the Most Great Ocean of His bounty, nor be deprived of the fragrances of His days.

It behooveth thee and those who have believed in God to make mention of him in the manner God hath mentioned him in a Preserved Tablet. Convey My greetings unto his believing kinsmen, then convey greetings unto the faces of My loved ones in that place and give them the glad-tidings of My gracious remembrance.</p>

<p>O beloved ones of the All-Merciful! Hearken unto the call from the precincts of the Prison - verily there is no God but I, the Hearer, the Answerer. Then know ye that Our servant who was surnamed Abu’l-Hasan hath appeared before the Throne and presented that which ye possess in your love for God, the Lord of the worlds. By this hath My Most Exalted Pen turned toward you and maketh mention of you through that whereby your remembrance shall endure in the kingdom of creation. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Giver, the Generous. Give thanks for My remembrance of you. By God! It is the water of life for you and the fragrances of the All-Merciful amidst all possibilities. To this beareth witness he who hath inhaled My fragrance, the Mighty, the Wondrous. We have heard your call and witnessed your turning toward the countenance of God, and We have sent down for you that which all the treasuries of earth cannot equal, were ye of them that know. Hold ye fast unto God and cling to the hem of His bounty and say:</p>
<p>“Praise be unto Thee, O God of the world, for having numbered us among them who have attained unto Thy recognition in Thy days and who have voiced Thy praise when most of Thy creatures turned away from Thee. O Lord! We beseech Thee by Thy Most Glorious Name, which hath been made sovereign over all names, to make us in all conditions turn toward Thy face, gaze upon the horizon of Thy grace, drink from the Kawthar of Thy knowledge, seek refuge with Thy presence and cling to the cord of Thy bounty. Then ordain for us that which shall profit us and that which Thou hast written for Thy chosen ones. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the All-Praised.”</p>

This is the Day whereof We gave you tidings in all the Tablets through a most holy and glorious Pen. Stand ye firm in the Cause, then weep for this Wronged One Who hath been slain by the sword of hatred and cast by the idolators into this pit whose depths no rope of possibility can fathom, and whose cry no ear can hear save whom your Lord, the All-Merciful, willeth. Thus hath the decree been fulfilled against the Beauty of the All-Glorious by the embodiments of tyrannous wickedness. Tear ye asunder the veils of glory, then emerge from behind the veil through My Name that encompasseth all the worlds. Beware lest ye break My Covenant or forget My days or join partners with My Self, for this verily would be a grievous sin. Unite ye in the Cause of God and His religion, and stand ye firm in love, for the idolators have gathered there and whisper unto men at all times that which Satan hath cast into their hearts, that they may cause them to slip from this Path which hath been raised up in the name of Him Who was exalted in truth. Today is the day of victory - aid ye then the Youth, and follow not every accursed Satan. Beware lest ye frequent the dwelling-place of those who have disbelieved in God and His signs, and in whose hearts hatred for the Youth lieth concealed. Take ye the cup of Baha with the fingers of faithfulness, then drink thereof that your hearts may be purified thereby. Thus hath the Pen of Destiny inscribed from a luminous and mighty Finger.</p>

<p>O My loved ones! We summon you at all times unto God, your Lord, the All-Merciful. By this We desire naught save to draw you nigh unto God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed is the ear that hath turned to the direction wherein was raised the call of God, that hath heard and said: “Here am I, O God of the seen and unseen!” We have raised the Word to a station that encompasseth all created things. Exalted be this power which hath conquered all that was and will be. Among the people are those who have denied the proof of God and His Cause, and among them are those who have turned to the Desired One. Soon shall We loose the tongues of all existing things in praise of those who have turned unto Him, and We shall seize those who have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the All-Loving. O thou who hast turned unto Me! When We turned Our gaze toward all things, We found from thee the fragrance of My love. We have, therefore, moved the Pen to make mention of thee, as a grace from Us unto thee and unto all peoples. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Knowing, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Blessed art thou for having attained in the days of God and discovered that which was diffused from the garment of My remembrance, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Be thou steadfast in thy station such that nothing shall prevent thee from this praiseworthy station. Through My remembrance all things have taken flight, and through My call all existence hath been enraptured. Soon shall We manifest that which We have deposited in the heart of the world through this Forbidden Name. The glory be upon thee and upon thy mother, from the presence of the Lord of the Promised Day.</p>

Hearken unto that which My Pen calleth thee to in My prison, and verily it calleth thee to naught save God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Grieve not at anything. Rejoice in the remembrance of God, thy Lord, for by His remembrance are tranquilized the hearts of them that are drawn nigh, and in it do rejoice God’s sincere servants. Say: His remembrance is the healing of every ill, the companion of every stranger, and a treasure for the poor and needy. Nothing that hath been created between the heavens and earth can be compared with His remembrance. Through it the mystics become independent of all created things, and through it do the monotheists ascend unto the heaven of exalted glory. And thou, O handmaiden of God, take comfort in the remembrance of thy Lord, then detach thyself from all else beside Him, for verily He sufficeth thee above all worlds. Grieve not over anything and place thy trust in thy Lord, the Help in Peril. Verily He forgeteth not His devoted handmaidens and servants. Be thou grateful for having attained unto the recognition of His Self and for having detached thyself from the satans who desired to cut down the Divine Lote-Tree after having sought its shade and having been among those who remembered God. But when the winds of tests blew upon them, they departed from the stronghold of God’s Cause and returned to the nethermost fire. Thus have We imparted unto thee the word of truth that thy spirit may rejoice therein, and this is indeed a great bounty. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

Efface from thy heart all things save My love, and from thine ear all save the wondrous descriptions of Me. Thus doth the Beloved counsel thee, if thou be of them that hearken. O My handmaiden! Forget not My wondrous remembrance and harbor naught in thy heart save My exalted remembrance. Be not gladdened by the acceptance of the world and whatsoever is therein, nor be saddened by its loss. The similitude of the world is as a shadow - at times it existeth and at times it existeth not. No wise one would attach their heart to such a thing, but rather would consider it vain. Think not that the world and what is meant by it are the ordained bounties therein or its varied ornaments, for these things are the creations of the Truth and the manifestations of His handiwork. Rather, they are the mirrors of the divine creative revelation and the manifestations of His power. Nay, what is meant by the world are they who deny the peerless Beauty and turn away from the eternal Countenance. Therefore, avoidance of such persons is necessary and turning away from them is obligatory. And today, the essence of worldliness is heedlessness of My remembrance and love of Mine enemies.

He speaketh the truth when He saith: There is none other God but Him, and that ’Ali-before-Nabil is, in truth, the Sovereign of the Cause gathered unto all worlds. Therefore, rejoice thou within thyself, and be thou gladdened in thine innermost being, for the veil hath been lifted, and the covering removed, and the Youth hath dawned from the Dayspring of holy beauty.

This, verily, is the shadow of God upon earth, and His beauty in the heaven of Command and Creation, and His proof unto all who dwell in the kingdom of the clouds and the Throne, and He is, in truth, a victorious Sovereign. Thus do We cast upon thee from the verses of thy Lord, and recite unto thee that which draweth thee nigh unto the shore of nearness, the blessed seat of glory. Take heed lest thou fear anyone, then give to drink unto thy kindred from a cup whose essence is of camphor.

Verily it hath been among you for numbered years, and ye have known it according to your measure and capacity. Whoso denieth it is assuredly in grievous loss. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon her whom God hath related unto thee, who was among the devout ones in the preserved Tablets of glory.</p>

<p>O ’Abdu’l-?usein, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing, the Compassionate, the Bountiful. We have desired to make mention of My servant ?usein, who attained unto My remembrance in the early days when We were established upon the throne of revelation in Baghdad. He recognized My verses, was honored to attain My presence, submitted to the manifestations of My grandeur, and was humbled at the raising of My call, and responded when My tongue spoke forth. We beseech God to assist him and strengthen him to preserve that which was revealed unto him from His swift-moving, ever-active Pen. A letter has come before the Wronged One wherein thy name was mentioned. We make mention of thee in this wondrous Tablet that thou mayest be gladdened by that which hath been sent down unto thee from an ancient Revealer. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of My loving-kindness and behold the pearls of the ocean of My utterance, say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having shown me and caused me to witness and hear Thy horizon and Thy call. I beseech Thee by the Dawning-Place of Thy verses and the Manifestation of Thy clear tokens and the Dayspring of Thy commandments and ordinances - He in Whose right hand is the standard of “He doeth whatsoever He willeth” and in Whose other hand are the reins of all things - to make me one of those who have aided Thy Cause through wisdom and utterance and whom the hosts of creation have not deterred. Thou art verily the Almighty, the Glorious, the Bestower. O Lord! Send down from the heaven of Thy bounty the rains of Thy mercy upon Thy loved ones who have not broken Thy Covenant and Testament and who have arisen to serve Thy Cause amidst Thy servants. Thou art verily the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayer.</p>

<p>He is the One dawning from the horizon of might! O Afnan, his honor Mirza Aqa, upon him be the Glory of God! We have manifested the Cause of God to all who are in the kingdoms of command and creation, and made clear His straight path. Among the people are those whom love of the world has prevented from turning to the Lord of Names, and among them are those who have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon, detached from the worlds. He who has turned to the One to Whom the world turns has prospered, and he who has turned away from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, has lost. Your letter has come before the Wronged One, and We have read it and found it purified from the mention of any but Me, and adorned with the name of Him through Whom the heavens of religions were cleft asunder, the lands of knowledge were split, and the stars of idle fancies were scattered. Verily your Lord is the Mighty, the Powerful. We have answered you with this letter that you might find in it that which will cool your eyes and gladden your heart. By My life! There has been ordained for you that which is not equaled by anything created on earth. Verily your Lord is the Expositor, the All-Wise. Say: Glory be to Thee, O my God! Thou seest Thy loved ones among the polytheists from among Thy creation and the transgressors from among Thy servants. I beseech Thee by Thy Name which Thou hast made the cause of the life of the world and the greatest means for the salvation of the nations, that Thou protect us through Thy power and sovereignty and might and dominion. Then set right, O my God, all our affairs and ordain for us what is best for us. I testify that Thou knowest better than we what benefits us, and that Thou art the Mighty, the Exalted, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>

I beseech Thee by the horizon which was illumined by the lights of Thy countenance, and the station which was honored by attaining Thy presence, and by the scratching of Thy Pen and the signs of Thy greatness, to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and benefit me in all Thy worlds. I know not what lieth hidden in Thy knowledge, and Thou art more knowing of me than I am myself. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst guide the peoples to Thy Most Great Path, that Thou disappoint me not of what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones.

<p>In the name of God, the All-Knowing! Miyanduab Amir Khan–may you drink from the ocean of divine favor and find its sweetness! In all the heavenly Books We gave the glad tidings to the people concerning this blessed Day and what would appear therein. But when the Sun of Manifestation dawned from the horizon of Sinai and the divine Tree spoke forth “Verily, I am God,” all turned away and deprived themselves of this supreme bounty, save whom thy Lord willed. This is that Comforter of whom the Spirit gave tidings, and this is that Hour concerning which the Son confessed that neither He nor the angels of heaven had any knowledge thereof. Were anyone to reflect even briefly upon the four Gospels and the holy Books, he would acknowledge that this Day hath no peer or likeness, for that which was hidden and concealed is now seated upon the throne and made manifest. Blessed are they whom the vanities, allusions, words and utterances of the people of the world did not prevent from this most exalted station. They turned with their whole being and drank from the cup of certitude. We bear witness that they are among the denizens of the most exalted Paradise and the companions of the Crimson Ark. Blessed is every hearer who hath heard, and every seer who hath beheld that which hath shone forth and dawned from the horizon of God’s Will, the Mighty, the Great.</p>

<p>God willing, may you be occupied with service to the Cause through divine assistance, and walk among the servants with complete steadfastness, in such wise that the opposition and objections of the people of the world shall not prevent you from the Best Beloved of the world and the Ancient King. Reflect upon that to which people cling today - in truth they are worshippers of the calf while counting themselves among the people of unity. The Supreme Pen beareth witness that the Furqan, which was the separator between truth and falsehood, dissociateth itself from those souls who claim connection to it. Verily it was revealed to establish the Remembered One and testified to the Promised One. Yet when the Remembered One came and the Promised One appeared, those servants who had been reading it night and day denied Him. Fie upon them and upon their leaders who led them to the fire while they perceived it not! Convey My greetings to the chosen ones of God and gladden them through divine favor. We make mention in this Tablet of thy sister who hath believed in God, the Single, the All-Informed. Convey My greetings to her face and give her the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy which have preceded all worlds. God willing, in these days when the Sun of Revelation is risen and the ocean of generosity is surging, may the handmaidens of God be occupied with the remembrance of the Beloved of all possibility with utmost sanctity, detachment, joy and fragrance.

<p>God willing, may you be blessed with divine bounties and heavenly outpourings, and be focused on the Dawning-Place of God’s names. Today it is incumbent upon all to fix their gaze upon the Truth and whatsoever proceeds from Him. Although all souls were created by a single word, the radiance and effulgence of the Sun of Truth varies according to the capacity of each soul. This is why it hath been said aforetime: “Verily We created souls in diverse stages.” Therefore one must look to the root of the Cause and to that which proceedeth from Him. In all conditions hold fast to the cord of grace and cling to the hem of bounty. He is the Deliverer, He is the Protector, He is the Helper. There is none other God but Him, the Helper, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Today all the loved ones are commanded to wisdom, and in most divine Tablets they have been forbidden from corruption, conflict and contention. Blessed are they that act accordingly. Through God’s grace, they who have turned to God must be dawning-places of loving-kindness and daysprings of mercy. They must heal the ignorant with the remedy of knowledge and wisdom, and quicken the heedless with the water of remembrance and utterance. O Ali! I swear by the Ancient Being that God, glorified and exalted be He, hath manifested such grace as none greater is possible. Blessed are they that comprehend. God willing, may you be occupied at all times with the remembrance of God - exalted be His glory and bounty - and speak forth His Name. Verily He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>

<p>O loved ones of God! May you ever drink from the Kawthar of the peerless Beauty of the Most High, and become so intoxicated from this wine of the Day of Alast that you see none but God and count all else as non-existent. In the emerald Tablets from the Pen of the King of Oneness, the triumph of the Cause through wisdom and utterance hath been recorded. Fix your gaze upon this. The Beloved hath ordained that the conquest of the citadels of hearts be achieved through the sword of the tongue. Thus hath the All-Merciful decreed. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Your turning to the Ka’bah of Glory and arising to promote His Cause is itself a victory, and God, exalted be His glory, hath accepted it and recorded you among the helpers in the Preserved Tablet. God will soon reward you with a goodly reward. He, verily, is the Protector of the sincere ones. Strive at all times that perchance ye may quicken dead souls through the remembrance of the King of Oneness and bestow the Kawthar of the love of the All-Merciful upon all who dwell within the realm of possibility. Today, whosoever ariseth to teach will be confirmed by the Spirit of the Cause. Blessed art thou for having turned unto [God] and turned away from those who disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds, and for having recognized thy Lord and desired His good-pleasure on a Day whereon the faces of those who turned away were darkened while the faces of those who turned unto Him were illumined. Unite ye in God’s Cause and in His love. Through this shall the back of the idolaters be broken. And the glory rest upon thee and upon those who are with thee in the Cause of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>

<p>O Mah Bigum, The Most Great, The Most Holy, handmaiden of God! Your letter reached the Most Holy Court and was favored with the glance of God’s loving-kindness. As for what you mentioned regarding your solitude and estrangement - this station deserves gratitude, for the True One Himself chose solitude and estrangement and made His dwelling in the Most Great Prison. And concerning what you mentioned about your kindnesses to this handmaiden - His favors have preceded and will continue. Among these was that He assisted you to recognize the Dawning Place of His Cause, while most men remained heedless and deprived. This is a station that cannot be equaled by anything that exists. Be grateful to your Lord for this great bounty. The breezes of divine favors have encompassed all - whoever turned to them completely, from their tongue and pen flowed rivers of knowledge and wisdom. We beseech God to enable all to achieve this. As for what you asked about your parents - they are adorned with the robe of forgiveness. This is from His bounty toward you, as your letter was present before the Throne and you supplicated God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Remain firm in the Cause, then preserve what We gave you in your vision. Say: “O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Overshadowing One above all names, to make me steadfast in Thy love and Thy remembrance, and ordain for me what befits Thy mercy that hath preceded all worlds.”</p>

<p>Subject: RE: O Nightingales</p>
<p>Dear Juan:</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the transliteration and translation of ay bulbulan.</p>
<p>It’s a little difficult to make out some of the lines in transliteration</p>
<p>without the long vowels, but here goes. There seems to be a sekteh</p>
<p>(metrical fault) in the 3rd hemistich. The basic meter of the poem is</p>
<p>mostaf`elun mostaf`elun mostaf`elun mostaf`elun, which is –^- 4 times.</p>
<p>However, the 3rd hemistich reads”</p>
<p>&gt; Ay `ashiqan, ay `ashiqan: Ma`shuq rukh namud `ayan</p>
<p>which gives –^- –^- –^- ^-^^-</p>
<p>I don’t have my Elwell-Sutton or Khanlari here at home, but I don’t think</p>
<p>this is a permissible variation of the foot. Of course, it is not terribly</p>
<p>unusual for a poet to have a metrically faulty foot, though it isn’t</p>
<p>considered tip-top style. There is only one other variation from the</p>
<p>metrical pattern, in hemistich 10:</p>
<p>&gt; Aynak chih khurshid-i sama bud; shab az kuhsar shud</p>
<p>scanning as: –^- –^- -^^- –^- which is probably a prosodically</p>
<p>permissible variant (again, I’d have to check the prosodic manuals).</p>
<p>However, there are a couple places where the transliteration needs to be</p>
<p>amended to get the correct scansion: In hemistich 7 dilbar must be followed</p>
<p>by an ezafeh and the vowel of va must be elided:</p>
<p>&gt; An dilbar-i pardih nishin v-an khusruv-i charkh-i barin</p>
<p>In hemistich 11, conversely, we must delete an ezafeh:</p>
<p>&gt; Bazar-i jumlih `ashiqan az zulf-i mushk-i tu fishan shud</p>
<p>In hemistich 12, I think it should be vowelled “dakkih.”</p>
<p>Also, in hemistich 13, for metrical reasons the va must be read as short</p>
<p>“u”: Khumha hamih dar jush shud; `aql u nuha madhush shud</p>
<p>The above emendations, of course, have no bearing on the meaning of the</p>
<p>words, but only on their vocalization. There is, however, one minor and one</p>
<p>important point that bear upon the correct understanding of the meaning of</p>
<p>the text. In hemistich 10 you give:</p>
<p>&gt; Aynak chih khurshid-i sama bud; shab az kuhsar shud</p>
<p>The first word should be vowelled “inak” if it is in the meaning of behold,</p>
<p>or voila. The second word–is it cheh or cho If cheh, it is an</p>
<p>expression of wonder, meaning “what a wonderful…”, whereas if it is</p>
<p>“cho” [the letters che and vav], it means “as / like.” It seems to me,</p>
<p>it should read like this:</p>
<p>inak cho khorshid-e samaa bovad, shab az kohsaar shod</p>
<p>here, now, is the sun of the heavens!</p>
<p>darkness [night] has fled from the hilltops.</p>
<p>Finally, for the last line (hemistichs 13 and 14), you read:</p>
<p>&gt; Khumha hamih dar jush shud; `aql va nuha madhush shud</p>
<p>&gt; Zi har kashandih nush shud, ta jam-i haqq sarshar shud.</p>
<p>which you translate as:</p>
<p>&gt; Metal drums</p>
<p>&gt; are playing loudly;</p>
<p>&gt; reason and</p>
<p>&gt; intellect</p>
<p>&gt; are left</p>
<p>&gt; bewildered</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; Everyone drew up</p>
<p>&gt; a draft</p>
<p>&gt; till the Chalice of God</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; overflowed.</p>
<p>The word khum-haa does not usually mean metal drums, but wine jugs or</p>
<p>amphora, which fits better here. Also, there is perhaps a pun on the word</p>
<p>nuhaa. While it means intellect, it can also mean measure, depth, volume</p>
<p>and also a glass. Hence the reading is:</p>
<p>the wine jugs have all come to a boil [fervent ferment];</p>
<p>intellect and reason [pun: the rising waters] are dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Though I don’t have the text in Persian characters, the second half of this</p>
<p>line almost certainly should be read:</p>
<p>zahr-i kushandih nush shud ta jamm-i haq sarshaar shud</p>
<p>which would mean:</p>
<p>The mortal poison was quaffed</p>
<p>as soon as the mystic goblet</p>
<p>filled to overflowing</p>
<p>Here, then, heavily indebted to Juan’s version, is another way to translate</p>
<p>Baha’u’llah’s poem. It attempts, not by rhyme, but by grammatical and</p>
<p>visual parallelism, to preserve something of the form of the original. Of</p>
<p>course, this often requires a somewhat convoluted word-order, but the word</p>
<p>order is not always natural in the original, either. What Baha’u’llah</p>
<p>wrote, after all, is a classical and metrical ghazal; such poetry is not</p>
<p>usually composed in a conversational, but rather a literary register. The</p>
<p>following version forgoes rhyme and uses a modern graphical lay-out of the</p>
<p>words on the page (as did Juan’s version), but pretty much preserves the</p>
<p>symbols, diction and metaphors of the original (as, also, did Juan’s). It</p>
<p>might also be possible to attempt a more modernizing translation, with a</p>
<p>contemporary diction substituting approximate equivalents for the imagery.</p>
<p>This might sound much better, but then it would be a modern adaptation of</p>
<p>the poem and not a translation.</p>
<p>yours, Frank</p>

<p>Juan’s transliteration:</p>

<p>O Abdullah the Emigrant!</p>
<p>In the name of the Ever-Abiding Friend! O Abdullah! Praise be to God, thou hast turned thyself to the ocean of divine bounty and attained unto His Most Great Name. His grace is endless and His generosity infinite. Among His bounties is that He confirmed thee in traversing vast distances and arriving at the court of His oneness. This hath been and shall ever remain one of the great blessings of God. How many souls today are occupied with their selfish desires, to such extent that they are wholly veiled from the Truth and deprived of the wine of reunion. Through His grace thou didst attain His presence and drink from the life-giving waters. God willing, thou must in all thy days be occupied with His remembrance and engaged in His praise. Turn thy gaze away from the peoples of the world and fix it upon His horizon. This is the counsel of Truth that hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Glory be upon thee.</p>
<p>We make mention of thee once again in eloquent Arabic, that thou mayest thank thy Lord and arise to remember Him amongst all peoples. Blessed art thou for having attained His presence, and heard and witnessed that which most of mankind hath failed to attain. This is through thy Lord’s bounty, if thou be of them that know. Give thanks unto God by night and by day, nay rather in all conditions, for having enabled thee to draw nigh unto the Most Great Ocean and made thee to be among the successful ones. Remember My loved ones in thy land and glorify their faces on behalf of this wronged Exile.</p>

<p>O Ali! May you ever abide, through divine grace, beneath the shade of the Divine Lote Tree, and remain joyous and glad through the wafting of the breezes of the Lord’s favors. I praise God for having enabled you to recognize His Cause and aided you to turn towards God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Your letter was received in His presence and its contents were noted. We beseech God to ordain for you the good of this world and the next. Verily He has power over all things. It is most praiseworthy to strive to unite the hearts of the loved ones of God and guide people through wisdom and utterance. Blessed are they who attain! Observe how despite the afflictions and successive tribulations, the Pen of the Cause has never ceased moving, continuously engaged in promoting God’s Cause, such that it has encompassed all regions. The loved ones of God must also arise to serve the Cause according to their capacity. This is from God’s grace which He bestows on whomsoever He wishes. The people of affirmation who are the manifestations of “except” must fix their gaze on affirmation - that is, on the established, enduring and eternal stations that were and will be with God, not on transient and impermanent matters. We beseech God to protect you beneath the canopy of His mercy and ordain for you what He has ordained for His sincere servants. He is indeed the Forgiving, the Generous. And may the glory rest upon you and those with you.</p>

<p>O ’Ali-Jan! The dewdrops of revelation are ever trickling from the leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree, yet most remain heedless thereof. The Sun of the Divine Countenance shines forth from the horizon of will, yet most turn away. The verses of the Lord descend at every moment from the heaven of merciful purpose, yet most of mankind remain veiled and remote therefrom. God willing, thou shalt arise to serve the Cause through divine power and strength, and share with all the sealed wine that hath been unsealed by the finger of God’s power, that perchance they may be freed from idle fancies and turn toward the horizon of certitude. Praise be to the Goal of all creation that thy name was mentioned before the Throne and that which shall endure forever hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. All that thou beholdest today shall perish save that which God hath ordained for thee. In all matters be mindful of wisdom, for the people are weak. Thy Lord is verily the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Place thy trust in God - verily He is with thee and will assist thee with the truth. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

<p>O Muhammad-’Ali! Great is the blessedness awaiting thee, inasmuch as thou hast adorned thine heart with the ornament of the love of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised. He that hath attained this station in this day, all good shall be his.</p>
<p>Pay thou no heed to the humiliation to which the loved ones of God have in this Day been subjected.</p>
<p>This humiliation is the pride and glory of all temporal honor and worldly elevation. What greater honor can be imagined than the honor conferred by the Tongue of the Ancient of Days when He calleth to remembrance His loved ones in His Most Great Prison? The day is approaching when the intervening clouds will have been completely dissipated, when the light of the words, “All honor belongeth unto God and unto them that love Him,” will have appeared, as manifest as the sun, above the horizon of the Will of the Almighty.</p>
<p>All men, be they high or low, have sought and are still seeking so great an honor.</p>
<p>All, however, have, as soon as the Sun of Truth shed its radiance upon the world, have deprived of its benefits, and have been shut out as by a veil from its glory, except them that have clung to the cord of the unfailing providence of the one true God, and have with complete detachment from all else but Him turned their faces towards His holy court.</p>
<p>Render thanks unto Him Who is the Desire of all worlds for having invested thee with such high honor. Ere long the world and all that is therein shall be as a thing forgotten, and all honor shall belong to the loved ones of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful.</p>

Thus doth the Beloved remember thee and counsel thee with that which shall profit thee in the worlds of thy Lord. Hold fast unto it and be thou of those who attain.

Ask thou God to assist thee in His remembrance and praise and service to His Cause, even as He assisted thy father. Verily He is the All-Powerful, to Whose sovereignty and grandeur and might all things have testified. The glory from Us be upon you and upon those in your household.

Today, which is Thursday the fifth of the month of Dhi’l-Qa’dih, one hour after noon, He appeared before me and commanded: Write to Aqa Muhammad-Rida, upon him be God’s peace: Khalil, upon him be God’s mercy, hath been freed from the troubles, hardships and difficulties of this transitory world and hath set forth for his true homeland. It behooveth all to attend, according to their means, to his affairs. This is among the conditions of faith and certitude, of love and unity. They owe a sum of money - whatever is verifiably owed to you must be quickly repaid, that perchance, God willing, the debt that must be paid to Haji Muhammad in Beirut may be settled before mention and claim are made. They must exert their utmost effort in this matter. We beseech God to aid him in that which He loveth and is pleased with.</p>

Ere long shall the world and whatsoever existeth therein pass away. Those souls who now recline upon the throne of glory and those who dwell upon the dust of abasement - all shall return to the earth. How excellent is the state of those souls from whom the denizens of the Concourse on High inhale the fragrance of divine love. Would that my people knew!</p>

<p>When your book was presented before the Face, therefore, purely out of grace and favor, resplendent, exalted and luminous verses were revealed and sent down from the heaven of oneness regarding what was mentioned therein. Read them to everyone. God willing, all must conduct themselves with perfect wisdom so that nothing may arise that would cause the weak to be shaken. Consider the interests of the Cause from all directions. It is necessary to prevent people from turning towards this direction, for this land is secretly in great turmoil, and that which is concealed therein shall ere long be made manifest, as hath been revealed in the Tablets of previous years. All must be content with God’s good-pleasure and be submissive to His Cause. He is the One who has power over all things. Should He so will, He can establish for one who is remote the decree of nearness. Verily, He has power over all things. Not every one who is near has a share in the grace of the Cause. The Command is in God’s hands. Verily, He is the All-Knowing. Convey My greetings to thy brother and to those who have believed in God, the Mighty, the Wise. Then mention on My behalf thy other brother who was named after the Sacrifice, and this is what was revealed for him. Say: Read and be of those who are thankful. [In the margin of the blessed Tablet is written “He is the Bestower, Glory be unto Thee O God” which appears to relate to a Tablet referred to at the end of this text.]</p>

<p>He is the One Who gazeth from the horizon of the heaven of utterance!</p>
<p>The Incomparable Lord is sanctified and exalted above all limitation and description. Duality cannot describe the One, nor can mention suffice except through His confirmations. All are dead and He is living, all are transient and He is eternal. Strive thou to hold fast to His firm cord and cling to His sacred hem. I swear by the Sun of Utterance which hath shone forth from the most exalted horizon of possibility that whosoever remaineth deprived today of the outpourings of the All-Bountiful Truth is deprived of all good. The Book beareth witness to this and the Supreme Pen testifieth thereunto. This Wronged One hath, from the earliest days until now, guided the people to the horizon of Revelation without any veil or hindrance. His path is clear and His Cause manifest, yet all remain heedless and veiled. The people are worshippers of vain imaginings and followers of idle fancies. They have not drunk from the Kawthar of certitude nor partaken of the choice sealed wine. Glory be to God! What comfort have they found and in what do they rejoice? They return from palace to tomb, and from light to darkness. Blessed is the soul that hath been reminded by the divine verses and hath sanctified itself from the events of these two fleeting days. Such a one is numbered among the people of Baha in the Crimson Book. Blessed are they that understand.</p>

<p>Praise be to the Lord of existence Who, through His Best-Beloved Name, illumined the hearts of His chosen ones with the light of recognition and adorned them with the glory of steadfastness. O Ha! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. We have been with thee under all conditions and were present when God, with power and sovereignty, took one of the deceivers. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to exalt thee through His Name, that there may be manifested through thee that which will spread His signs throughout His lands. He is verily the Almighty, the All-Choosing. That which We revealed unto thee before hath come to pass, and that which was hidden in God’s knowledge, the Lord of lords, shall be made manifest. Hold thou fast to the teaching of thy Lord’s Cause. He will protect thee through His power and will guard thee through the might that hath encompassed all created things. And as for what hath befallen My loved ones in the Land of Ya, God hath made it the supreme means for the exaltation of His perfect Word. Its effects shall soon be made manifest from all directions. Grieve not over anything. In all matters place thy trust in God, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for thee and those with thee, through His Most Exalted Pen, the good of this world and the next, and to open before thy face, through the key of His Name, the Lord of all names, the gate of His bounty. He, verily, is powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His Cause that hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon My loved ones whom the hosts of those who denied the Beginning and the Return could not frighten.</p>

<p>In the name of the One True God, the All-Knowing. Praise befitteth the Lord of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and unseen, Who hath illumined the realms of hearts and minds with the lights of His Most Great Name, and guided them to the Supreme Horizon in the prison of ’Akka. He is the One whose power the might of the world could not weaken nor deter from His purpose. Glorified be His majesty and exalted His dominion! Glory be unto God! The claimants of divine love have broken the Covenant and joined the enemies. Neither kindly counsels nor wise exhortations have proved effective. We beseech God–glorified be His majesty–to adorn His servants with the ornament of justice and fairness. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Exalted. Convey My greetings to the loved ones and say: Since the fate of the Wronged One is a cause of grief, We have refrained from mentioning it. The divine Ark is encompassed by waves, and the divine Lamp by winds. We beseech God to manifest that which is the cause and source of truthfulness, trustworthiness, religiosity, justice and fairness. The world and its peoples bear witness that this Wronged One hath desired naught save the exaltation of the Word and the advancement of existence. Blessed is he who hath adorned his head with the crown of justice and his temple with the ornament of fairness. Woe unto the deniers and they that have turned away.</p>

<p>Praise be to the Imperishable Beloved Who, through His all-embracing mercy, summoneth all created things unto life everlasting. Yet many souls in the Days of God have remained deprived of the wine of the All-Merciful’s mercy and the Heavenly Fountain of Divine utterance, and wander bewildered in the wilderness of self and passion, while others have attained unto His infinite bounties. Blessed are they, and woe unto the heedless!</p>
<p>Praise be to God that thou hast quaffed from the Everlasting Chalice proffered by the Hand of Divine favors, and hast attained unto the recognition of God which is the source of all good. Thy mention hath been made in His presence and thy name inscribed in His Book. This is a mighty favor indeed - know thou its worth and preserve it as thou wouldst thy life.</p>
<p>Be thou not grieved at that which hath befallen thee. We must all be content with God’s decree and patient in times of tribulation, for whatsoever proceedeth from God, if observed with penetrating vision, hath been and ever shall be the essence of His grace. In truth, sorrow befitteth those souls who are afflicted with the vain imaginings and troubles of this world, not one who hath, by God’s grace, ascended unto the highest horizon and taken up his abode in the most exalted Paradise.</p>

<p>Praise be unto the Omnipotent, Self-Subsisting One, Who through the blessed and goodly Word that dawned from the horizon of the All-Merciful Will, brought all creation from nothingness into the realm of being. This Word hath been God’s balance amongst His servants and the straight path for people of insight and guidance. In one station this Word hath been called by all the most beautiful names, and in another station it hath been sanctified from all, for the Manifestation and Dawning-Place of the Word hath been the Divine Manifestation among creation. And in another station the Word itself is the Manifestation. For this Word, which is the Pivot of the Book of God, two stations have been ordained in creation and law. The first station tells of the Manifestation of God amongst His servants, for all divine commands and prohibitions appear from Him. Whosoever turns to Him hath turned to Truth, and whosoever turns away is accounted among the turn-aways in the Book of God. Blessed is he who today attains unto the Word of God and His Manifestation, who grasps the Most Firm Handle and turns toward the Most Exalted Horizon - he is assuredly among the sincere ones. God willing, may you, through the grace of the All-Merciful, arise with utmost effort and endeavor to exalt the Blessed Word, and set ablaze the people with the fire of the love of God.</p>

<p>As to the question of Huquq: Reference to this matter is in no wise permissible. We have formerly enjoined upon you and Jinab-i-Amin that which will redound to the glory and dignity of the Word of God and of His Cause. Touching on this particular subject We have bidden thus: Ye may relinquish the whole world but must not allow the detraction of even one jot or tittle from the dignity of the Cause of God. Jinab-i-Amin – upon him be My glory – must also refrain from mentioning this matter, for it is entirely dependent upon the willingness of the individuals themselves. They are well acquainted with the commandment of God and are familiar with that which was revealed in the Book. Let him who wisheth observe it, and let him who wisheth ignore it. Verily, thy Lord is the Self-Sufficing, the All-Praised. Indeed, independence of all things is as a door of guidance unto His faithful servants. Well is it with them that have severed themselves from the world and have arisen to serve His Cause. Verily, they are numbered with the people of Baha at the court of His resplendent Beauty.</p>
<p>O Haydar-Qabli-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Lord of Wisdom and Utterance!</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified beyond tongue and utterance, befitteth the most holy and most exalted court of the Beloved of the worlds, Who hath caused His loved ones, through hope of His promise and fear of His warning, neither to transgress the straight Path nor the Mighty Announcement. They have trodden the path of transformation and raised high the hand of reformation. They are the followers of the paths of certitude and the obliterators of the traces of doubt and idle fancy. Exalted is their Teacher and exalted is their Commander! We beseech God to assist them with the hosts of might and power, and to confirm them in that which hath been revealed in His perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>O Haydar-i-Qabli-’Ali! Upon thee be My remembrance and praise. Thy letters, both previous and recent, have reached the Most Holy Court, and answers have been sent down from the Dawning-Place of the favors of the Goal of all the worlds. Letters arrived repeatedly and answers were repeatedly revealed. Praise be unto God, again praise be unto God! Concerning what thou didst mention about turning to Nun and Jim, excellent is what thou hast done. Regarding Huquq, mention of it is in no way permissible. We have previously commanded thee and the Trustee to do that which would exalt the Word of God and His Cause. We specifically uttered these words: “Forsake the world, but forsake not an atom of the glory of God’s Cause.” The Trustee, upon him be My glory, must also make no mention of this matter. This is contingent and dependent upon the acceptance of the souls themselves. Most have heard the Command of God and what was revealed in the Book. Whoso willeth, let him act, and whoso willeth, let him turn away. Verily thy Lord is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised. The very state of being independent is a door of guidance for the servants. Blessed are they who, detached from the world, have arisen to serve. They are assuredly among the people of Baha in this luminous horizon. What thou hast said regarding these stations is the truth in which there is no doubt. We beseech Him to assist His loved ones to act in accordance with that which will cause the exaltation of His Cause. Verily He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Concerning thy mention of the daughter of Zayn and those related to her - each one hath attained unto the tokens of the Most Exalted Pen. Give them the glad-tidings of God’s favors, the Lord of all worlds, and remind them of His verses, and illumine them with the lights of His wondrous utterance. We beseech God to ordain for them what beseemeth His generosity and bounty, and to assist them at all times to remember and praise Him and to serve His mighty and exalted Cause. Thou didst mention Mashhadi Muhammad-Taqi and likewise their intention and turning toward the House. For some time, due to the actions of the mischief-makers, undesirable matters have occurred in this land. Therefore We have commanded those intending to attain the presence of the Ka’bih to wait. And concerning his intention to convert his property to gold for the payment of Huquq - We have pardoned him as a bounty from Us. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. And We write for him from My Most Exalted Pen the reward of attaining My presence, of standing before My countenance, of arising before My gate, and of hearkening to My call. In My Name hath been raised the banner of “He doeth what He willeth.” Verily thy Lord is the Commander, the Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>Regarding your mention of attention to Kha and Vav and entry into the house of him of Mim and Ha, upon him be the Glory of God, it has attained unto Our hearing. Some time ago the loved ones of that land were once again blessed with the verses of the Supreme Pen. We made mention of each one with a mention that is lasting and enduring. Blessed are they and joy be unto them. Convey to the loved ones of that land greetings from the Wronged One. Verily We have, at this hour, turned toward them and have made mention of them time and again with that which hath diffused the fragrance of My mercy that hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Blessed is the land that hath been honored by the footsteps of My loved ones, and the air wherein their mention hath been raised, and the ears that hear their call. Were ye to count the favors and bounties of God, ye would not be able to number them. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this from this exalted station. The Glory from Us be upon them and upon those who have testified to that which God hath testified, that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And whatsoever they have sent hath been accepted. Give them the glad-tidings of this great favor.</p>
<p>Thou didst make mention of Ibn-i-Mahdi, upon him be My Glory. Verily We make mention of him at this moment with the verses of God, the King, the True, the Just, the Manifest. Give him glad-tidings from Me and convey unto him greetings from the Wronged One. We beseech God to assist him to make mention of Him and to serve His loved ones. He is verily the Helper, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And We make mention of the children of My loved ones who are there. We beseech God to enable every servant who hath turned unto Him to perform such deeds as shall never be erased from His mighty Book. Verily We have made mention of every name that hath been present before the Wronged One with that which the treasuries of kings and rulers cannot equal.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! We have desired to bestow Our bounty upon him who was named Muhammad (Mulla Mirza), and to remember him with words through which the light hath shone forth and the concealed hath been revealed. Blessed is the servant who hath recognized and attained, and woe unto the heedless ones. O Muhammad! Hear the call from the direction of Akka, then behold and remember when thou wert turning toward the lights of the Face and heard the call from the Most Exalted Horizon that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Hear the divine call in the Persian tongue. The days are passing, and all that is witnessed returneth to nothingness. Strive that perchance thou mayest succeed in performing a deed that will be adorned with the ornament of divine acceptance and good-pleasure. Today the ocean of generosity surgeth before all existence, and the lights of the Sun of grace shine forth and gleam from the horizon of the heaven of bounty. Arise for the sake of God and awaken the heedless servants for His sake, that they may not be deprived of the outpourings of the All-Bountiful Lord which descend like a copious rain.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! The signs have encompassed the world and the evidences have embraced all things, yet the people of Iran are seen to be heedless, veiled, forbidden and deprived. Those upright souls who have drunk from the hand of bounty the water of everlasting life must engage, for the sake of God, in the reformation of the world, and the reformation of the world is dependent and contingent upon the reformation of the nations. Blessed is the ear that hath heard and the eye that hath seen. Woe unto every doubtful hesitator.</p>
<p>We beseech God to assist thee and ordain for thee the best in this world and the next, and to send down upon thee that which will make thee powerful, steadfast, firm and immovable in the Cause of thy Lord in such wise that neither the veils of glory nor the might of the people of error shall hold thee back. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Forgiving, the Compassionate.</p>
<p>When thou findest the fragrance of the utterance of the Lord of all beings and beholdest the pearls that have appeared from the treasuries of My Most Exalted Pen, say: O Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens! I beseech Thee by those whom neither the world nor its ornaments, nor its beauty, nor its glory, nor its might, nor its riches prevented from hearing Thy call, who said “Yea, yea, O Lord of the mighty throne and the exalted seat!” and whom the attraction of the call seized in such wise that they hastened to the place of sacrifice out of love for Thy beauty, that Thou make me in all conditions to stand firm in Thy service, to speak Thy praise, to gaze toward Thy horizon, to hearken unto the wonders of Thy verses, to hold fast unto the cord of Thy care, and to cling to the hem of the robe of Thy grace and bounty. Verily Thou art the Possessor of existence and the Knower of the seen and unseen. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention Jinab-i-’Andalib, upon him be My glory and My mercy. Should he again journey to the lands of Ra and Shin and Mazandaran, it would be most fitting and beloved. Jinab-i-Amin, upon him be My glory, must to the extent possible attend to his affairs. Likewise the friends of God - praise be to God - his pen and tongue in the divine days have been occupied with His mention and praise. We beseech God, exalted be He, to protect him and assist him and preserve what hath been revealed for him and make the reward of his deeds a treasure for him and make him a helper of His Cause through wisdom and utterance. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! On this night the Wronged One of the world hath turned toward thee and maketh mention of thee, while the kings of the earth and the peoples have risen against His harm, and every day there appeareth that which grieveth the denizens of the highest Paradise. Without helper or assistant, in the Most Great Prison and the supreme imprisonment, He maketh mention of His loved ones, and in every moment there appeareth from the treasury of the Supreme Pen that which the treasurers of the realm of inner meanings are powerless and incapable to assess its worth. Blessed are they who possess insight, who hold fast to the Most Sublime Vision and cling to that which is with God, who have detached themselves from self and others, and who are turned toward and gazing upon the Purpose of the world. To such souls as desire to turn unto Him, make mention of each one on behalf of the Wronged One and give them glad-tidings. However, in these days the effulgences of the Sun of Permission are veiled behind clouds and mists, for the opposers and deniers stand as barriers and obstacles. We beseech God to record from the Supreme Pen the recompense of attainment for all in the Crimson Book. He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty.</p>
<p>As to thy mention of H and S Kh, may God assist him - today every possessor of justice and fairness beareth witness that this Cause moveth above the world. Previously, Tablets in Persian were revealed; give him copies thereof. O Haydar-’Ali! This Wronged One hath had no purpose except the reformation of souls and the improvement of existence. This exalted word hath flowed from the Supreme Pen both before and after: the purpose of this Revelation is that the fire of hatred and animosity kindled in the hearts of the various peoples on account of religion might be quenched by the Kawthar of the All-Merciful’s utterance and the loving counsels of His chosen ones, and that every just and fair-minded one might arise to aid this Cause. Praise be to God, whatsoever hath been sent down from the divine realm of utterance hath been and is conducive to the tranquility of the world. Every person of insight beareth witness and every informed one testifieth. We beseech God to aid him in that which is befitting. Should they observe the revealed Surahs, they would arise to the extent possible to assist the Wronged One.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! To every fair-minded one, the arising of this Wronged One alone against kings and subjects is a manifest proof and a decisive evidence. The might of the world hath not prevented Him, and the clamor of the nations hath not held Him back from His purpose. We have openly proclaimed to the princes, divines and religious leaders of the earth, without any concealment or veil, that which causeth the limbs of the idolaters to quake and the hearts of the fair-minded to be illumined and radiant. All witness and testify that this Wronged One hath not been of the people of learning, nor hath He associated with them. Blessed is the servant who pondereth on that which hath been revealed from My Supreme Pen and who showeth fairness in this manifest Cause and mighty Message. It behooveth thee to beseech God, thy Lord and the Lord of the exalted Throne, to preserve him and assist him to aid this wronged and lonely One.</p>
<p>O Ha before Ya! We have heard thy mention at the Source. Remind him through this clear Remembrance. He should not grieve over anything, for he hath attained to that which most of the peoples of the world have been deprived of. To this beareth witness the Lord of Eternity. He is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Praise be to God that they have ascended the ladder of love and attained unto the splendors of the Daystar of certitude. We beseech God to ordain for him that which shall profit him in all the worlds of His worlds and to assist him in that which shall draw him nearer at all times. O Ali! Grieve not over anything that hath befallen thee. He hath, as a token of His grace, purified thee and hath ordained for thee, through His Most Exalted Pen, that which no thing can equal. Be thou thankful and of those who render praise.</p>
<p>We make mention of Ghayn that he may rejoice in Our remembrance of him. We beseech God to change his sorrow into gladness and to ordain for him the good of this world and of the world to come. He is, verily, the Lord of all mankind and the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about this Wronged One and the Book of Certitude - should one obtain its authentic text, it would render him independent of any mention of the Resurrection and its signs, and of the Hour and its tokens. That is, one would comprehend the purpose of the Prophets in their revealed utterances and attain unto the light of the Daystar of Purpose. Blessed is he who gazeth thereon with the eye of fairness and heareth what hath been revealed therein with the ear of justice.</p>
<p>We have desired to make mention of him whom thou didst mention, who is noble in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech God to assist him in that which is meet and to grant him strength that he may lead the heedless unto the court of understanding and guide the oppressors to the light of the Daystar of justice and equity. Perchance the world may be reformed and the peoples may attain unto true tranquility. He hath ever been and shall ever remain remembered. My loving-kindness and My mercy have preceded him, and My grace, the Mighty, the Sublime, hath preceded him.</p>
<p>The other letter which thou didst send in the name of Jud, upon him be My glory, hath been honored with Our gracious acceptance. We beseech God to aid thee and to make thee successful in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Praise be to God, thou hast been and art remembered in His presence, and thou hast become the possessor of the Word of contentment, which is more precious than all the treasures of the world. This bounty hath no peer or likeness. Say: Praise be to Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world, and glory be to Thee, O Thou the Beloved of those who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst mention regarding the letter Sin and Ya - may God make him successful - the glances of Our loving-kindness have ever been directed towards him. He ordaineth whatsoever He deemeth expedient. He may say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! I have committed my affairs unto Thee and have placed my trust in Thee. Ordain for me that which will render me mighty through Thy might and steadfast in Thy service. Then write down for me that which shall profit me in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, I know not what profiteth me in Thy sight. The knowledge of all things is with Thee, and Thou art, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.”</p>
<p>Would that all the world might attain unto this remembrance and hold fast unto it. Verily, it would deliver them and preserve them. He is, in truth, the Preserver, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. They must be joyous at all times, inasmuch as they have attained unto His presence and have been enabled to hearken.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the oppressed members of that household; they have ever been and continue to be remembered. Every good thing hath been ordained for them in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>His honor Sad, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, standeth before the Wronged One. We beseech God to adorn him with the ornament of steadfastness and enable him to achieve that which will cause the Word to be exalted and the Cause to be uplifted. In these days a Tablet was specifically revealed for him from the heaven of grace and sent to Iraq, that he might hold fast unto it and be of the thankful ones. The glory be upon him and upon his mother from whom We have inhaled the fragrance of the love of God, and upon his brother and sister, and upon those who love them for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Under all conditions thou must be vigilant regarding their circumstances. The command is in God’s hands; He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst mention about Ba, upon him be My glory, it hath attained to the honor of being heard. Blessed is he and blessed are they who have spoken the truth and established His Cause through clear proof and evidence and through all that hath been sent down from His presence. We testify that they have drunk the choice wine of steadfastness from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the All-Loving, the All-Forgiving. Remember on My behalf him who was named Ali before Haydar, and convey to him My greetings and give him the glad tidings of My attention to him and My remembrance of him. He hath arisen to serve the Cause with spirit and fragrance and hath done that which he was commanded by the Ordainer, the All-Wise. The glory be upon him and upon My loved ones in Ta whose names We have concealed out of wisdom from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Once again We make mention of his honor Sin and Ya. Convey to him greetings and salutations from the Wronged One. Say: God is witness and the All-Knowing doth testify that the people of God have ever been faithful to their covenant and have held fast unto it. His honor too must exert his utmost endeavor in aiding the oppressed ones of the world. Most of the people of the world are deprived of the lights of the Day-Star of faithfulness, but this party hath remained firm and steadfast in what they have declared. We beseech the Almighty to assist thee in that which is meet. Verily He is the Helper, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>And We make mention of Mim and Qaf who appeared before My countenance and heard My call and attained unto that which was recorded in the tablets of God, both before and after. We beseech God to enable him to preserve what He hath bestowed upon him. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Give him the glad tidings of My remembrance and illumine him with the lights of the Day-Star of My utterance, that the call may draw him to a station wherein the happenings of the world will not change him nor will the whispers of the nations who have denied that which hath been sent down from the presence of an ancient Revealer cause him grief.</p>
<p>O Ali! Remember on My behalf Ayn and Ta. He hath attained unto the mention of My Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book which none hath comprehended save God, the Revealer of verses and the Manifestor of His firm and wise command. We beseech God to exalt his station among His servants and to open before his face the doors of His loving-kindness and enable him to preserve this mighty and gracious station. The glory that shineth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon them both and upon those whose names thou hast mentioned and upon all who are steadfast, firm and faithful.</p>
<p>O Haydar-i-Qabli-’Ali! His honor Andalib, upon him be Baha, has, according to what is known, turned his face towards the land of Ya. His sojourn in that land is also good. We beseech God that through him He may open the doors of hearts and minds, and that through him may be manifested that which will draw the servants nigh unto the Lord of Creation.</p>

Yet when the Sun of Truth shone forth from the Dayspring of “God was, and there was nothing besides Him,” all arose in rejection and protest, nay rather, they arose to extinguish that Most Great Light. Such is the station of the servants. How many are the divines who today are honored by His name and Word, yet remain heedless of Him. Consider the Wolf of the Land of Sad, who deemed himself the promoter of the Law of the Messenger, yet martyred the sons of the Virgin with utmost tyranny and oppression. And the Snake who considered himself a descendant of the Prophet’s lineage killed the Lord of Lords without recognizing Him. Would that people knew and understood! From time immemorial unto this day, there has befallen the loved ones of God at the hands of the manifestations of oppression and tyranny that which the pen is powerless to recount. Praise be to God that that leaf attained unto that which the sincere men and women and the devoted men and women attained in former times. Verily He was with you in all conditions, witnessing and beholding what befell you in His path. He is, verily, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. The Glory be upon you and upon those women who have believed in the One, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>O Haqvirdi, upon him be the Glory of God! In the name of the All-Knowing Lord! Throughout past ages and centuries, the people of Iran, both clergy and others, according to their own claims, held fast to truth, spoke of truth, and walked in the path of truth. Yet when the light of the Most Great Luminary shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the Ancient Lord’s will, they committed such acts as no oppressor had ever committed since the beginning of creation. They issued death sentences against One Whom they had remembered day and night. I swear by the Sun of Truth which shineth from the horizon of the prison’s heaven that all religious groups have sought and continue to seek refuge in God from the deeds of those heedless souls. Now again the deniers of the Bayan are engaged in the same pursuits. Beseech God to protect all, that they may perhaps engage in the remembrance of the Beloved of the worlds with joy and fragrance, and attain to the light of true unity. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken, and the Tongue of Grandeur uttered in this glorious and wondrous station. The world hath been laid waste by vain imaginings. Glory be to God! Despite all they have seen and heard, they again associate with the barking ones. What do they intend to perceive and what do they wish to understand? We beseech God to assist His loved ones with the means of the heavens and earth, and protect them from the evil of every remote oppressor and every stubborn barking one.</p>

O servant! Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for having been nourished by the fruits of the Tree of Knowledge from this Paradise, which hath been established at the axis of contingent being by the command of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, as a manifest truth. Purify thyself from every allusion, that thou mayest be enabled to soar in the atmosphere of holiness and glory, and witness the Sun of thy Lord’s remembrance at its noontide zenith with a sovereignty that hath encompassed all the worlds. By God! Whoso harboureth in his heart even less than a mote of remembrance of aught else beside Me shall never be able to soar in this atmosphere wherein the breaths of God have been sent forth as a manifest truth. Thus have We imparted unto thee the word of truth, that it may detach thee from all things and bring thee unto a station wherein thou shalt witness all created things beneath the shadow of thy Lord’s name, and remain steadfast in the Cause. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon them that have taken refuge in a mighty stronghold.</p>

At times thou beholdest Him in the form of fire - from its roaring thou hearest “There is none other God but Him” - and at other times in the form of light, illumining all who dwell on earth. Thus hath the Spirit spoken in this Tablet which hath been preserved before the Throne. And at times thou beholdest Him in human form - blessed be the All-Merciful Who hath sent Him in truth, for verily He hath power over all things. He hath other manifestations which, were We to mention them, would exhaust the ink, for verily He hath knowledge of all things. Ponder upon the Revelation of God and His sovereignty, and immerse thyself in the oceans of utterance, that thou mayest discover the pearls of knowledge and wisdom that draw thee to a station inscribed in the Book. Let not allusions grieve thee, nor follow thou those who have denied the sovereignty of the verses. Their efforts in this world have gone astray, and they shall find no path to the Cause. They walk in the wilderness of error and rejoice in what their base desires command them. By My life! They are in the depths of wrath and shall find none to help them. Remind the people of this announcement which hath been sent down in the Tablets. Say: O people! When ye hear the call of the Calf, leave it behind you. This is what God hath counseled you, for verily He is witness to all things. We have imparted unto thee that which quickeneth souls, and thy Lord sufficeth as a helper.</p>

Then would ye lament and weep. Say: O people! I am God’s trust among you, and His deposit within you, and His holy and beloved fragrances. Beware lest ye object to Him Who took from you the covenant of His own Self, Who appeared in truth with the name of Ali and descended from the heaven of mighty glory. By God! I moved not except by His command, even as He moved not except through My remembrance and praise, did ye but know. He is indeed the Beloved of My heart and My soul, and that which appeareth from Me beareth witness that there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. O My name! Recite thou the verses of God and turn not unto the world and its ornaments. Put thy trust in Him. Unto Him do all matters return. Upon every soul descendeth what hath been ordained for it - neither less nor more - except after His leave. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>

The mention of the Peerless Friend is in truth the breath of life for the bodies of the world and a fountain of living waters for all peoples. Yet the people have not accepted this most great gift from God, exalted be His glory, save for a few, as is evident. Thy letter was presented before the Wronged One and what was recorded therein the servant present mentioned. Praise be to God that time after time thou hast been blessed with mentioning the Wronged One and hast drunk from the ocean of bounty. It behooveth you to preserve this most exalted station through My Name, the Powerful, the Mighty. Thy letter was adorned with these words: “My wish and desire before the immortal Court is to sell both this world and the next for a drop from the Kawthar seas of the meaning of Thy love.” O Friend! Blessed art thou for having uttered words that caused the lips of thy Lord to smile. Give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Wise, the All-Knowing. The Most Exalted Pen beareth witness that this transaction shall yield boundless profit. God willing, in all conditions fix your gaze upon that which God hath willed and be detached and free from all else. From this station We send Our greetings upon Ali who attained aforetime to My mention and My bounty, and upon thy other brother Ali before Akbar, that they may rejoice in the bounty of their Lord, the All-Bountiful.

Beware lest the paths of the world hold you back from His straight path.

When thou hast drunk the choice wine of My utterance and heard My call from the words of My Book, say: My God, my God! I have forsaken the world out of love for meeting with Thee and for what lieth with Thee, and have cast aside what the peoples possess in hope of Thy grace, O Thou Who art the Lord of eternity and Who hast appeared through the Most Great Name.

<p>The Most Holy, Most Impregnable, Most Exalted. A remembrance from Us unto him who hath hearkened unto the Call and desired to attain unto a sublime station, that the fragrances of the remembrance of the Lord of Destiny, which have been wafted from the Most Great Scene, may attract him and cause him to arise to remember his Lord Who is imprisoned through tyranny. Arise with supreme steadfastness in thy Lord’s Cause, the Creator of heaven, then remind the people of this Cause which hath appeared from the horizon of glory. Beware lest vain imaginings disturb thee. Leave the people and what they possess. Take what hath been given thee from the presence of Him Who causeth the dawn to break. Thus hath the matter been decreed and the command hath come from the Sovereign Who encompasseth all worlds. Verily he who hesitates in this Cause hath not attained unto maturity and is recorded in the Mother Book as a suckling babe, feeding on the milk of heedlessness from the breast of vain imaginings. He is indeed veiled by a veil which is great in the sight of the Truth. Cast aside doubts and hold fast unto the cord of certitude. Thus doth the Ancient One command thee with a tongue wondrous in truth. Those who deny on this Day are assuredly the people of the fire, and thy Lord is witness unto what I say. Those who cast away vain desire and follow guidance - these are the people of the Ridvan, and their names are inscribed by the Pen of God upon the Tablet. Blessed is the man who hath arisen to remember his Lord, detached from those who are confined within the boundaries of the earth. Glorify thou thy Lord with praise, then give thanks unto Him for this Tablet which hath shone forth from a horizon illumined by the light of His countenance.</p>

I, Who am established upon the Throne of Utterance, make mention from Our presence of him who hath heard and responded, that the fragrances of remembrance may attract him to a station wherein nothing whatsoever shall prevent him from God, the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, and that he may arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as the might of those who have turned away from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, shall not deter. A letter containing mention of thee was presented before the Wronged One. We have remembered thee with this wondrous remembrance. Blessed is he who hath inhaled and discovered the fragrance of his Lord’s utterance, the All-Merciful, and blessed is he whose ear hath attained to the hearing of His most sweet call. He is indeed the most exalted among creation before the Truth, as doth testify this faithful Speaker. Glorify thy Lord with praise at eventide and at dawn, and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the Day of Meeting, for having strengthened me and shown me Thy path and guided me to Thy most exalted horizon and made known to me Thy Most Great Cause and Thy mighty Message. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of what lieth with Thee. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful. Moreover I beseech Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, by Thy grace to ordain for me the reward of attaining Thy presence.

Beware lest veils prevent you from the Source of divine verses, or the might of those who have violated God’s Covenant and Testament and are among the most lost deter you. By God’s life! We have come for the reformation of the world, yet the peoples have risen in opposition in such wise that they have shed blood and plundered what belonged to My loved ones without any clear proof or perspicuous Book. Therefore have the inmates of the pavilion of sanctity wept, and the eyes of those near to God have shed tears. A letter mentioning thee hath come before the Wronged One. We have remembered thee with that which hath caused the hearts of the sincere to soar. Give thanks unto God for this supreme bounty. Verily He remembereth whom He willeth and aideth whom He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the Powerful. We make mention of God’s loved ones in the cities and regions and counsel them to remain steadfast in this mighty, irrevocable Cause.

Thy Lord is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Blessed is the strong one whom the hosts of earth could not weaken, and blessed is the one who hath turned toward God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

I am the Hearing, the Answering One.</p>
<p>We have found in thy letter the fragrance of thy turning unto Him, when most of the people have turned away from the Most Exalted Horizon, save those whom the hand of God’s will, the Lord of all worlds, hath delivered. O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! Hear the call once again: “There is none other God but I, the One, the All-Informed.” Thou hast stood firm in acknowledging the Manifestation and spoken the praise of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Thou hast summoned kings and subjects, divines and princes to the Most Exalted Horizon with an authority that the hosts of the earth and the ranks of kings and sovereigns could not prevent.</p>
<p>When the Sun of Manifestation shone forth from the horizons of all lands, the people of the Bayan rose in such opposition as nearly rent the heavens asunder and caused the hearts of the Messengers to melt. Thus did their souls deceive them in a matter, and today they are among those who cry out against the Book of God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. Give thanks unto God for His grace and bounty, and for what He hath sent down unto thee that shall never be exhausted nor altered throughout the eternity of His most excellent names and supreme attributes. I am the All-Knowing Expositor.</p>
<p>We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid thee and assist thee in that which shall cause the fragrance of sanctity to be diffused. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken, while the Wronged One was beneath the talons of hatred by reason of what the hands of the oppressors had wrought. And thus did the Most High Ocean manifest its waves and the Light its radiance. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto every heedless and remote one.</p>

Bear witness within thyself to that whereunto God hath testified concerning His own Self, by His own Self, ere mention was made of any remembrance or names were ordained through the form of a wondrous Temple - that there is none other God but Him, and that the Tree of the Bayan is the first Tree wherein appeared the Fire and spoke forth: “Verily, I am God, the Lord of all worlds,” and verily He is the Sovereign of the Messengers, and the mention of Adam and clay was not. Thus do We cast upon thee of the verses of God, the King, the Mighty, the Generous, that thy soul may find assurance thereby, such that thy feet shall never slip on account of any Baal or ass. Say: By God! Verily Baal shall arise by himself, and the Samaritan shall appear in magnificent form, and the calf shall cry out from every nearby quarter. Therefore, O loved ones of God, be steadfast in the Cause and turn not unto them, and be not among the abased ones.

The proof hath come, and He Who revealeth the utterance hath appeared with a manifest sovereignty. Follow not your desires - burn them with the fire of the remembrance of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: Do ye sport with God’s sovereignty and His Cause? Turn your eyes that ye may behold your Lord dawning from the horizon of might with a sovereignty that hath encompassed the worlds. Hearken, O My loved ones, unto the melody of grandeur, then drink ye of the water of everlasting life. We have forbidden the people of hatred from this crimson cup from the hand of the All-Glorious Cup-bearer. Thus hath the matter been decreed by your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>

Glorified is He Who hath shed His splendor upon all created things through His Name that He hath made the Sovereign of Names when He established Himself upon the throne with manifest sovereignty. They who have quaffed the wine of reunion from the hand of bounty, these are numbered among the sincere ones. And whosoever hath lingered by the pond, turning away from the Most Great Ocean, is accounted among the abased. Say: Have not the verses been sent down, and have not the evidences shone forth, and hath not the proof been perfected, and hath not the Resurrection come to pass? By My life! That which ye were promised in the Tablets hath been fulfilled, while ye remain behind veils, and be not of them that know. He that was far off hath entered the Realm of Glory, while he that thought himself near hath been kept back. Thus hath God made your high ones low and your low ones high. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. Say: The Ancient Beauty hath appeared with His Most Great Name, and yet ye remain veiled. Come ye forth from the habitations of heedlessness and blindness, turning unto God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Eternity. This is better for you, if ye be of them that perceive. Cast aside idle sayings - this is the Day of deeds. Hold fast unto that which ye are commanded by One mighty and great. O thou who hast turned to God! Give thanks unto thy Lord for having turned unto thee when He was in the hands of the idolaters, and for having called thee through His grace and revealed unto thee clear verses that thou mayest be among the triumphant. When thou hast attained unto them, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Beloved of the worlds!</p>

Sorrows have encompassed Us from all directions through what hath befallen My friends at the hands of those who have broken My Covenant, denied My right, and cast behind them what was sent down unto them from My forbidden Kingdom. O My loved ones in My realms! Be not grieved at what hath befallen you in My path. Soon shall annihilation overtake all who dwell in the kingdom of creation, and ye shall find yourselves seated in the seat of truth with God, the Lord of the invisible and the visible. By God! I created the world for your sake, and the next world rejoiceth at your presence, did ye but know. Beware lest ye be frightened by the might of the divines through whose command the rulers have risen against you and perpetrated that which hath caused the Spirit to lament in the luminous Spot and the near ones to cry out. Preserve your stations through patience and tranquility. Thus doth My Most Exalted Pen command you from this praiseworthy station. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto every heedless one who is veiled. Thus have We sent down the verses and expounded them in truth, and verily I am the Powerful over what I will, and I am the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We have sent them unto thee that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Lord of existence.

When We encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth, We found thee in a cleft of the Cause. Therefore have We made mention of thee in truth, that the remembrance of thy Lord might draw thee to a praiseworthy station, that thou mightest inhale from the Holy Tablet the fragrance of intimacy, that thou mightest turn with thy whole being unto God and arise to aid this Wronged One Who hath been imprisoned in this land for the sake of God, and before Whose face the doors of ingress and egress have been sealed.</p>
<p>Hearken unto My words, then cast away all that is in the contingent world and take what hath come to thee from thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Arise and say: O people of the Bayan! By God, the Quickener of all creation hath come! Detach yourselves from all who are on earth, then turn unto God, the King, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. If thou aidest Him on earth, He will assuredly aid thee in His Kingdom and will send down upon thee hosts from the manifestations of power and might, and will assist thee thereby. There is none other God but He, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Loving.</p>

Have ye clung to aught else besides Him after ye were commanded not to cling to any but Him at the time of His appearance? Have ye disbelieved while ye yourselves bear witness? Fear God, O people! This indeed is He through Whom the Tablets of God were sent down in every age, and that which was revealed in the Bayan testifieth to His own Self. Beware lest ye deny Him.</p>
<p>Stand firm in the Cause, then kindle the fire of oneness in the hearts of all creatures that it may purify them from the defilement of idle fancy and draw them nigh unto God, the Lord of the former and latter generations. Beware lest thou be halted by the cawing of them that are polytheists. Take the rod by Our strength, then cleave asunder therewith the sea of vain imaginings, that perchance the people may turn their faces toward the holy precincts. Array the hearts in the name of the Beloved, that the effulgences of the Sun from this manifest horizon may be imprinted thereon.</p>

Say: He informed Me of your turning away from the direction of God and of that which would befall His Beloved, but ye have forgotten what was revealed by Him, and have broken His Covenant, and have disbelieved in Him through Whom was manifested that which was hidden.

Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee that thy heart may rejoice thereat and thou mayest be of them that have attained. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>My God, my God! I love to remember Thee at all times with every tongue, for this servant has found nothing sweeter in the world than Thy remembrance, nor loftier than Thy praise among the nations. I beseech Thee, O Creator of earth and heaven and Cleaver of the dawn, by Thy power that overshadows all things, and by Thy command whereby Thou hast subdued all in the kingdom of creation, to assist Thy loved ones to remember and praise Thee in such wise that neither the oppressors nor the tyrannical shall prevent them. O Lord! Thou seest and knowest that they have believed in Thee and in Thy signs, and they are surrounded by the wolves of Thy earth. I beseech Thee by Thy name the Preserver, and by Thy name the Helper, and by Thy name the Triumphant, to protect them from the oppression of every remote oppressor and every obstinate transgressor.

Thus doth He bestow His bounty upon whomsoever He willeth of His servants, and forgive their misdeeds, and cause them to enter the paradise of nearness, and nourish them with the fruits of paradise. Therefore give thanks unto God for having strengthened thee through His Cause and admitted thee into the Egypt of certitude and brought thee out of darkness into light in days wherein the pillars of the sincere ones were shaken.

Thus doth the Lord of Names make mention, that every discerning believer may become aware thereof. By God! He hath done what none among those who disbelieved in God in bygone ages had done. Thus hath the matter been decreed in a perspicuous Book. We beseech God to assist His servants to remain steadfast in this Cause whereby the feet of the learned have slipped and the hearts of the mystics have been perturbed. We make mention of thee as a token of grace from Us and a mercy from Our presence, that thou mayest rejoice and render thanks unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Glory be upon thee and upon him who hath placed his trust in God, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>

From this station do We send Our greetings unto thy face and unto the faces of them from whom the lights have shone forth through their love of God, the Lord of all worlds. How many a servant who laid claim to knowledge and wisdom was hindered when the All-Merciful appeared, and how many an unlearned one drank from the ocean of knowledge through My Name, the All-Subduing over all who are in the heavens and on earth. God willing, may steadfast and firm souls find rest beneath the shade of the divine Unity, and be illumined by the light of His countenance. This is the Day whereon all atoms proclaim “The Kingdom is God’s!” They who have quaffed the Kawthar of immortality must speak forth the remembrance of God, the Lord of all names, in such wise as to cause the seated to arise and the heedless to turn unto Him. Know ye the value of these days. These are the very days whose mention hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in most of the divine Books. Blessed is the heart that hath recognized and drunk and attained, and woe unto them that deny! From this remote station do We send Our greetings unto the faces of them that have believed, and make mention unto them of that which is better for them than all the treasures of earth. He, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. We counsel thee to manifest the Most Great Steadfastness and to observe that which God hath ordained in His wondrous Book. We beseech God to assist you and to ordain for you that which He hath ordained for His chosen ones. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Most Great.</p>

They have forsaken the Self-Subsisting and clung to vain imaginings, having followed the promptings of the Evil Ones who turn people away from this Most Great Ocean while supposing themselves to be guided aright. Say: By God! Ye have turned away from guidance and turned to desire - this is what the Lord of Names doth testify, seated upon His mighty throne. Say: O people of vain imaginings! Shatter the idols of your selves, then turn towards the most exalted horizon, the station from which every wise command hath appeared. Fear God and spread not corruption in the land after its reformation. Answer Him Who calleth you to the All-Informed One. He accepted affliction for your salvation, yet you turned away from Him. What aileth you, O heedless ones! O servant! Arise to assist thy Lord, then aid Him through a wondrous remembrance.

Whosoever hath caused to flow from his pen a single verse from among the verses of his Lord - God hath ordained for him the reward of one who hath circled round His presence and been honored to attain His meeting. He is assuredly among the triumphant ones. Were We to expound what We possess and reveal that which is hidden, they that are in the heavens and on earth would fall thunderstruck. Arise to serve the Cause in My Name and place thy trust in God in all thine affairs. He is the Protector of whosoever hath turned towards Him, and He is indeed nigh unto them that do good. Write down the verses of thy Lord and recite them, that they may draw thee to My Kingdom and thou mayest witness that which hath been forbidden to the eyes of them that have been heedless of this wise Remembrance. Be thou of such constancy that tribulation shall not deter thee from making mention of Me, even as the kings and rulers united against Us failed to deter Us. By God!

<p>A Book sent down by the All-Merciful to her who hath heard and responded and hath attained unto the days of her Lord, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. O leaf! Hearken with the ear of thy soul to the call of the King of Oneness. I swear by the life of the Beloved that should anyone partake of this cup–that is, should they attain unto the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful–they would, throughout all their days and nights, remain occupied with the remembrance of the Peerless Friend. This is the Day whose mention hath been from time immemorial and will endure forever, and all the peoples of the world were promised its coming. Yet when the lights of the divine Dayspring appeared, all turned away and followed that which Satan commanded them, save those souls who were detached and free from all else but God. These are they whose mention hath been recorded in the divine Books, both past and future. Blessed are they and joy be unto them! God willing, that leaf shall at all times hold fast unto the Divine Lote-Tree in such wise that diverse winds shall not cause her to fall. This is the counsel of the Beloved of the world unto thee and the other handmaidens. At all times praise thou the Beloved of all possibility, for He hath enabled thee to attain unto that whereof the divines of the earth remain veiled. Verily thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. The glory be upon thee and upon My handmaidens in that place, from One loving and bountiful.</p>

<p>He is the One manifest from the horizon of utterance. This is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down unto a leaf from among the leaves of the Lote-Tree of utterance, that it might draw her unto a station wherein she shall behold in the world naught save the radiance of the lights of My Most Great Name - the Name at whose appearance the idols have wailed and every ignorant one remote from God hath been sorely troubled.</p>
<p>O My leaf! Hearken thou unto My call. Verily, there is no God but Him, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Cast away what is with the people and take what hath come unto thee from God, the Bestower, the Bountiful. Indeed, there hath been sent down unto thee each year a Book that all the treasures of the earth cannot equal. To this beareth witness He Who is established upon the throne of His Great Name.</p>
<p>Hold thou fast unto the cord of thy Lord’s tender mercy, then speak forth that which the Most Great Spirit teacheth thee from this noble station.</p>
<p>O my God, my Beloved, and He Who is mentioned in my heart! I beseech Thee by the Name which Thou hast made a lamp unto Thy servants, a herald unto those near unto Thee, and a sun in the heaven of Thy knowledge, that Thou aid me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all beings and the Dayspring from the Most Exalted Horizon. Thou givest and withholdest. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O my Lord! Disappoint me not of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, and withhold not from me that which Thou hast desired for Thy handmaidens who have voiced Thy mention and praise and who have circled round Thy mighty throne. The glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who are with thee, from God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-’Ali! In the name of Him Who hath been wronged in the prison of the heedless. This is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down from the Kingdom of Utterance unto him who hath believed in God, the Lord of all worlds. Should anyone ask thee of My dwelling-place, say: By God, it is in the Most Exalted Paradise - to this doth testify He with Whom is the perspicuous Book. And should anyone ask thee of My station, say: In the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Great. Should a heedless one object to thee, saying: “At one time He mentioneth His station in the prison, and at another in the Most Exalted Paradise - tell me truthfully which of these is more accurate,” say: All that floweth from His Most Exalted Pen is truth from God, the Goal of all who know. Say: God hath changed the prison into the Most Exalted Horizon and hath named it with all names. He, verily, is the Ruler over what He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the One, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. O Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali! Husayn hath mentioned thee before this Servant Who standeth before My face, and He hath revealed for thee this perspicuous Book. Take hold of it through the power of thy Lord, then do what behooveth this mighty Cause and say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of all worlds and Goal of them that know. It behooveth My servants there who have quaffed the wine of Mine utterance and attained unto the fragrance of My wondrous knowledge to read this Tablet. Upon them rest My prayers and My mercy and My loving-kindness, and I am verily the All-Merciful, the All-Bountiful.

<p>A Book sent down by the All-Merciful from the Kingdom of Utterance, calling the servants unto God, the Mighty, the Powerful. O peoples of the earth! By God, the Promise hath come, and He Who was promised calleth unto you from His most exalted horizon and giveth you glad tidings of that which hath dawned and shone forth from the horizon of the will of your Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The verses have been sent down and the clear proofs have appeared, yet most of the people remain heedless. They have cast certitude behind their backs, turning to the dayspring of vain imaginings. Thus have their souls enticed them, and they are this day accounted among the most grievous losers in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. This is a Day wherein the Concourse on High circle round the Throne of God, the Lord of all beings and the Master of the Hereafter and of the former times, yet most of the people are in manifest error. Blessed is he who hath attained unto My days, and the eye that hath beheld My tokens, and the ear that hath heard My call, and the tongue that hath spoken forth My wondrous remembrance. I give thanks unto God for having aided thee to turn towards Him at a time when the learned ones of the earth and its divines have turned away from His straight path. Thy name was mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. We have remembered thee with verses that surpass all that the people possess, as thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, doth testify. We make mention, too, of thy son as a bounty from Our presence, for We are verily the Kind, the Generous. We counsel thee and him to show forth the most great steadfastness and to observe that which hath been sent down in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Great. That which thou beholdest today shall perish, while the recompense of deeds shall endure with a guardian faithful. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

The Dove hath warbled upon the Divine Lote-Tree, while behind it the wolves do howl and the dogs do bark. Thus hath the matter been decreed in this forbidden Prison. We have remained steadfast in the Cause in such wise that neither the harm of the world nor the opposition of those who have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Loving, hath deterred Us. And at a time when We were immersed in an ocean of tribulation, We summoned all unto God, the Creator of the heavens, as do testify such servants as are endued with knowledge. We have seen thy letter and heard thy call, and have answered thee through this Tablet whereby every soul that hath turned to God, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved, hath been guided. Thou hast attained unto the mention of God and His favors in such measure as none can reckon save God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Blessed is he who hath gathered from this Divine Lote-Tree celestial fruits, sublime and wondrous. He is assuredly among those who have attained, as inscribed in a preserved Tablet.

<p>Whenever Thy musk-laden pen remembers Us, it earns the reward of freeing two hundred slaves. The dewdrops of musk that trickled from the ocean of ink onto the luminous tablet of the heart - when they appeared like the point of hidden knowledge upon the preserved page - were as the beauty spot on the Beloved’s cheek, becoming the mirror of mystic knowledge and the manifestation of divine beauty. How exalted and powerful, that He referred all letters to the Word, and the Word to the Point, and the Point to a speck of darkness, and made that darkness a Fisher, giving it dwelling on the shore of the sea of eternity! And how swift is this Fisher, who catches His prey before releasing the arrow - nay, in every instant brings a world of fishers into His net! With a single hair He has ensnared hundreds of thousands of necks, and with one glance from His eyelashes has wounded countless hearts. In a moment He has shattered the heart of creation, and in an instant has consigned all contingent beings to extinction. O my Beloved! This letter, whose very point merits such description and is worthy of such praise - how can this perishable frame prove equal to answering it or venture to make response? Unless Thou regard it with the eye of forgiveness and behold it with the glance of favor. And glory be upon those who are with Thee and who circle round about Thee.</p>

<p>The firm words which were adorned with the mention of the Lord of Lords were observed, and the fragrances of Paradise were inhaled therefrom. Blessed art thou! And all the hardships and tribulations thou hast borne in the path of God are remembered with Him. Blessed is thy pen by which the words of the Beloved were inscribed! Indeed, in these days most people have arisen to cause harm. That honored one must engage in service to the Cause with utmost joy and eagerness, and must act with perfect wisdom. Consider vigilance over the Cause from all directions to be essential, for even the polytheists of the Bayan will spread abroad whatever occurs. Now that the leader of that group has exchanged truth for money, you will hear the details. And the reason for your delay in that land during these days has become somewhat apparent, but be not grieved, and in all things be patient and thankful, for whatsoever appears today has been and will be for the good of the Cause. For each of the names mentioned in your Tablet and in the Tablet of Jinab-i-Mahdi, a sublime Tablet was sent specifically. Convey greetings to all the loved ones, and exert utmost effort in protecting and preserving the Cause that no harm may occur. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those with thee.</p>

<p>O Rida, upon thee be the Glory of God! In the name of the Goal of the world, the glances of divine favors have been and will be, God willing, directed to thee from the Dawning-Place of the verses of the Lord. It behooveth such souls as thyself to endeavor, through the power of God and the might and ascendancy of the eternal Sovereign, to rend asunder the veils of idle fancy and to lead men to the station where “Put out the lamp, for the morn hath appeared.” There is no doubt that the Truth is one and the path leading to Him is one. Consider how, after the ascension of the Countenance of Muhammad and the Beauty of Ahmad, the Islamic people are witnessed to be so divided and divergent. It is as though they have not drunk from the Kawthar of oneness and have remained deprived of the Salsabil of detachment. Know ye this much, that the cause of Islam’s weakness hath been its division. Many are the deluded souls who have become the cause of their own loss and the loss of other servants. Thou must, with the living waters that flow from the fountainhead of the Pen of the All-Merciful, wash away the idle fancies that have been imprinted upon the breasts and hearts of men, and summon all to the straight path and the mighty announcement that speaketh, so that all may speak with one name and walk upon one path. This is the most great triumph and the cause of salvation for the people of the world. God is sufficient as a witness.</p>

<p>Praise be to God, thou hast attained and turned thy face to the most exalted horizon. Today the world is illumined by the lights of the dawning of His manifestation and the divine call is raised from the Tree of Revelation. Blessed are they whom the ranks of doubts and idle fancies did not prevent from the Lord of all names - they sought the Most Great Ocean and drank therefrom. Today the rains of mercy are pouring down from the clouds of the heaven of bounty. Well is it with them that have attained, and woe unto the heedless! We beseech God that He may assist thee to recognize one blessed and supreme Word, for if thou attainest unto it, thou shalt attain unto all good and remain steadfast in the Cause of God, in such wise that the calumnies and doubts of the people of the Bayan and the Furqan shall not prevent or deprive thee from the dawning-place of verses and the source of clear proofs. And that Word is “He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.” Though the meaning of this blessed Word is outwardly clear and evident, yet concealed within it are mighty hosts of meanings, and these hosts will protect man from the promptings of Satan and the whisperings of the polytheists. Much reflection is needed that thou mayest attain to thy goal and drink from the Kawthar that lies hidden in this blessed Word. The splendor of God be upon the people of Baha from God, the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds to come and of the first.</p>

Verily praise from the people of praise is beloved before the Lord, and remembrance from the people of remembrance beseemeth this wondrous Face.

Blessed is he who hath recognized the Purpose and set out upon the path of God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, and hath drunk the choice wine of reunion from the utterance of his Lord, the Most Exalted, and was among the steadfast ones. By My life! The greatest of stations is steadfastness in My Cause. Blessed are they that act! Be thou gladdened by My Tablet, then rest assured in thy Lord’s grace and grieve not for those who have turned aside and wander distracted. Be thou a helper of My Cause, a servant of My Self, and one who maketh mention of My praise. Thus doth the Tongue of Eternity command thee as a bounty from Him upon thee.

<p>O Son of Vahid, Ahmad, upon him be the Glory of God. In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious. This is a Book from Us to him whom God hath caused to grow from blessed and goodly soil. This, verily, is a great bounty. It behooveth thee to let thy tongue make mention of thy Lord, thine eyes be directed toward the court of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, thy hands be raised unto God, the Creator of all worlds, and thy fingers point to all peoples. By God, the Truth! O people, the veils of fancy have been rent asunder and the Ever-Abiding hath come with mighty sovereignty. Do ye follow vain imaginings after the Sovereign of certitude hath appeared from the horizon of the will of your Lord, the Most High, the Most Great? Or do ye cleave to idle fancies when this is your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing? Fear God, O people, and follow not those who have denied the Dawning-Place of the Cause but for Whom no revelation would have been sent down from time immemorial. Thus doth the Tongue of Grandeur speak forth from the pavilion of glory, yet the people are wrapped in a thick veil. Rend asunder the veils through My Name, then draw strength from the power of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Say: Verily, He calleth you unto God from His prison in such wise that His tribulations have not hindered Him from making mention of the Lord of Names. Turn ye unto Him and be not of the losers. Grieve thou not over anything. Soon shalt thou behold that which hath been ordained for thee. Thy Lord is with thee under all conditions. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And glory be upon thee and upon those who have stood firm in the Cause of their Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>

This is a Book from Us to him who was stirred by the call of his Lord and perceived the fragrance of the Garment after most of the servants had debarred themselves therefrom. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the recognition of thy Lord, cast away what thou didst possess, and taken what came to thee from the Lord of all creation. Thy name hath been mentioned before the Throne, and there have been sent down unto thee clear verses from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Detach thyself from the world and whatsoever is therein, then turn wholly unto God, the Lord of creation. Say: O people! How long will ye slumber? The heaven hath been cleft asunder and the Lord of the Day of Mutual Calling hath come. How long will ye flee to the right and to the left? Do ye not see that the mountains pass away like clouds? Say: O people! Fear God and follow not every doubting idolator. Arise from the slumber of heedlessness and passion, then turn your gaze toward your Most Glorious Lord. He calleth you unto God, your Lord, the All-Merciful. Beware lest ye follow the factions who have united in tyranny and denied the proof of the All-Merciful. By My life, this is indeed a wondrous thing! Recite the verses of thy Lord, then preserve them and shun those who have denied the Lord of lords. Let not the deeds of the wrongdoers grieve thee. God shall soon seize them with His might. Verily He is severe in punishment. And the glory be upon thee and upon whoso hath cast the world behind him and believed in God, the Mighty, the Most Exalted.</p>

<p>This is a Book from Us to him who hath believed in God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Walk thou in none other path save My path, turn thy face to none other face save My face, utter naught save My praise, speak of naught save My remembrance, move not save by My leave, and gaze at none other save the wondrous rays of My luminous and beloved countenance. Be thou detached from the world. Walk thou in My footsteps. Thus do We command thee, if thou art of those who understand. Avoid whatsoever God, thy Lord, abhorreth. Strive within thyself that there may appear from thee goodly deeds and pure effects, that through thy deeds thou mayest attract the hearts of those who are heedless of the remembrance of their Lord. This is true counsel, did ye but know. Say: O people! Nothing ascendeth unto God save pure words and goodly deeds, and He loveth those who are detached. Aid ye God through your deeds, and be not of those who are veiled. Adorn your tongues with truthfulness, your temples with the ornament of trustworthiness, and your hearts with the remembrance of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. He from whom appear goodly deeds - God will praise him by His own Self, for through him are raised the standards of His Cause amongst His servants. Thus doth God counsel you in a preserved and mighty Tablet. Grieve not over anything. Rather, rejoice in thy love for thy Lord. Then seek His help in all matters. And the glory be upon thee and upon thy family and upon every praiseworthy believer.</p>

When thou hast quaffed the choice wine of My utterance from the cup of My bounty and hast attained unto My verses, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me unto the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Manifestation of Thy Self, and thanksgiving be unto Thee for having remembered me in Thy prison. I beseech Thee by the Point through which the Books and Scriptures were differentiated, to make me detached from all else save Thee and to hold fast unto Thy cord. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, and I desire from the heaven of Thy generosity and the sea of Thy grace that Thou assist me in that which beseemeth Thy days. O my Lord! Thou beholdest the poor one standing before the gate of Thy bounty; I beseech Thee by Thy grace and generosity not to disappoint him. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest.

<p>In His Name Who abideth after the passing of all things! This is the Day wherein the veils have been rent asunder, the verses sent down, and every destined matter made distinct. Therein hath the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimed betwixt earth and heaven: “Verily, there is none other God but Me, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.” He who hath been drawn by hearing the utterance of his Lord, the All-Merciful - he is of the people of Baha, inscribed in a preserved Tablet. And whoso turneth away, no mention hath he with his Lord. Thus hath the matter been decreed from the presence of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: O people! We have lit, by the hand of grace, the lamp of guidance for all in creation. Beware lest ye extinguish it through the gusts of the winds of denial. Seize ye the Day and follow not every rejected idolater. Turn with illumined hearts toward the court of your Lord, the Lord of Names. This is the foundation of all good, would ye but know it. Verily, he who preventeth you this Day from the path of God - he is indeed Satan. Thus doth He instruct you, in Whose grasp is the reins of all knowledge. When the clamor of the wicked and the croaking of the impious are raised, pay no heed, but hold fast unto God, your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Loving. Verily in the surging of the Most Great Sea in the Most Great Prison, and the wafting of the fragrance of the Robe amongst the people of creation, are signs from God - yet most of the people know not. Thus hath spoken He Who hath caused all things to speak His praise and glorification. He, verily, is the All-Powerful over what He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.</p>

<p>O Husayn! He is God! This is the Paradise of eternity - We have opened its gates unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. Hasten thereunto, O ye who are sincere, and turn not back upon your heels. Put your trust in God, then advance toward it if ye walk in God’s guidance. This is a City which God hath manifested through His power. Say: Journey therein if ye gaze upon the countenance of God. Say: O people of earth, aid God, your Lord, with the swords of your hearts, with whatsoever power ye possess in the kingdom. Say: This is one of God’s signs which We have made a token of My servitude unto Him, if ye behold with the eye of the spirit. Say: I have no authority save by God’s leave, and this is of His leave which hath been sent down in truth, though the people lie dead in the beds of their vain desires. Say: Enter ye the Most Great House of God and remember Him in spirit as ye fall prostrate upon your faces. Fear ye nothing - open your eyes and follow not those who have taken their vain imaginings for their god and who cleave fast unto them. Bear ye witness to the truth with justice, then gaze upon the countenance of Beauty if ye run in the valley of love. Say: Seek ye forgiveness for what ye have thought concerning Him Who was among you but as one like yourselves. Though ye traverse the earth, ye shall find none like unto Him - and God is witness to this. This is a proof of truth, if ye but understand.</p>

<p>He, verily, hath come from the heaven of utterance with a clear proof and hath summoned all to the supreme horizon. Blessed are they who are endued with true understanding, who have cast away transgression and wickedness and have held fast to righteousness and the fear of God. These are they who possess insight in this age and are numbered by God, the Lord of all worlds, among the people of the Greatest Vision. The Trusted One made mention of thee, whereupon We make mention of thee and bid thee to that which will exalt thy station in this glorious and luminous station. We have adorned the heaven of utterance with the stars of proof and have sent down therefrom that which delighteth the eyes of them that are nigh unto God, who have taken hold of the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him and have clung to His firm and mighty Command. Say: O concourse of the Torah! The Friend hath appeared and the Interlocutor hath come, both giving glad tidings of that which hath appeared and shone forth from the horizon of God’s Will, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Cast away what ye have heard from the manifestations of idle fancies. The gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of Names hath come with His Revelation. None denieth this save they who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. Let not the turning away of them that have turned aside grieve thee, nor the doubts of the doubtful hinder thee. Take hold of My Book with My strength, in spite of them that have cast the Command of God behind their backs - these, verily, are among the idolaters.

Verily they are the Kawthar of life unto the people of knowledge and the Choice Sealed Wine unto those who have turned unto the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.

Beware lest the waters of rejection hold you back from the ocean or the doubts of the deniers bar you from the gate.

Thou art he whom neither the opposition of the ignorant nor the clamor of every heedless and remote one could deter. Thus have We made mention of thy father, and I am the All-Knowing Remembrancer. O My handmaiden! We have read thy letter and have revealed for thee that whereby the hearts of them that are endued with understanding are attracted. Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and upon every handmaiden who hath attained in this grievous age.</p>

<p>O My handmaiden! Know that We have sent forth loving-kindness upon the form of this Tablet and dispatched it unto thee that thou mayest glory therein amongst the worlds. We visited thy house at a time when thou wast heedless of it, and We found not therein the sweet fragrance of holiness. Thus doth the All-Informed apprise thee. Cleanse your houses, O people, and wash your garments of whatsoever is abhorrent unto God. Thus doth the All-Knowing counsel you. We love refinement in all conditions. Beware lest ye transgress that whereunto ye have been bidden in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Most Praised. Adorn your temples with the raiment of piety - this consisteth not of tattered and threadbare cloth, nor of worn wool and cotton, but rather of refinement and wisdom that restraineth you from base desire. This is the truth, did ye but know. Be ye utterly refined, for whoso lacketh refinement shall never perceive the fragrances of the All-Merciful nor associate with the dwellers of the Ridvan. Fear God and be not of the ignorant ones. Wash away whatsoever the pure nature abhorreth. Thus have ye been commanded aforetime by One Who is mighty and ancient. Follow that which We have enjoined upon you in the Tablets. Beware lest ye follow the heedless ones. Those who are heedless are among those who wander in the wilderness of error. O My handmaiden! Drink thou the Kawthar of utterance from the words of thy Lord, then give thanks and prostrate thyself before the face of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thus have We imparted unto thee the Word of Truth, after which there is naught but manifest error.</p>

Thy letter hath gained My audience and its words have been beheld by My glance, and the page hath been honored by the hand of Him in Whose grasp is the kingdom of the heavens and earth. Give thanks unto thy Lord and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Beloved of the worlds! Today the waves of the ocean of bounty are manifest and the lights of the Sun of grace are evident and radiant. Yet the people of the earth have, with their own hands, deprived themselves of this most great bounty. They have committed that which, God forbid, giveth rise to the fear that the outpourings of the All-Bountiful may cease, for the tyranny of the oppressors hath reached such a degree that none save God, exalted be His glory, can reckon it. Praise be to God, thou hast turned unto Him and attained His love. Know thou this most exalted station, then render thanks unto thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. In all conditions hold fast unto wisdom and cleave unto its hem. Verily God hath forgiven those men and women who have turned unto Him. He, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving, the Ancient.</p>

<p>O My handmaiden and My leaf! We have desired to remember thee and console thee regarding what hath befallen thee through the irrevocable decree and ordained destiny from God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting. Grieve not over what hath befallen thee. Recite what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “Every soul shall taste of death. We are God’s and to Him shall we return.” In the Persian tongue We make mention, that thou mayest comprehend the purpose and attain unto it. Life itself giveth tidings of death, and likewise cultivation announceth ruin. Death, for those who are assured and nigh unto God, is the gate of mercy, for they advance from the limitations of the world to a station which is the dawning-place of joy and sanctified above the comprehension of those who comprehend. Praise be to God, through the light of faith and the glory of certitude, which are each a wing of moist crimson ruby, he hath ascended unto the Supreme Companion. Well is it with him and with whosoever remembereth him through what hath been revealed for him from My Most Exalted Pen. In truth, this world is the supreme prison for souls that are confident, content and well-pleasing. Say: O my God, my God! Aid this handmaiden of Thine unto that which Thou lovest and art pleased with, then pour forth upon her patience. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the handmaidens of that land. Verily, We have mentioned them before and at this time, as a grace from Me, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>

<p>O handmaiden of God! The True One, exalted be His glory, hath appeared so that all who are on earth might attain unto His recognition and presence. Yet after the rending of veils and removal of coverings, most were found heedless and in denial. How many divines and jurists who considered themselves the most exalted of creatures were counted among the most abased after the dawning of the Sun of Truth. God hath made their highest ones lowest, and their lowest ones highest. How many dwellers in palaces have returned to their graves, and how many possessed of glory are witnessed in utter abasement. By the life of God! Abasement lieth in denial of God, and glory in faith in Him. Do jewels and ornaments and palaces and thrones preserve man from divine chastisement? Nay, by God’s Self! Soon all they witness shall return to nothingness. Both witness and witnessed shall become extinct and lost. O leaf! Praise the Beloved of the worlds that thou hast attained unto His blessed word “O My handmaiden.” It behooveth thee to preserve this most exalted station through the name of thy Lord, the Most Glorious. Verily, He is with His remembering handmaidens and His remembering servants. Glory be upon thee and upon every believing man and believing woman who hath believed in God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Khalil, upon whom be the Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted Glory of God! O Khalil! This is not the day of quietude and silence. Arise from the horizon of utterance with the remembrance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, then summon all creation unto God, the Mighty, the Bestower. Know thou that We have secluded Ourself in prison alone and have closed the gates of meeting for a number of days. Should We desire, We would open them in truth. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Beware lest thou withhold thyself from that which We have ordained for thee. Be thou among the people a herald of thy Lord’s Cause and a bearer of that which thou art commanded in the Book. O My Khalil, My Khalil! Grieve not for what hath befallen thee in My path. Thy reward is with Him Who created thee and caused thee to know that which most of the servants have failed to know. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord at all times and glorify His praise amidst the followers of all religions. Arise to serve the Cause as befitteth thee, then follow this Wronged One Who, from the horizon of the prison, summoneth the servants unto God, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. We beseech God to attract thee through the fragrances of the garment of Revelation in such wise that thou shalt arise to serve Him with power and sovereignty. Thus did We command thee before when We sent down unto thee a Tablet from whose horizon shone forth the sun of wisdom and utterance. This is yet another token of Our grace unto thee that thy heart may rejoice thereby and eyes be consoled. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the lights of the Countenance when the Promised One appeared and the veils were rent asunder.</p>

<p>In My Name, Who speaks from the Supreme Horizon! O Messenger! The people awaited the divine Day in such wise that in the nights and days they implored and beseeched with utmost humility and supplication the presence of the immortal King, seeking His meeting. Yet when the Sun of Revelation dawned from the horizon of Will, all remained veiled, bewildered and heedless, save whom God willed. Consider the saved sect, namely the Shi’ih, who counted themselves the best of all the world’s peoples. They afflicted a few helpless souls with such vain imaginings that finally they martyred the Lord of the world with hands of hatred. Now souls who have no knowledge whatsoever of the essence of this Cause have arisen with the same vain imaginings. Their purpose is to establish a region like before, and designate an illusory Jabulqa and an unknown Jabulsa. This Wronged One has spoken and speaks for God’s sake. All the servants - that is, those souls who have drunk from the cup of certitude - must arise to protect and preserve the House of the Cause, and behold the Truth with their own eyes and hear His call with their own ears. Whoso desires to know Him through other than Him shall never know Him. This is specific to this most mighty, most holy Revelation. Glory be upon the people of Baha who have cast away idle fancy and clung to the hem of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>In the Name of the One God! O Sadiq! Thy petition hath arrived, and from it wafteth the fragrance of the love of the Best-Beloved of the worlds. Praise be to the Purpose of the world Who hath enabled thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of Revelation, the Dayspring of Inspiration, and the Manifestation of His Self. Whoso hath attained unto recognition in this Day hath attained unto all good. The whole world was created for this blessed Day which in the divine Books hath been designated as the Day of God. Nevertheless, when the Day appeared and its Lord was seated upon the throne, all turned away save whom God, the Lord of the worlds, did please. The cause and reason for this are the divines of the age. We testify that they are numbered among the ignorant in the Perspicuous Book. They are honored by the name of Truth yet turn away from Him; they are known by His name yet remain heedless and veiled from Him. Whosoever hath in this Day attained unto the Most Exalted Horizon must, throughout his life, voice the praise and glorification of the Truth and through His name preserve this most exalted station, for verily the evil ones lie in wait and stand ready in ambush. Thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Informed, the All-Knowing. Convey on behalf of the Truth greetings to all the friends in that land and give them glad-tidings of that which hath been ordained for them. Ere long their station shall become manifest and evident unto all the world. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>

Thy petition was presented in the White Spot before Him Who is the Possessor of all Names, and the glances of His loving-kindness were directed towards thee. It was adorned with these words: “Establish me firmly in the confession that Thou art the pure Truth and the sheer Light.” Blessed art thou for having uttered these words! In truth, all created things must needs, in this day, implore this station from God, inasmuch as the Cause is mighty great. How numerous were the souls who made claim to firmness, steadfastness and constancy, yet afterwards, at the slightest breeze that blew from the Beloved of hearts, turned away and joined the worshippers of idols. God willing, thou shalt remain so firmly established and steadfast in the Cause of God that all the peoples of the world shall be powerless to hinder thee. Be thou aflame with the fire of My love, soaring in My atmosphere, holding fast to My cord, clinging to My robe, stirred by My will, turning thy face toward My face, speaking in My praise, and acting according to that which hath been sent down in My perspicuous, mighty and wise Book. Glory be to God! Should a soul turn away from this horizon, to what horizon would he turn, and to what proof and testimony would he cling? By the life of God! The proof doth circle round, and the testimony doth prostrate itself before My countenance, yet most of the people are in evident obscurity. The glory be upon thee and upon every servant who is steadfast in this mighty Cause.</p>

Arise in thy love for thy Lord in such wise that neither the oppression of the oppressors nor the ascendancy of them that have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds, can deter thee. Grieve not for thy brother - by thy Lord, the Most Glorious! - for he hath ascended to the Supreme Companion and hath attained unto the lights of the countenance of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great.

Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. No command precedeth the command of thy Lord. That which hath been inscribed by the Pen of the Ancient of Days from the presence of the Lord of all nations shall be manifested, but the people are wrapped in a manifest veil. Put thy trust in God and say: O Lord! Praise be unto Thee for all that hath befallen us in Thy path.

Although there was consummate wisdom in the delay of this remembrance. Say: O friends! Ye too must arise to make good what has been lost and exert your utmost endeavor. Ere long will the scroll of life be rolled up and return to nothingness. Beseech ye God that He may cause all to attain unto the word of contentment and ordain for them an enduring remembrance and an eternal word. Verily, He is powerful over all things. At all times they must strive with the utmost diligence to achieve unity and concord, that all regions may be illumined with the effulgent rays of the sun of unity and all may be seen as a single soul. The Supreme Pen hath, both aforetime and in this age, voiced this most exalted word: “Power and might are in unity, and glory and majesty are in concord.” We have counseled all, in the past, with that which will exalt the Cause and manifest the station of man. Blessed is he who hath hearkened, and woe betide the heedless. If they move according to the divine will and act upon that which hath been sent down in the Book, ere long will the world and its peoples turn towards the Dayspring of Revelation and quaff the choice sealed wine.

Thou must at all times drink from the chalice of joy and gladness, for that which came upon you in the path of God caused the Concourse on High to weep and lament.

<p>O Mashhadi Abu’l-Qasim, upon him be the glory of God! In My Name, through which the light hath shone forth from the Mount of Revelation. O peoples of the earth! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, Who remembereth you in the Most Great Prison and guideth you to the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. The Hidden One hath been made manifest, and that which was promised in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Great, hath been revealed. Beware lest human conditions prevent you from the Lord of Destiny, and beware lest the oppression of any remote oppressor frighten you. Take the chalice of eternity in the name of your Lord, the Most Glorious, then drink therefrom once in remembrance of My Most Great Name, and again in remembrance of My Name, the All-Encompassing over all who are in the heavens and the earth. Say: O people of the Bayan! He around Whom the Bayan revolved hath come, and that which was mentioned by the tongue of the Point, Who gave the glad tidings to the servants of the appearance of Him Who conversed on Sinai, hath been made manifest in this mighty and wondrous station. When thou attainest unto My verses and that which hath flowed from My Pen, turn thy face toward the Prison and say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and glory be unto Thee, O my Beloved! I beseech Thee by Thy Pen which Thou hast made as an ensign for the manifestation of Thy Cause and as a herald of Thy Name amongst Thy servants and as a light unto those who have sought Thy supreme horizon and as darkness and vengeance unto every wicked and vile one. And I beseech Thee, O Thou the Desire of the world, by Thy Most Great Name, to make me in all conditions to hold fast unto the cord of Thy bounty and to cling to the hem of Thy mercy and to be immersed in the ocean of Thy oneness. There is no God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>

Every appointed time hath been fulfilled, every sign hath been made manifest, every hidden secret hath been revealed, and He Who was promised hath come in truth, riding upon the clouds. Blessed is the powerful one who hath arisen to serve the Cause, and the speaker who hath proclaimed: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of Lords!” We have revealed that which lay concealed in knowledge and have sent down that which the Mother Book doth testify. How many a servant hath fled from the hosts of divine revelation, and how many a servant hath arisen and said: “Praise be to Thee, O my Lord, the Most High!” Blessed is he who hath remained steadfast, whom the clamor of those who have disbelieved in the Beginning and the Return hath failed to deter. And woe unto every one who hath turned away from Him through Whom the horizon of creation hath been illumined. Let nothing grieve thee. Put thy trust in God, thy Lord, and say: “Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having made known unto me the Dayspring of Thy signs, the Dawning-Place of Thy lights, and the Manifestation of Thy Self, before Whom, when He appeared, all necks bowed down in submission. I beseech Thee to aid me in Thy remembrance and praise and in the service of Thy Cause in such wise that the hosts of every one who hath denied Thy right in the Hereafter shall not deter me. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, mine eyes fixed upon the wonders of Thy bounty. Have mercy upon me through Thy grace and loving-kindness, then send down upon me from the heaven of Thy favor that which befitteth Thy Name, the All-Bountiful.”</p>

In this divine springtime and luminous day, the friends of God must, with love and kindness and mercy and wisdom and utterance, make the people of the world aware and summon them to the Most Exalted Horizon. The first cause which led to the exaltation of the Blessed Word has been the unity and harmony of the friends. That honored one must hold fast, with both outer and inner tongue, to that which was mentioned, and must cling to unity, which is the greatest cause for the reformation of the world and the refinement of the nations.

Cast aside what your desires command you and take hold of that which ye have been given by God, the Lord of the Unseen and the Seen.

We testify that they are among the transgressors. O concourse of divines in Persia! Be fair concerning that which hath appeared with truth and be not of the oppressors. O thou who hast turned, when thou attainest unto My utterance say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having remembered me and revealed unto me that through which the fragrances of Thy loving-kindness and the sweet savors of Thy mercy were wafted. I beseech Thee by Thy hidden mysteries and Thy shining lights and by Thy Most Great Book which Thou hast sent down to the peoples, to assist me in serving Thee and serving Thy loved ones. Then protect me from the evil of Thine enemies who have disbelieved in Thee and in Thy signs. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>Praise be to God that through the effulgences of the rays of the Sun of divine favor thou hast succeeded in that which most of the servants are deprived and forbidden. How many are the possessors of knowledge and learning who today walk in the paths of fancy and vain imaginings, although all have acknowledged and do acknowledge the appearance of the Truth and the advent of the Promised One with the Cause of God. Woe unto them and unto those who follow them without any clear proof or Book from God, the Lord of the worlds. O Ahmad! Know thou the value of thine own station and strive that thou mayest attain to that which, when mentioned, shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endureth. That which the senses perceive today shall soon return to nothingness. But that which floweth from the Most Exalted Pen hath been and shall forever be eternal. Hold thou fast unto the cord of the favor of thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. In all matters fix thy gaze upon the Truth and place thy trust in Him. Say: O my God! I have turned wholly unto Thee. Through Thy bounty, ordain for me that which Thou desirest. I know not what profiteth me. Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Word and by the Supreme Horizon to ordain for me through the Pen of Thy bounty that which shall benefit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds.

Praise be to Thee for having caused me to soar on the wings of longing in the atmosphere of Thy knowledge, and adorned me with the ornament of certitude in Thy days, and illumined my heart with the light of Thy manifestation. I beseech Thee by those who were so attracted by Thy verses that they hastened to the place of sacrifice in their longing to meet Thee and offered up their souls in Thy path, to ordain for me that which will make me speak forth Thy praise and drink the choice wine of Thy revelation and turn toward the lights of Thy countenance at all times. O my Lord! Thou seest me standing before the door of Thy grace, asking for Thy bounty and generosity. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me what Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones. Verily Thou art the Compassionate, the Generous. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.</p>

<p>Today the ocean of knowledge is surging and the pearls of wisdom and divine knowledge are manifest and visible, yet all are deprived thereof save whom God willeth. O friends! Know ye the value of these days which, though fleeting and transient, are ordained for the attainment of everlasting stations. Blessed is the one whom transient conditions have not prevented from recognizing the essence of knowledge and wisdom. We have heard thy call and have made mention of it in this Tablet, that perchance through the sweet-scented breeze of utterance they may attain unto that which God hath purposed. The idolaters have encompassed the believers on all sides. The cause and reason for this hath been and continueth to be the heedlessness of the negligent ones and the tyranny of the oppressors. Now must thou and all the unitarians, with utmost humility and lowliness, beseech the Self-Sufficient One for that which would conduce to the betterment of the world and the progress and tranquility of its peoples. Say: My God, my God! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and holding fast to the cord of Thy Prophet and Thy Chosen One, Whom Thou hast made the Sovereign of the Messengers and the Guide of all paths. I beseech Thee by Him and by His family and companions to assist me in Thy remembrance and praise amongst Thy servants. Verily Thou art powerful to do what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the Hearing, the Responding One!</p>
<p>Today all things speak forth the blessed word “The Glory has come!” This is that Name at which the joints of the polytheists tremble and the hearts of the monotheists find peace. This is that Name which has had and has no likeness or equal. He is the Hidden Pearl that was concealed and preserved in the Mine of Divine Wisdom and Protection, and was later mentioned, by the Absolute Divine Will, in the Dawn Prayer. He is the Crown of utterance and the Diadem of proof - none denies it save those filled with rancor, envy, and such wretchedness as amounts to disbelief in God, the Lord of all worlds. And the throne of that Name has been the Dayspring of Divine utterance, as expressed in His words: “O God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Glorious Beauty [Baha] and all Thy Glory is truly glorious.” This is the Most Great Name and the Most Perfect, Most Ancient Blessed Word - at its very mention the evil ones are scattered.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabl-’Ali! Praise God for having enabled thee to attain unto a Tablet from whose horizon the Sun of Grace has shown forth and become manifest. His honor Ibrahim, who circumambulated around Me and attained My presence, made mention of thee. We make mention of thee with that whereby the hearts of those near unto God have been attracted. That which thou didst send has been accepted. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this mighty favor. Verily, glorification swims in the ocean of utterance and glorifies its Lord, the Hearing, the Responding One.</p>

<p>O Leaf, sister, upon thee be the Glory of God! In the name of God, the Speaking One! Today the divine fragrance is wafting from the garment of His Cause - surely every possessor of smell perceives it. The Sun of the Face is manifest and shining from the horizon of appearance - every possessor of sight beholds it. The Euphrates of utterance is flowing and streaming forth from the Finger of the Will of the All-Merciful - everyone whose thirst is true thirst attains and will attain unto it. Besides these souls, all are and were dead. Therefore one should not be saddened by the deeds and actions of the dead, for they were and are not worthy of mention. O Greatest Leaf! The Supreme Pen commands: In all conditions be occupied with the remembrance of the Friend and with the utmost joy and fragrance drink from the life-giving water. Count all contingent beings as absolute nothingness. Soon will the whole world return to extinction, while the banner of immortality has been and will be raised in the name of Truth. “Everything will perish save His dominion which belongeth to God alone.” Convey greetings from this Wronged One to the believing and devoted women of that land and say: God is witness and sees and hears, and He has not forgotten and will not forget the leaves of the Tree of Love. And the Glory be upon thee and upon them.</p>

How many are the servants who exist in this Day yet are deprived of Him, and how many who in the nights and days were seeking and yearning, yet now find themselves remote from the One they sought and knew. At all times hath the Most Exalted Pen made mention of souls who have turned towards Him, and continueth to do so.

We have heard thy call and have answered thee, and have witnessed thy turning and have turned unto thee from this glorious station. God willing, thou shalt act with the utmost love and unity with the friends of God.

Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful! We behold the people in a strange sleep and manifest doubt. They possess neither that which would lead them to the good-pleasure of God, nor that which would attract them to the Supreme Horizon. Can what they possess equal what is with God? Nay, by His own Self, the Truth! Say: He followeth not your idle fancies, nor walketh in your ways. Fear God, and be not of the wrongdoers. Convey My remembrance to the friends of God and His loved ones, and give them the glad-tidings of My remembrance and My loving-kindness. We beseech God to draw them nigh unto Him and to ordain for them the reward of attaining His presence. There is none other God but Him. He guideth whom He willeth unto His straight path.

Rend asunder the veils of idle fancy by My sovereignty which encompasseth the worlds. Say: O people! Exchange not the love of the Youth for aught else, nor sell it for countless coins. By God! Those from whom ye perceive the stench of hatred are worse in character than Nimrod and greater in their unbelief than Pharaoh. Beware lest ye draw nigh unto them. Be on your guard and maintain an impregnable detachment. Then know thou thyself to be more learned than those who have not entered the stronghold of My Cause, lest the pride of the turbaned ones who have disbelieved and associated partners with God cause thee to slip. For knowledge is My love, and all else is but the whisperings of Satan. Thus have We imparted unto thee from the essence of knowledge, that thou mayest be possessed of true learning.</p>

<p>O servant! On this Naw-Ruz, when the Sun has risen from the constellation of grandeur, most faces have turned black except for those whom your Lord, the All-Merciful, has willed. We see people in distress and turmoil, descending and ascending, not knowing. Some faces are gloomy and frowning, others radiant and joyful. Some eyes are weeping and staring, others sharp and observant. Some ears are deaf and forbidden, others hearing and attentive. Some tongues are dull and fettered, others eloquent and speaking. Some hands are restricted and bound, others extended and giving. Some hearts are fearful and heedless, others pure and expectant. Some souls are agitated and commanding to evil, others tranquil and well-pleased. Some feet are trembling and unsteady, others firm and steadfast. Thus do We observe the servants and inform you in this wondrous Tablet. Grieve not for those who have disbelieved. Remember those on whose faces you find the radiance of the beauty of your Lord, the Most High, the All-Knowing. Verily, in this Great Prison We summon the people unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Be as We are in the Cause of God and fear not the oppressors. He is with you and will help you in truth. He is the Protector of those who remember Him. We beseech God to purify the servants from the world and to turn them toward the Dawning-Place of His Most Beautiful Names. Verily, He is the Hearer of Prayer and He encompasses all the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Beloved of the people of the world! O handmaid of God! Render thanks unto God, the Peerless, for having confirmed thee in pursuing a course of action which most of the women of the earth are debarred from and unable to perform. Ponder upon the days of the Seal of Prophets, may the soul of all else but Him be a sacrifice unto Him. All the dwellers of the earth, servants and handmaidens alike, have been brought into being to recognize that Luminary of the horizon of utterance, yet, during the days of His manifestation, all arose in opposition and denial, save a few mentioned souls. From amongst the handmaidens the great Khadijih attained this tremendous honour, because she remained steadfast, nay thankful, in the midst of tribulations and afflictions. Well is it with her and blessed is she. She is one of those women who was nurtured from the fruits of the Divine Lote-Tree and quaffed from the Immortal River. Well is it with her and with every handmaiden who hath loved her, hath turned to her and hath spoken forth in praise of her.</p>
<p>O handmaid of God, We send greetings to all the women of that land and admonish them all to that which is meet and seem1y. Say, this is the day of utterance, of praise and of steadfastness. Exert yourselves that you may not be deprived of the fragrances of these days, and may attain to that which God hath purposed.</p>

<p>O servants! The light hath appeared, the Sun hath risen, the Book hath been revealed, the proof is resplendent, and the Kingdom of Utterance is manifest at the midmost heart of contingent being. Yet the people remain heedless and in denial. Say: O servants, be ye ashamed before the Lord of Creation! Deny not Him Whom ye remember night and day, before Whom ye stand in service, and Whose Name ye invoke. Today the Straight Path is manifest and calleth out, guiding all to the supreme horizon. The Balance uttereth “The All-Merciful is come,” and the Herald between earth and heaven proclaimeth this most exalted Word: “The Desired One is come with a sovereignty before which the sovereignty of the world and the might of the nations cannot stand. Fear ye the All-Merciful, O people of possibility, and be not among the heedless.” Blessed art thou, for thou hast turned unto Him in days when all turned away, and made mention of Him in times when all were silent. Beseech thou God to aid thee to remain steadfast, for mighty is this Cause and mighty this Day. We send greetings to the loved ones in that land and give them the glad-tidings of God’s grace, favor and mercy, glorified be His majesty. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have embraced that which is good, turning away from evil and from all that God hath forbidden in His perspicuous Book.</p>

<p>O Javad, beloved of the world, son of the brother of His Honor Nasir of Lahijan! The fragrances of the garment of revelation of the Ancient King are diffusing throughout the realm of being, and the lights of His countenance are shining and manifest from the horizon of creation. Whosoever has turned to Him and become detached from aught else is reckoned among the people of divine unity in the Most Sublime Vision, and whosoever remains distant from this station is accounted among the people of passion by the Supreme Pen. You had asked that He protect you from the evil of satans. Yea, verily He is the Protector, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. This station has been and ever shall be dependent upon steadfastness. And steadfastness is to know God alone as the One who prevails over all things, watches over all things, knows all things and encompasses all things, and to consider all else as non-existent and evanescent in His court. He has had no partner in the past nor will He have any in the future. Most of those who imagine vain things have not, until now, comprehended the station of this Revelation as it deserves. This is why they wander in the wilderness of heedlessness and forgetfulness. By My life! Had they known, they would have cried out and lamented, saying: “We have been remiss in our duty to Thee, O Lord of the worlds!” Make this counsel the focus of thine eyes and be of those who act accordingly.</p>

Some time ago, through the hands of emigrants, the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed and sent. God willing, thou shalt attain unto the suns of divine utterances which shine forth from its horizons. Therefore, at this time We shall be brief. Know thou this much: in these days the Pen of the All-Powerful is constantly occupied, inasmuch as countless petitions from all directions are present before the Throne. By My life! I am indeed engaged in a mighty task and manifest tribulation. Yet no thing hath ever prevented or will prevent the Pen of God’s Will - by the sovereignty of might and power it is occupied with whatsoever God hath willed. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. That which thy daughter composed in remembrance of the Best-Beloved of the worlds reached the Most Holy Court and was heard. Blessed is she, then blessed is she! A Tablet was specifically revealed and sent for her as well. Convey My glory unto her face on My behalf and give her the glad-tidings of My great bounty. At all times be thou occupied with the promotion of God’s Cause through divine wisdom, that perchance the dead in the valley of self and passion may be quickened by the outpourings of the ocean of the Merciful’s utterance and turn unto the Friend.

Today the Kawthar of utterance is flowing from the right hand of the Throne of the All-Merciful, and the choice wine of divine knowledge is streaming from the left, while the Kingdom before His face calls out and proclaims: “This is the Day wherein that which was hidden in God’s knowledge and mentioned by the tongues of the Prophets and Messengers has been made manifest.” The whole world was created for this glorious Day, yet when the morn of the Day of Revelation was illumined by the lights of His countenance, all were found to be veiled. Blessed art thou for having turned to the Horizon from which the pillars of the earth turned away. Soon shall all arise in lamentation and weeping, finding no refuge or shelter. Drink at all times from the ocean of joy, for thou hast attained to this Most Great Cause and art mentioned by the Truth in God’s Book.

<p>O Ali! Some in certain places have outwardly clung to one of the branches of this Tree, thereby drawing weak souls from the shore of divine unity into the wasteland of polytheism and error. In truth, these souls’ secret purpose was never and is not the branch of the Tree, but rather their own selfish desires. God will reveal what lies in their hearts and the hidden things of their souls. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. It is necessary to prevent people from entering such places and to make every possible effort to protect the Cause from all directions, lest the satans make a breach. O Ali! Strange are the people who each day soar with a different desire and wander in a wilderness. Never was their purpose the branch, nor is it now. Rather, they have made him a means for attracting people to their own causes. God protect us and you from the evil of these people. Out of regard for previous mercy, We have not torn away the veil from these souls in this instance - perhaps they will become aware and conscious. They have also deceived some village people with their vain imaginings. If someone could wisely and kindly draw these weak ones to the shore of divine unity’s glory, it would be praiseworthy.

<p>In the name of the All-Knowing God! Say: O servants! Act according to that which the True One, glorified be His majesty, hath enjoined. Today is the day of nearness and meeting, and the day of grace and favor. All must cleanse their hearts from the words of the heedless, the doubts of the suspicious, and the allusions of the opposers, that they may be adorned with the ornament of divine favor, mercy and loving-kindness. The eye was created for this day and is commanded to turn to Him in all conditions and to know Him through Him. If today any soul fails to attain the lights shining from the supreme horizon, he is recorded and inscribed among the blind in God’s Book, even should he possess a hundred thousand eyes. Strange it is that some, having attained to recognition and uttering the praise of God, glorified be His majesty, were nevertheless seen to be deprived of the Ancient Beauty through trivial causes and vain words. Say: O servants! Let not your station slip from your grasp. Know your worth and the worth of these days, and drink of the choice-sealed wine in the name of the Self-Subsisting. Beware lest the doubts of the opposers keep you back from God, the Lord of all worlds, or the allusions of the misguided veil you from the Mighty Announcement. Thus have We sent down the verses that the people may be reminded by this Clear Tablet. And the glory be upon thee.</p>

<p>He is the Caller in all conditions! Blessed is He Who hath sent down the Word and through it hath distinguished between all created things. He is verily the All-Distinguishing, the All-Wise. He hath made it the Wine of Life for all who dwell within the realm of possibility, and the Kawthar of immortality for all who are in the heavens and on earth. Whoso hath attained unto it hath attained unto that which his Lord, the Gracious, did desire, and whoso hath shown pride, he is truly among the losers. The Tongue of the All-Merciful beareth witness to this from this luminous horizon. Say: This is the Day wherein the Evidence hath appeared and the Way hath been made clear, wherein the proof hath been perfected and the bounty completed. Blessed is he who hath turned towards it, and woe unto the heedless among the idolaters. Whoso imagineth that he can outrun God’s Cause - say: Nay, by His own Self! He is verily the Almighty over what He willeth. His power hath preceded all worlds. He doeth what He pleaseth in His dominion. He giveth and withholdeth. He is truly the Almighty, the Powerful. Vain have been the strivings of those who have disbelieved - soon shall they find themselves in grievous torment. We render thanks unto God at all times and are patient in what hath befallen Us on this straight Path. We judge between people as We please and summon them unto that which shall profit them in the world to come and in this world. He is verily the All-Witnessing, the All-Knowing.

Thus hath the matter been decreed from the presence of One mighty and powerful.</p>

Soon shall all that is visible perish; then shall the sincere ones behold what hath been ordained for them in the Kingdom of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the Almighty. For love of Thee I have chosen every affliction, and for passion of Thee every grievous trial. The rapture of Thy utterance hath so seized me that I have turned my breast toward the darts of the enemies and set my face toward the spears of the idolaters. Were it not for my love of Thee, how could I have endured the derision of the enemies and all that hath befallen me at every moment? Thy love hath imprisoned me in the prison of the land of Ta beneath the chains of Thy creatures, and hath sent me to ’Akka, the place that hath been named the Most Great Prison. Were We to recount what hath befallen Us in the path of God, the Lord of Names, every hearing and seeing one would weep. We make mention of Our tribulations in measure, lest grief overtake Our loved ones in hardships and trials. He, verily, is the Helper, the All-Wise. All that hath come upon me in the path of God is the solace of mine eyes. To this testifieth every truthful and faithful one. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen mentioned unto thee what hath been inflicted upon Me by the hosts of the heedless. Convey My greetings unto My loved ones who have turned their faces toward My Countenance and drawn nigh unto God on this resplendent Day.

<p>These are the holy verses sent down from the heaven of God’s Will, the All-Powerful, the Most High, the Most Great, that He might guide thereby such servants in whose hearts the dove of love hath nested, and make them to be of those who have drawn nigh. And thou, O handmaiden of God, draw near unto the Tree of Knowledge with thy heart, then detach thyself from those who have turned away. Should sorrow touch thee in the path of God, grieve not, but place thy trust in all things in God, the King, the Mighty, the All-Praised. And should joy befall thee, rejoice not, for all that hath come to pass in this world or shall come to pass shall perish, and the dominion shall remain with God, the King, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Remember thy Lord and follow not the desires of the heedless. Free thyself from all things that God may adorn thee with the ornament of His remembrance amongst the worlds. Verily, hearts that are occupied with the remembrance of aught save God shall never be illumined by the lights of the revelation of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. This is a truth about which there is no doubt, yet the people are in grievous heedlessness. Taste thou from the Tree of Knowledge and eat of its wondrous fruits, then take shelter beneath its mighty and luminous shade.

Therein is decreed from among the traditions of the ancients, for in it is mentioned that which changes nearness into distant separation, whereat the denizens of Paradise lament, the eyes of the unseen weep, the Cock of the Throne crieth out, and the Dove of the Cause waileth in the holy and glorious Ridvan. Say: In this are signs for those who remember. And in it is wisdom which none knoweth save God, Lord of all worlds. God shall soon manifest His Cause with truth, exalt His proof, and aid His servants who are numbered among the emigrants. Say: Be patient, O company of the wretched ones, for God shall soon validate His Cause and establish His Word, and speak forth in truth, “Verily I am God, there is none other God but Me, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate.” Thus do We teach you the paths of knowledge, and cast upon you the verses of the Spirit, and guide you to the ways of certitude. And thou, O handmaiden of God, give thanks unto thy Lord and place thy trust in all matters, and be not of those who despair. Then know that God is powerful over all things - He doeth whatsoever He willeth and verily He hath power over all things.

In the days and nights they were occupied with the remembrance of God upon their pulpits, beseeching and hoping for divine bounty that they might receive a portion from the Kawthar of reunion with the Dawning-Place of divine verses and take their share from the Salsabil of meeting. Nevertheless, when the world was illumined by the Sun of Manifestation, they turned away and objected, except for souls who rent asunder the veils of fancy in the name of God and turned toward the supreme horizon. The fruit of all souls is that they attain the divine presence in the Day of Manifestation, as this point is mentioned and recorded in several places in the Qur’an.

He hath educated creation through the tongue of the Books and the Messengers, that they might attain to the station of “Blessed, therefore, be God, the most excellent of Makers.” We have mentioned thee repeatedly. Muhammad-Quli hath once again sought to express his love, and thus do We make mention of him. We counsel all the loved ones of God to observe the fear of God and that whereby hearts and minds are concealed. Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Him through Whom the valley-bed flowed and through Whom the Light shone forth from the horizon of the Hijaz, to send down upon this Thy servant from the heaven of Thy bounty the rains of Thy loving-kindness. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, detached from all else besides Thee. I beseech Thee to make me in all circumstances steadfast in Thy Cause and to hold fast unto that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Then ordain for me the good of this world and the world to come. Verily Thou art the Lord of all mankind. There is none other God but Thee, the Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens.</p>

<p>In this year there occurred that which caused the All-Seeing Eye to weep and the Pen of God to lament. O Abu’l-Qasim! The delusions of the previous party have emerged - the notorious Dawlat-Abadi has denied the Book of God and has intended to eliminate it. This grief is greater than all the griefs of the world. His followers say this Text is not authentic. It was said: bring forth the text which you possess. They mentioned that that too is not authentic. The tale of the deluded ones of the past has emerged. By the life of God! This incident has closed the door of joy and gladness and delight and expansion. Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the sighs of Thy Baha and by His tears to protect Thy Book from the oppressors who desired to erase it in Thy days. O my Lord! Aid them not in what they intended. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest and within Thy grasp is the reins of those in the heavens and the earth. Likewise they have intended to erase the Book which was named the Qayyumu’l-Asma. In any case, the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark must, in the nights and days, beseech the Truth, exalted be His Glory, for the protection of His Book. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who heard the call and answered their Lord, the Hearing, the Responding.</p>

<p>O Afnan, his honor Mirza, upon him be the Glory of God! In all times We have been and are afflicted with successive and continuous tribulations. Nevertheless, through God’s grace, mercy, power and sovereignty, We are engaged in His remembrance and in teaching His Most Great Cause. Whatever has been and is being endured has but one purpose: that hearts and souls may be sanctified from selfish and passionate inclinations and turn toward the Most Holy Horizon, so that through divine favor they may, in this transient world, attain unto eternal stations. The rain of the mercy of the All-Merciful is at all times descending from the clouds of grace, that perchance withered souls may be adorned with the ornament of a wondrous life. Verily the Cause is in His hands - He doeth whatsoever He willeth through His sovereignty. Blessed art thou for having attained unto that which God desired and for having arisen to serve Him on a day wherein most of the people were veiled. There hath befallen Our loved ones in that place what hath befallen Us in this exalted station. Although what hath come to pass hath outwardly been most bitter and unpalatable, yet inwardly, since it hath occurred in the path of God, it is most sweet. Erelong shall the opposers be seen in manifest loss and remorse, and those who have turned toward God shall be observed in the utmost glory and dignity. This is irrevocably decreed with thy Lord. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee.</p>

<p>O Haydar! He is the One speaking from the horizon of utterance. At all times the Pen of the Most Merciful has commanded the birds soaring in the heaven of divine knowledge to act with wisdom, lest any action arise that might become a cause of veiling the weak ones. Likewise He has commanded love and unity, for discord has ever been and will ever be the cause of corruption and the waste of God’s Cause. Some souls accepted and obeyed the divine commandments, while others transgressed, such that in every land actions contrary to God’s command have arisen, becoming the cause of the cawing of crows and braying of asses. The friends of God must gird up their loins to serve and become the cause of fellowship and unity of hearts and souls, and in all conditions be mindful of wisdom. I beseech God to aid all to do what He loves and is pleased with. Your letter was presented before the Throne and what was mentioned therein was observed. God willing, may you ever be and forever remain adorned with the ornament of divine love and illumined by the lights of His countenance. Blessed art thou for having turned to God and heeded His call when the divines who took idols as lords besides God turned away from Him - verily they are among the lowly ones. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained this sacred, mighty and wondrous station.</p>

Say: O people! This is the Book of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Therein is mentioned every matter in such wise that souls would be thunderstruck were ye to hear with the hearing of God.

O Isma’il! Hearken unto the call of this Bird Who hath turned from the City of God toward a holy and exalted City.

Know thou that God hath accepted thy obedience and what thou hast done to build the House whose name God hath raised to the heaven of sublime glory. Well is it with thee for having attained unto this station which none besides thee hath attained, and God is witness unto this. Yet We bid thee to be patient and steadfast, calm and dignified, if thou art obedient to God’s command. Beware lest thou forget My counsel and dispute with anyone. Rather place thy trust in God in all matters, for He is the best of helpers. Associate with people with wisdom, then speak with wisdom lest anyone cause thee harm. Thus do We impart unto thee words of wisdom that thou mayest be gladdened in thy soul and be at ease in the realm. Then convey Our remembrance to thy sister and to those who have detached themselves from all directions toward a holy and generous station. And upon you all be the Spirit and Glory.</p>

Regard all save God as non-existent, and behold Him as the Ever-Present. The effulgence of the All-Merciful’s grace hath never ceased, nor shall it ever cease. If the Ancient Beauty is manifest, His mercy’s splendors shine forth outwardly and inwardly without interruption, and if the Ancient Beauty is concealed, the effulgences of His grace have been and shall forever be directed toward those who have turned unto Him. Therefore, the infinite outpourings of divine bounty are present at all times. Blessed are they who are not deprived of the Sovereign of Oneness by evanescent fancies, nor kept back from the divine court by the whisperings of malicious souls. O Asad! The names descend from heaven. God willing, thou shalt remain steadfast and firm in the Cause of God with the courage of a lion and the might of a fierce beast. Verily all grace is in His hands - He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth through His command. He is, verily, powerful over all things. Verily He calleth unto him who calleth upon Him and answereth him who invoketh Him. His mercy hath indeed preceded all created things and His grace hath encompassed the worlds.</p>

<p>A remembrance for him who has rent asunder the veils when the All-Bestowing came in the shadows of the clouds. How sweet is My remembrance of My servants who were attracted by the verses in days wherein the mountains were scattered. Say: Verily, He in the prison summons the peoples unto God, the Lord of the ancient, and draws mankind near unto the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Say: Are you content with the pool while you behold the Kawthar before your faces? What aileth you, O people of error? Take what you are commanded in the Tablet. Cast away what hopes you have from the people. Among men are those who have cast away religion and exalted clay, and among them are those who have chosen desires over guidance. By My life, all these shall perish, and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Lord of the beginning and the end. Say: O people, do you not see the sun? Verily it is at its zenith. Through it the moon of fancy was eclipsed and the stars of idle imaginings have fallen. Blessed is he who has rent asunder the veils with the finger of might. Think not that those who are heedless are sleeping - nay, they are dead in the wilderness of error. The breezes of chastisement have seized them from all directions, and they have no protector from God this Day. Give thanks to thy Lord for having aided thee to recognize the Manifestation of His Essence and drawn thee near unto this station which hath been illumined by the lights of Beauty. Beware lest anything prevent thee from God. Leave all else but Him, then remember Him in the morning and the evening.</p>

<p>O Ghulam-Husayn, who hath emigrated and attained unto My Name, the One Who holdeth dominion over all names! Day after day bringeth joy and expansion - joy from what? From the wine of divine love in this luminous morn. And expansion from what? From the infinite outpouring of the Lord’s bounty. O Ghulam who was formerly Husayn! The leaf thou didst send hath attained unto Our presence and been honored by the glance of Our loving-kindness. Blessed art thou in having turned unto the Most Sublime Horizon and attained unto that which lay hidden in the treasury of infallibility and was inscribed by the Most Glorious Pen in the Books of the Messengers. The names have been blessed through the mention of their Lord - a bounty unto thee and unto them from God, the Lord of all worlds.

O Ghulam! Give thanks unto God, then praise Him for having aided thee and brought thee into His presence, where thou didst hear His sweetest call from His Most Glorious Horizon.

Thy might beareth me witness! Every limb of my body crieth out to Thee and saith: “O Thou Who art the Well-Beloved of the worlds, and the Lord of all that are in heaven and on earth, and the one Desire of the hearts which are devoted to Thee! I implore Thee, by Thine Ocean unto which Thou didst summon all the inmates of heaven and all the dwellers of the earth, to help Thy servants who have been kept back from turning unto it and from approaching its shores. Make them, then, O my God, to be detached from all else but Thee, and enable them to speak forth Thy praise and extol Thy virtues. Supply them, moreover, O my God, with the choice Wine of Thy mercy, that it may cause them to be forgetful of any one except Thee, and to arise to serve Thy Cause, and to be steadfast in their love for Thee. Thou art, verily, the Lord of their lives and the Object of their adoration. If they be driven away by Thee, who will then look upon them; and if they be removed far from Thee, who is there that can help them to approach Thy Presence? I swear by Thy might! No refuge is there to flee to except Thee, and no shelter to seek except Thy shelter, and no protection except Thy protection. Woe betide him who hath taken as Lord any one beside Thee, and blessed are the ones who have rid themselves of all attachment to all the dwellers of Thine earth, and clung to the hem of Thy bounteousness.

<p>God testifies that there is no God but Him, and that He Who speaks is indeed the Dawning-Place of His signs and the Dayspring of His clear tokens - He at Whose appearance the heaven was cleft asunder, the earth was rent, and its peoples lamented, save whom God willed, the Lord of all worlds. Through Him appeared what was inscribed in the Books of God, and His advent was heralded by the Point of the Bayan and before Him by God’s Messengers, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. By God! The Self-Subsisting has come, giving His sealed choice wine to drink to those near unto Him. Blessed is he who turned, partook and drank in My Name, the Munificent. Beware lest the affairs of creation hold thee back from the Truth. Cast aside all else and take what hath come unto thee through His binding and wise command. Make mention of thy Lord with wisdom and utterance, that through it may be attracted the hearts of those who were heedless of this momentous News. Say: This is the News whereof God gave tidings in every age, and through it the horizon of utterance was illumined. Thus have We set forth the verses, sent them down in truth, and dispatched them unto thee that thou mayest be thankful and be of them that remember. Say: This is the Day of Utterance and this is the Day of Praise, would ye but know. Say: Make haste, O people, to gain what escaped you in the days of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The glory be upon thee and upon those whom nothing whatsoever hath held back from God, the Lord of this wondrous Day.</p>

God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who speaketh is the Manifestation of His Cause, the Dayspring of His signs, and the Source of every wise command. Blessed is he who hath hearkened unto His most sweet call and acted according to that which was enjoined upon him in His perspicuous Book. This is the Day which the Lord of all beings foretold in former ages. Blessed is the strong one whom the doubts of the opposers have not kept back from this magnificent bounty. We have heard thy call and have answered thee, and have beheld thy mention and have mentioned thee in this Tablet through which the fragrances of the All-Merciful have been wafted throughout all possibilities. Joy be unto him who hath found, and woe betide every doubting denier. Blessed art thou inasmuch as thou hast turned toward the Most Sublime Horizon at a time when most of mankind have turned away therefrom, and joy be unto thee inasmuch as thou hast quaffed the Kawthar of immortality from the hands of the bounty of thy Lord, the Munificent, the All-Bountiful. Beware lest the affairs of the world hold thee back from Him Who is the Lord of the former and latter generations. That which thou beholdest today shall perish, but this luminous Tablet shall endure unto thee. Hold fast unto the cord of bounty and cleave unto the hem of the generosity of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Thus hath spoken the Tongue of the Wronged One, whilst imprisoned through that which the hands of the heedless have wrought.

Then preserve her from every illness and calamity, honor her with Thy presence and Thy riches, cause her to enter beneath the shadow of Thy tenderness and generosity, and grant her the good of this world and the next if she hath believed in Thee and in Thy signs and in that which Thou hast sent down upon Thy most exalted Countenance from the wondrous verses of Thy glory and the comprehensive tokens of Thy wisdom. Then make her among the inheritors in the earth.</p>

<p>The trustworthy messenger caused the musk-scented letter to ascend with one feather from the heavens of existence and descend to the earth of manifestation. This is the journey of the physical messenger who, in one moment, graciously descended from the highest Sadratu’l-Muntaha to the lowest supreme height. What would happen if the spiritual courier were to move with the Buraq of love and display its majesty!</p>
<p>The wine of our pain makes us mad</p>
<p>If it were to become pure, I know not what it would do</p>
<p>This is from God’s grace which He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth. And when I removed the veil of covering from the face of the bride of ink, and with complete love lifted it from her head, immediately a light shone forth from the identity of the essence of the words, such that the mountains of tranquility were crushed and the spirit became detached from its attachments. He fell down in a swoon, and when he recovered he said:</p>
<p>Was it lightning that flashed from the direction of the Mount,</p>
<p>Or were the veils lifted from Salma’s face?</p>
<p>And from beholding it, the breezes of spirit blew from the north of the soul and bestowed pure victories upon all parts and members, such that the ear received the delight of divine call, and consciousness became unconscious from excess of love, and the mouth drank the wine of reunion, and the tongue strove to give thanks for this bounty. The sorrowful rejoices, the love-smitten is revived, the yearning one finds solace, and the hearer delights. And peace be upon you.</p>

<p>O Mulla Muhammad-Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the One speaking from the Most Exalted Horizon. The All-Bountiful has come, saying: “To Me, to Me, O people of understanding!” The All-Merciful has come, saying: “Hasten, hasten, O followers of the religions!” The All-Forgiving has appeared with truth, saying: “Come, come, O people of the Furqan and O people of the Bayan!” The Self-Subsisting has arisen and proclaimed: “By God! He Who was promised in the Books of God has come, and He Who was the Purpose of those near unto God and the Beloved of the Prophets and Messengers has appeared. Fear God, O peoples of the earth, and follow not the desires of those who have denied the Proof when the All-Merciful came with clear sovereignty.” Thus has the scratching of My Pen been raised up, and the rustling of My Divine Lote-Tree, and the murmuring of the water of My loving-kindness, and the whistling of the winds of My Will - if ye be of them that hear. Is there one possessed of tongue who will recite what hath been sent down from God, the Mighty, the Great? Is there one possessed of sight who will behold My luminous horizon? Is there one possessed of hearing who will hear what hath been sent down in this time from One All-Knowing, All-Informed? When thou hast drunk the living waters from the Pen of the All-Merciful, arise to serve the Cause with the wisdom We have sent down aforetime, that thou mayest find thyself in manifest joy.

How many a servant hath mocked God, and how many a servant hath said, “Here am I, here am I, O King of mankind!” We have manifested the Cause and raised up the Standards, and have sent down from the heaven of revelation that whereby ears were created in the contingent world. But when the Cause appeared and the Sovereign of Power was established upon the throne, the idolaters emerged from behind the veil. By God! They committed that whereby the Cause was brought to naught and whereby the dwellers of Paradise in their chambers did lament. Thus do We recount unto thee that thou mayest be informed of what befell Us at the hands of them that denied God and His sovereignty in the final return. The fire of hatred seized them to such extent that they disbelieved in Him in Whom they had believed and around Whom they had circled at morn and eventide. From this station We send Our glorification upon thee and upon them that are with thee, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing. Remind the people in thy Lord’s name, that perchance the remembrance may draw them nigh unto the most exalted station. It behoveth thee to arise to serve thy Lord. Verily He seeth thee in thy condition. He is, in truth, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>The satans of the Bayan have acted treacherously in the Cause of their Lord, the All-Merciful, and have conspired until the fire of sedition was kindled. By this means they desired to extinguish the light of God in His dominion and to quench the fire of God among His creatures. But their scheming has first recoiled upon themselves, and they have found themselves among the losers. This indeed is the manifest loss. However, the Youth has departed from the City of Mystery, and at the time of His departure the consuls of that city gathered round Him and desired to help the Youth. We found them possessed of manifest love. God will soon raise up from among the kings one who will help His Cause, for He is potent over all things. Grieve not over Our Cause and thine, but make mention of Us throughout all days. Thy Lord will assist thee with truth, for He is the Almighty over all the worlds. Thou knowest that the idolaters have made My family captives from the land of Zawra, and the Youth is in the hands of the oppressors. Yet despite all thou hast heard regarding what hath befallen Us, We remain in a joy that no joy in the heavens or earth can equal, and We remain content with what God hath ordained for Us. Soon will the breezes of glory waft, and the nightingale of gladness will warble in the hearts of the loved ones of thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>He is the One speaking with truth! The fragrance of utterance has wafted throughout contingent being. Blessed is he who perceived it and recognized Him Who came with manifest sovereignty. O peoples of the earth! By God, the Hidden One has come and what was treasured in the Books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, has been made manifest. Beware lest riches prevent you from the ultimate goal, or the forces of those who have violated God’s Covenant, the Lord of all worlds, cause you fear. The Promise has come, and the Promised One stands before all faces, calling out with the most exalted call: “He Who was mentioned in the hearts of the Messengers has come, and that which was hidden in God’s knowledge has appeared.” To this bears witness […] in this exalted station. This is the day when the Ancient Beauty moved toward another palace, despite those who denied the Day of Judgment - the Day in which the veils were rent asunder, the clouds were dispersed, and the lights of the Face appeared from this luminous horizon. Blessed is the one whose strength was not weakened by the forces of the world, and blessed is the upright one who heard, hastened, and said: “Here am I, O Thou Goal of the mystics!” I beseech Thee by Thy manifestation in Thy days and the splendors of the lights of Thy face, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause, speaking in Thy remembrance, and arising to serve Thy Cause - through which the foundations of those who worship idols without any Book or proof from God, the Single One, the All-Informed, were shaken.</p>

<p>Having contemplated the earth and heard its tale and tidings, lo, there emerged from one of the chambers of Paradise a luminous maiden who walked until she stood in mid-air and called out in the most beauteous voice: “O concourse of earth and heaven! I am a maiden named Trustworthiness in the preserved and inscribed Tablet. I have unveiled my countenance by my Master’s leave that you may behold my beauty and majesty, my loveliness, my creation and character, and witness my dark-lined eyes, my crimson cheeks, my radiant brow, and my raven tresses. I adjure you, O concourse of creation, by the Lord of all beings and the Sovereign of the hereafter and of former times, not to veil me with the veils of treachery, greed and passion, nor leave me exposed before them. By the life of God! Treachery is among my enemies, and its nature is rancor and hatred. I beseech you by the One, the Single, not to let my most ardent foe gain mastery over me. Have mercy upon me, O people of the earth, and be not of the wrongdoers.” Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee and made known to thee through allusion what hath befallen Us in the Most Great Prison, that thou mayest be among those who know. We praise God for what hath come upon Us of tribulation in His straight Path. When thou hast read this Tablet and understood its contents, remind My loved ones on My behalf and glorify their faces from the Wronged One, the Stranger.</p>

<p>The Author of the Bayan wept by night and by day at that which hath befallen My Self at the hands of those who deny the All-Merciful. Say: Beware, O people of the Bayan, lest that which was revealed in the Bayan withhold you from His presence, or its letters prevent you from recognizing Him - a recognition which is the most glorious of all things in the estimation of God, the Lord of all beings. Nothing in the kingdom of earth and heaven can be compared with Him - to this doth the Lord of the realms above bear witness from His most exalted station. When the horizon of heaven was illumined and the Morn of eternity breathed forth its fragrance, the Desired One appeared, whereupon the people of the Bayan rose in opposition, save those whom God, the Lord of the Day of Return, pleased to guide. Among them were those who said He had uttered in the Bayan that which was inconsistent with this Revelation, while others claimed He had decreed other than what God had ordained in the Book. Say: Woe unto thee, O heedless one! This is the Day whereon the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Bountiful! Be fair, O people of the Bayan - ye were commanded not to look this Day to the Bayan and its letters, but rather to that which the Revealer of verses ordaineth for you. Say: The Bayan itself curseth you and disowneth you, O ye that are veiled! Thus have We sent down unto thee the Book that thou mayest rejoice and remind the people of that which it containeth from One Who is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

<p>He is the One speaking in His Most Glorious Name in the Kingdom of Utterance. This is a Book sent down by the All-Merciful to him who hath believed and acted according to what was commanded in the Scriptures and Tablets. O peoples of the earth! Adorn your temples with the ornament of tranquility and dignity. Thus have We commanded you aforetime and in this Book. Blessed is he who hath cast away what the people possess and taken what was given him from God, the Lord of all men. We counsel thee and those who have believed to manifest spiritual qualities and goodly, virtuous deeds, that there may appear from you what beseemeth you and this Day which every Book and every Messenger who came with the truth from God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Bestower, hath extolled. Behold, O people, what hath appeared and shone forth from the horizon of Revelation, then judge it with fairness and follow not every doubtful idolater. The Promise hath come, and this is the Promised One Who calleth out with the most exalted call amidst the peoples. He hath desired naught for Himself, as testifieth He Who speaketh the truth, and behind Him is the Mother Book. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Master of all mankind. Glory be upon those who have attained to hearkening unto the Call when it was raised between earth and heaven from God, the Lord of the Day of Mutual Divorce.</p>

<p>He is the One dawning from the horizon of the heaven of utterance! This is a Book which the All-Merciful has sent down to him whose name was mentioned before the Wronged One in this remote spot. This is a Day whereon the Balance has spoken: “O peoples of the earth! The Dayspring of Justice has appeared with a manifest Command, and the Path has cried out: ‘To Me, to Me, O heedless ones!’” There is nothing but proclaims the truth in remembrance of this Mighty News, whereby the limbs of idols have quaked and every obstinate oppressor has wailed. This is a Day whereon the seas have surged and the fragrance of God, the Lord of all worlds, has wafted. The verses have been sent down and the clear tokens have appeared, yet the people remain veiled by a thick veil. Blessed is the powerful one whom the doubts of the divines have not weakened, and the steadfast one whom the might of the oppressors has not caused to slip. When the wine of revelation has seized thee and the breezes of inspiration have attracted thee, say: “O Lord of all beings and Sovereign of days! I beseech Thee by the Word which Thou hast made a sword for the polytheists and a light for those near unto Thee, and by Thy hidden mysteries in Thy Books and Tablets and Scriptures, to make me steadfast in Thy love, firm in service to Thy Cause, and speaking Thy praise amidst Thy creation. Then write down for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will draw me nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Thou art verily the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.”</p>

A Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down for whosoever hath hearkened to the Call and answered his Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous, on a Day whereon every heedless one turned away, every idolater denied, and every wrongdoer disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds. The Name of Bounty hath mentioned thee, wherefore We make mention of thee, and I am the All-Knowing Rememberer. Say: O peoples of the earth!

The Most Great Spectacle hath appeared and the Lord of Destiny is established upon the throne of His Great Name. Turn ye unto Him and be not of them that turn aside.

A missive from the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, unto him who hath drunk of My sealed wine, that he may rejoice and be of them who have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon on a Day whereon the Herald proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Possessor of the Invisible and the Visible. My Name Jamal, upon him be My glory, hath made mention of thee. We make mention of thee in a Tablet whereunto nothing in all creation can compare, and I am, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Hearken unto the Call that hath been raised from the precincts of the Prison - verily there is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Be thou vocal in My praise, and turn unto My horizon, and make mention of My Forbidden Name through which the foundation of every learned one was shaken and the hearts of all who are endued with understanding were perturbed, save whom God, the Lord of the Kingdom, did will. Thus hath the Tongue of Revelation spoken, as the Wronged One was established upon the throne of dominion. Let not the affairs of men grieve thee. Hold thou fast unto the cord of the tender mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Loving. Convey My remembrance unto My loved ones who have believed in God, the Lord of the Invisible and the Visible. We counsel them with that which We counseled Our servants aforetime and with that which hath been sent down in a Preserved Tablet. The Glory shining resplendent from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon My servants who have not broken My Covenant and My Testament, and who have acted in accordance with that which they were bidden in My perspicuous Book.</p>

Read ye what is easily accessible thereof, then follow what the Spirit casteth of the verses of His Lord, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Ever-Present. Beware lest the intimations of those who cling to vain imaginings sadden you. Rend ye asunder the veils through My Name, the Help in Peril over those in the invisible and visible realms. We have sent down in every matter clear verses. Blessed is he who hath heard and turned unto God, the Mighty, the Beloved. The ocean of utterance hath surged in the days of God, the Path hath been laid, and this Hidden Tablet hath been sent down. Verily thou, O thou who hast turned to the Countenance, hearken unto the call of the Wronged One from the direction of His Most Great Prison, this Forbidden Station, that the call may attract thee to a station that shall never be followed by extinction, nor be overtaken by the doubts of those who have denied God, the Mighty, the Loving. Blessed art thou for having drunk from the Kawthar of divine knowledge and turned unto God, the Lord of the visible and invisible. This, verily, is a manifest bounty.

We testify that thy hesitation was better in the sight of God than those who claimed acceptance but from whom appeared that which appeared not from those of old. We perceive from thee the fragrance of love, wherefore We have sent down Tablets unto thee before, and this glorious Tablet. Thy Lord knoweth what no one else knoweth.

Reflect upon the greatness of God’s Cause and His sovereignty, then enter into it, detached from all who are on earth. This is better for thee, if thou be of them that know. He hath desired naught for Himself - My imprisonment and tribulation bear witness to this, blessed are the fair-minded. For him who turneth unto Him, He ordaineth what is best for him.

This is a Book sent down in truth unto him who turned to God when every heedless and remote one turned away from Him. We entered into prison and summoned all unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Among the people was he who was attracted by the call of God and hastened with his whole being and essence unto the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And among them was he who cast God behind him by following those who disbelieved in God and His signs when He appeared with manifest sovereignty. Thy letter was received and We found from it the fragrance of devotion.

When thou dost find the fragrance of God from the traces of His Pen, say: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, for having mentioned me and guided me unto Thy straight path.

Among them are those who turned away from Me and those who turned toward My luminous countenance. Verily, he who turned toward Me is among the people of Baha in the Tablet of Eternity, and he who turned away is in manifest loss. Will what they possess benefit them and will what they have gathered suffice them? No one has any protector today except he who has cast away vain imaginings and held fast to this firm cord.

Thus have We sent down the verses to you and dispatched them to you that you may be among the thankful ones. When you attain unto them, read them to those in whom you find the fragrance of the mercy of their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Verily, he who has found its fragrance, by God, the veils of creation and the allusions of the polytheists will not prevent him.

Among the deniers are they who cling to the Bayan and turn away from the All-Merciful. These are assuredly the companions of the fire. Say: By God! Whoso denieth this Cause shall never be able to establish any cause in all creation. To this doth God’s tongue testify from the most exalted Paradise. The Bayan is but a leaf amongst the leaves of My Paradise. Thus hath the All-Merciful informed you in the Scriptures and Tablets. That which is in the hands of men cannot be compared with the Word of God. Blessed is he who hath inhaled the fragrance of the Intended One and hath arisen to help His Cause amongst the servants. Hold fast to the cord of favors, then make mention of thy Lord in such wise as to cause the dead to arise. Thus have We adorned thy brow with the crown of remembrance and utterance. Be thou thankful and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Revealer of verses and Lord of all men!”</p>

<p>The Divine Lamp is visible amidst the winds and bears witness through divine destiny and decree. The events of the world and oppression of nations cannot prevent it from appearing and giving light. It has not taken glass and crystal for its own protection, and has sought eternal illumination for all. Yet the servants have attempted to extinguish the light with swords of hatred. We beseech God to illumine them with the light of justice and adorn them with the ornament of fairness. Verily He is the Lord of gifts and favors.</p>
<p>O Light of God! His honor the Observer, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, made mention of thee, and likewise of the mother and sister. We beseech God not to deprive any from the Euphrates of mercy and the waves of the ocean of loving-kindness. The whole world was created for this blessed Day, yet the people have arisen in rejection and blindness, and have issued the decree for shedding His blood. Such is the condition of the heedless and the deed of the opposers.</p>
<p>Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having remembered us in Thy prison and revealed unto us that which draws us to the horizon of Thy manifestation. O Lord! Illumine our faces with the lights of Thy countenance, then ordain for us the reward of those who have attained Thy presence and drunk the choice wine of Thy utterance. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Glory be upon you and upon those who have attained the recognition of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>From Jinab-i-Naqdali, upon him be the Glory of God. In His Name, the One Who has dominion over all things! Among the people are those who have turned away from the Truth by following the vain imaginings of those whom knowledge has deluded, and thus they have been prevented from hearkening to the call of the Lord of Names, which has been raised in truth: “There is no God but I, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting.” Among them are those who have clung to the vain imaginings of the people of the Bayan, and thus have been kept back from the All-Merciful. Say: By God! What was revealed aforetime will profit you not today, except through your recognition of this Book which has been inscribed by the Pen of Revelation from God, the Mighty, the Beloved. There is no escape for anyone today, nor refuge for any soul - thus has it been ordained in the Tablet, did ye but know. The Bayan had foretold what later came to pass, saying: “When the Call is raised, let not yourselves be veiled by the Bayan and what was revealed therein. Hasten ye unto the All-Merciful and follow not every heedless, limited one.” Beware lest the world beguile you, or the veils of names keep you back from Him through Whom every decreed matter has been established. Yet when the Call was raised and the Hidden was revealed, they turned away from it, unaware. Those who have attained to recognition - these are the manifestations of the Face amidst creation, upon whom the near-stationed angels shower their prayers. Hold fast to that which ye have been commanded by God, and grieve not for what has befallen you at the hands of the oppressors.</p>

Take comfort in My remembrance and forget those who have denied My Self, for this is the best counsel shouldst thou be of them that know. Thus hath the tongue of thy Lord spoken out of love for thee, that thou mightest rejoice within thyself and be of them that take delight in the remembrance of God. And upon thee be glory, and upon whosoever hath detached himself from them that have disbelieved and associated partners with God, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>

<p>This is a Book from Us to him who hath sought the sanctuary of his Lord’s presence, and journeyed from his home to the Most Great House, the scene of his Lord’s glory, the All-Praised, and entered the Garden of Paradise until he attained the presence of God and heard the melodies of God, the Powerful, the Glorious, the Best-Beloved. Upon him shone the lights of the countenance from this Youth, Whom He hath sent with the truth and dispatched unto every witness and witnessed thing, and made to speak with the verses of His glory, and manifested at the station of His Self amongst His creatures, whereat the pillars of existence were shaken. Among the people are those who turned away and disbelieved in God their Lord, and those who believed and sought shelter beneath this extended shade.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, O servant, in that thou hast attained the presence of God and drunk the cup of inner meanings from the hand of utterance in this Paradise which God hath sanctified from allusions and limitations. And now hath risen the sun of leave from the horizon of thy Lord’s command, and We grant thee permission to return to thy dwelling, that through thee the people of heedlessness may arise. Forget not thy Lord, but rather remember Him amongst His creatures. This is what hath been ordained for thee from God, the Mighty, the Witnessed. And the Spirit and glory and splendor rest upon thee and upon those who have purified their faces for God, the Powerful, the Glorious, the All-Desired.</p>

I beseech Thee, by Thy name whereby the goodly pearls of Thy wisdom and Thine utterance were brought forth out of the treasuries of the hearts of such of Thy servants as are nigh unto Thee, and through which the Day-Star of Thy name, the Compassionate, hath shed its radiance upon all that are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth, to supply me, by Thy grace and bounty, with Thy wondrous and hidden bounties.</p>
<p>These are the earliest days of my life, O my God, which Thou hast linked with Thine own days. Now that Thou hast conferred upon me so great an honor, withhold not from me the things Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones.</p>
<p>I am, O my God, but a tiny seed which Thou hast sown in the soil of Thy love, and caused to spring forth by the hand of Thy bounty. This seed craveth, therefore, in its inmost being, for the waters of Thy mercy and the living fountain of Thy grace. Send down upon it, from the heaven of Thy loving-kindness, that which will enable it to flourish beneath Thy shadow and within the borders of Thy court.

O servant! Blessed art thou for having recognized the Truth and turned away from him who denied the All-Merciful and was recorded as a wretched one in the Mother Book. Be thou steadfast in the love of God and His Cause, then aid Him through utterance. Thus doth the All-Merciful command thee at a time when He was imprisoned by the hands of the oppressors. When tribulations overtake thee in My path, remember thou My tribulation and My exile and My imprisonment. Thus do We impart unto thee from the presence of One mighty and wise. By My life! The day is approaching when We will have rolled up the world and all that is therein, and spread out a new order in its stead. He, verily, hath power over all things. Sanctify thy heart for My remembrance and thine ear for hearkening unto My verses, then turn thy face toward the Spot wherein the throne of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, is established. Say: O my Lord! Praise be to Thee for having enabled me to recognize the Manifestation of Thyself and caused me to turn toward the Kaaba of Thy reunion and meeting with Thee. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the heaven was cleft asunder and the earth was rent to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for him who turned away from all else save Thee and turned unto Thee, and to decree for me a seat of truth with Thee in the Most Glorious Pavilion.

<p>The Most Holy, The Most Great. This is a Book which hath been sent down in truth from the presence of One mighty and wise. It speaketh that I am the Prisoner in this mighty Prison. O My loved ones! Look not today to your own selves but rather to the Self of God, if ye be of them that comprehend. Ponder not upon that which would bring comfort to your bodies, but rather upon that which would exalt My remembrance amongst the worlds. Grieve not at anything, for He is with you. Soon will He open before you a gate whereby your affairs shall prosper both in this world and in the next. A mighty station is yours if ye gather together for the triumph of God and His Faith. Beware lest ye differ in the Cause of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. All that hath been revealed in the Bayan is My remembrance, and all that hath been revealed in this Manifestation is the embellishment of Mine Own Self, which We have created for My Temple, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. My outward calleth unto My inward, and My inward unto My outward. There is none other in the kingdom save Me, yet the people are in manifest heedlessness. Verily the Branches that have branched from the Divine Lote-Tree are My evidences amongst My creatures and My breezes between the heavens and earth. See ye any partner or peer unto God, your Lord? Nay, by the Lord of the worlds! Speak not of that which God hath not permitted you. Fear ye the All-Merciful, and be of them that are endued with insight. Grieve not thou, for nothing escapeth the knowledge of thy Lord. He is cognizant of all things. Remind the people with wisdom from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>

Verily there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. His is the Command and the Creation. He doeth what He willeth through His word “Be” and it is. None can gainsay His command. Through the sovereignty of His Will, He ordaineth whatsoever He hath decreed, and He, verily, is the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.

Say: In this departure are signs that none shall comprehend save God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Praised. God shall soon make manifest that which hath been concealed from the eyes of them that are veiled, and the Herald of the Spirit shall cry out in the midst of heaven, saying: This is the Day whereon God shall establish Himself upon the throne of victory and seize them that have tyrannized upon the earth - and this is a truth well-known. O people of the Bayan! Grieve not at this, but put your trust in God, if ye be of them that know. Say: The breezes of might shall waft, and God’s Cause shall be made manifest in truth, and all shall hasten unto Him. Thus do We impart unto you that which shall tranquilize your hearts, that ye may be of them that are well-assured.

Know thou that We have been faithful and shall continue to be faithful - nay rather, through Us hath faithfulness been made manifest among all the worlds. And verily We have fulfilled all that We promised unto you, and by this was kindled the fire of jealousy in the breasts of that company, such that they shall find no rest upon their seats until they have shed My blood - if thou be of them that understand. And after the Youth hath departed from your midst, it behooveth you to remain steadfast in faithfulness to My Cause, than which nothing else standeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth, or in what was or what shall be - if thou be of them that perceive. By God! Then shall all things weep, and beyond them the hosts of holiness behind the veils of mighty glory. Soon shalt thou witness the turning away of them that turn aside from this Beauty, through Whom have shone forth the suns of the Command and appeared the signs of God and emerged the pearls of knowledge and risen the Beauty of the Unseen with luminous sovereignty.

We testify that thou hast attained unto that which was inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds, and thou hast attained to the presence and drunk the choice wine of reunion from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath cast away the world and taken that which he was bidden by the One Who commandeth, the All-Wise.

This is the Day of mention and praise, and the Day of steadfastness and faithfulness. The tongue was created for this Day and the ears for hearing the Call.

Be steadfast with such steadfastness as no authority of princes can shake, and speak forth with such utterance as the clamor of the heedless cannot silence.

I beseech Thee by the joy of Thy Beloved at His ascension unto Thee, and by the rapture of the Primal Point at the mention of the Most Glorious, and by Thy radiant and resplendent light shining from the horizon of the heaven of Thy Revelation, to make me in all conditions one who speaketh forth Thy Name, who gazeth toward Thy horizon, who moveth by Thy will, and who holdeth fast to the hem of Thy robe. O my Lord! Thou seest me enkindled with the fire of Thy love. I beseech Thee to aid me to perform such deeds as befit Thy Revelation and Thy days.

I do not forget him who remembers Me, and I am a companion to him who loves Me, and One Who remembers him who desires Me, and a fortress to him who turns his face toward My countenance, and a helper to him who advances toward My direction, and a protector to him who calls upon Me, and a succorer to him who seeks succor from Me. Grieve not over anything - all good is treasured for My pure ones, which We send down from the heaven of My grace by My leave and will. Rejoice in that We have caused thee to hear My melody and My warbling and My remembrance and My call. Blessed is the soul that hath been set ablaze with the fire of My love and hath attained unto My presence and sought refuge in My court and heard My call and soared in My atmosphere and placed its trust in My Self and fled from all else beside Me. Verily he is of the people of the kingdoms of My might and My dominion. Upon him be My blessings and My mercy and My benediction. Thus have We mentioned thee and preferred thee that thou mayest be of the thankful ones. Say: O my God! Thou seest my burning in separation from Thee and my longing for the dawning-place of Thy reunion. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the dawn of unity broke forth and the face of detachment was illumined, that Thou make me one who circles around Thee in all Thy worlds.

<p>O people of God! This is His Day and His Cause. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto true divine unity. The people of the past never attained the fragrance of unity, much less its station. Each day they would ascribe a partner unto God, and yet deemed themselves to be believers in His unity. And on the Day of Judgment their rank and station became evident to the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise. After twelve hundred years of supplication, yearning, searching and hope, they martyred the Pride of the World and Lord of Nations with the most grievous torment. True unity is to turn unto the horizon of the one Manifestation; to exceed this is accounted as polytheism in the Book of God. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to illumine all with the light of His unity and oneness, and to draw them nigh unto Him. Verily He is the Almighty, the One Who doeth as He willeth through His firm and mighty command.</p>

He made no mention of the owners of treasures and riches and cities and regions and ranks and thousands, but made mention of the owner of a camel. All matters depend upon and are suspended by the utterance of the All-Merciful. He bestowed such honor and favor upon the she-camel of Salih that mention of it has flowed and been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen in most of the Books, and likewise the servants upon the pulpits speak in its praise and glorification. Praise the Goal of the world Who caused you to attain that which was recorded and inscribed in the divine scrolls and books. Turn your face toward God, then act according to what you were commanded in His Book. Hold fast to the Book and act according to its ordinances. This is the Most Exalted Word that hath appeared from the treasury of the Most Exalted Pen. If you act according to what was mentioned, the mercy and blessing will descend from the heaven of the favor of the Lord of Lords. He is the Generous, He is the Merciful, and He is the Bestower, the Kind.</p>

I testify that I know not what lieth within the treasuries of Thy knowledge, and Thou knowest what is with me. Thou art in truth the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the wonders of Thy bounty and the manifestations of Thy favors to grant me one who will inherit from me. Thou art, verily, the Best of inheritors. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.”</p>

<p>O Mohsen! Hearken unto the Call of the Wronged One, Who hath come with the truth from the heaven of might by His Own sovereign will. The hosts of the world cannot prevent Him. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Encompassing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. By God! The Call hath been raised once in Baghdad and again in the Land of Mystery, and in this spot which hath been named the Most Great Prison by My Most Exalted Pen. And I am, verily, powerful over whatsoever I will. There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Great. We have manifested that which lay hidden in knowledge and concealed in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds. Among the people are those who turned away, and those who uttered that which caused the hearts of them that are nigh to be consumed. The first to turn away were the divines of the land, and through them the servants objected and committed that which caused every illumined heart to lament. Blessed art thou for having turned towards the Wronged One and attained unto the traces of His Most Exalted Pen. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this manifest grace. We have revealed the clear proofs and sent down the verses as a bounty from Us, and We are verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Thus hath the ocean of utterance surged from the Pen of the Most Merciful and the fragrance of the garment been diffused. Blessed is he who hath found and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Beloved of the worlds, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of all in the heavens and on earth.”</p>

<p>O Muhammad-Baqir! O Muhammad-i-Qabl-i-Baqir! In the name of the All-Knowing Speaker! Your cries, lamentations and wailing in separation from the Beloved of all worlds have been heard. God, exalted be His glory, brought these creatures from nothingness into being for the recognition of this blessed Day and the knowledge of Him Who hath appeared therein with His Name, the One Who holdeth sway over the worlds. There is and hath been no doubt that all were created for attainment unto His presence, and the One True Beloved hath ever loved and loveth the nearness of His friends. The divine Tablets and heavenly Books bear witness unto that which hath been mentioned. However, the rebellious, heedless and transgressing souls have become the cause and reason of prevention. Be not grieved by this prevention, for His Will is supreme and His Purpose prevailing. The Supreme Pen recordeth the reward of attainment unto His presence for whomsoever He willeth. Verily thy Lord is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou seest me turning toward Thy Kingdom and beseeching from the ocean of Thy bounty that which beseemeth the heaven of Thy generosity and grace. O Lord! Deny me not that which lieth with Thee. Ordain for me the reward of one who hath attained unto the vision of Thy countenance and circumambulated around Thy throne. Verily Thou art the Almighty Whom the circumstances of creation cannot frustrate, nor can the hosts of the oppressors prevent. Praise be unto God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

God drove them away through His command and made them to be among the losers. How many a learned one hath been debarred from My days, and hath neither inhaled the fragrance of My raiment nor heard My sweet call which hath been raised betwixt earth and heaven, while thou didst turn unto Me and didst recognize and win this mighty and wondrous Cause, whereby feet have slipped and idols have lamented and the pillars of every ignorant one remote from God have been shaken. Know thou the station of turning unto God, then preserve it through the name of thy Lord, the All-Subduing, the Almighty.

Strive to connect thy heart to the Most Great Ocean. In this way, the divine bounty will ever encompass thee. All that the wealthy pride themselves upon today, and the learned boast of, and the possessors of riches are made vain by - all shall pass away. Make a mighty effort, that thou mayest become in those regions and parts a cause for the exaltation of the Word of God. This is the station wherein, shouldst thou attain unto it, thou shalt be recorded in the Divine Book as one of the people of the immortal Kingdom.

Praise be to God that thou hast attained His mention and been enabled to recognize Him. God willing, thou shalt take up thy station beneath the Lote-Tree of grace in such wise that all creation shall testify thereto. Be thou in all conditions firmly attached to the grace of God, clinging to His hem, speaking His praise, and severed from those who have disbelieved and turned away when God came with a manifest light.

That which was hidden from the beginning of creation until now has been made manifest. Yet all the divines of this age are engaged in cursing and denunciation. Glory be to God! The former faction, who counted themselves the most learned, most God-fearing and most ascetic in the world, committed that which no previous factions had done. In the early years, both learned and ignorant would curse the Lord of the world and issue decrees for His death. What has been the fruit of the words, deeds and actions of those souls over twelve hundred years, and what has become of them? Man is bewildered, nay the world is bewildered. Blessed is the soul that became aware of that faction’s loss and preserved itself from the whisperings of the turbaned ones through the name of Truth. Give thanks to the Aim of the world that He remembered thee in the Most Great Prison, and arise with complete steadfastness in the Cause of the Lord of all names.

Say: Praise be to Thee for having given me to drink, from the hand of Thy bounty, the wine of Thy knowledge, and for having guided me to Thy path, and shown me Thy signs, and sent down upon me from the heaven of Thy generosity the tokens of Thy greatness. I beseech Thee, O Creator of the world, by the Most Great Sea Who walketh in the prison and uttereth that whereby the fragrance of revelation and inspiration hath been diffused among Thy servants and Thy creatures, and by the lights of Thy countenance and the power of Thy most exalted Word, to ordain for this handmaiden of Thine the good of this world and the next. There is no God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Write down, then, for me and for Thy devoted handmaidens that which will draw us nigh unto Thee and exalt us through Thy name amongst Thy handmaidens. O my Lord! Thou seest Thy handmaiden turning unto Thee, detached from all else but Thee, and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy pardon and bounty. I beseech Thee to open before her face, through the key of Thy Most Great Name, the doors of grace and bestowal. Verily, Thou art the Potent over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things past and future. Light and glory and praise and laudation rest upon Thy loved ones and chosen ones and trustees, who broke not Thy Covenant and Testament, and who arose to aid Thy Cause with such power as to shake the hearts of the doubtful and the heedless. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>O Leaf of Paradise! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious! God is Most Glorious! O Leaf of Paradise! Verily the Hidden One hath come with the truth, yet the people understand not. And the Treasured One hath appeared through grace, yet the people perceive not. The Most Exalted Horizon hath been illumined through the manifestation of the Lord of all beings, yet the people recognize not. This is He Who was promised in the books of old, and before Whose name the Kingdom of Names hath bowed down. To this testifieth he who hath with him a perspicuous Book. Verily the Bayan and whatsoever was revealed therein is like a ring upon My finger. To this do testify the dwellers of Paradise and beyond them honored servants. Blessed is the strong one whom the cawing of the wicked weakeneth not, and the steadfast one whom the clamor of every ignorant outcast causeth not to sit. I give glad-tidings unto My servants of My remembrance and My bounty which hath preceded existence. O handmaidens of the All-Merciful in all lands! We have remembered each one of you with that which no treasures or riches can equal, and We bid you show forth the Most Great Steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of those who turned away from the Truth did slip when it came with manifest sovereignty. Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto his Goal and the handmaiden who hath believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon them and upon every handmaiden who hath turned and hearkened and responded when the Call was raised between earth and heaven, and the unitarians hastened to the horizon of Manifestation.</p>

The Leaf of the Divine Lote-Tree makes mention of you and has granted from the ocean of utterance that which cannot be equaled by all the treasures of the world. Today the winds of self and passion and ignorance and blindness have caused most of the leaves of the world to fall and become deprived of the Lote-Tree, while you through boundless grace and infinite mercy have clung to it, gazed upon it and held fast to it. The grace of God, exalted be His glory, took hold of you and guided you to His straight path. You heard the call of the Wronged One and attained His presence. Give thanks to your Lord for this great bounty. His remembrance is the Sovereign of all remembrance and His Cause is the Sovereign of all causes. Convey My greetings to the handmaidens in that land who are sanctified and detached from names and stories of old. O My leaves and My handmaidens! You have ever been remembered and have attained His grace. That which is now necessary and obligatory is steadfastness. Hold fast unto it. Blessed is the handmaiden who has detached herself from all else save God and has held fast to His firm cord and His manifest Command. The glory from Us be upon you and upon them and upon those women who have believed in God and have said: “We believe in Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world, and we have turned unto Thee, O Thou the Beloved of those who are in the heavens and on earth.”</p>

Countless books have appeared, and none but God can reckon their number. One ray from the lights of the Day Star of His grace hath appeared in the form of the sun, becoming the educator and protector of the world, illumining it with its light. Were We to interpret but one letter of the Book, it would lead to an entire world and the interpretation of that letter would have no end. O people of God!

Ye have drunk from the ocean of divine knowledge, and have attained unto the hearing of His Word, and are illumined by the light of His grace. Preserve this station through His Name. Say: O my God, my Adored One! From Thee have I come, and unto Thee have I returned. Illumine my heart with the light of Thy knowledge. Thou art He Whose power the might of the world and of nations hath failed to withhold. From a single effulgence of the Day Star of Thy generosity, oceans of bounty have appeared, and from one manifestation of the Day Star of Thy munificence, the world of existence came into being. O my Lord! Remove from me whatsoever is unworthy of Thy days, and grant me that which is meet. Thou art the Bestower Whose bounty knoweth no bounds.

This is the Day of Beauty and the hour belongs to the King of Glory, yet I have taken up the pen of inscription to express matters of love or to soar to the utmost stations of love and affection. But this is most difficult, for the wings of this dove have been clipped by the scissors of the suspicions of the servants. How can one whose wings are clipped have the power to soar alongside the falcon of might? This is extremely remote and impossible. All this is by God’s command and nothing appears except by His leave. Yes, unless the Unseen Grace stretches forth Its bounteous hand from the pocket of mercy and bestows wings of success, so that with one wing we might transcend contingent being and with the other wing pass beyond the kingdoms of existence and the universes, and cross the distant stations of days whose measure is fifty thousand years in a single step, and attain in less than the twinkling of an eye to the highest degrees of nearness and reunion. All this is from God’s grace which He bestows upon whomsoever He wishes among His creation. Verily He has power over whatsoever He wishes and He is the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And this is the station of the spiritual messenger who moves by the confirmation of light and circumambulates the Throne of manifestation, and afterwards remembers all the dwellers of the pavilion.</p>

And likewise there befell Him such oppression from the oppressors as caused grief to the Concourse on High. And when the Luminary of God’s Will, exalted be His glory, illumined the horizons, the people of discord emerged from their ambush and, with swords of hatred and animosity, attempted to slay the Lord of Names.

Although letters have been sent in Arabic, Persian and all kinds of ways, nevertheless love is expressed anew that you should, God willing, follow that departed one in all matters pertaining to the material world. This will surely be the nearest means of drawing nigh unto God. That is, you should conduct yourself with people in the same way as he conducted himself with them. The believer lives with eternal, everlasting life in the most exalted horizon of detachment and the most holy Lote-Tree of sanctity, and death does not overtake him. He watches over his own affairs and is aware of his people. If he observes no goodness in those associated with him, he will surely raise his voice in complaint in the Supreme Concourse, and that complaint will surely have its effect and return upon his people. In any case, you must, God willing, act in such a way that all the inhabitants of the Supreme Concourse and the angels brought nigh will rejoice. For example, as Aqa Mirza Muhammad was engaged in service during his time, if he continues now as before, it will surely be acceptable.

<p>O Aqa Mirza Rida-Quli! He is God, the Exalted! Although the book of lovers cannot be completed through utterance, and the letter of the yearning ones cannot be finished by the pen of possibility, yet if one cannot attain an ocean of reunion, one must be content with a dewdrop of remembrance. For some time no bird has taken wing from the city of nearness to Sheba, and no nightingale has appeared in the rose garden. It seems that either the custom of fidelity has vanished from the people of eternity, or the free spirits no longer harbor grief of separation in their hearts, or else the friends do not need a material messenger to reach their goal and are not veiled by the barrier of remoteness. Without a messenger they send letters, and with the heart they share secrets. Without a pen they write, and without meeting they seek reunion, and in the very midst of separation they attain to nearness. Yes, these stations are true, but they are the portion of the heart, not the share of water and clay. Though the spirit may rejoice in spiritual sustenance, yet the body requires physical nourishment. The outward ear needs an outer melody, while the inner ear yearns for divine harmonies. The eye of mystery beholds eternal beauty, while the physical eye witnesses horizonal majesty. Therefore what is acceptable is to distribute and apportion all stations in their proper measure.</p>

<p>Praise be to God! From among the wondrous bounties of God, the spiritual sustenance is being sent down in every moment from the heaven of His Will. But blessed is the soul that attains unto it. Today all deeds and stations depend upon the recognition of God and acceptance of Him. For example, if today a handmaiden among the handmaidens of the world attains to the recognition of God and acknowledges His unity and oneness, she is regarded before God as greater and more distinguished than all the queens of the world who have not been honored with the grace of faith. Noble birth and exalted lineage are praiseworthy when adorned with the love of God; otherwise, if one does not attain to this most exalted station, one has not been and will never be mentioned in the presence of God. Give thanks to the Ancient Lord that thou hast turned to the Dawning-Place of His Cause and drunk the water of His love. Guard this station as thou wouldst guard thine eye, for it will accompany thee in all the worlds, while all else, even if it be all the treasures of the world, will perish and come to naught.

<p>Praise be to God that, through His infinite bounty, the Sun of the Primal Word hath risen and shineth forth from the horizon of the heaven of Will. Whosoever hath turned unto Him is accounted as being of Him.

Yet when the Sun of reunion dawned and the Ocean of attainment was made manifest, all remained veiled and deprived, save whom thy Lord did choose. Therefore, whosoever hath today attained unto the most pure wine that floweth and circulateth from the direction of the Most Great Scene must at all times be occupied with thanksgiving to the Lord of all possibility, that He hath enabled him and guided him to the shore of the sea of oneness.

Today all dwell in one place: whosoever hath ascended unto the heaven of recognition and hath known the Dawning-Place of the Cause of the All-Merciful is reckoned before the Truth as one of the people of truth and is witnessed as such. And whosoever is debarred therefrom is accounted among the people of loss. Divine power hath encompassed all mankind, though this encompassing is now veiled by reason of the veils of the people. Ere long shall the Hand of Power rend asunder these veils and shrouds, and the faces of His loved ones shall shine forth like brilliant stars throughout all regions, and their station shall become evident and manifest unto all the peoples of the world. Now that in these days of the All-Merciful ye have attained unto the waters of life, ye must strive that all may partake of this most pure wine and turn with heart and soul toward the court of the All-Merciful. We beseech God to aid thee to serve Him and to make thee one who remembereth Him through His remembrance and who speaketh forth His Name and acteth according to that which He loveth and is pleased with. He, verily, is the Goal in the beginning and in the end.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-Taqi - upon him and upon his father be the Glory of God - in the name of the One Incomparable Knower!</p>
<p>Praise be to God that in the springtime of youth thou hast attained unto the recognition of the Lord of all Return. Know thou the value of this heavenly bounty. By the life of God! Whatever is hidden or manifest cannot compare with it. Today, due to the lack of capacity in the earth, the station of those who have turned to God and are assured is hidden and concealed from views and eyes. However, I swear by the Sun of the heaven of the All-Merciful’s knowledge that a day shall appear on earth which will tell of the degrees and stations of those holy souls. Blessed is the one who today has attained unto what God has willed and has acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this most great favor and say:</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O my God, my Beloved, and my Heart’s Desire, by the Most Exalted Word whereby Thou hast subdued earth and heaven and caused all things to speak, to strengthen me to stand firm in Thy Cause and in Thy love. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The Glory be upon thee and upon thy father and thy brothers and upon whosoever hath held fast unto the Sure Handle on this Day wherein the Lord of all beings doth proclaim: There is none other God but Me, the Speaker, the All-Seeing.</p>

From the Hand of the Favor of the Lord of Names thou hast drunk the Kawthar of immortality, which is the recognition of the Ancient Being and the Lord of all nations. However, the Most Exalted Pen counseleth you to preserve that which He hath bestowed, for the opposers have ever lain in wait for those who have turned towards Him. Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me to Thy most exalted horizon and for having caused me to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy mighty signs. I beseech Thee by the Manifestations of Thy Revelation and the Daysprings of Thy inspiration to protect me from the evil of Thine enemies who have disbelieved in Thee and in Thy signs and have denied that which hath appeared from Thy presence. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and directing my face to the lights of Thy countenance. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Pen to ordain for me the good of this world and of the world to come. Verily Thou art the Lord of the Most Great Throne and of the Exalted Seat. Praise be unto Thee, O Manifest Light and Lord of the heavens and earth. The Glory of God be upon thee and upon them that have believed in God, the Lord of the worlds.

<p>Praise be to God that thou hast been successful in turning towards Him in days when the mystics, divines, men of letters and princes of the earth have turned away from the Truth, save those whom God hath willed. This station is so great that, by the truth, none upon earth can be compared with it. Through God’s grace, remain firm and joyous, and free and detached from all else. The Supreme Pen hath informed all of the cawing of the crow and the croaking of the raven. God, the Exalted, will, God willing, protect all and give them to drink from the Kawthar of steadfastness. This day belongeth unto God, for in previous Books it was mentioned and recorded as the Day of God. Exalted is the station of one who hath attained unto supreme steadfastness and remained firm and steadfast in the Cause of God. Thy services and efforts are known and remembered before God. May God willing, thou shalt attain unto His endless bounties. The reward of no one hath been, nor ever shall be, lost before God.

Make copies of these and send them to various regions, that perchance the people may remember what was revealed therein and be among those who remember. Furthermore, certain matters have arisen in this land that have not occurred from the beginning of creation until now - you will hear of these from those who return. Quickly deliver copies of the Persian Tablets to His Holiness Ismu’llah-i-Munir and His Holiness Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin. Send as many wondrous verses as possible to Nayriz and the Land of the Sultan. Some Tablets in the script of revelation were sent from this servant present before the Throne, as there was no time for signing. Have Salman return to the cities of the All-Merciful as soon as possible - this is closest to righteousness. Make haste without fail. God willing, may you be occupied at all times with the remembrance of the Beloved of the worlds and be detached from all else. Some insignificant, unworthy items were sent specially for certain loved ones of God - deliver these to them. However, since they are from God, they will assuredly be more precious than all else.

That which befell thee hath been mentioned before the Face, and thy deed hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of the world and the Lord of the nations, for having made known unto me Thy straight path and enabled me to acknowledge Thee on a day when most of the servants denied Thee, and made me turn toward Thee when the people of the lands turned away. I beseech Thee, O Thou King of existence and Lord of the seen and the unseen, to assist me to serve Thy Cause amidst Thy creatures and to make me ever gaze toward Thee in all conditions. Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Most Generous. O my Lord! Thou seest the poor one turning toward the horizon of Thy riches.

Be thou thankful unto God for having attained unto His recognition and drunk the Kawthar of certitude from the hands of His bounty, and become of those who have attained. Be thou steadfast in the Cause through God’s might and power, then rest assured in God’s grace, for verily His grace sufficeth thee above all the worlds.

O Mohsen, bear witness with thy tongue and heart, even as the Dove hath testified upon the sacred and exalted branches, that He is God, there is none other God but Him, and that Ali-before-Nabil is the Dawning-Place of His Cause, and His Light, and His Radiance, and His Glory unto all who are in the heavens and on earth, and He was indeed knowing of all things. Through Him the Resurrection was established and the Hour appeared, and the Bridge was set upon the Balance of the name Ali. Through Him the Sun shone forth and the treasures of the earth were revealed of precious jewels of might. Through Him the Face appeared and Beauty was manifested from the Dayspring of a name most luminous. And thou, O Mohsen, do thou show kindness unto thyself, then unto the people of God who are with thee, then unto those who follow God’s decree in the atomic realm of immortality and were possessed of evident certitude, and who answered God’s call within their souls and were upon a straight path. Thus have We cast upon thee the word of truth and inspired thee with that which rejoiceth thy spirit, and have remembered thee with a wondrous holy tongue.

<p>O Muhammad! Hearken unto My call once again, even as thou didst hearken before, when thou didst enter the Garden of Paradise, the Seat of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, and didst hear His voice with thine ears, and attain His presence, and wert of them that have attained. Forget not My covenant and My remembrance. Speak forth amongst My servants in praise of My Self. Thus did We command thee before, and thus do We command thee at all times, that thou mayest be of them that act. Verily, We have not forgotten thee, and We make mention of thee in this Tablet, that thou mayest be assured that thy Lord hath preceded in faithfulness His sincere servants. None can outstrip Him in aught. Therefore place thy trust at all times in God, the King, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Take comfort in the remembrance of thy Lord, for it shall suffice thee above all the worlds. Blessed are the days wherein thou didst attain the presence of thy Lord’s countenance and didst drink from this Most Great, this Mighty Ocean. Strive within thyself to remain steadfast in His love, and let not the intimations of the idolaters cause thee to slip. Verily, Satan hath appeared in every form in every city.

Nevertheless, the heedless souls have not awakened, and at all times have been and are opposed to the Tree of the All-Merciful and its branches, twigs, leaves and fruits. In such circumstances, the very deeds of these people have been and will be the cause for the appearance of the small Shah-Mirza and the very great Shah-Mirza and similar servants, that perchance they may become a balm for the wounds in the hearts of the oppressed. O Dhabih, oppression itself giveth rise to the manifestation of might and wrath. If thou wouldst observe with the eye of truth, all people deserve punishment, for they are engaged in oppression, save those whom thy Lord willeth. Nevertheless, God, in His name the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful, doth observe, and therefore hath not desired and doth not desire that anyone should oppose another.

<p>In the name of the All-Knowing! O Lord! This is one of Thy handmaidens who hath sought the ocean of Thy bounty and the horizon of Thy good-pleasure. I beseech Thee, O Master of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen, to assist me in Thy remembrance and to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for the leaves of the Tree of Thy Cause. O Lord! Thou seest that Thy helpless handmaiden hath turned toward Thy most exalted horizon and Thy Most Holy Sanctuary. I implore Thee by Thy generosity not to disappoint her, nor to withhold her from the shores of the ocean of Thy bestowals, nor to keep her distant from the pavilion of Thy nearness and the tabernacle of Thy glory. Thou knowest, O my God and my Lord, what I have heard in Thy path from the polytheists among Thy creatures and what I have witnessed in Thy days. By Thy might, O Beloved of the world and Desire of the nations, Thy handmaiden is not dismayed by tribulations in Thy love nor by adversities in her devotion to Thee. Every poison in Thy path is an antidote, and every ordeal in Thy love is a comfort. I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name, through which the nations were shaken and the pillars of the world trembled, to open the doors of the heaven of Thy mercy unto Thy loved ones, even as Thou didst open the prison door by the finger of Thy will. O Lord! Illumine the hearts of Thy servants and handmaidens with the light of Thy knowledge, then draw them through the fragrances of Thy raiment. Thou art He Who hath ever been and ever shall be, and verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O Shaykh Baba Sa’id, in the name of the All-Knowing Lord! O Shaykh, mention of you has come repeatedly before the Wronged One of the horizons. Praise be to God that you have attained to these blessed days. Ask of the True One that you may attain to the recognition of His Manifestation and that which is manifested through Him. These days have no parallel, nor will they ever have, and mention of them hath been made in all the heavenly Books. You must, God willing, occupy yourself with absolute certitude in reforming the edifices of God, and His edifices have been and ever shall be His servants. The world hath never had, nor will it ever have, any constancy, as you observe at all times. Blessed is the soul that today acquireth eternal stations and attaineth unto a matter whose mention floweth from the Supreme Pen, and if one attaineth not unto this station, he shall pass from this ephemeral world with utmost regret. God willing, through divine grace you shall become eloquent in the mention of the True One and arise to serve Him. All make mention of the True One and imagine themselves oriented toward Him, but who shall attain to His acceptance and be adorned with the ornament of His good-pleasure? We conclude with these words: Verily He is God, there is none other God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great. Praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds.</p>

<p>O Ali! The glance of favor hath been directed towards you. Were it not for this, that which hath appeared from you would not have appeared. And concerning what you wrote about the weakness of the servants and the heedless souls’ lack of attention to the exalted Truth - verily you speak truly. Indeed, the face of the world hath been turned toward irreligion. In all years, nay in all months, nay in all days, it hath been far from faith, certitude and knowledge, and close to conjecture and vain imaginings. And for a time they shall continue thus, even as the duration thereof hath been revealed and recorded in the Book of God. But be not grieved, for the effulgences of the Sun of Truth shall absorb the excess moisture of nature and shall gather together the scattered letters. This matter is not confined to this age alone, but hath been thus from ancient times, even as a drop from the hidden drops in the divine ocean of knowledge hath been revealed in the holy Tablet of Wisdom. Blessed is he who hath beheld and read it and hath said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who maketh clear to the worlds!” After the passing of the time mentioned in the Book, suddenly shall the Cause of God be upraised and all souls shall turn unto it. Verily thy Lord is the True Informer, the Speaking One, the Faithful Utterer.</p>

<p>O Ali-Qabli-Akbar! God willing, may you be joyous and successful through the favors of the Lord of Lords, and may you drink at all times from the wine of the mercy of the All-Merciful. Most of the petitions from the people have not reached the Presence due to the obstruction and interception by the highwaymen who block the path of the All-Merciful. However, your petition arrived at the Seat of Divine Unity and was grasped by the hand of grace, and the glance of favor beheld it. Blessed are you and blessed is he who has attained to this mighty grace. For you is written the reward of one who has attained His presence. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. For in these days the path is blocked by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. Be content with that which God has been content with - this is better for you, were you of those who know.</p>

Beseech God that thou mayest not be deprived of His Word and its sweetness, and that thou mayest stand so firm in the Cause of God that tribulations shall not hold thee back from the Most Glorious Horizon. Tests and trials have ever existed and shall continue to exist, that truth may be distinguished from falsehood and the doubter from the assured one. Observe how those souls who claimed to believe and who prostrated themselves before the All-Merciful in submission and humility - when His Self was made manifest, most of them became veiled from Him and remained far from the seat of nearness. This is naught but due to the heedlessness of souls, else the sun is far distinct from the shadow, and the flower is clearly evident from its likeness. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of My Cause that were they to open the eye of the heart, all would behold the Truth as existing and all else as non-existent.

<p>Details regarding the Tablet revealed on Mount Carmel: After the arrival and descent of the Ancient Beauty, exalted be His glory, at that elevated spot, when noon arrived, the food tablecloth was brought and spread in His presence and the meal was served. Suddenly He commanded: “Take up the pen, and with power and grandeur, openly in a clear voice, the verses of God were revealed while the monk of that place stood by listening.” When it reached the point that was recorded, since outwardly the meal had been served and those present were waiting, He said: “Let it be for now, we will complete it later.” And later when He turned toward Akka from Haifa, He mentioned at the mansion: “The Tablet of Carmel was not completed. Bring it sometime so we may complete it.” Outwardly it was this servant’s failing that the blessed Tablet remained incomplete, but inwardly - and exalted be His all-encompassing knowledge - He knows for what reason it remained suspended and incomplete, and by what means it should be completed. For there were allusions revealed in the Tablet, and its relationship with God was previously established and verified in the books of the Messengers and in wondrous, sublime verses and God’s clear Book.

<p>Regarding what was mentioned about the blessed verse, that the person in question said they had changed the verses and had written “yati’llah” instead of “ya’tihumu’llah” - it is very clear and evident that no change was intended, rather it was a reference to the meaning of the verse. The original verse is “Do they wait for naught else than that God should come unto them in the shadows of the clouds.” This meaning exists and has existed in previous books. The purpose is that the servants should understand and discover the meanings and allusions of the divine verses. This blessed book was revealed in Iraq and printed in India, but before comparison and collation, his honor Mirza Haydar-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, requested its correction from the Land of Sad. By command some have engaged in collation and God willing after correction it will be sent to that land as well. This is the truth of the matter that was mentioned, but regarding the station of gathering and separation in that book an explanation was given: Say: All is from God.

At all times He summons the peoples of the worlds to their Lord, the All-Merciful. How wondrous is this fire which, whenever water touches it, grows more intense in its love for its Lord, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing.

This is a mighty, mighty Cause which the hosts of earth and heaven cannot withstand. Shouldst thou find the sweetness of thy Lord’s remembrance in but one of His verses, thou wouldst swoon away at that moment, and upon arising thou wouldst say: “I testify, O my God, that the Daysprings of Revelation and the Dawning-Places of Inspiration came before Thy Manifestation, and in every word that proceedeth from His mouth is concealed that which giveth life to the worlds.” O Lord!

The lights of unfading splendor have so enveloped Him that all else but Thee is in His eyes but a shadow.</p>
<p>And when Thine irresistible summons reached me, I arose, fortified by Thy strength, and called all that are in Thy heaven and all that are on Thy earth to turn in the direction of Thy favors and the horizon of Thy bounties. Some caviled at me, and determined to hurt me and slay me. Others drank to the full of the wine of Thy grace, and hastened towards the habitation of Thy throne.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Creator of earth and heaven and the Source of all things, to attract Thy servants through the fragrances of the Robe of Thine Inspiration and Thy Revelation, and to help them attain the Tabernacle of Thy behest and power. From eternity Thou wert by Thy transcendent might supreme over all things, and Thou wilt be exalted unto eternity in Thy Godhead and surpassing sovereignty.</p>

Follow ye the path of God, unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth, and follow not every foolish madman.

How excellent is the state of the one who, through the Name of the Lord of all beings, has rent asunder the veils of idle fancies and has attained unto the ultimate goal and the most exalted horizon. Whosoever today attains unto the recognition of God, it is as though he has attained unto the recognition of all the Prophets and Messengers from the beginning that has no beginning unto the end that has no end. This wondrous Day has no peer or likeness. Every eye that beholds Him is the sovereign of all eyes, and every tongue that makes mention of Him is the lord of all tongues. Blessed is the heart that has turned unto Him, blessed the foot that has hastened unto Him, and blessed the hand that has taken hold of the Book of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. We counsel thee to that which is today the cause of the exaltation of the Cause. Beseech God that He may enable thee to hearken unto His utterance, for should anyone discover the sweetness of His utterance, all the peoples of the world would be powerless to alter it.

Thy mention was presented and the servant who was present before the Countenance read it. We heard it and have answered thee through this luminous Tablet. By God! The luminary of prosperity hath shone forth from the horizons of the Tablets, yet the people are in grievous doubt. Their vain desires have kept them back from God, their Creator. They are indeed among the heedless ones. The mountains have passed away and the Cry hath been raised, the Trumpet hath been sounded and the Herald hath called out, yet the people are in strange stupor. Say: Glory be to Thee, O Dawning-Place of the verses and Dayspring of clear tokens and Source of the oceans of wisdom and utterance in the contingent world! I beseech Thee by the power of Thy Pen of destiny and by Thy might in Thy kingdom to make me steadfast in Thy love and speaking in Thy praise and detached from all else besides Thee. Thou art verily the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Powerful, the All-Subduing, the Omnipotent. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and hoping for the wonders of Thy grace. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me that which is with Thee and which Thou hast ordained in Thy Book. Thou art verily the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>A remembrance from Us to one of the servants, that he might draw nigh unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O servant! Hearken unto the call from the precincts of My Most Great Prison. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Powerful. By My life! If thou wouldst hear My call and find its sweetness, thou wouldst forsake all creation, turning thy face toward the Most Exalted Horizon, and remember thy Lord with a tongue whereby the hearts of the heedless would be attracted. Deprive not thyself of this most great bounty. Draw nigh unto the Kawthar of divine knowledge, then drink therefrom in the name of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. They who are heedless this Day, these have no portion of this mighty ocean. Say: O my God! Leave me not to myself and my desires. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which spirits were attracted and bodies took flight, to aid me in recognizing the Manifestation of Thy Self. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the August, the All-Praised. God willing, through divine grace in this spiritual dawn thou shalt become one who partakes of the wine of inner meanings. The world hath never had, nor will it ever have, any permanence. Strive thou to drink of the everlasting wine and enter the divine Kingdom. Know ye the value of these days and beseech God that He may cause to appear from you that which would ensure the perpetuation of your spirit and your goodly remembrance.

He Who is the Lord of all mankind remembereth thee at a time when sorrows have compassed Him round from every side through that which the hands of the infidels have wrought, they who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all creation. Every soul hath taken unto himself an idol besides God. Thus have vain imaginings and idle fancies seduced them. They hear the verses of God and deny them. They are indeed in doubt and hypocrisy. This is a Day wherein the Spirit lamenteth by reason of that which the hands of the divines have wrought, they by whom the eyes in every age have been made to weep. We testify that they have violated the Covenant of God and His Testament, and have turned away from Him Who hath come unto them with the kingdom of verses. They have occupied themselves with the world, turning aside from Him Who is the Lord of the Throne above and of the earth below. Erelong shall their dominion be rolled up by the hands of Power, and they shall behold themselves in the lowest depths. Be thou thankful, O My Afnan, that We have enabled thee to recognize My Self, caused thee to hear My call, and made thee to speak forth that which My Tongue hath spoken. Thus doth the Divine Lote-Tree bear witness unto its twigs from the most exalted station. The glory that hath shone forth, appeared and radiated from the horizon of My Most Exalted Pen rest upon thee and upon those who have held fast unto you, seeking sincerely the presence of God, the Lord of the Day of Return.</p>

<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been sanctified beyond mention and utterance, and exalted above all description and explanation. The mystics have confessed their powerlessness to ascend unto the heaven of His knowledge, and the sincere ones their inability to attain unto the comprehension of His essence. He hath ever been the One Who uniteth His Own Essence with His Essence, and describeth His Own Self by His Self, for whatsoever else besides Him hath been created by His word. How can that which knoweth not save through Him know Him, and how can that which is described not save by Him describe Him? Exalted be His dominion and exalted be His power! When He was established upon the throne of His name, the All-Merciful, He described Himself through manifest signs and brilliant words, and commanded all to describe Him by that which flowed from His Most Exalted Pen. He accepted their mention and praise as a bounty from Him. Verily He is the Overseer, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Blessed is he who remaineth steadfast in His love and drinketh the wine of faith from this ocean, every drop of which proclaimeth that there is none other God but Me, the Speaker, the All-Informed.

Fear God and be not among the oppressors. The Will of God hath triumphed over the will of His creatures, and His Purpose hath preceded the purpose of all who are in the heavens and on earth.

We beseech God, exalted be He, to protect His servants from the evil of these people. By the life of God! They are the offspring of vipers, and this is what God hath revealed aforetime unto His Messengers. O thou who gazest toward the Most Sublime Horizon! It behooveth Us and thee and every believer to hold fast unto the cord of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of creation. We beseech from Him victory and deliverance for His servants who are encompassed by the ships of polytheism and the cannons of unbelief. O my Lord! Thou seest Thy weak servants - where is Thy strength, O Lord of the worlds, and where is Thy power, O Creator of the nations? I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue all created things, to send down from the heaven of Thy loving-kindness that which will gladden the hearts of Thy servants and the souls of Thy creation. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Conquering, the All-Powerful. Peace be upon thee and upon God’s sincere servants.</p>

Gather ye together around the Cause, then help the All-Merciful through wisdom and utterance. This behooveth him who hath held fast unto this mighty cord.

<p>In My Name, the Wronged One, the Stranger</p>
<p>The denizens of My heaven have lamented at what hath befallen My loved ones who remember God at morn and eventide and who desire naught but the betterment of the nations of the world. To this doth the Lord of Eternity bear witness from a station wherein the Sun of Grace hath shone forth and wherein the atoms themselves testify that there is none other God beside Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Countenance when the ignorant ones of the earth turned away from it. They, verily, comprehend not. The horizon of the heaven of My Hidden Name hath been illumined, yet the people perceive it not. They have violated their Covenant and cast behind them their Pledge, until they disbelieved in Him in Whom they had believed throughout ages and centuries. Say: O people of the earth! He Who was promised in the Books of God hath appeared. Fear ye the All-Merciful and follow not every heedless and veiled one. Give thanks unto God for having aided thee and caused thee to know Him and enabled thee to stand at a gate that hath been opened unto all who are in earth and heaven. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Merciful, the Kind. Cast aside the vain imaginings of men and take fast hold of the hem of certitude. Thus doth He command thee Who testifieth at all times that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Loving. Be thou steadfast in the Cause and make mention of thy Lord at eventide and at dawn.</p>

I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Signs, and by Thy Most Beautiful Names, and by the Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of Sinai, and by Thy Command whereby the people of the graves arose, to make me in all conditions turned towards Thee, speaking Thy praise, and steadfast in Thy love. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have believed in Thee and in Thy verses, and I acknowledge that which the tongue of Thy grandeur hath spoken.

Turn ye unto Him and be not of them that wander distracted.” Say: He hath existed in the eternity of eternities in the loftiness of His exaltation and the sublimity of His transcendence. None among all contingent beings hath truly known Him, as every discerning knower doth testify. No thing can be mentioned in His presence, and none hath any mention when His sovereign dominion is made manifest - He Who overshadoweth all who are in the heavens and on earth. Whoso acknowledgeth what hath been revealed in this Tablet, by the life of God, he is of them that profess the divine unity. And whoso speaketh other than what God hath sent down in the Book, he is of them that are in loss. Thus do We teach thee that thou mayest teach the people with wisdom and utterance.

I entreat Thee, O my Lord, by these days and by all such as have during that period clung to the cord of Thy commandments, and laid hold on the handle of Thy precepts, to grant that unto every soul may be assigned a place within the precincts of Thy court, and a seat at the revelation of the splendors of the light of Thy countenance.</p>
<p>These, O my Lord, are Thy servants whom no corrupt inclination hath kept back from what Thou didst send down in Thy Book. They have bowed themselves before Thy Cause, and received Thy Book with such resolve as is born of Thee, and observed what Thou hadst prescribed unto them, and chosen to follow that which had been sent down by Thee.</p>
<p>Thou seest, O my Lord, how they have recognized and confessed whatsoever Thou hast revealed in Thy Scriptures. Give them to drink, O my Lord, from the hands of Thy graciousness the waters of Thine eternity. Write down, then, for them the recompense ordained for him that hath immersed himself in the ocean of Thy presence, and attained unto the choice wine of Thy meeting.</p>
<p>I implore Thee, O Thou the King of kings and the Pitier of the downtrodden, to ordain for them the good of this world and of the world to come. Write down for them, moreover, what none of Thy creatures hath discovered, and number them with those who have circled round Thee, and who move about Thy throne in every world of Thy worlds.</p>

Worship ye none but God alone - this is a word whereby the eyes of the people of Baha have been gladdened and the hearts of those who disbelieved were troubled when the Lord came with power and authority.

Arise in the Cause of thy Lord in such wise that neither the oppression of the oppressors nor the turning away of the people of the lands shall deter thee.

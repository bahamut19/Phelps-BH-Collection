<p>=== START BH01010 ===</p>
<p>O concourse of the seen and the unseen! Rejoice with exceeding gladness in your hearts and souls, for the night hath come for the harvesting of the ages and the gathering up of past cycles, the night wherein all days and nights were called into being and the time preordained for this Revelation was fulfilled at the behest of Him Who is the Lord of might and power. All joy to the Concourse on high at the appearance of so glorious, so wondrous a Spirit!</p>
<p>This is the night wherein the doors of Paradise were flung open and the gates of Hell were shut fast, the night wherein the paradise of the All-Merciful was unveiled in the midmost heart of creation, the breezes of God were wafted from the retreats of forgiveness, and the Last Hour ushered in through the power of truth, could ye but know it. All joy to this night through which all days have been suffused with light, though none can apprehend this save those that are endued with certitude and discernment!</p>
<p>This is the night round which have circled the Nights of Power, wherein the angels and the Spirit have come down bearing cups filled at the streams of Paradise, the night wherein Heaven itself was adorned with the ornament of God, the Almighty, the All-Gracious, the Most Bountiful, wherein every created thing was brought to life, and all the peoples of the earth were surrounded by His grace. All joy to the concourse of the Spirit for this manifest and resplendent bounty!</p>
<p>This is the night wherein the limbs of Jibt were made to tremble, and the Most Great Idol fell upon the dust, and the foundations of iniquity were shattered, and Manat lamented in its inmost being, and the back of ’Uzza was broken and its face blackened; for the Morn of divine Revelation hath dawned, and there hath appeared that which hath solaced the eyes of glory and majesty, and beyond them the eyes of all the Prophets and Messengers of God. All glory, then, to this Dawn which hath broken above the dayspring of effulgent glory!</p>
<p>Say: This is the Dawn whereat the evil ones were debarred from approaching the realm of might and grandeur, and wherein the hearts of such as have contended with God, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Unconstrained, were lacerated. This is the Dawn whereat the faces of the wicked were darkened, whilst the countenances of the righteous shone forth with the light of this Beauty, a Beauty Whose advent all things visible and invisible, and beyond them the company of the Concourse on high, have eagerly awaited. All hail the appearance of this Spirit, through Whose potency the dead have been stirred up in their tombs and every mouldering bone brought to life!</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Say: This is the Dawn whereat the hidden Essence and the unseen Treasure were made manifest, the Dawn whereat the Ancient Beauty seized the cup of immortality with the hands of glory and, having first quaffed therefrom, proffered it unto all the peoples of the earth, high and low alike. All glory, then, to the one who hath approached this cup, taken it up, and drunk therefrom for the love of his Lord, the All-Powerful, the Most High!</p>
<p>One fruit of that Tree hath proclaimed what the Burning Bush had proclaimed aforetime in that hallowed and snow-white Spot, words to which Moses gave ear and which caused Him to forsake all created things and to direct His steps towards the retreats of holiness and grandeur. All glory, then, to that ecstasy born of God, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great!</p>
<p>Another fruit thereof hath uttered that which enraptured Jesus and raised Him up to the heaven of manifest splendour. All glory, then, to this Spirit in Whose presence standeth the Faithful Spirit, together with a company of God’s chosen angels!</p>
<p>Yet another fruit thereof hath disclosed that which captivated the heart of Muhammad, the Apostle of God, Who, carried away by the sweet accents of the Voice from on high, ascended unto the Divine Lote-Tree and heard, proceeding from within the Tabernacle of majesty, the Voice of God speaking forth the mystery of My hallowed, My exalted and mighty Name. All glory, then, to this Tree which hath been raised up through the power of truth, that all the peoples of the world may seek the shelter of its shade!</p>
<p>O Pen of the Most High! Write no more; for, by God, wert thou to set forth all the sweet accents of the fruits of this heavenly Tree, thou wouldst find thyself forsaken upon the earth, inasmuch as all would flee from thy presence and abandon thy court of holiness. And this, verily, is the undoubted truth. All glory, then, to the mysteries which none can bear save God, the sovereign Ruler, the Almighty, the Most Gracious!</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Dost thou not witness, O Pen, what a clamour the hypocrites have raised throughout the land, and what a tumult the wicked and ungodly have provoked? And this notwithstanding that thou didst reveal but an infinitesimal glimmer of the mysteries of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious. Wherefore, restrain thyself and conceal from the eyes of men that which God, as a sign of His bounty, hath bestowed upon thee. And if it be thy wish to give all created things to quaff from that crystal water that is life indeed, and whereof God hath made thee the Fountainhead, then let thine ink flow only in proportion to their capacity. Thus biddeth thee the One Who hath called thee into being through the power of His behest. Do thou, then, as thou wert bidden, and be not of them that tarry. All glory be to this weighty decree which hath reined in the power of all created things and withheld the Pen of the Most High from divulging to the peoples of the world that from which they had been veiled! His might, verily, is equal to all things.</p>

<p>He is the One who speaks from His most exalted horizon!</p>
<p>We have desired to make mention of the party of God and His loved ones, to remind them of His verses and to give them the glad tidings of His favors and His mercy which has preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth. O My loved ones in Gukchay! Hear My call from the direction of My prison. Verily it draws you to My Kingdom, guides you to My path, exalts you among My servants, and brings you near unto God, the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Previously there came a letter from him who was named Amin in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. He mentioned you and We have mentioned you in truth and have revealed for each one of you that which testifies to God’s favor and bounty. Give thanks to your Lord, the Most Merciful. Verily He has turned toward you and revealed for you that which shall never be exhausted throughout the endurance of His most beautiful names and His most exalted attributes. To this testifies He with whom is the knowledge of all things in a clear Book. Thus has the horizon of utterance been illumined with the light of proof. Blessed is he who has witnessed and seen and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the mystics, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Thou Who art remembered in the hearts of the Messengers!”</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Chakan! Hear My call from the direction of My prison. Verily there is no God but He, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Bestower. We have heard your call and witnessed your turning. We have turned toward you and revealed for you that which all the remembrances of the world cannot equal. Give thanks to your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Your letter came before the Wronged One and the servant present before His face read it. We have answered you with a Tablet from whose horizon shines the light of your Lord’s favor, the Lord of creation. Glorify the name of your Lord and remember Him at eventide and at dawn. Blessed are you for having attained unto the traces of My Most Exalted Pen. By God! The trace of My Pen is better for you than whatsoever has been created on earth. Give thanks to your Lord for having made you know Him, taught you, and guided you to the straight path. Beware lest the happenings of the world sadden you or the doubts of the nations prevent you from this Cause whereby feet have slipped save those whom God has protected through His grace and delivered through His loving-kindness. Verily He is the Mighty, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>In the Persian tongue do We speak that all may drink from the Kawthar of the utterance of the All-Merciful and may arise to that which beseemeth His days. O friends! Praise ye the Beloved of the world Who mentioned you in the Most Great Prison, showed you the way, and granted you the grace to attain that which most of the peoples of the world are deprived of and forbidden from. Reflect upon the former party, that is, the party of the Shi’ih. Throughout centuries and ages they spoke in the name of Truth and uttered His praise from pulpits, beseeching from God, glorified be His majesty, in the evening and at dawn, at night and in the morning, to attain His presence and His days. Yet when the appointed time came and the Dawning-Place of verses appeared from the horizon of God’s will, glorified be His majesty, the divines of Persia, one and all, occupied themselves with cursing and reviling. In their wickedness they reached such a point that they pronounced their verdict against the Essence of Being and the Intended Lord and shed His blood. Now the barking ones desire to adorn a party like unto that party and to afflict the people with the vain imaginings of the past. Open your eyes and reflect upon the deeds of the former party. Until now they say from the pulpits that which causeth the holy ones of the most exalted Paradise to weep and lament. Fie upon them and perdition unto them!</p>
<p>O party of God! If ye truly ponder on matters pertaining to that party, ye shall find yourselves established upon the throne of steadfastness and the seat of certitude, freed and delivered from intimations, doubts, suspicions and idle fancies. O friends! Today is the day of service, the day of remembrance and praise. We have aforetime informed all concerning the cawing of the ravens and the clamor of the froward ones. That which hath flowed and continueth to flow from the Pen, all the world is powerless to alter. It behooveth each one among you, when he hath quaffed the wine of knowledge from the cup of My bounty and been illumined by the lights of My utterance, to say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I testify to Thy oneness and Thy unity, and that this Day is Thy Day, and this Cause is Thy Cause. Thou hast manifested and made clear Thy path, and sent down from the heaven of utterance Thy proof. I testify that no cause can withstand Thy Cause, and no power can rival Thy power. I beseech Thee by the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Dawning-Place of Thy clear tokens and the mines of Thy wisdom and the repositories of Thy knowledge, and by the Light wherewith Thou hast illumined the world, and by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the nations, to make me steadfast in Thy love, detached from all else but Thee, attracted by Thy verses, and enkindled with the fire of Thy sacred Tree. O Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thy most exalted horizon, awaiting the wonders of Thy grace, O Lord of all being and Sovereign of the throne above and earth below. I beseech Thee not to deny me the wonders of Thy grace. Then ordain for me, O Possessor of existence and King of the seen and unseen, that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and aid me in serving Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>My God, my God, my Goal, my Beloved, the Ultimate Object of my desire and hope! I beseech Thee by Thy bounty wherewith Thou hast adorned existence, to illumine my face with the light of Thy knowledge, mine eyes with the vision of the horizon of Thy revelation, my heart with attraction to the source of Thy wisdom and knowledge, and mine ears with hearkening to Thy most sweet call and the sound of Thy Most Exalted Pen. O Lord! Leave me not to myself. Take my hand with the hand of Thy loving-kindness, then deliver me from the pit of doubts and idle fancies. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Lord! Thou seest me clinging to the cord of Thy bounty and holding fast to the hem of the robe of Thy generosity and favor. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Signs and the manifestations of Thy grandeur in the kingdom of creation to aid me and Thy loved ones to act in accordance with what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Then illumine us with the lights of Thy good-pleasure in such wise that we move not except by Thy command and permission, and desire naught save what Thou hast desired for us through Thy bounty and loving-kindness. Verily Thou art the All-Compelling over those who are in earth and heaven, and the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Bountiful.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy, the Exalted, the Most High, the Most Glorious! These are the verses of the Book which have been sent down in truth. God hath made them a proof from His presence and a manifestation from His own Self unto all who are in the heavens and on the earth. Verily, He accepteth what He willeth through His command, and He is, in truth, wise over all things. His is the creation and the command. He giveth life unto whom He willeth through His command and causeth death unto whom He desireth through His sovereignty. He shall not be asked of His doings, and He hath ever been, through His sovereignty, encompassing all the worlds.</p>
<p>O servant who gazes upon the Countenance! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High, from this Most Glorious Horizon, that verily there is none other God but Him, and that He Who speaketh at all times in all things, that there is none other God but Him, hath been the Manifestation of His Cause, the Dawning-Place of His Revelation, the Repository of His knowledge, and the Treasury of His revelation unto all worlds. Say: O people, fear ye God and follow not every sinful infidel. Have ye forgotten God’s sovereignty and His power, and God’s might and His glory in the days when He stood forth by His own Self and revealed His Cause between the heavens and the earth, whereunto ye were witnesses? O Trustworthy One! We did promise these people in a previous Manifestation that I would reveal unto them My beauty once again and would reveal unto them a mystery beyond reckoning, and when We manifested Ourselves once again by Our Most Glorious Name and We did not unveil the mystery but rather desired to bring the fingers of My will near to its veil, thereupon all who dwell in the heavens and on earth were struck with terror, and all returned to their original station, and God was witness to this. We had informed them beforehand that upon the unveiling of the mystery, those of Sinai would be thunderstruck and those of light would perish upon the Sinai of destiny by reason of this Most Great News. Yet they were unaware of this, and when a number were struck down, the hearts of those who had believed in God and witnessed the wonders of His power every morn and eve were sorely troubled.</p>
<p>O Trustworthy One! By the True God! He who fought against My Self and whom the servants took as a lord besides God was created by My Word and did circle round Me, as every fair-minded one who is possessed of knowledge doth testify. Thou beholdest the people as those who walk yet know not the way, or like the blind who walk in the shadow of the sun yet recognize it not and inquire about it from every ignorant blind one, or like sheep whose shepherd hath become the wolves of the earth and who can find no safe retreat. Thus do We set forth similitudes for thee that thou mayest recognize those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, and that thou mayest abide in an impregnable stronghold. Blessed art thou for having drunk the cup of life from the fingers of the All-Merciful in this Paradise which hath appeared at the heart of heaven, wherein all created things speak even as the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing spoke at the ultimate retreat, and the Tree of Sinai upon the crimson hillock, and the Tree of Eternity beyond the sea of grandeur. Thus is thy Lord powerful over whatsoever He willeth, and verily He encompasseth all things. Be thou ignited by the fire We have kindled in the paradise of thy heart, then ignite the servants therewith. By God! The Spirit of Glory will strengthen thee in all matters, and the Holy Spirit will speak within thy breast and will aid thee in times when thou openest thy tongue in remembrance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Verily, He strengtheneth whom He willeth through His grace, but the people are wrapped in thick veils. Know thou then that thy letter hath come before Us and the gaze of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds, hath fallen upon it, and We have witnessed from it thy longing for God and thy yearning for Him. How excellent it is for thee that the breezes of Paradise have wafted upon thee from this direction which hath been, from time immemorial, raised above the knowledge of the worlds. Therefore, give thanks unto God for having protected thee through the sovereignty of His Cause and delivered thee from the depths.</p>
<p>O thou who art attracted by My love and hast been raised to a station which is, in truth, praiseworthy! Sanctify thyself from the allusions of those who have disbelieved, and arise to praise thy Lord with a pure and wondrous tongue. Say: O people, be fair in the name of God - by what proof did ye believe in the Manifestations of the past, and by what evidence do ye establish your faith, after having denied this Sun which hath dawned from the horizon of eternity and by Whose light all who are in the heavens and on earth have been illumined? And now It standeth at its zenith with the sovereignty of grandeur, might and glory, having come unto you with God’s proof and His testimony, then His evidence and magnificent signs. Fear ye God, and war not against Him Who hath come unto you with all the signs, through Whom God’s power and proof, then His greatness and might have been made manifest. Fear God, O people, and be God-fearing in His Cause. If thou detectest from them the sweet savors of the All-Merciful, turn towards them; otherwise leave them to themselves and say “In the Name of God and by God,” then embark upon the Crimson Ark in My Most Glorious Name, which saileth upon the sea of grandeur from whose essence have appeared the seas of attributes and names. Thus do We impart unto thee in this night which hath been illumined by this Sun that was visible from God’s horizon. Were We to recount unto thee what hath befallen Us in this prison, thou wouldst weep and lament and become detached from all things in creation. But We have been patient and concealed it, and patience is from none but thy Lord, and verily He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful unto His servants. Be thou at peace within thyself, then rejoice in God’s joy, for there hath been ordained for thee in the Tablet a station that is, in truth, magnificent. God’s glorification from this prison be upon thy countenance, and by His glorification have the denizens of the highest paradise and the dwellers of the crimson chambers beyond the veils of the cloud-shrouded mysteries glorified thee. Thus doth God single out whom He willeth through His grace, and verily His grace hath ever been nigh unto them that are brought near. And the mercy that descendeth from the heaven that hath been raised in its essence be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and upon those who hearken unto thy words concerning God, thy Lord and the Lord of all creation.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be befitting and worthy of the Eternal Purpose, and thanksgiving unto the Self-Sufficing, the Most High. He is the One Who, with perfect might, for His own sake, hath been and still remains imprisoned in the fortress of Akka amidst the hands of the ignorant and the people of error. Exalted be His dominion, glorified His Command, magnified His station, and there is no God but Him! Blessings, peace, glory and splendor be upon those who have borne tribulations in His path, who have offered up their souls in His love, who have left their homelands, yearning to hearken unto His sweetest call and to behold His most exalted horizon.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter of that spiritual beloved arrived from the great city. Praise be to God, it bore witness to steadfastness in the Cause and orientation toward the Source, and likewise to joy after sorrow, tranquility after agitation, and health after bodily weakness. It also spoke of the well-being of God’s loved ones in that land. After its perusal and reading, it was taken to the Most Exalted Paradise and presented before His countenance, attaining the honor of His attention. Thereafter these effulgent words and manifest letters dawned and shone forth from the Dayspring of utterance of the Purpose of all worlds. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Encompassing over all who are in earth and heaven!</p>
<p>O ’Aziz! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness! Thou art he who attained the presence of the Countenance and heard the Call from the most exalted horizon and witnessed the effulgences of the Luminary of the Cause at its highest zenith. We beseech God to aid thee to rend asunder the veils of the people through His Name, whereby the idols have fallen and the standards of polytheism were lowered, while the banners of divine unity were raised in the cities and lands.</p>
<p>The True One, exalted be His glory, hath asked for justice and fairness from His servants. All must be adorned with the ornament of love, unity, fellowship and accord, and must associate with His servants with the utmost joy and fragrance for the sake of God. Verily pardon hath preceded, bounty hath preceded, mercy hath preceded, and loving-kindness hath preceded. Today the ocean of mercy is surging and the sun of loving-kindness is shining. Convey My greetings to the loved ones and say: Strive that perchance ye may illumine the dawning-place of hatred with the splendors of the sun of love, and guide the wayward to the straight path.</p>
<p>Convey greetings from the Wronged One to Ibn-i-Basir, upon him be My glory. Say: Two years ago thy petition attained the Most Holy Court, and a tablet was revealed for thee from the heaven of the Divine Will. Each of the names mentioned in thy letter was honored with God’s remembrance and the traces of the Most Exalted Pen, but there was delay in its dispatch. Now We have sent it as a bounty from Us, and verily We are the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. In each letter thereof lieth concealed an ocean and a hidden book. Glorified be He Who hath joined the ocean with the book, even as He hath joined water and fire.</p>
<p>And to each of the names mentioned that have arrived in these days, convey greetings and glory from the Wronged One. Say: Today all must render victory to the Truth through goodly deeds and praiseworthy character, that the people of the earth may observe and follow. Glory be from Us upon those who have heard and responded to that which they were commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne and the Elevated Seat.</p>
<p>The true outpouring of grace is manifest from the horizon of every tablet and descendent from the heaven of every page. We hope that the peoples of the world shall not be deprived of the rains of divine mercy and shall attain unto that for which they were created. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Forgiving, the Compassionate, and He is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Concerning your brother, upon him be the Glory of God, and his debt, and the actions of that spiritual beloved one, and the relinquishing of the house for the payment thereof and the exaltation of God’s Cause - all these matters were presented before the countenance of the Lord of all beings. His mighty utterance and glorious proof states:</p>
<p>O beloved one! Blessed art thou and blessed is what thou hast done in the path of God. Praise be to the Purpose of the world that He hath aided thee in that which causeth the exaltation of His Cause. Trustworthiness before God is among those attributes that hath had and hath no likeness or equal, and it is the cause of glory and the source of wealth. Concerning its description there hath flowed from the Supreme Pen that whose fragrance shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Convey to Asadu’llah the greetings and salutations of the Wronged One. Say: Be not grieved in any matter. Take hold of trustworthiness, placing thy trust in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He will verily aid those who have committed their affairs unto Him, who have held fast to the cord of His grace and clung to His luminous and blessed hem.</p>
<p>The letter of Khodadad which arrived again and which thou didst forward attained unto the Most Holy Court. Thereupon the ocean of forgiveness surged and the fragrance of thy Lord’s pardon was diffused. We beseech God to assist him and those who have believed unto that by which their remembrance shall endure throughout His earthly and heavenly kingdom. He is verily the Helper, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that Khodadad, son of Nasir, upon him be the Glory of God, hath again been blessed with His grace and mentioned in the Most Holy Court. This servant mentioneth each of the friends and seeketh for them both outward and inward bounties, that all may hold fast to the Cause and arise to serve it, and appear among the servants with detachment and trust in God. The world is transient, yet the attainment of enduring stations hath been ordained therein. This is the decree of the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. From your steadfastness and action regarding the aforementioned debt, it is hoped that the door of grace shall be opened and affairs shall be set aright. Verily He is the Generous, He is the Merciful, and He is the Ever-Bountiful, the All-Glorious, the Ancient. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who have held fast to the cord of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all creation. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the All-Knowing Expositor, He is the Hearing, the Answering</p>
<p>Praise befitteth and is meet for the Desired One of the world Who, through the grace of the Most Great Name, hath bestowed upon all peoples the Kawthar of knowledge and understanding, and through the Most Exalted Word hath raised aloft before all faces the standard “The Kingdom is God’s.” The might of the oppressors, the prohibition of the deniers, and the clamor of the ignorant did not withhold Him. The ocean of generosity is surging in such wise as to encompass the realm of being and the kingdom of heaven, and the sun of grace is shining in such wise as to illumine all the worlds of sciences and arts. Glorious is His favor, exalted His dominion, and mighty His proof!</p>
<p>The light shining from the horizon of the heaven of bounty and bestowal be upon the hands of His Cause, who have taken hold of His Book with a power that the hosts of rejection and the manifestations of denial could not withstand. These are they whom God hath described in His mighty Book, both aforetime and in these days: “Men whom neither merchandise nor traffic beguile from the remembrance of God,” and in another passage: “They speak not until He hath spoken, and they do as they are bidden.” Through them hath God revealed His Cause and His sovereignty, through them hath He guided mankind unto His straight Path and His mighty Announcement, and through them have His traces been spread abroad, His signs been exalted, and His lights been manifested. Verily our Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in His grasp are the reins of all things, of the former and latter generations.</p>
<p>Thereafter, on this blessed day, when four hours of the day had passed, this servant proceeded to the Most Exalted Paradise and the Supreme Garden, and after attaining the presence before His face, the tongue of grandeur spoke these decisive words and manifest verses, He spoke and His word is the truth: “O Majd, His honor Khalil, upon him be the glory of his Lord, the Glorious, hath sent a letter. Praise be to God, through His special favors the friends of those regions have been blessed and the fire of love hath been kindled in hearts and souls. We beseech God to aid them to remember and praise Him and to serve His Cause, to rain down upon them from the clouds of His mercy the showers of His bounty, and to give them to drink, from the hand of His bestowal, the Kawthar of His utterance. He is verily the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>“O Khalil! At this moment the letter hath attained Our presence and this Wronged One hath personally read it. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as We have inhaled from thee the fragrance of steadfastness in this Announcement whereby the pillars of them that have denied the Day of Judgment have been shaken. Say: O people, fear the All-Merciful and be not of the wrongdoers. The proof hath come, and the Day-Star of certitude hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of utterance of God, the Lord of the worlds. Beware lest the conditions of the wicked and the deeds of the immoral grieve you. Leave them to themselves, turning unto God, the Single One, the All-Informed. They have violated God’s Covenant and His Testament, and have committed that which hath caused the Faithful Spirit to lament. The oppressor in the land of Ya hath perpetrated that which hath caused the hearts of the chosen ones to burn and the livers of the sincere ones to melt, and there hath appeared in the land of Ta that whereof We had forewarned you in Our Most Holy Book. With Him is the knowledge of all things in a clear Record. The wrongdoers shall soon find the recompense of their deeds. Thy Lord, verily, is the Avenger, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>“Say: O people of God! Let not the manifestations of idle fancies frighten you, nor the dawning-places of vain imaginings sadden you - they who have denied God’s signs and His testimony and have rejected this straight Path. We have announced to them Him Who conversed on Sinai, this Revelation Who hath seated Himself upon the throne of utterance at the heart of contingent being, despite every ignorant remote one and every heedless doubter. When thou hast attained unto the Euphrates of thy Lord’s mercy which hath flowed from His Most Exalted Pen, and hast heard His most sweet call, say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having guided me to the horizon of Thy manifestation, given me to drink of the Kawthar of Thy knowledge, and made me to know the Dayspring of Thy verses and the Dawning-place of Thy clear tokens. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued all that was and all that shall be, to protect me from the evil of Thine enemies and to strengthen me to stand firm in Thy love. Then I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds, by Thy Most Excellent and Most Ancient Name, to assist His Majesty the Sultan and his loved ones to turn towards Thee and to face the lights of Thy countenance. O Lord! Aid him to protect Thy sheep from the wolves of Thy earth. Then write for him that which will draw him nigh unto Thee and give him to drink of the Kawthar of Thy knowledge. Then make known to him, O my God, the nature of Thy loved ones whose hearts Thou hast purified from rancor and hatred, from corruption and contention. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. O Lord! Adorn Thy loved ones with beauteous patience and noble steadfastness, illumine them with the light of Thy knowledge, and assist them to turn towards Thy servants and guide them in Thy days. Verily, Thou art the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The Sun of proof hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of utterance with such brilliance that those who would describe, remember, or speak of it all find themselves powerless and wanting. Who can count the waves of the ocean of His utterance, and who can encompass the effulgences of the light of His bounty? Each day a new scroll is revealed and each night a book appeareth. Glory be to God! Despite this supreme grace which hath encompassed both the seen and unseen worlds, the people remain heedless and veiled. What intoxication hath seized the world of knowledge? Despite the raising of the call and the appearance of the banners of the Lord of all beings, all remain asleep in the slumber of heedlessness. The cry hath not awakened them and the trumpet hath had no effect. In all conditions one must hold fast to the cord of grace and cling to the hem of bounty, that perchance the servants may not remain deprived in this blessed Day.</p>
<p>This servant submitteth and saith: O my God, my Lord, and my Support! Thou seest those who are near and those who have turned towards Thee in the hands of such of Thy servants as have turned away from Thee, and there hath befallen them in their love for Thee that which hath caused the dwellers of Thy Kingdom and Thy Realm to lament. O Lord! Assist them to turn in repentance to Thy gate and to return to the court of Thy holiness. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>As for the mention made of Aqa Khan and other loved ones, upon them be the Glory of God, after their names were submitted before the Most Holy Court, there was revealed for each one that which the world and all that is therein cannot equal. This is what was revealed for Aqa Khan, upon him be the Glory of the All-Merciful.</p>

<p>In the name of the Most Holy, the Most Impregnable, the Most Great, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>The servant hath been honored by thy letter, from whose horizon shone forth the sun of the love of God, unobscured by any veil that might conceal its lights or barrier that might prevent its radiance - as if it were a spirit by which all created things were revived, and a fire by which all beings were set ablaze. Whoso possesseth a sense of smell will perceive from it the fragrance of the Intended One and the perfume of the Beloved. When the servant found this ladder, he ascended by it to the Dawning-Place of Names and Attributes, until he was present before the Throne and submitted what was therein with humility and supplication. Thereupon the ocean of favors surged in such wise that this evanescent one and those immersed in the depths of wisdom and utterance are powerless to describe it.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant submitteth that he was honored by your letter, from which wafted the sweet savors of divine love and from which emanated the fragrance of the garment of heavenly affection. Praise be to God that the glad tidings of your arrival in that land caused joy to the heart, delight to the soul, and a happiness beyond description. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that I may ever be blessed and sustained by this spiritual fragrance. Regarding what you wrote about not having received the Tablets revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will, and your request for copies of those exalted Tablets - a special volume hath been revealed from the Divine heaven of authority specifically for you, and the answer to the questions of the Afnan, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God, hath also been revealed therein. Now the copy of that writing is being sent. Since its beginning was separately copied in the Book of Verses, it is now also being sent separately along with the volume. Glory be to God Who revealed it in truth! By God! It hath been revealed in such wise as to astound the minds of the mystics and the hearts of the eloquent. Blessed is he who findeth its sweetness and attaineth unto the oceans that surge in its words and letters. Were people to look upon it with the eye of fairness, they would testify that it alone sufficeth as proof for all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>O my Khalil! Concerning what you mentioned about this body not being worthy of such protection and preservation - yes, this is an undoubted truth. Those souls who are clinging and holding fast to the Truth, and through the wondrous outpourings of divine grace have reached a station wherein they see themselves lacking nothing while under the shadow of Truth - such souls, out of their love for God, surely seek martyrdom and the sacrifice of their spirit. Some of the mature and knowledgeable ones consider the sacrifice of the body a great triumph, that they may be freed from outward tribulations and attain to everlasting bounties. However, you should not fix your gaze upon these stations, nor [diligently] pursue thoughts of your own deliverance. You must exercise the utmost care in preservation - thus does the All-Knowing Truth command you. For one such as yourself must remain steadfast among the people and, with perfect wisdom and utterance, enable receptive souls to attain the bounties of the All-Merciful. This is what God has chosen for you - verily He is the Ordainer, the All-Choosing. Protection has ever been and shall ever be in God’s hands, but since its means are also from God, you must be mindful of them.</p>
<p>This servant submits that now that you have arrived in that land, if matters gain prominence beyond the bounds of moderation, most people will withdraw themselves, thereby causing the work of teaching to fall into delay. However, if one proceeds with perfect wisdom, perhaps through association with people, some receptive souls may be awakened from the sleep of heedlessness and turn to the Truth. The supplication that was submitted to the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence was presented before the Face on one of the nights, and a Tablet was revealed from the heaven of divine favors and sent forth. I beseech you to convey countless greetings from this evanescent servant to the loved ones of God in that land. Furthermore, write to the Afnan - upon him and them be the Glory of God and His sweetest remembrance - who reside in the land of China, that everything they sent to the Most Holy Court has been received in full, for the sons of Jenab-i-Z had requested in their letters to the land of S that a receipt for the items be written and sent. Therefore, your honor should write expressions of utter servitude and the Most Wondrous, Most Exalted, Most Glorious greetings on my behalf to them, and mention the receipt of the items. Perhaps later a Tablet of God will be specifically revealed and sent to them. I submit again that besides the two Most Exalted Tablets sent, another Tablet has been revealed specifically for your honor and is immersed in the ocean of verses, but due to the press of occupations, there is no opportunity to search through the books and send it. I hope for forgiveness. May the Most Glorious Glory and the Most Splendid Light rest upon your honor and upon those who are honored to serve you there from among the loved ones of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

The servant acknowledgeth what God hath sent down from before and after, and what hath been revealed in His perspicuous Book, and confesseth what hath been uttered by the tongues of His Messengers and His near-favored ones. And prayers and peace be upon His Beloved and His Chosen One, through Whom He hath manifested His power and His sovereignty, and sent down His verses and revealed His clear proofs, and upon His family and companions, through whom He subdued the world and drew the hearts of the nations - prayers that are everlasting, through which the fragrance of His utterance is wafted amongst His servants and the sweet perfume of His bounty throughout His lands.</p>
<p>The beloved letter arrived and gladdened the sorrowful heart with news of the health, wellbeing and steadfastness of the honored Mr.&nbsp;Afnan, upon him be the peace of the All-Merciful, and that blessed being. The One God is witness that mention of the friends and loved ones brings joy and delight. After being informed, I approached the Presence and presented it. He said: “It is clear and evident to every fair-minded and insightful person and every knowledgeable and informed one that there has been and is no purpose except the betterment, love, harmony, kindness and unity of hearts and souls. We have ever counseled all to trustworthiness, religious devotion, truthfulness and sincerity. Some accepted, while others were prevented from the word of truth by the fire of greed, passion, avarice and transgression. Praise be to God, the deeds of every soul bear witness to it. The secrets of hearts and their hidden thoughts, as well as the treachery of eyes, are all manifest and visible. This Wronged One beseeches God, exalted be His glory, for that which leads to success and prosperity. Assuredly, whatever has appeared and will appear stems from the requirements of consummate wisdom. However, victory and triumph in all conditions belong to His assured servants, those who have no fear nor are they grieved.” The honored Afnan, upon him be God’s care and grace, was present and mentioned before Him. We beseech God to strengthen him, make him successful, assist him, protect him and ordain for him what benefits him. Verily He knows him better than he knows himself and He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. O Amin, grieve not over anything or what has passed of ornaments. Praise be to God, your truthfulness, trustworthiness and honesty are clear and evident to all, and the condition of those who have clung to lies, calumny and treachery is also apparent and visible. Every fair one is aware and every just one bears witness - indeed those souls themselves are aware of each other’s state, but the fire of greed and avarice has intervened and deprived them of trustworthiness and truth. What you mentioned was heard with acceptance. God willing, mention of those souls will flow from the Pen and be sent. We beseech God in all conditions to assist you and not withhold from you His grace, mercy, generosity and bestowal. Verily He is the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Glory be to God! Souls who have so clearly betrayed the property of the servants and who speak calumnies still claim truthfulness, sincerity and righteousness. The leader of that people is Shaykh Muhammad, than whom there exists none more wicked in the world. The cause of these matters and the unity of those souls has been and is the wrongful consumption of people’s property. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to judge with justice, and He is the Commander, the Wise.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about Ardikan, it was seen and according to your beloved request it shall be done. They mentioned Mr.&nbsp;Muhammad Isma’il, upon him be God’s peace, who has arrived in that land. They were with him for some time. Praise be to God, they are aware of some of that heedless one’s affairs. The servant asks his Lord to strengthen and assist him that he may make known to the people the calumnies of that heedless and remote one, and his deeds and conditions. Verily He has power over all things. This servant conveys greetings to them and asks God to make them successful in that which causes the exaltation of being.</p>
<p>As for the letter from the honored brother Master Ali Akbar, upon him be God’s peace, which was sent - it has been seen. A reply to him will be written and dispatched. Whatever that beloved one wrote is being considered. God willing, he shall succeed in accordance with what He loves and is pleased with. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that all may be enabled to perform good deeds and manifest praiseworthy conduct, that their names may endure in goodness forever. Permission has also been granted for that mentioned person - write and inform him. However, the details of the treacheries of the unfaithful ones must also be mentioned so that one who intends to turn toward [the Cause] may be aware.</p>
<p>O my God, my Aim, my Object of Worship! Protect Thy sheep from the wolves of the earth, and adorn praiseworthy conduct with its finest ornament, that all may find their station and become aware of its fruits. For if Thou grant awareness, treachery will be transformed into trustworthiness, falsehood into truthfulness, and oppression into justice. O Generous One! Thy mercy hath preceded all and Thy generosity hath encompassed all. Let not the daysprings of darkness prevail over the dawning-places of justice. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Strong, the Powerful. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>All the loved ones send their greetings, and likewise do others. In truth, they make mention with perfect love and affection. We beseech God to create an effect in the remembrances of His chosen ones and His loved ones. Verily He is the Fulfiller of the needs of all who ask, and praise be to God, for He is the Lord of all the worlds. Peace and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you, and upon God’s righteous servants.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>The essence of praise and its pure reality befit the sacred realm of nearness to the Beloved, Who created all that is visible and hidden through a single Word, Who gathered all created things through pure justice in a single plane through a single Word, and then through that same Word made manifest the greatest differentiation. The sanctified souls, through the sweetness of the divine call, turned to the most exalted horizon, drank from the Kawthar of eternity, and were numbered among the companions of the right hand, while the souls of the polytheists turned away and were named the companions of the left hand and of Sijjin. He is the Sovereign of existence and the Possessor of the unseen and the seen. How excellent is the state of the soul that hath today become aware and turned toward the ocean of knowledge. His is the generosity and grace, and His the grandeur and justice. He giveth and taketh. He, verily, is the Single One, to Whose singleness all created things have testified, and the One, to Whose oneness all contingent beings have confessed. From His Pen have flowed the Salsabil of life and the Kawthar of knowledge, through which the seekers have turned to the ultimate goal and those near unto God to the highest summit, and the inhabitants of the graves have arisen in the kingdom of creation. Exalted, exalted is He Who hath appeared with the truth and manifested what He desired through His sovereignty that hath encompassed all who are in existence, both unseen and seen. He, verily, is the One manifest through His name, the All-Loving, and the One speaking from His praiseworthy station.</p>
<p>I offer prayers and peace, glory and praise unto those servants who have arisen to aid His Cause, exalt His Word, and make manifest His grace amongst His creatures. These are His sincere servants, His unified servants, His near ones. God hath described them in His Books, His Psalms and His Scriptures, and the tongues of His Messengers and Emissaries have spoken their praise. These are servants whom no blame from any blamer, nor the gloating of any polytheist, nor the turning away of any opposer, nor the denial of any denier holdeth back from that which their Creator hath commanded them, nor do the forces of the earth weaken them from what they desire in the path of God, their Fashioner and Creator. These are servants who speak not except by His leave, who move not except by His command, whom the affairs of men sadden not, and whom the clamor of those who have disbelieved in the Lord of destiny frighteneth not.</p>
<p>This servant beseecheth his Lord to gather him beneath their shadow and within their pavilions of glory, and to strengthen His loved ones in that wherein He hath strengthened them. Verily, He is the Almighty Who doeth as He pleaseth in His dominion and ordaineth through His sovereignty what He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Single One, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Following this, it is submitted to your honor that in previous years, in correspondence with one of the divine friends, this servant, as commanded, submitted that for each of the names that Jinab-i-Nasr had sent, a special Tablet would be revealed from the heaven of grace and would be dispatched. And according to that list which your honor had sent, wondrous and sublime Tablets were revealed, but there was no one available to carry them. For nearly two years this matter remained in abeyance. Now Jinab-i-Mulla Muhammad-’Ali has insisted that he will carry them, therefore they were sent so that they may be delivered to the mentioned souls. However, since much time has passed, whoever is present will be blessed with divine grace, and if anyone has ascended, their Tablet serves as a perpetual remembrance for them in both the earthly and heavenly kingdoms. God willing, your honor will deliver them with the utmost joy and delight and be thankful to the True Beloved, for your honor’s request was accepted and found favor at the divine threshold. Blessed are you and joy be unto you.</p>
<p>Now consider the bounty and grace of God - if all the world were to sacrifice their wealth, spirits, and bodies, it would surely seem as nothing compared to this supreme bounty. God willing, these blessed Tablets will become the cause and means of enkindling the residing souls and will bestow upon all a portion from the ocean of inner meanings.</p>
<p>O my beloved! If the people of the world were to reflect even briefly upon this Most Great Revelation, all would find themselves free and liberated. All strife, conflict, differences, upheaval and estrangement have been forbidden in this blessed Revelation. All have been commanded to associate with the people of the world in a spirit of fragrance and joy. Time and again this blessed word was heard from the Tongue of Grandeur, saying that God, exalted be His glory, has appeared for the reformation of the world and has willed to cast the word of unity into the hearts of all nations. Blessed is he who has heard and attained, and woe unto the heedless and the deniers.</p>
<p>Another submission: Convey greetings and praise to the friends on behalf of this evanescent servant and tell them to appreciate the value of this day. I swear by the Ancient Beauty that the like of this day has never been witnessed. Strive that the conditions and colors of this world may not make you heedless of the Lord of earth and heaven. These lives are observed to be most fleeting; through the grace of the Beloved of all possibility, you must attain a station which neither decline can seize nor change can approach. Today, whatever any soul desires, it can possess, for the gate of mercy is open and the ocean of generosity is surging. Were this servant permitted, he would reveal a hint of this station and a drop from this ocean, that all might soar on wings of joy in the atmosphere of love for the Lord of the Day of Resurrection, and find themselves free from the darkness of this earthly world.</p>
<p>O my masters and friends of God! Listen to the submissions of this evanescent one with the ears of both head and heart, for he speaks for God’s sake, and his witness has been and will be God Himself. God willing, may He assist and enable this servant and all friends to that which is pleasing to Him. Verily, He is the Answerer of the prayers of the supplicants and the Ultimate Goal of those who seek Him, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>O Siyyid Mahdi! Your letter, adorned with wondrous mention of the Lord of Lords, reached the Nest of Tribulation and the Treasury of Tests, was taken in hand and perused with sorrowful glances. This is the decree of the All-Powerful Ordainer. Praise be to God that you have been made to partake of the Kawthar of the recognition of the Most Merciful, from which most of the people of the contingent world remain deprived this day. How glorious is this wondrous bounty which hath appeared in creation without peer or likeness and without pause or cessation, and the unitarians drink of the wine that hath been mingled with the love of God.</p>
<p>It was mentioned that you had intended to circumambulate the House of God but were prevented by certain obstacles. How excellent was what was ordained, for therein lies a mighty wisdom. Soon shall you become aware of the hidden wisdom, even as you have witnessed in all that was previously ordained by your Lord manifest wisdom. Nothing escapes His knowledge, and verily, He is cognizant of all things. Be content with the irrevocable decrees of the eternal Sovereign and be not distressed, for that which is ordained by your Lord cannot be altered by anything in the heavens or on earth.</p>
<p>As is known among the servants, two terms have been ordained for all things - the first contingent, and the second irrevocable. Yet what they have mentioned regarding these two stations is neither nourishing nor profitable, for they are deprived of the foundation of divine knowledge and the consummate wisdom of the Eternal, save whom thy Lord willeth. Most people acknowledge their inability to comprehend these two stations. To elucidate this matter, an example is given that perchance you may understand its reality and, through God’s protection and power, safeguard people from contingent terms, that they might attain to the irrevocable term and recognize it with certitude.</p>
<p>Consider the lamp that is lit. Its irrevocable term is the exhaustion of its oil and wick, for as long as these two remain, the lamp continues to burn and give light. When these are exhausted, its extinction is inevitable and it will surely be extinguished. No change or alteration can occur in this station - it will neither hasten by a moment nor delay. This is evident and observable. However, it will attain this inevitable end only if the contingent terms that are created within existence by the power of the All-Merciful do not seize it and extinguish it first. These contingent terms are evident in all things due to the unceasing, universal divine power.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who attains unto the source of knowledge, who ponders the signs of his Lord, and who attains to God’s purpose in His words. Well is it with them that understand and reach this station. For example, this same lamp may often be extinguished before reaching its end by winds passing over it or by other created means, as is plainly visible.</p>
<p>All knowledge is manifest and evident in the essence of all things, for all things are God’s creative Words, and divine knowledge is concealed and treasured within the repositories of His Words, except for that knowledge which is exclusive to the Ancient Being and to which none can gain access. Glorified be He above what the learned attribute to Him!</p>
<p>Although in one station all that transpires is and shall be irrevocable, and the very act of its execution is proof of its inevitability, yet its mention still abides in the heaven of divine Will, until such time as it descends from the heaven of Will to the kingdom of utterance and is inscribed by the Pen of Destiny. These limitations of station and rank that are mentioned relate to human limitations and earthly means which are created by contingent will and return unto it. That which is with God and His Will is sanctified above all limiting conditions.</p>
<p>Therefore, that honored one must strive today to the extent possible to watch over the Cause of God and protect His servants, lest the lamps of recognition - the recognition of self - which are kindled in the hearts of men be extinguished by the winds of the satanic self and its party, that they might attain their destined goal and praiseworthy station. Effort is necessary, but God doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth as He pleaseth. Be patient in separation and consumed by the fire of longing, for the burning of those who long for Him is beloved in the sight of God, and in their consumption in separation God giveth them the reward of attainment. Thus hath it been ordained in the dominion of destiny.</p>
<p>You must, God willing, be detached from all save God in all conditions and be focused on His bounties. Moreover, you must today adorn the temple of being with the ornament of servitude and move among the servants with pure and absolute servitude. By the Ancient Beauty! Any soul who today worships with pure servitude stands higher in the sight of God than all other souls, for the opponents of the religion of the Lord of the worlds appear at every moment with a new scheme and have placed novel notions in the hands of the ignorant that they might thereby deprive people from the path of the All-Glorious. You shall later become aware of this.</p>
<p>In any case, may you ever drink from the cup of favor of the King of grace and dwell at rest in the shade of His mercy. It is necessary to prevent the friends from traveling to this land, as harm will surely result. At all times remind the servants of God with clear counsels, lest holy souls be sullied with the stain of sins and remain far from the paradise of divine nearness. Never be saddened henceforth and do not move without permission. However, God willing, if the hand of divine power removes the impending dangers of this land, you will surely be summoned to the court of His presence. And God is with the patient ones.</p>

<p>He is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing, the All-Wise!</p>
<p>O My Name Mehdi! The letter from Afnan Alif and Ha, upon him be My Baha, which was addressed to you, was presented by this servant before the Divine Presence. God willing, may they ever abide beneath the blessed Lote-Tree in tranquility and rest, and partake of the choice wine of His love. Blessed is he for having turned unto God, attained His presence, and arisen to serve the Cause of God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. God willing, may they ever attain unto this most great station. Though it be veiled at present, this veil shall assuredly be lifted. He, verily, is the Informed, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Concerning what they wrote about Badi, upon him be the Glory of God, may he be blessed through divine grace. We have made mention of his father in such wise that, by the life of God, all the treasures, hoards and mines of the earth cannot equal it. The Lord of all beings beareth witness unto this. O Mehdi! The days pass like lightning, and their transience is clear and evident. Blessed is the soul that hath been honored to make mention of God and whose name hath been recorded by the Supreme Pen in God’s Book. This is a bounty with which no other bounty can compare, nor can any other matter rival it. Soon shall the sincere and devoted ones witness that which God hath foretold in the Scriptures and Tablets.</p>
<p>As to what they wrote concerning the Spot of Blessing and the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar, this is most acceptable, for they have mentioned it with wisdom. The Supreme Pen hath, for reasons of wisdom recorded in the Book, forbidden at this time the execution of such matters in the land of Shin and the land of Ya and certain other lands. Verily, He knoweth and commandeth, and with Him is the knowledge of all things in a mighty Book. Blessed is such an Afnan, for he hath spoken that which God, the Lord of the worlds, desired. He must render thanks unto his Lord for this manifest favor. In all matters they must observe wisdom. Although the law of prayer was sent down from the heaven of God’s Will in previous years, due to wisdom it hath not yet been dispatched to other regions and remaineth preserved and concealed in the Kingdom of Utterance by the command of the Beloved of all possibility. Such divine laws as can be practiced without conflicting with wisdom must be observed by all, and those that conflict with wisdom are not permissible to practice until God’s Cause is raised up amongst His servants and creation.</p>
<p>His honor Asad and the son of My Name Al-Asdaq, upon them be My Baha, have arisen to serve the Cause, and whatsoever they have executed regarding the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar and the Spot of Blessing in the lands of Kha hath been approved by the Supreme Pen. Verily, He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>The heedless people have regarded the Dawning-Place of the world’s reformation as a source of corruption. So intoxicated are they with the wine of self that neither the blast of the trumpet, nor the sound of the bugle, nor the enduring proofs, nor the manifest shining evidences, nor the revealed verses have brought them to their senses. They remain heedless of Him Who hath appeared with all the proofs possessed by those on earth, clinging instead to their own idle fancies. Nevertheless, the mercy and loving-kindness of God have been so abundantly manifested that pen and tongue are powerless to describe them. Hence it is that He hath enjoined wisdom upon His loved ones. Were one to ponder the allusions of the Supreme Pen, hidden matters would emerge and become evident. By Him Who is seated upon the throne, were they to attain even a small measure of understanding, they would cry out “I turn unto Thee, O God of the worlds!” In this Most Great Revelation, corruption, contention, bloodshed and the like have been forbidden, and in most Tablets these utterances have been revealed from the heaven of divine knowledge. Yet none hath grasped God’s intent or comprehended His purpose, save whom He willeth. Blessed are they who have arisen and remained steadfast in the Cause of God, and who have associated with all men in a spirit of joy and fragrance. These are they who are mentioned as the companions of the Ark in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. All must strive for the betterment of the world. This is the binding decree that hath been revealed in this Most Great Revelation, both aforetime and hereafter. Blessed are they that understand, blessed are they that ponder, blessed are they that act accordingly. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O Afnan! Take hold of wisdom and cleave unto it, and abandon all else. Thus doth the Wronged One command thee by a bidding from God, the Lord of the worlds. Under all conditions observe wisdom.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast mentioned concerning him who was named Mu?sin, who hath ascended unto God - We make mention of him as a token of Our grace. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful. The first greeting that issued forth from the City of Peace - the spot adorned by the revelation of God, the Lord of all men - and the first fragrance that wafted from the garment of thy Lord’s mercy be upon thee, O thou who hast turned to the Most Sublime Horizon and believed in God, the Lord of Names, when those who followed conjecture and idle fancy turned away. I testify that thou didst answer thy Lord when His call was raised between earth and heaven, and thou didst fulfill thy covenant and pledge in such wise that neither the veils of glory withheld thee from the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, nor the barriers of names from God, the Creator of heaven. Blessed art thou for having remained steadfast in the Cause when most feet did slip, and the hearts of men were troubled - they who cast the command of God behind their backs and followed every heedless doubter. Blessed is he who remembereth thee after thee, O Mu?sin, and who maketh mention of thy turning unto God, thy faithfulness, thy love and thy ardor in the Cause of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Rejoice thou in that the Most Exalted Pen hath made mention of thee and consoleth thy kindred who attained unto recognition on a Day wherein the Cry was raised and the mountains passed away. Peace and praise and glory be upon thee from God, the Almighty, the Most Glorious, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>O Afnan! Concerning what thou didst write about designating a blessed spot in these lands - this is more conducive to piety and wisdom. If it be accomplished with utmost joy and fragrance, it is acceptable and will, God willing, become a source of universal good. Verily, He ordaineth what He desireth for whomsoever He willeth, and revealeth that which His unerring and mighty Pen is moved to record. Praise be to God, the Beloved of those who know.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who caused the Ocean of Knowledge to surge!</p>
<p>O Jamal! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High! Time and again hath thy mention flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Rejoice and say: Praise be unto Thee for having revealed unto me numerous Tablets and for having mentioned me in Thy Most Great Prison in such wise as hath delighted the eyes of the Concourse on High. O my Lord! I beseech Thee to aid me under all conditions to serve Thy Cause, to witness Thy signs, to recite Thy verses unto Thy servants and to manifest Thy proofs unto Thy creatures. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Compassionate, the Forgiving.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention Nazimul-’Ulama. He hath been mentioned before, but great, great is this Cause. Eyes are prevented from beholding and ears are debarred from hearing, save whom God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, willeth. Reflect upon the people of the Bayan: although they have witnessed with their own eyes the deeds of the Shi’ih sect on the Day of Judgment, they have again become Shi’ihs. Though bearing His Names, they are deprived of their Possessor. In this Revelation, they must rend asunder the veil of names, traverse its gulf and pass beyond it that they may attain unto the Most Great Ocean. In any case, shouldst thou meet Nazimul-’Ulama, convey to him the greetings of the Wronged One. Say: Hearken unto the Call, for if thou hearest with thy true ear it will so attract thee that thou wilt detach thyself from all else but God and attain unto the recognition of His Day. Ponder the events that have occurred. What hath caused all the divines of Persia, after their seeking and expectation, to be deprived on the Day of His Manifestation? By the life of God! In days past in the land of Ta, the lamentations of pulpits rose from all directions, saying in their inner tongue: “O God, O God! Thou didst nurture and manifest us for Thy mention and praise, yet now they mount us and speak contrary to Thy good-pleasure, nay rather, they are engaged in vilification and cursing.” Alas, alas, for what hath befallen us in Thy days! Alas, alas, for their mounting, their sitting and their words! We beseech Thee to deliver us from these people. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the Wise. Every day the pulpits speak, and this hath been mentioned in various Tablets, yet until now none hath been aware. In any case, were they to reflect upon the former sect and become conscious of their misdeeds and transgressions, they would attain unto the light of certitude and steadfastness in this Most Great Cause and Momentous News. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid His friends and loved ones to be trustworthy, religious and steadfast. Verily, He is the Lord of creation. There is none other God but Him, the Commander, the Wise.</p>
<p>We beseech God to aid him who is named Aqa Buzurg, who hath attained Our presence and witnessed and beheld. Verily, he was mentioned before the Wronged One, and We have mentioned him in such wise as hath diffused the fragrance of eternity. Thy Lord is, verily, the Powerful over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Mighty, the Great. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon thy family and upon him who loveth Me and upon him who loveth thee and hearkeneth unto thy word concerning My great and mighty Cause.</p>
<p>O My Name! We have desired at this moment to mention him who is named Zakariyya, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of God, the Lord of the worlds. O Zakariyya! Verily, Zakariyya entered the sanctuary through My remembrance and My love, and We revealed unto him that which was hidden from the eyes of those who denied the Cause of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. My Name hath mentioned thee, and We make mention of thee. Say: Praise be unto Thee for having sent down unto me that which hath caused me to soar in the atmosphere of Thy love and to speak forth Thy beauteous praise. I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful ones.</p>
<p>O My Name! Make mention of him who was named before by the True One. Verily We have remembered him and revealed unto him that which caused the hearts of them that are nigh to take flight. We beseech God to assist him with the hosts of utterance and to make him one who speaketh in His name and who ariseth to serve His loved ones, in whose faces can be seen the radiance of Baha. Thy Lord is verily the All-Bountiful, the All-Wise. Take hold of the Book with strength from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast mentioned concerning the handmaiden of God and her turning to another direction, We have ordained affairs through consultation and have commanded thee thus before and after, and I am the Commander, and I am the Witness, and I am the All-Informed. She must hearken unto thy counsel. Verily thy Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>O My Name! Thou hast made mention of My handmaiden who hath turned towards My horizon and attained My grace and loving-kindness. Give her glad tidings from Me and make mention of her from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great. We send Our greetings unto her and counsel her with that which beseemeth the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. We have remembered her time and again. Then concerning ’Ayn and Ta who attained Our presence in this mighty stronghold, We found him ablaze with Our love and attracted by Our verses. We beseech God to send down upon him and upon those who have believed, from the heaven of His bounty, the rain of His mercy and His gifts. He is verily the Bestower, the Generous.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention Jenab-i-’Ayn and Ba, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness. Praise be to God, he hath ever been remembered in the Most Holy Court. Some time ago Jenab-i-Amin arranged a feast in his name which was accepted. Give him glad tidings of this and send greetings unto him from the Wronged One time and again. Verily He doth not suffer the reward of the doers of good to be lost. They are engaged in service, speaking in remembrance, and steadfast in the Cause. Well is it with him. Soon that which thou seest on earth shall be rolled up, and there shall endure for him that which hath been sent down from the presence of One Who speaketh with knowledge.</p>
<p>O Jamal! We make mention of My handmaiden who soared in Mine atmosphere until she attained My presence. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon her and upon her son ?abibu’llah and upon those who hearken unto thy word concerning this mighty News. O My handmaiden (Mother of Aqa Buzurg), O mother of him who visited Me, rejoice thou in this manifest remembrance, then be thou glad with that which hath moved the Tongue of Grandeur to speak thy name. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful. And We make mention of (Khaliy-i-Fadl) My handmaiden who hath attained to the presence and responded when the Call was raised between the heavens and the earth.</p>

<p>O servant of God! Upon thee be the grace and loving-kindness of God. The letter of the honorable sheikh (may God, the Blessed, the Most High, strengthen him) was perused. Praise be to God, they have attained His favors. We beseech God, the Blessed, the Most High, to strengthen him and assist him in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to rain down upon him from the clouds of His mercy a blessing from His presence and a bounty from His own Self.

<p>O servant of God! Upon thee be the peace and bounty of God. The true and manifest tidings are that one manifestation from the manifestations of the Sun of Truth pertains to him, and one word from the words of the Mother Book hath he attained, and one melody from the melodies hath reached the Kingdom of utterance, and one letter from the attraction of the Call hath arrived at the gate of the Most Great Name. Upon Javad be My glory and loving-kindness; he hath become connected with the ocean of divine generosity. We have heard of his ascension, his turning and his devotion, and We have sent down for him that which causeth the realities of all things to be attracted. By My life! Through My mention the ocean of forgiveness surged in the Most Exalted Kingdom, and the sun of pardon and bestowal shone forth from the horizon of the Will of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne and the Sublime Seat. Verily, We have purified him with the water of utterance and caused him to enter a station adorned with the glances of loving-kindness, embellished with the lights of the Countenance, and illumined with the light of recognition. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who hath sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs and hath spoken that wherefrom the fragrance of utterance hath been wafted throughout contingent being. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>We testify that Javad hath attained unto the ocean of generosity and bounty among the nations, and turned unto God when most of creation turned away from Him, and acknowledged this Day when the people denied it, and showed forth love and devotion when the fire of hatred was kindled. Upon him be My glory and the glory of those in God’s Kingdom and dominion, and the glory of those in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>We enjoin the loved ones to patience and steadfastness, and We beseech the True One to illumine all with the lights of the Orb of grace. O people of God! Be not grieved by that which hath befallen you. We testify that ye have attained unto that which cannot be equaled by treasures nor by the wealth of the princes of the earth. This Manifest Book beareth witness to this. Take, in My Name, the All-Glorious, the cup of joy, then drink therefrom once in My Name, and again in My remembrance, and yet again by My command, in spite of Mine enemies, and yet again by the light of My wondrous Cause.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that in this time each of the friends hath attained that which hath no likeness or equal. They have attained the choice wine of My remembrance in the Kingdom of My utterance from the cup of one of My branches who is present before My face and who writeth My verses by My all-compelling will that prevaileth over all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>O servant of God! We beseech the True One to assist the loved ones in that land to such deeds as will cause the elevation of the Cause of God. By the life of God! The helper of the Truth hath ever been deeds and character. Say: My God, my God! Assist Thy loved ones in that which will cause the exaltation of Thy Most Exalted Word in the world of creation, then aid them to triumph in Thy Cause through wisdom and utterance. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Glorious, the Bestower.</p>
<p>The friends of Ishqabad have acted in a way that has been accepted in glory - they transformed the weapons of warfare into conciliation and love. Blessed are they! When tribulations descended upon them, they held fast to patience by the command of the All-Patient Lord and maintained forbearance. Two deeds which are truly considered among the greatest of all deeds in the sight of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, were manifested by them: first, refraining from retaliation against the oppressors, namely the tyrannical Shi’ih party, and second, interceding with the authorities on behalf of their enemies. This is the conduct that has been and is worthy of the people of Baha. Glory be to them, joy be to them, and light be to them! Now beseech ye God to illumine the hearts of the friends of that land with the light of unity, that the horizons of the world may be brightened by a single light, lest there appear from them that which would prevent them from attaining the most exalted station and the supreme summit.</p>
<p>In these days Jinab-i-Samandar, upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness, has mentioned the deceased and elevated one, and likewise has repeatedly mentioned the friends of that land. Jinab-i-Javad, upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness - We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist him with the hosts of grace and to confirm him in that which He loves and is pleased with. Indeed, steadfastness has been manifested by him and those associated with the aforementioned one.</p>
<p>Yesterday Ismu’llah attained Our presence and mentioned Jinab-i-Darbaghi, upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness, and afterwards sent his letter to Our presence. Blessed is he and joy be unto him! Praise be to God, they have succeeded in teaching the Cause of God, and there was revealed from the Most Exalted Pen especially for him that which caused pure gems to appear from dust and transcended the heavens. His mention has been remembered and his name renowned. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to cause the servants of that land to become detached through the loving counsels of His friends and to guide them to the highest horizon.</p>
<p>Some time ago Hibatu’llah, upon him be My Baha, sent a letter to the Most Holy Court wherein he mentioned the friends. Each one has been blessed with divine favors and received their portion from the ocean of utterance. The door of grace is open, the sun of mercy is shining, the ocean of generosity is surging before all faces - blessed are they that attain! We make mention of each of the handmaidens of God and give them the glad-tidings of the effulgences of the light of divine favor. O My handmaidens and My leaves! Ye have attained to that which most of the men on earth are deprived of. Today, the steadfast and assured maidservants are recorded and mentioned in the Crimson Book above the men. We counsel the handmaidens of God to observe the Most Great Chastity, trustworthiness, religiosity, truthfulness and purity.</p>
<p>O my God, O my God! Aid Thy loved ones, both men and women, to achieve such deeds and character as will cause the fragrance of Thy good pleasure and acceptance to be diffused. The light that shineth resplendent from the horizon of the heaven of bounty be upon the people of Baha, whom the hosts have not weakened nor the ranks intimidated. They have turned unto Thee and said: “We believe in Thee, O Thou the Goal of the mystics and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and on earth!”</p>

<p>Today the hands of God’s loved ones are raised to the heaven of the bounty of the Bestower of gifts, beseeching relief and joy, and imploring victory for the Manifest Religion. They cling to the cord of grace and hold fast to the hem of generosity. The enemies of the Faith have surrounded the mighty and impregnable fortress. From every direction the idolaters have risen to extinguish the Muhammadan light and Ahmadic character. The tempests of polytheism and the storms of infidelity have nearly extinguished the light of divine unity. O people of the world! Arise and with perfect humility, submission and lowliness beseech the Self-Sufficient Lord for assistance, that perchance something may remain. Each soul is occupied with his own fancy and strives in his own affairs. Glory be to God! The signs of the Hour are manifest and the evidences of the resurrection brilliant. The people of the pavilions of glory and the tent of knowledge are all grief-stricken. Eyes are deprived of witnessing and ears forbidden from hearing. The veils of greed and avarice have obscured all, and its fire has consumed the realm of insight. At every moment they sink deeper into the earth, yet remain unaware. As has been and continues to be witnessed, each year the grandeur of God’s religion and God’s Faith diminishes in the eyes of men due to the oppression of the idolaters and the hatred of the opponents.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O God of existence, Who art established upon the throne of manifestation! I beseech Thee by the standards of Thy signs and the banners of Thy power, and by those whom Thou hast made the dawning-places of Thy revelation and the manifestations of Thy Cause and the daysprings of Thy most beautiful names, to protect Thy servants through Thy power which hath conquered all things and Thy might which hath encompassed the earth and heaven. O my Lord! Thou seest the unitarians beneath the claws of the polytheists. I beseech Thee by the light whereby Thou didst deliver Noah and his companions, and didst make the fire cool for Thy Friend despite his enemies, and whereby Thou didst manifest Thy straight path and make it the herald of Thy mighty News, to deliver them through Thy grace and bounty. Then have mercy upon them through Thy providence which hath encompassed all created things and Thy mercy which hath preceded all existing things. Then ordain for them what beseemeth Thy generosity. Verily, Thou art the Giver, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter of that honored one was a source of joy and gladness, for it was adorned with praise and glorification of the One True God. After its reading and perusal, we proceeded to the Divine Court where it was presented. He said: O servant of God! The world craves for reformation and the homes of hearts need repair. These matters have ever been and are dependent upon the hands of justice. Now, through the tyranny of the oppressors, the hands of justice are bound with strong and mighty cords. To loose them is the work of the right hand of power. We beseech God–glorified be His majesty–to loose them and remove the clouds from before the face of the sun. O servant of God! Discernment has been taken away; the blind and the seeing, the deaf and the hearing, are deemed equal in the sight of men. Thou hast observed the letter that was sent. By God’s life! Astonishment is bewildered at this point. Would that Hussein had been asked what he understood from this and what people understand. By God’s life! He should return to his place. If thou wouldst reflect, thou wouldst become aware of the tribulations of this Wronged One. In brief, the vain imaginings of men have reached such a point as transcends description. Ask God not to deprive His servants. The sun of divine wisdom is shining from the horizon of the heaven of knowledge, yet people follow ignorance and fancy. Consider the divines of Iran–what they were and what they did. Their words were praiseworthy but their deeds were like unto Nimrod’s. Nay, by God! They have wrought that which neither Nimrod, nor Pharaoh, nor any rejected idolater ever wrought. Those souls were the cause of division and the weakening of God’s Law. Furthermore, the people of the Bayan are even more lost than these souls, for despite being aware of their evil deeds, they yet follow in their footsteps. We beseech the Most High to protect Us and thee and the company of the unitarians from their mention, their call, their deeds, their words, their counsels and their admonitions. For years they occupied the pulpits with their preaching, yet they themselves never acted upon a single word of it, as hath become clear and evident.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the friends of that land. We beseech God to aid them all and grant them supreme steadfastness.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant also conveys greetings to the gentlemen and friends of that land. I beseech God–glorified be His majesty–to protect them all from the braying and barking of the brayants and barkers.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about the Fast, no such news has been heard in this land. The firm command is that all should hold fast to wisdom. This word was ever heard from the blessed tongue and is likewise recorded in the Tablets. Divine wisdom is the protector and helper of the servants. Therefore, all must hold fast and cling to it. As commanded, convey greetings to all the kindred, both sons and others, and give them the glad-tidings of their Lord’s favors. God willing, may they ever drink from the cup of bounty and abide at rest beneath the Lote-Tree. We beseech Him to send down upon them His blessings and mercy, for He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant also conveys greetings to each one and begs confirmation and assistance for all, and that which will endure through His remembrance. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer. Peace and mercy and glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who act according to that which they were commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. And praise be to Him, for He is the Goal of all seekers and the Object of worship of all who know Him.</p>

<p>He is the Most Glorious, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>O Habib! We sent thee aforetime Tablets containing that which would suffice all the worlds, yet no response from thee reached Our presence; therefore did We restrain the Pen until thy Lord’s appointed time. When it was fulfilled, We sent down unto thee verses from a holy and exalted Dominion. O Habib! Ascend unto the celestial heights and fear no one, but place thy trust at all times in the Beauty of sublime and impregnable glory. Then rend asunder the veils by Our command and arise between earth and heaven upon this Word which hath been mentioned from the direction of the Throne. Rend asunder the veils of men through that which God hath bestowed upon thee, that perchance thereby God’s fire may be kindled in all else but Him, and the Spirit may proclaim in all things that there is none other God but I, the One Who hath power to do what He willeth, and verily I have been independent of all worlds.</p>
<p>Know thou that when We found the people immersed in the delusion of ignorance and the intoxication of desire, We lifted the hem of the veil with the fingers of Command less than can be counted. Then arose the clamor of the denizens of Sinai at the station of pause, the veils of the righteous were rent asunder, every known name was struck with awe, and servants who were created by My command rose up against Me and returned to what they were, and thus was Satan veiled from the Self of the All-Merciful. And thou, come forth from behind the veil of concealment, then open thy tongue in utterance, for the Spirit will aid thee from the presence of the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Know thou that they who were veiled behind the veil feared for themselves. Yet when We raised up the Cause and the breezes of assurance wafted from the direction of the All-Merciful, they then rose against Me with swords of hatred and showed no shame before God Who created them from fetid water. Thus was their rebellion against Me and their transgression against God Who created all things by His command, and verily He encompasseth all things.</p>
<p>Say: O people! By God, ye and all who are on earth are in God’s sight but as the blackness in the eye of an ant, or less than that, and thy Lord’s Self sufficeth as witness to this. They in whose breasts burned the fire of hatred, these took their leaders as lords besides God. What aileth this people that they comprehend not a single word?</p>
<p>O Habib! When the hosts of thy Lord’s inspiration descended in the guise of verses, then were the faces of those who waxed proud before God blackened, and they were far removed from the pavilion of security. Their leadership deluded them to such degree that they denied what they had believed in and manifested evident rebellion. And thou, take hold of the reins of the Cause with power from Us and neither pause nor keep silent, for silence is praiseworthy only in the remembrance of thy Lord - thus hath the command been sent down from the cloud of grace. Sanctify the hem of holiness from the touch of the idolaters, then stand firm between earth and heaven with mighty power. By God! Upon the heart of whoso remaineth steadfast in My love shall descend the Most Great Spirit, and the Holy Spirit shall speak upon his tongue, and shall aid him at all times.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of the Bayan! Enter ye into the presence of God, then judge fairly within your own selves, and be ye God-fearing in this Cause. Should ye deny these verses, by what evidence can ye prove your faith in God and the Manifestations of His Self? Bring forth your proof if ye be capable thereof. Then shall ye behold upon their faces the darkness of fire from the wrath of their Lord, the All-Powerful, and they shall speak as spoke the people of the Furqan when ’Ali came upon clouds of light from the presence of the Mighty, the All-Wise. O beloved! Arise in this Cause, then offer the pure wine ere the great cry be raised. Thus have We commanded thee in truth in this Tablet which hath been inscribed by the finger of might. Remind the people of this Most Great Remembrance and fear no one, for He will protect thee with the hosts of power and might, will strengthen thee with the Spirit, and cause thee to speak between earth and heaven with the melodies of the Dove in the midmost heart of eternity. Thus hath the decree been witnessed from the horizon of the Cause. By God, O beloved! Shouldst thou examine the body of Baha, thou wouldst find no place thereon but hath been struck by the arrows of fate from those filled with hatred, whereat have wept the eyes of the people of eternity behind the pavilions of concealed glory. They slay the Self of God with the swords of their malice, then recite His verses. Say: Ye shall have no mention today in the presence of God, even should ye bring forth the deeds of all creation combined. Among them are those deceived by the name of the Mirror, and those seized by the veils of fancy. Rend thou these two veils through the power of might and strength, and be thou supremely sanctified in truth. Leave behind all names and their kingdoms, then ascend on the wings of holiness to that station where all created things shall take shelter in thy shadow, and thou shalt behold thyself established upon the most holy seat of glory. Should thou find thyself alone in My love, grieve not, for this is a matter none can bear save him who is detached from all in the heavens and earth. Thus doth God purify the hem of sanctity from the touch of every rejected polytheist. Take comfort in thy Lord, then forget all else, then convey unto the people what the Spirit teacheth thee from the presence of the Self-Subsisting. Know thou that the Youth of the Spirit hath fallen into the well of hatred, and there was no caravan of eternity to let down the bucket of faithfulness save His own Most Exalted Self. Soon shall He raise him up in truth and aid him through a Cause that encompasseth all the worlds. Shouldst thou hearken with the ear of innate nature, thou wouldst hear the lamentation of all things for this Beauty Who hath been wronged among the polytheists. Thus have We cast upon thee a letter from the tablets of destiny that thou mayest discover what is hidden and be illumined with clear insight. The Spirit, glory and splendor be upon thee and upon those with thee whom God hath strengthened in His love and made steadfast in His Cause.</p>

<p>He is God, the Most Manifest, the Most Manifest!</p>
<p>O Bird of Inner Meanings and Utterance! Wing thy flight in the atmosphere of divine knowledge, then hearken to the melodies of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, that they may detach thee from the contingent world and all that hath been ordained within the realm of possibility, and draw thee nigh unto the Ridvan wherein the Sun of Utterance hath dawned from the horizon of exposition, and wherein the Nightingale of Glory warbleth its various melodies upon the branches of the Tree that was planted by the hands of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful, the Powerful, the Inaccessible, the Impregnable.</p>
<p>O Nightingale of Remembrance! Soar in the atmosphere of My nearness, then in the heaven of My loving-kindness. Then hearken to My melodies from the direction of My Throne. Then detach thyself from all else but Me. Then speak forth My remembrance and My praise amongst My servants and My creatures. Fear not the wicked among My servants nor the oppressors among My creation. Illumine thy countenance with the lights of My face, then thy heart with the white radiance of My knowledge and loving-kindness. Then inhale the fragrances of the All-Merciful from My garment and the breezes of Glory from My wondrous words. By God! Through these have the hearts of the sanctified ones, the minds of the mystics, the tongues of those who remember, and the realities of the Concourse on High been stirred, raised up, quickened, called out and cried aloud.</p>
<p>Thus have We imparted unto thee from the words of thy Lord that He might guide thee to the Ridvan of My nearness, distance thee from all else but Me, establish thee in the paradise of My grace, open thy tongue with the wonders of My remembrance, and cause the breezes of the Cause to move thee with longing for My reunion and desire for My good-pleasure. Thus hath the Lote-Tree of the Uttermost Boundary brought forth fruits through the mention of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High. Take shelter, then, beneath its shade and partake of its fruits. Well is it with him who hath found its sweetness, tasted its flavor, and is numbered among the successful ones.</p>
<p>Say: O people of creation! The Beauty of your Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High, hath come upon the clouds of destiny, with the Kingdom of eternity proceeding before Him and the hosts of the unseen from the Concourse on High following after Him. Say: By God! He hath come to quicken the world and unite all its peoples. O people of the Bayan! Fear ye your Lord, the All-Merciful, dispute not with Him, and oppose Him not. Fear God, O heedless ones!</p>
<p>Know thou that the tale of weeping hath returned in this Most Glorious Youth, whom His wicked servants have cast into the well of darkness. By God, the Truth! O youth who walketh in the atmosphere of love and faithfulness! The garment whereof every thread proclaimeth “There is none other God but Him, the Most Exalted, the Most High” hath now been pierced by the spears of hatred. Were this garment to be revealed, even less than can be counted between earth and heaven, verily the people of the Concourse on High would pass away, the pillars of the Throne would quake, the leaves of the Furthermost Tree would fall, and the Lote-Tree of the Uttermost Boundary would be cast down upon the darkened earth.</p>
<p>And if thou wouldst hear with the ear of God and be detached from all else save Him, thou wouldst surely hear the lamentation of ’Ali in the Ridvan of eternity, the cry of Muhammad in the chambers of the Cloud of Mystery, and the call of the Spirit in the heaven of destiny. But the people of the Bayan laugh and rejoice, then mock their Lord God and remain unaware.</p>
<p>And there hath been inscribed by the Pen of God upon the cheek of all else but Him from this blood which was shed in God’s path, in the secret of the line: By My beauty, My grandeur, and My majesty! This, verily, is the Wronged One Who hath been slain in My path throughout all ages. Through one of His sighs have the suns of rapture and yearning dawned in the hearts of the righteous ones. Through the fire of His love hath the heat of God’s love appeared in every age. Through the tears of His eyes have the clouds poured forth their rain. And through the shrill voice of His pen the Most Exalted Pen hath be set in motion, and a voice from the direction of grandeur calleth out: O people of the Bayan! This, verily, is the Essence of the All-Merciful and the Reality of the All-Glorious. If ye believe not in Him, oppose Him not, nor contend with Him. Sufficient unto Him was what the peoples of former times inflicted upon Him in Iraq, in days when all who are in the heavens and on earth were sorely troubled. Thereupon did the Spirit of God return unto Itself, and the breezes of the All-Merciful unto their Source, and the sweet savors of eternity were withheld from the realms of holiness, and the fragrance of glorification from the kingdoms of creation, and the gates of the Ridvan were shut by reason of what the manifestations of Satan wrought against His exalted and mighty Self. Say: O people of the Bayan! If ye persist in your ways, why then did ye leave the community of the Furqan and enter into the party of God, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great? For We observe you speaking as did the peoples of former times in those days, and advancing the same arguments as did the followers of religions past. It would behoove you, then, to return to your former path and follow your forbears of old. Ye slay Ali with the swords of opposition, then busy yourselves with his praise and glorification. Therefore do all things give you the lie, and the denizens of the highest Paradise disown you. Thus hath the Pen of Destiny inscribed upon the Tablet of Divine decree, were ye of them that perceive. Would that people would discover this Cause which hath appeared with the truth, and that which they have taken as a lord besides God. Then would the tongue of all things proclaim: Would that the people of the Bayan knew what was veiled from them, for they are of the heedless! Is there one possessed of vision, of understanding, of intelligence, of heart and soul who would ponder this Cause and discover that which none among Our slumbering servants hath discovered?</p>
<p>O Nightingale of remembrance! Know thou that from the Most Exalted Pen of thy Lord, which is now moved by the fingers of holiness from the hand of the Most Glorious, proceed such melodies and such notes that were but one of them to be sounded, all who dwell in the heavens and on earth would be struck down, except such as have detached themselves from all that is mentioned amongst men and have turned with pure, sanctified, and luminous hearts unto God. Thus have We made mention unto thee of the gems of wisdom and utterance, that the melodies of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, might draw thee unto Him, might sanctify thee from all allusions, might illumine thee with the lights of this Sun which hath dawned from the horizon of the divine Essence with manifest splendor, and might cause thee to speak forth, through the attraction of the Almighty, in praise of His mighty and chosen Self in such wise that neither the evil whisperings of the wicked nor the words of the impious among the company of polytheists shall deter thee. And upon thee, and upon those who have entered this most sublime and mighty stronghold, be the Spirit, the Light, the Glory and the Splendor.</p>

<p>He is God, the One, the Single, the Unique, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>O servant! How can I recount to thee what hath befallen Me in this Prison at the hands of those who prided themselves on serving Me, standing in My presence, and keeping watch at My gate? When they found Me imprisoned in this far-off land, they rose up against Me with tyranny, opened their lips in lies and calumny, and spoke against Me what they perceived in the mirror of their own souls and hearts. Thou art indeed aware of some of these matters. We beseech God to aid thee to manifest pure truthfulness and to speak among the people of what thou hast witnessed and seen. Beware lest thou add or subtract a single letter. Remind the people of what thou knowest, that perchance God may cause what proceedeth from thy mouth to cast from their hearts all that distanceth them from self and passion and draweth them nigh unto God, their Lord.</p>
<p>Hearken unto My words: Detach thyself from the world, its ornaments, its embellishments, and all that hath been created therein and thereon. Soon shall all that thou beholdest and seest pass away, and sovereignty shall remain with thy Lord. Strive, therefore, in this world that thy purpose may be that which God hath purposed for thee, for that which He hath purposed should be the purpose of every soul. Choose not for thyself save that which He hath chosen for thee and commanded thee, for He is the All-Choosing, and hath chosen what His righteous servants, they that are among the most virtuous, have chosen. Hearken unto My words and forget not that which this servant counseleth thee. By God! We have never before commanded anyone, nor do We now command thee, except with that which is better for thee and for them, that perchance souls may be detached from all that preventeth them from arriving at the shore of the love of God and His commandments.</p>
<p>Make provision for thy journeys through reliance upon thy Chosen Lord, let thy drink be His love and knowledge, and let thy raiment be the fear of God - which is to shun the wicked and their deeds and actions - and steadfastness in the Cause of God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>And when thou departest from that land and enterest another, perform ablutions, and while washing, call upon God, thy Lord and the Lord of all that is seen and unseen, and say:</p>
<p>“O my Lord! Even as Thou hast cleansed my body with this water, purify me from all that veils me from knowing Thee between earth and heaven. O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy manifest Name to send down at this moment from the clouds of Thy mercy the holy rain of Thy favors, that thereby my soul and heart may be cleansed from the defilement of those who have disbelieved in Thy signs, warred against Thy Self, and turned away from Thy proof. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.”</p>
<p>And when thou hast completed thy ablutions and donned thy garment, prostrate thyself upon the earth before God, thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing, and say:</p>
<p>“O my Lord! This is Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, who hath sought refuge in Thee and clung to the hem of Thy mercy and held fast to the cord of Thy loving-kindness. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the breezes of forgiveness have wafted over the sinners among Thy servants, that Thou forgive me and have mercy upon me. Then make me, O my God, sincere in my devotion to Thy Cause, obedient to Thy command, looking toward the horizon of Thy bounty, firm in Thy love, established in Thy affection, assured of Thy grace, certain of Thy Lordship, submissive to Thy Oneness, acknowledging Thy sovereignty, and confessing Thy grandeur and majesty. O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Beautiful Names and Thy Most Exalted Words, and by Thy Name through which Thou hast guided the seekers to the manifestations of the light of Thy Beauty and the yearning ones to the paradise of the glory of Thy presence and reunion, that Thou leave me not to myself and my desires, nor deprive me of the oceans of Thy grace and bounty, nor occupy me with that which Thy good-pleasure abhorreth. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>Then raise thy head and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having enabled me to achieve this and for having caused me to hear the call of Thy servant.” And when thy task is completed, say “In the Name of God and through God,” then place thy trust in Him with thy tongue and thy heart, and proceed to the dwellings with the fragrances of thy Lord. And when thou beholdest the loved ones of God, say: “O people! Fear God, and spread not corruption in God’s earth, and wage not war against men, and dispute not with them, and consume not their wealth unjustly, and refute not the truth by what ye possess, and say not that which ye do not practice, and commit not that which ye have been forbidden in the Book of God, and shed not blood, and engage not in that which displeaseth God’s good-pleasure and your own minds. Fear God, O people! Purify your hearts from the remembrance of those who have disbelieved in God, then your eyes from gazing upon them, then your souls from turning unto them. Remind men with wisdom and utterance, and transgress not that which ye have been commanded by your Lord, the Mighty, the Merciful. Adorn your temples with the robes of detachment, and your tongues with truthfulness, and your hearts with sincerity, then make your breasts free from all deceit and guile and doubt. Be adorned, O people, with the qualities of the spiritually-minded, and deny not God’s grace and mercy after ye have witnessed it with your eyes and it hath encompassed you from all sides. Fear God, and whoso feareth Him shall fear no one, nor shall anything that hath been created in the earth cause him fear. Fear God, O people! Be God’s trustees in His earth, and the lamps of His Cause in His lands, and the torches of His remembrance amongst His servants. And thou, O servant, if thou hearkenest unto what this servant hath counseled thee and detachest thyself from all else but God, He will kindle in thy breast such a fire of His love that its heat shall reach His servants, and the slumbering shall awaken by its warmth, and the heedless shall be reminded thereby. Strive within thyself that there may be manifested in thee what God hath desired for thee, then turn away from those who speak that which they know not and utter that which they understand not. Blessed is the servant who hath detached himself from the world and turned unto his Lord, and hearkened unto that which he was commanded, and turned away from the idolaters. Then remind from Our presence the loved ones of God whom God hath sanctified from the allusions of them that glory in appearances, and who were of the firmly assured. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God and were steadfast.”</p>

<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>“O guardian angels! Return them to their abode in the world below,</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>

<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>And with her brow signed to the Celestial Concourse,</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>

<p>And as the radiance of her beauty shone upon the people of dust,</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>All beings were shaken in their mortal graves.</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>She then raised the call which no ear through all eternity hath ever heard,</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>And thus proclaimed: “By the Lord! He whose heart hath not the fragrance of the love of the exalted and glorious Arabian Youth,</p>

<p>“Can in no wise ascend unto the glory of the highest heaven.”</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>

<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>And commanded her: “Descend into space from the mansions of eternity,</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>“And turn thou unto that which they have concealed in the inmost of their hearts.</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>“Shouldst thou inhale the perfume of the robe from the Youth that hath been hidden within the tabernacle of light by reason of that which the hands of the wicked have wrought,</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>“Raise a cry within thyself, that all the inmates of the chambers of Paradise, that are the embodiments of the eternal wealth, may understand and hearken;</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>“That they may all come down from their everlasting chambers and tremble,</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>“And kiss their hands and feet for having soared to the heights of faithfulness;</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>“Perchance they may find from their robes the fragrance of the Beloved One.”</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>Thereupon the countenance of the favored damsel beamed above the celestial chambers even as the light that shineth from the face of the Youth above His mortal temple;</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>She then descended with such an adorning as to illumine the heavens and all that is therein.</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>She bestirred herself and perfumed all things in the lands of holiness and grandeur.</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>When she reached that place she rose to her full height in the midmost heart of creation,</p>

<p>And sought to inhale their fragrance at a time that knoweth neither beginning nor end.</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>She found not in them that which she did desire, and this, verily, is but one of His wondrous tales.</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>She then cried aloud, wailed and repaired to her own station within her most lofty mansion,</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>And then gave utterance to one mystic word, whispered privily by her honeyed tongue,</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>And raised the call amidst the Celestial Concourse and the immortal maids of heaven:</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>“By the Lord! I found not from these idle claimants the breeze of Faithfulness!</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>“By the Lord! The Youth hath remained lone and forlorn in the land of exile in the hands of the ungodly.”</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>She then uttered within herself such a cry that the Celestial Concourse did shriek and tremble,</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>And she fell upon the dust and gave up the spirit. It seemeth she was called and hearkened unto Him that summoned her unto the Realm on High.</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>Glorified be He that created her out of the essence of love in the midmost heart of His exalted paradise!</p>
<p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>Thereupon the maids of heaven hastened forth from their chambers, upon whose countenances the eye of no dweller in the highest paradise had ever gazed.</p>
<p>Glorified be our Lord, the Most High!</p>
<p>They all gathered around her, and lo! they found her body fallen upon the dust;</p>
<p>Glorified be our Lord, the Most High!</p>
<p>And as they beheld her state and comprehended a word of the tale told by the Youth, they bared their heads, rent their garments asunder, beat upon their faces, forgot their joy, shed tears and smote with their hands upon their cheeks, and this is verily one of the mysterious grievous afflictions�”</p>
<p>Glorified be our Lord, the Most High!</p>

<p>This is what hath shone forth from the horizon of utterance: Regarding what ye had mentioned about the upheaval and discord in Iran - this is what We promised in the Tablets. O physician! Before the sending of Badi’, the divine proof was not complete and conclusive for the people of that land, for the ruler had not been fully informed of the details, nor had anyone openly conveyed to him a word of truth. However, after the appearance of Badi’, through divine power and the delivery of the divine Word and Book, the proof and evidence became complete and conclusive. When they turned not to the spiritual bounty, they were deprived of outward blessings as well. This tribulation was decreed by God, the Lord of Names. Now one must ponder what caused the drops from the ocean of divine wrath to grant respite to the ruler while seizing the others. With thy Lord is the knowledge of what was and what shall be. He is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Had people reflected upon these occurrences and this great calamity, thou wouldst have found all turning toward the shore of divine unity. But that which He willed hath come to pass. He, verily, is the One Who is desired. O physician! Vain imaginings have prevented the people from the Lord of all beings. Observe the People of the Furqan, who through vain and idle fancies were deprived of the King of utterance. Two matters were established and confirmed among that people, to such extent that they occupied themselves day and night with their mention: one was the mention of the Qa’im, and one the mention of succession. Regarding the Qa’im, thou hast witnessed that what they held was mere fancy. Now leave aside the People of the Furqan and observe certain People of the Bayan who have once again clung to former vain imaginings, even as the evil one of Isfahan mentioned succession to everyone he met, hoping that through reference to former imaginings he might deprive people from the shore of justice - although that evil one himself knew that there was never any mention of succession in the Bayan, and moreover he was not informed about Yahya’s cause. Nevertheless, he and his followers, through their whisperings, prevent people from the Countenance of the Chosen One.</p>
<p>This is why people have not yet attained maturity. Were they mature, they would not be prevented from the One mentioned by such mentions, nor would they remain distant from Him through Whose one word a hundred thousand saints are created. Blessed is the soul who rendeth asunder all veils of fancy and with penetrating vision gazeth upon the Dawning-Place of divine oneness. Although the People of the Bayan witnessed that all they formerly possessed was mere fancy, still they remain veiled from the Lord of creation through the imaginings of the idolaters. Today, if one doth not consider all these stations as non-existent and null, he is not counted as human in God’s sight, let alone achieving lofty stations. With the ear of the spirit, hearken to the call of the All-Merciful saying: Verily the wayfarer on the white path and the crimson pillar shall never reach the station of his homeland - that is, the station of meeting his Lord - except by emptying his hands of what is in people’s hands, what their tongues speak, and what their hearts imagine. How excellent is he who hath attained unto this most exalted station, this ultimate goal, this highest summit!</p>
<p>The followers of the Bayan have risen up against Me with a cruelty unparalleled in the world. Had they but observed with the eye of equity and turned unto that which God hath desired, the fragrance of the divine Robe would have embraced them all. By Him Who hath caused Me to speak the truth, they are seen to be so bereft of justice and heedless that naught above it can be imagined. I beseech God to assist them to recognize this Manifestation, than Whom the eye of creation hath seen none more wondrous. Say: By God! He is the Originator of the heavens and earth, and He is the Lamp of God unto all the worlds.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention concerning the Mim, he hath indeed transgressed. Soon shall he witness his loss for what he hath committed, except he repent and return. He, verily, is the Judge, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We have withheld the Pen concerning his state, for he hath no opinion of his own but is governed by those around him. Thus hath the matter been decreed in a mighty Tablet. Grieve not over this, for God shall soon render victorious His loved ones and seize those who have wronged. This, verily, is a truth assured.</p>
<p>O Physician! We hear the lamentation of the House. It saith: “O Lord! Deliver me from the wrongdoing people. O my God! Send forth one who will take me, free me, and restore me. Thou art, verily, powerful over this, and Thou art the Mighty, the Omnipotent. How long shall I remain in the possession of those who have denied Thee and Thy mighty signs? O Lord! Deliver me from these polytheists who heard not Thy call nor answered Thee. Vain imaginings have so seized them that they turned away from Thee and opposed Thee after Thou didst come unto them from the Dayspring of grace with manifest sovereignty.”</p>
<p>If someone could be found there who would lease it even temporarily, this would be favored. The matter is in God’s hands. He, verily, is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. Convey My greetings to My loved ones and give them glad tidings of My remembrance of them. We beseech God to assist them to remain steadfast in His love, for nothing in creation can equal it. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to Abdul-Rahim. We beseech God to strengthen him in His love such that he may cast vain imaginings beneath his feet and shatter the idol of idle fancies through the name of his Lord, the Mighty, the Wise, and assist him to serve and obey Him, sanctify him from the whisperings of the corrupters, and make him mindful of Him among His servants. He is the Protector of whosoever turneth unto Him. There is no God but He, the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful. May the glory be upon thee and upon him and upon them from One Mighty and Wise.</p>

<p>The spiritual beloved, his honor Nabil son of Nabil, upon them both be God’s peace and solicitude, may observe:</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the majesty and the power!</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified from the limitations of creation, befits and is worthy of that exalted Truth Who, through the wonders of His bounty and generosity, illumined the world with the lights of justice and guided it to the straight path which is the cause and means of preserving the peoples. He is the Omnipotent One Whom the armies of the world cannot weaken and the opposition of the idolaters cannot frighten. His will is supreme and His decree penetrating. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Strong, the Dominant, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. And the prayer shining from the horizon of the grace of the Lord of eternity be upon the Lord of Nations and Master of the World, through Whom the Book was sealed and God’s promise of judgment’s return was fulfilled, and upon His family and companions whom God made the stars of the heaven of His knowledge and the moons of the horizons of His proof.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who with the finger of Thy power didst rend the veils! I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty, Thy might and Thy power to aid Thy resplendent Law and protect it from the idolaters among Thy servants and the deniers among Thy creatures. O Lord! Weakness hath seized the limbs of Thy party, and the vitals of Thy religion tremble at the onslaught of Thine enemies. I beseech Thee, O King of Kings and Merciful to the downtrodden, to send down from the heaven of Thy grace that which will exalt Thy Cause among Thy servants and raise the standards of Thy mention in Thy lands. O Lord! I implore Thee by the Manifestations of Thy Cause, the Daysprings of Thy revelation, and by the Seal of Thy Prophets and chosen ones, to protect him who hath clung to Thee and to the cord of obedience to Thee, who hath spoken Thy praise and glorification, and arisen to serve Thy Cause. O Lord! Thou seest him clinging to Thee, hoping in Thy grace, and yearning for Thy nearness and meeting. O Lord! Deprive him not of the revelations of the light of Thy knowledge, and render him not deprived of the effulgences of the dawn of Thy favors. Make all his deeds and devotions as one devotion in Thy presence. This is what the sovereign of Thy chosen ones uttered in a prayer taught by the Lord of Thy Messengers: “that all my deeds and devotions may become as one devotion, and in eternal service to Thee.” O Lord! Protect him who hath entered the fortress of Thy security, then aid him who hath sought shelter beneath the shadow of Thy banner. Grant him pilgrimage to Thy Sacred House once again, and ordain for him that which shall profit him in the hereafter and in this world. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Verily my heart yearns to converse with thee, and my spirit loves to turn to thy face, though faces are indicated by thee and me. Yet the love of God with which we have been blessed cannot be indicated by the signs of the world. It speaks of true spiritual oneness - whoso attains unto this has attained unto the mysteries of the Books and the signs of the Scriptures. Blessed is the seeker who has found his Goal, and the searcher who has been honored with the presence of his Beloved. The longing and yearning of this servant is evident and clear. The One God is witness that at all times he wishes to make mention of that spiritual beloved, but due to the multitude of occupations and other matters, there is sometimes delay. Yet heart-to-heart communications have, praise be to God, existed and continue to exist, [and nothing] has or will affect them. Thy letter was presented before His Countenance. He said that thou art adorned with a pleasing ornament and art confirmed and mentioned in all conditions. Whoso attains unto this has attained unto the Most Great Joy. Whoso is for God, God is for him. Praise be to God, thou art known and mentioned for pure deeds in God’s path. No harm comes to thee from incidental matters and unpleasing signs. What has been and is being said is an expression of love outwardly and inwardly in a station that changes not.</p>
<p>We counsel Nabil, upon him be My peace, to deal with kindness and affection toward the few souls who are in that land. They should in no wise take notice of words or deeds wherein opposition may be perceived, for they must become the reference point for all matters. However they deal with those few souls will be the cause of their own exaltation - no harm will ever return to them. I am among those who bear witness. Let them act in such a way that those few souls remain at peace. Man is ever prone to error, save him whom God protects. Forgiveness and overlooking are ever beloved before God. The purpose is that they should not engage in conflict with anyone in that land, so that gradually their love too may dawn and the foundation of thy business may be made firm.</p>
<p>Although in the outward world separation, parting and division have prevailed, yet by God’s grace the light of true nearness is not prevented by leagues and miles. This is of God’s bounty - He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth. I beseech and implore Him to strengthen the light of nearness and to ordain outward meeting and reunion. He is powerful and mighty over all things. Indeed this time of separation from that beloved has had a great effect, a mighty effect. The servant asks his Lord to grant reunion after it. Verily He has power over all things.</p>
<p>The tools and implements sent for the garden arrived. Indeed much trouble has been taken. It is hoped that, God willing, through these implements success will be achieved for the garden and from that success an enduring fragrance will be diffused. In this case, this deed of that beloved will remain with him - that is, mention of it will, God willing, remain fixed and established in the book of the world.</p>
<p>I send greetings to the honored brother, Aqa Ghulam-Husayn, from whom every possessor of smell has found the fragrance of the garment, and I congratulate him and beseech the Exalted Truth to confirm him in attaining all that he hopes and seeks. May the manifest, evident and radiant peace shining from the horizon of divine favor be upon you and upon him and upon God’s righteous servants. Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds.</p>

<p>The Beloved of the Heart, His Holiness Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be the 966 [Glory of God] and His favors, may he take note.</p>
<p>He is God - exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise be to the Goal of the world Who, through the letters of His chosen ones, causes the sweet-scented breezes of love to waft, Who draws near, Who bestows union, Who brings to remembrance. These are all among the fruits of the letter. This door of bounty is made manifest through the pen. Glory be to God! How resonant is this soundless pen! It is the source of all the world’s sounds. Its scratching gives life to souls. The world of command and creation appears through it and returns to it, for in one station it is the first interpreter and in another the second. How many treasuries of arts and knowledge has this hollow shaft gathered within itself! This is but the description of the pen of composition; how then can any tongue be worthy to make mention of the Most Exalted Pen? Glory be to God! Hearts and minds cannot reach it nor comprehend it. It is from the Truth and is attributed to the Truth. The description of Truth transcends the understanding and knowledge of all created things. Glorified be our Lord, the Most High! Were anyone to speak with fairness, he would in truth observe the world’s powerlessness to describe any single thing, let alone that which is beyond, and beyond beyond, and that station which is sanctified above the mention of beyondness. And peace and blessings be upon God’s chosen ones and His friends whom nothing whatsoever has prevented from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of all beings. These are servants whose attributes the All-Merciful has revealed in the Qur’an through His exalted Word: “honored servants who speak not until He hath spoken, and who do His bidding.” These are the hands of Truth amidst creation, the manifestations of power among the servants, and the recipients of knowledge among all lands. Blessed is he who holds fast unto them and clings to their hem. He is verily among the successful ones in the sight of God, Who controls the winds and Who causes the dawn to break.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Thy letter, adorned with glad-tidings, was received. God knoweth it was a spiritual herald and a luminous messenger that brought tidings of thine arrival as well as thy health and well-being. It was especially adorned with mention of the Two Lights, upon them be God’s most exalted peace and most glorious praise. The gates of joy, gladness and delight were opened by the key of its words. God is witness and His chosen ones do testify what effect these glad-tidings produced. The bounty of the sun is manifest and the generosity of the spring rains is evident and visible. Every person of insight and wisdom doth speak His praise. What further effects will the dawning rays of the Sun of love produce and what generosity will it show! We beseech God that this favor may continue uninterrupted and these tidings may follow in succession, and that He may grant this servant opportunity, though what is in the heart can never be fully expressed in words and one is powerless to manifest it. That which dawned from the horizon of the letter was presented before Him, and the Lord - may our spirits be sacrificed for Him - said: “Praise be to God that the journey was accomplished with joy and fragrance, and God willing shall reach its Source. From mention of the Luminary of bounty, dawning and manifest, mention hath transitions. For him are established heavens and visible horizons. At every moment a light appeareth from his horizons and a word shineth forth. His fragrance caused the appearance of fire in the Tree and the manifestation of light in minds and hearts. We beseech God to increase at all times the joy of the branches and thy joy, and to send down from the heaven of bounty that whose traces and fruits shall never end or change. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful.” We heard thy call and beseech God to grant that which beseemeth His generosity. Thou hast ever been and art before Our sight. Convey to all the loved ones of that land the greetings of the Wronged One. End. Praise be to God! The river floweth, mercy descendeth, bounty is manifest, the Sun of utterance dawneth. Mention of these bestowals transcendeth hearts and minds. God willing, thou shalt at all times be confirmed, successful, triumphant, present and steadfast in service. This evanescent one seeketh this same success for himself. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer. I convey greetings to the loved ones and nobles of that land, and in the nights and days I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for that which beseemeth His generosity for each one. Verily He is the Generous, the Kind. In truth, where am I and where is mention of His loved ones? This too is from God’s confirmations and the manifestations of His Cause, for He hath commanded all to mention His chosen ones and loved ones. Glory be to our Lord, the Most Exalted!</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning Mu’in and His Holiness Mu’in, upon him be God’s grace, bounty, acceptance and favor - this is the truth in which there is no doubt. In truth, they have been and are the helper of the oppressed and the supporter of those who are nigh unto God. Their reward is inscribed in the Book of Divine Grace and will not be erased by worldly events. This is a mighty glad-tiding from a manifest Source. The servant beseeches his Lord to extend his life, grant him success, strengthen him, and ordain for him the good of both worlds. Verily He is the One Who has power over whatsoever He willeth through His command “Be!” and it is. Praise be to God, in the world a dawning of good is observed; after despair, relief appears. The grace of Truth has been and will ever be limitless. He confirms whomsoever He willeth; He is powerful and mighty over all things. Furthermore, the services of His Presence are not forgotten, especially this service - what can I say? I beseech God to ordain that which is befitting for the servants of His Cause and those who arise to assist it. His is the grace and the bestowal, His the bounty and the glory. There is no God but Him, the Lord of the present and the future world. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon your presence, and upon all who are steadfast and firm, and all who are resolute and knowing.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Ancient!</p>
<p>A remembrance from Our presence to him who hath attained unto the lights of divine knowledge in the days of his Lord, the Most Merciful, and hath voiced His praise amidst the concourse of all created things. He is verily of those who have attained. Blessed is he who hath stood firm in the Cause of God and desired that which his Ancient Lord desired. It behooveth thee to arise to serve the Cause in such wise that whatsoever proceedeth from the Pen of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, shall not grieve thee. We have chosen thee for Our Cause, as witnessed by all things and beyond them this All-Knowing Pen. We have sent thee numerous Tablets which well-nigh fill the horizons. Thy Lord is verily the All-Numbering, the All-Informed. It behooveth thee to render thanks unto Him at morn and eventide, and to soar on the wings of spirit and joy in the atmosphere of the love of thy Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate.</p>
<p>We have revealed for everyone mentioned in thy book clear verses that cannot be equaled by the treasuries of the heavens and earth. This is of My grace upon thee, and thou dost witness what God hath witnessed, wouldst thou but reflect. Thy Lord is verily the Forgiving, the Merciful. He was with thee when thou wert in Iraq and other lands, and heard what thy tongue uttered in remembrance of this Wronged One, this Exile, and testified unto thee with His truthful and trustworthy tongue. Behold the Tablets We sent thee aforetime, that thou mayest be assured that His grace hath encompassed thee and His mercy hath preceded thee in every matter. He is verily the Lord of those who turn unto Him.</p>
<p>Wert thou to gather all that hath been revealed for thee, thou wouldst find it a book wherein every word indicateth thy Lord’s loving care. Read thou and be of them that render thanks. The ocean of grace hath surged and the heaven of bounty hath been adorned with the stars of thy Lord’s favors, the Lord of all names. Drink thou therefrom and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of all seekers!</p>
<p>O My physician! God’s grace and bounties have ever been and shall ever continue to be. Out of pure loving-kindness, numerous wondrous and sublime Tablets have been revealed and sent to thee at most times, and for every soul mentioned in thy book, divine verses were specifically revealed and dispatched. Most of this bounty pertaineth to thee thyself. Thou must, God willing, conduct thyself in such manner that whatsoever proceedeth from God and the Dawning-Place of His Cause should be regarded as thy desire and purpose. His purpose and whatsoever proceedeth from Him hath been and shall ever be. O My Name! Thy will must be connected to what God willeth, and thy desire must be annihilated in His desire - that is, thou must regard God’s will as thy desire and His wish as thy purpose. It is most evident that the condition of all is witnessed and known before the Divine Throne, and His gaze hath ever been and shall ever be fixed upon His loved ones. Thou art now counted among those related to the Truth. Let not certain matters grieve thee. Be confident in God’s grace and be detached and free from aught else but Him.</p>
<p>Write that they should take heed not to trust in him, for he has not been and will never be steadfast. Whatever matters he comprehends and understands, he will surely mention in due time. If the Tablet to the Sultan is given, there is no harm, as most of the opponents have seen it and it has even reached the source of opposition. Therefore, if it reaches anyone, no harm will come of it. However, nothing else is ever permitted. They should exercise utmost care. His example is like that of a serpent - when it reaches maturity, it strikes and hisses. Regarding the House, the intention is that it be purified from strangers. If the name Mim with utmost gratitude and joy and fragrance relinquishes the House to him to whom it belongs, this is most beloved and praiseworthy. Otherwise, speak not of it and turn not unto it. Thus does the All-Knowing, the All-Informed command you. Soon you shall witness what is in your Lord’s knowledge and shall say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose possession is the knowledge of all things in a Mighty Book.” Write for Muhammad-Mustafa, upon him be the Glory of the Lord of Names, that which hath been revealed for him. We beseech God to assist him and those with him to aid His Cause and exalt His Word through wisdom and utterance. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower. Convey My greetings upon him and upon those who were with him, that they may rejoice within themselves and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>Concerning what you mentioned about Ha preceding Sin becoming Sipahsalar - listen not to this. His neck was between the fingers of thy Lord’s power. Soon shall you hear from him what you heard from those who opposed Us in the Great City. Verily thy Lord is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the return of the loved ones to Iraq - whosoever can go, there is no objection. Soon shall all attain to divine favors and bounties. What is beloved of all is steadfastness in the love of God. If they remain firm in this station through God’s grace, they shall comprehend all inner and outer effusions. Those who have become captives in His path and afflicted with exile shall never be erased from the view of the Most Great Scene. Blessed are they for what hath befallen them in the path of God. We beseech God to grant such grace that they may remain steadfast and properly preserve the trust of God, which is His love, lest any deed appear from anyone that would cause the hardships and difficulties they have borne in God’s path to be wasted. We beseech God to assist all to His love and good-pleasure. Verily He has power over all things.</p>
<p>A letter from Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin, upon him be the Glory of God, was written to this servant present before the Countenance. It was observed. Its answer will reach him, God willing. Glorify him on My behalf, then give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance of him. Verily thy Lord is the Best of those who remember. Adorn the temple of each one of My loved ones with the ornament of My remembrance and glorification, then give them glad-tidings of what God hath desired for them. Verily He is the Rewarder of the doers of good.</p>

<p>O Thou Lord! Glory be to Thee, O God of Names and Creator of earth and heaven! I beseech Thee by Thy greatest signs and by Thy light that shineth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy will, O Lord of all beings, to assist Thy loved ones in that which will cause Thy Cause to be exalted amongst Thy servants and Thy decree to prevail throughout Thy lands. O Lord! Thou seest them in the hands of the oppressors among Thy creatures who have violated Thy Covenant and Testament and have reached such a state of wickedness that they have pronounced judgment against them with such tyranny as hath caused the people of the cities of Thy justice and bounty to lament. I beseech Thee to protect them from the oppression of every oppressor and from the Pharaohs and tyrants of the earth, by whom the hearts of those near unto Thee among Thy creatures have been melted and the hearts of the sincere ones among Thy servants have been set ablaze.</p>
<p>O my Lord! Thou seest the weakness of Thy loved ones and the power of Thine enemies, and their dispersion in Thy days. I beseech Thee, by the Most Great Ocean which surgeth through Thy Name, and by the fragrance of the garment of Thy mercy which hath been diffused by Thy command, to enable them to assist Thy Cause through wisdom and utterance and through that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Scriptures, Thy Books and Thy Tablets.</p>
<p>O Lord! Thou seest them acknowledging the unity of Thy Being and the sanctity of Thy Essence, and Thou hearest their voices raised in remembrance and praise of Thee and in the recitation of that which hath been sent down from Thy Most Exalted Pen, both morn and eve. I beseech Thee, O Lord of all existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen, by the power of Thy Will and Purpose, and by Thy might wherewith Thou hast subdued the peoples of Thy realm, to make them of those whom neither the swords of the enemies nor the weapons of the wicked have deterred. They have heard Thy sweetest call and have said: “Here am I, O Lord of all beings!”</p>
<p>O Lord! Thou beholdest Thy loved ones in Alif and Sin and hearest their sighing and their cry. I beseech Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of glory and power, and by Whose Name the manifestations of grandeur and authority have been moved, to aid them in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with, to preserve them from the evil of Thine enemies and from the manifestations of tyranny in Thy land. Then ordain for them that which will draw them closer, in all conditions, to the court of Thy holiness and the carpet of Thy nearness, and cause them to speak of Thy remembrance and praise. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, unto Whose greatness all things have testified, and to Whose sovereignty every matter hath borne witness. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling over all who are in the heavens and on the earth.</p>
<p>The letters of that spiritual beloved arrived, and each was a door for the manifestation of divine love and the emergence of humility and submissiveness before His Eternal Presence. However, due to the abundance of correspondence, there was a delay in response. That honored one is witness and knows that this servant has never, insofar as possible, delayed in responding and will not do so. In these days, correspondences from all directions arrive like pouring rain. This evanescent servant beseeches from the Truth support in mentioning and praising the loved ones and trustees. Verily our Lord is the Hearer, the Responder.</p>
<p>After observing the final letter and intending to attain the presence, it was presented before His countenance. He said: “Blessed art thou, O Abdul-Baha, in that thou hast turned, attained presence, heard, circumambulated the Sacred House of God, and acted according to what thou wert commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of all days. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make thee a helper of His Cause through wisdom and utterance, and one who speaks His praise amongst all religions, and to ordain for thee through His grace and generosity that which shall endure throughout the duration of His Kingdom and His Dominion. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.”</p>
<p>The matters which his honor Sadiq, upon him be Baha and my loving-kindness, wrote to that honored one were mentioned before the Wronged One and were granted response. We beseech God to send down upon them mercy from His presence and blessing from His side. Verily, He is the Most Generous of the generous ones and the Most Merciful of the merciful. He ordains what He willeth by His command, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Wise. We send greetings to Our loved ones there and beseech God for them all good that He hath sent down in His Book. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, and He is the Helper, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! That which his honor, the beloved of the heart, Mirza S., upon him be the Most Glorious Glory, intended has been blessed and confirmed by the will of the Lord. The atoms testify that God is the Hearer, the Responder. He is the One Who has chosen for us what benefits us, and He is the All-Bountiful. There is no God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>To the presence of the honored ones and loved ones of that land, I extend greetings and praise, and I beseech from the Powerful, the Wise, on their behalf, that which is the cause of loftiness of station and exaltation of rank. Verily our Lord is the Generous One, possessed of great bounty. There is no God but He, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>And regarding the mention of the beloved of the soul, his honor Aqa Mirza Abdul-Hussein, upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness, they wrote that when thy letter attained the honor of being heard, permission was granted, but they made it contingent upon the consent of the household of the honored Mother, upon her be the peace of God and His loving-kindness. The servant asks his Lord to ordain for him blessing, might, exaltation, wealth, bounty, and every matter He has made a source of glory for the monotheists among His servants and the sincere ones among His creation. Verily our Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, and worthy of responding.</p>
<p>They mentioned the spiritual beloved, his honor Aqa Abdul-Ali, upon him be the peace of God. After presentation, they said: “This Wronged One beseeches from God, exalted be His glory, success for him. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for him that which will gladden his heart and bring rest to his outward and inward being. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” And as for the affairs, they are contingent upon consultation. Whatever emerges from consultation is confirmed.</p>
<p>This servant also extends greetings and praise to them, and beseeches for them that which is the cause of glory and comfort. Peace, remembrance, and glory be upon your honor and upon those who are with you, who love you, and who hear your word concerning the Cause of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station in majesty and power!</p>
<p>Praise and glory be to the one true God Who adorned non-existence with the ornament of being, made manifest the non-existent through causes He created for His own bestowal, and ordained means for the expression of bounty in the world. Every matter appears through causes. He created man and placed within him the sign of love, and the strengthening of this love has been through meeting and union by means of causes, and in separation and remoteness through the means of pen and ink, which preserve the stations of nearness in distance. Wondrous arts have been manifested by the Creator through pure grace.</p>
<p>In any case, praise be to God, the glad tidings of health and well-being have arrived through the aforementioned means, and its effects are truly more firm and steadfast than those of a messenger, for a messenger may forget something, but this messenger has no forgetfulness. If man would reflect upon any single thing among the things of the world, he would observe in it the sign of divine education and merciful compassion. His grace has encompassed all and His mercy has embraced all. However, we servants hope that henceforth we may arise to compensate for what has passed, praising Him detached from the world and all that is therein, and becoming occupied with His remembrance and glorification.</p>
<p>In any case, the events of pen and ink have exceeded bounds - I fear the point may be lost. In brief, the letter of that spiritual brother arrived. It was one letter, yet within it were glad tidings concealed: first, the tidings of your health, and second, the acknowledgment of the Lord’s generosity. Health takes precedence for the manifestation of bounty, and after bounty, thanksgiving becomes obligatory and praise becomes necessary. This is the station of servitude, and in the station of Truth, even if these thanks and praises were to appear from the beginning that has no beginning to the end that has no end, they would not be worthy of His threshold. However, the assurance of existence and the joy of hearts come from the acceptance of the All-Loving Lord. In this station He has permitted both thanksgiving and remembrance. After the joy, delight, gladness and exultation from the letter of that beloved of the heart, intention was made to approach the station and it was presented. Thus spoke the Master, may our souls be sacrificed for Him.</p>
<p>O Rida! This Wronged One has ever remembered His loved ones and counselled all to that which brings them nearer to God. Such nearness cannot be attained except through goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct. Deeds and their acceptance are, in the first instance and highest station, dependent upon the divine unity. Praise be to God that the favored community is adorned with the crown of recognition and the ornament of unity, and in the nights and days utters and remembers the blessed words “There is none other God but God.” Blessed are they! This blessed Word is both an ocean of mercy for the monotheists and a fire of retribution for the polytheists. We beseech God to remove discord from among this people and adorn all with the ornament of unity and concord, that perchance this weakness may be transformed into strength and the former power be made manifest. However, as the party in Iran is tainted with the calumnies of self and desire, they accept not the counsel of the trustworthy counsellor. They cling to suppositions and hold fast to vain imaginings. We beseech the Truth to transform their eye affliction into light that they may see and find. But unseemly deeds and words prevent and hinder this, and this has been and is required by divine justice. Give praise unto the Goal of the world Who adorned thee with that which is the foremost ornament for the peoples of the world. The Wronged One beseeches God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect thee and aid thee to act according to what He hath revealed in His Book. Verily He is the All-Hearing, the All-Generous, and He is the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that at all times thou hast been mentioned. The bounty of remembrance and praise is considered by those who have attained as among the greatest bounties, and in one station it is the heavenly food. Praise be to God that thou hast attained and art attaining unto it. Whatever was sent, in any form, is acceptable and praiseworthy, for it was acquired through love and sent through love, and that which proceeds from love is praiseworthy in the sight of the fair-minded and the knowing ones. Well done to thy effort, attention, diligence and striving. This time it arrived well and arrived intact and was quickly composed. What has been from this servant and thee is what has been accomplished; the rest depends on divine grace, and whatsoever comes from Him has been and is beloved. We thank Him in all conditions.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write regarding the excellent fruits to be found in that region - alas that this servant knoweth not their locations, and moreover, no one knoweth me such that were I to inquire, they would give a proper answer. Indeed what thou didst write is correct, but in the presence of the Beloved of the Near Ones, His Honor Muhammad-’Ali Effendi, may God the Exalted strengthen him, you are independent of being known, and above that, praise be to God, you possess virtuous character and excel in love and faithfulness. Ever is the mention of his qualities and stations present in the gatherings of true friends. The servant beseeches his Lord to grant him success and aid him in what He loves and is pleased with, and to bestow upon him and enable him to attain the highest positions and most exalted station. Verily He is powerful over all things. The friends of this land, one and all, send their greetings and beseech God, exalted be His glory, for your presence and meeting. Especially does the apple of the eye, His Honor Aqa Mirza Mustafa, upon him be [Baha], mention you in every instance and continues to do so. Indeed, all express love, kindness, mercy and compassion, according to their degrees and stations, towards your honor. Peace, mercy and bounty be upon you and upon God’s righteous servants.</p>

<p>He is God - exalted be His station of grandeur and power!</p>
<p>The heart of this servant present was gladdened by the sight of your letter, rejoiced at your mention, and was expanded by your love. O our Lord, the All-Merciful, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous! It ascended unto God and was presented before His countenance. This is what was revealed from His presence - verily He is the All-Wise Ruler. His word, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>“O Abdullah! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of Names, Who speaks throughout creation. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We make mention of God in this station with such remembrance as hath enraptured all created things and struck down every rejected idolater. At the time when We were turning toward the Most Exalted Station and speaking in praise of His Own Self, which holds dominion over all who are in the heavens and on earth, that which thou didst send was presented before the Throne. The face of the Wronged One turned toward thee from this forbidden station, and revealed unto thee this Tablet, from which the fragrance of the Beloved hath been wafted and every scroll that was folded without God’s leave, the Mighty, the Loving, hath been spread out. Give thanks that thy letter attained the presence of thy Lord, and be thou of such manner as befitteth this beloved mention. Convey Our greetings to Our loved ones there and give them glad tidings of their exalted station.”</p>
<p>This lowly one submits that after your letter was read in the presence of His countenance and all was presented, these sublime verses were revealed from the Dayspring of favors. God willing, they will attain unto them and not be disheartened by the delay in response. If Sheikh S has arrived in that land, he has surely mentioned the details. In any case, sending letters was outwardly contrary to wisdom, as these regions were in turmoil due to the ongoing conflict, and the hand of investigation and inquiry was extended in every matter. Verily our Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Details about this land have been submitted to His Holiness Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin (may every most glorious splendor rest upon him); they will be informed thereof. And if the Sheikh has arrived in that land, he has surely presented some details of the early events that transpired in this land to the friends, so there is no need for further elaboration. I beseech and implore God, exalted and mighty be He, to ever assist you and aid you in all conditions.</p>
<p>The Tongue of Truth hath spoken, yet all matters unfold and shall unfold according to wisdom and expediency. The loved ones of God, especially those who have attained His presence and been honored to serve His Cause, must be content and grateful with whatsoever God hath willed. Consider now those souls who, without permission, turned their faces toward Him - what tribulations and hardships befell them. Yes, in the early years when the decree of prohibition was revealed from the heaven of God’s Will, most paid no heed and came from every direction. Yet due to the precedence of mercy, perfect grace was outwardly shown to those souls, and with loving kindness all that needed to be said regarding obedience to God’s command was spoken. Some hearkened with complete submission and contentment and returned, while others, following their own imaginings, opened the door of interpretation. Lost indeed are they who interpret the Book of God without His leave. Then was revealed to Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin, upon him be the glory of God, a passage explicitly indicating the trials of those who turned their faces and God’s displeasure. Blessed are those souls who held fast to the cord of patience and clung to the hem of tranquility. Say to him from the Tongue of Truth: Give thanks to the Beloved of the world that thou hast attained His presence and been honored with His service. Now beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid thee in that which pleaseth Him. Thou art and hast been mentioned at the Divine Throne, and God willing, all shall be done according to wisdom. The glory be upon thee, upon him, and upon those who have attained the mention of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>That which thou didst write in thy second letter regarding the Place of Blessing was presented and accepted. They said: God willing, novel thoughts from the mother principles of governance, specifically regarding the comfort, joy and ease of humanity, must ever arise. The gaze must at all times be fixed upon all the peoples of the world. That is, souls who have accepted the Truth and are related to God must look to the welfare of all who dwell on earth. A few handfuls of bones have appeared in the world, each handful considering only their own personal interests and having no care for the destruction and ruination of humanity. Thus after the revelation of what the All-Merciful sent down in the Tablet to Ra’is, each of the powers proclaimed that they had no recourse to killing, plunder, slaughter and burning so long as no harm befell their national interests. They set two warring powers against each other, and how many souls - men, women and children - and how many cities and villages were destroyed and obliterated. Had other kings prevented this and considered the good of all, these matters would not have occurred, save what was destined in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God willing, may the Place of Blessing remain radiant and luminous among the treasuries, and become the dawning-place of trustworthiness, religiosity and goodness. If the friends act according to what hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen, verily all blessings and good things shall turn toward them. He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Giver, the Generous.</p>
<p>Furthermore, several words of the revealed text were written with changes, for wisdom’s sake, and perhaps later the original revelation will reach thee. The loved ones in the Prison City send their greetings to thee and all the friends of God who dwell in that land. The glory be upon thee and thy family.</p>

<p>He is the Most Exalted!</p>
<p>The Ocean of Revelation, concealed within the Most Exalted Pen, hath distilled these words: O Jamal! Thou hast attained unto the Most Holy Court and been blessed with the Most Great Vision. With thine outward eye thou hast beheld the waves of the divine ocean of meanings, and with thine own ears thou hast hearkened unto the perfect Words, each a treasury of the pearls of wisdom and utterance. Thou hast comprehended, insofar as is possible and befitting thee, the outpouring grace of the All-Merciful and the vast divine mercy extended to all created things. O Jamal! On this day ye must manifest such love, kindness, humility, submissiveness, sanctity and detachment that no one among all people might detect from your deeds, actions, character and words any trace of the deeds and words of former peoples who, upon hearing a single word, would curse and revile one another.</p>
<p>Verily, We have created souls with different capacities: Some soar in the highest realms of understanding, while others remain below. For instance, one soul beholds the Unknowable and Inaccessible Mystery manifest in the Temple of Revelation without separation or connection, while another regards the Temple of Revelation as the Manifestation of God and His commandments and prohibitions as the very commandments of Truth. Both these stations are acceptable before the Divine Throne. However, should the holders of these two stations dispute and contend regarding these two ranks, both shall be and are rejected. For the purpose of understanding and expressing the highest stations is to attract hearts, unite souls, and promote the Cause of God. Through the disputation and contention of those who hold these two stations, the Cause of God hath been and will be compromised. Therefore, both are destined for the fire, even though in their own estimation they soar in the highest horizon of understanding.</p>
<p>O Jamal! The Unknowable and Inaccessible Mystery lamenteth and weepeth, for He perceiveth not that which is well-pleasing on this day. The people of truth must reflect His attributes. Verily, He is the Concealer of faults, the Knower of all that is hidden, and the Forgiver of sins. This is the day wherein the ocean of mercy is manifest, the sun of bounty is radiant, and the clouds of generosity are raised up. One must refresh and revive withered souls through the gentle breezes of love and fellowship and the waters of mercy. When the loved ones of God gather in any assembly or meeting, such humility and submissiveness should be manifest from each in glorifying and sanctifying God that the very atoms of dust in that place would testify to the sincerity of that gathering, and the spiritual utterances of those pure souls would so move these atoms that they would not declare in the tongue of their being, “I am superior to you,” for they remain patient in bearing the toils of the farmers and bestow upon every living thing the bounty of the All-Bountiful One deposited within them. Despite all these exalted stations and countless manifestations, whereby all the necessities of existence appear from them, they have never boasted nor will they ever boast to anyone, but rather dwell beneath the feet of all in utter humility. Consider the divines and mystics of the past: Though they soared in the atmosphere of unity and spoke in praise of the stations of detachment and glorification, not a single word from those souls was acceptable in the presence of the Word.</p>
<p>Those who never achieved acceptance were nonetheless accepted, and those unable to utter the word of divine unity, upon recognizing the Manifestation, found their unperformed deeds accepted and their unspoken praise beloved. Take heed, O ye who possess insight! I swear by the waves of the ocean of meanings that are hidden from sight that none has been or is capable of describing this Most Great Revelation as it truly is. Therefore, all must conduct themselves with one another in gentleness, forbearance and love. And if someone is unable to comprehend certain stations or has not yet attained them, they should speak to him with perfect kindness and compassion and remind him, without seeing in themselves any superiority or elevation. The essence today is to partake of the ocean of divine bounties - one should not look at the size of the vessels. One has taken a handful, another a cup, another a pitcher, and yet another a large vessel. Today all must focus on those things that cause the spread of God’s Cause. God is witness and testifier that nothing has been or is more harmful to this Cause than corruption, conflict, disputation, ill-feeling and coldness between the loved ones. Avoid these through God’s power and sovereignty, then unite hearts through His Name, the Unifier, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Beseech God, exalted be His glory, that ye may be blessed with the sweetness of deeds in His path and humility and submissiveness in His love. Look beyond yourselves to others. Exert your utmost in educating souls. Nothing is hidden from God, now or ever. If they move according to God’s good-pleasure, they will attain infinite bounties. This is the Clear Book that hath flowed and appeared from the Pen of Command of the Lord of the Worlds. Ponder on what hath been revealed therein and be of those who act. Those souls who are today commanded by God to teach His Cause and have been specially favored with His particular bounties - all must show humility toward them, for that humility is shown unto God, and since it is by God’s command it returns unto Him. However, those souls who have been specially chosen must demonstrate perfect unity among themselves. Furthermore, their levels of knowledge and stations are and will remain evident before God. Thus have We lit the lamp of utterance among all possibilities. Blessed is he who hath acquired from its niche and been illumined by its lights. He is among the successful ones who are honored. And praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds.</p>

<p>O Siyyid Mahdi, upon thee be the Glory of God!</p>
<p>He is the One manifest with proof in the Kingdom of utterance!</p>
<p>Upon thee be the Glory of God, Lord of all names! Verily the Most Great Ocean desired to send unto thee a wave from its waves, that thou mayest behold it with thine own eyes and be of the thankful ones. And the Sun of Knowledge desired to shine upon thee with one of its effulgences, that it might draw thee unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Hearken unto the call from the precincts of the Prison; verily it will draw thee nigh unto the Most Exalted Station, aid thee to serve the Cause of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, cause thee to speak His praise, give thee to drink of the Kawthar of grace from the hand of His bounty, make thee hear the scratching of His Most Exalted Pen which hath been raised between earth and heaven, and show thee that which hath shone forth and gleamed from the horizon of His Tablet, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>The Wronged One hath heard thy cry and hath revealed for thee that whereby thy name shall endure in the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. He hath observed thy devotion and hath turned unto thee from this Spot which God hath made the circumambulation point of the sincere ones and of the angels drawn nigh. This is a day wherein mysteries have been revealed and that which was hidden in the knowledge of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, hath appeared. On this day the scratching of My Most Exalted Pen, the flowing of the water of My loving-kindness, and the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree have been raised. Blessed is he who hath turned and hearkened, and woe unto the heedless ones.</p>
<p>Arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as cannot be shaken by the oppression of those who have violated God’s Covenant and Testament, who have denied His proof and evidence, and who have changed His favor unto themselves. These, verily, are among the most lost ones in His perspicuous Book. Say: O peoples of the earth! Cast away what ye possess of idle fancies and vain imaginings. The Self-Subsisting hath come with a light whereby earth and heaven were illumined, and with a fire whereby the hearts of them that have drawn nigh were set ablaze. Beware lest the doubts of the divines withhold you from drawing nigh unto the Lord of all being, and beware lest the veils of them that croak hold you back from this momentous News. Say: There is no refuge for anyone today save through this Cause, whereof God gave tidings in the Books of the Messengers. Open your eyes. By God, the Truth! This is the Day of revelation and meeting. Blessed is he who hath turned and attained, and woe unto every remote ignorant one.</p>
<p>Arise thou to serve the Cause, detached from the earth and its gifts and ornaments, and take the chalice of knowledge from the hands of thy Lord’s bounty, the All-Merciful. Then drink therefrom in spite of them that have disbelieved in God when He came with manifest sovereignty. They awaited the days of the Manifestation, yet when the appointed time came and the verses were sent down, they turned away from the Dayspring of the Cause of their Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. Blessed art thou, O Mahdi, for having outstripped the divines in turning unto God, the Goal of them that have recognized Him, and blessed art thou for having drunk the choice wine of revelation before the divines of the earth who denied the Manifestation of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. God shall soon exalt this Most Great Station among His servants. Verily, He is the Protector of them that have turned unto Him.</p>
<p>We beseech God to make thee a standard of His Name in His lands and an ensign of His remembrance among all that are in the heavens and on the earth. Verily, He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. Nothing whatsoever can frustrate Him, and He is the Strong, the All-Conquering, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. When thou art seized by the Kawthar of My utterance and art attracted by the scratching of My Pen, say: Glorified art Thou, O my God, my Lord and my Support! I beseech Thee by the Word whereby the hearts of Thy sincere ones among Thy servants and those near unto Thee among Thy creation were attracted, and by the Lamp of Thy Cause whereby the horizons of Thy dominion were illumined, to make me a servant of Thy Cause and one who stands ready to serve Thee. O my Lord! Thou seest me detached from all else save Thee and holding fast unto Thy sure handle. I beseech Thee by Thy mercy which hath preceded all created things, and by the light of Thy Cause which hath shone forth from Thy most exalted horizon, and by Thy Name through which the ocean of names surged and all who dwell in the kingdom of creation were subdued, to aid me to perform such deeds as will endure as long as Thy names and attributes endure, and will not be effaced throughout the eternity of Thy dominion and might. Thou, verily, art the Powerful, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Most Bountiful.</p>
<p>In the Persian tongue it is stated: We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to confirm you in that which beseemeth His days. O thou who gazest upon His countenance! Know thou with clear certainty that the Cause of God and whatsoever hath appeared from Him is even as the sun, distinct and manifest from all else. However, the inflammation of pride and heedlessness hath prevented eyes from beholding it, even as ancient tales have prevented ears from hearing. Blessed is the servant whom veils have not hindered and whom the oppression of the tyrannous ones and evil-doers of the earth hath not frightened - who hath heard and turned unto God, the Lord of lords.</p>
<p>Throughout ages and centuries the divines of Persia awaited His appearance, speaking His name from pulpits, standing at His mention, and uttering “may God hasten.” Yet when the dawn of His manifestation broke and the Voice of the Divine Speaker was raised, all assailed Him with arrows of hatred and swords of tyranny and transgression, inflicting that which causeth both tablet and pen to grieve and tremble. Implore ye God to adorn His servants with the ornament of justice and fairness, that they may not deprive themselves of eternal life and everlasting bounty.</p>
<p>In every age when the horizon of the world was illumined by the lights of the Sun of Manifestation, the people, bereft of fairness, arose in opposition, becoming a barrier and depriving the servants from His light. We hope that thou wilt, with the finger of power, rend asunder the veils and tear away the shrouds, delivering the servants from the pit of vain imaginings through the hosts of wisdom and utterance, that perchance they may afterwards become aware and recognize the station of these days, and arise to make good what hath passed. Thus hath spoken the Tongue of the Wronged One while in His Most Great Prison. He desireth naught save that which will exalt the authoritative Word of God amongst His servants and draw them nigh unto Him. To this testifieth every discerning mystic and every learned sage. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon whosoever heareth thy word concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the Exalted Throne and the Master of this wondrous Day.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Wondrous, the Most Manifest, the Most Pure, the Most High, the Most Exalted!</p>
<p>This is a Book which is penned by the Most Exalted Pen at an hour when it weeps and laments in the secret of its writing by reason of what hath befallen it from those who have disbelieved in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. From its weeping the tribes of the Concourse on high do weep, yet the people neither hear nor perceive. O servant! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, though in these days We find none who would hear the melodies of his All-Merciful Lord from the direction of the Ridvan, for all the people of the Bayan have opposed God after they were created for the recognition of My Own Self, the Inaccessible, the Holy, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>Among them is he who hath rejected God and disbelieved in Him in Whom he had believed, being unaware of his own self and numbered among the heedless. And when it is said unto him: “By what proof didst thou believe in the Manifestation of My Self, Whom We named ’Ali in the Kingdom of Names?” he saith: “By the verses of God that were revealed unto him.” Yet when these are recited unto him again, he placeth the fingers of denial in his ears, turneth away his face, and becometh of those who disbelieve.</p>
<p>And among them is he who prideth himself on his connection to one of the Letters of the Furqan, and by this hath waxed proud before his Lord, the All-Merciful, and opposed God in such wise as neither Nimrod opposed the Friend nor Pharaoh the Interlocutor. Thus hath Satan made his deeds appear fair unto him and rendered him among the idolaters. Say: All the Letters at each Revelation have been created by My word “Be,” and it is. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear God and confuse not the matter to yourselves. Verily His melodies and His words and all that hath appeared from Him cannot be confused with aught else, could ye but understand. Can the buzzing of the fly be mistaken for the cooing of the Dove, or the croaking of the raven for the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen? Nay, by the Self of Baha, were ye to ponder the verses of your Lord. […] Then bear witness to your Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, through the sovereignty of grandeur and majesty. Verily He hath come upon the clouds of tribulation, and before Him march the hosts of revelation, and on His left advance the armies of inspiration. O ye people of vain imaginings! How long will ye traverse the paths of hypocrisy? Say: We have rolled up the carpet of the names which ye have taken as lords besides God. Beware lest ye make mention of that which is with you; rather make mention of that which is with God, your Lord. This is better for you in these days wherein the Sun of the horizons hath dawned forth. Say: Fear ye God, and cut not the sinews of His Cause, nor break the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree, nor prevent the breezes of grace from wafting over the hearts of His servants. And if ye believe not, oppose not, and look not upon God save through His eyes - this is God’s decree unto you in the tablets of wisdom. Say: Do ye imagine that your belief profiteth Us, or your rejection harmeth Us? Nay, by Our own Self, were ye but fair in your judgment! Say: The Beauty of the All-Merciful hath come to quicken all created things with a life that shall never perish. Fear God, O ye wicked ones! Draw not against Him the swords of hatred. Thus doth the Dove counsel you, would ye but hear. And thou, O servant who hast drunk from the cup of eternity, stand firm in the Cause of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious. Then convey unto men what the Spirit hath inspired thee with in this beloved and mighty Tablet, that they may detach themselves from all else and hasten unto the hallowed, mighty, preeminent and self-subsisting Kawthar of God. The rapture of God hath so seized Me at the time of the revelation of these words that the reins of orderly arrangement were taken from My hands. This is not from Me but from Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: O people! By God, the Most Great Spirit of God speaketh in this Ancient Temple as He willeth and desireth. This is not from Me but from Him, would ye but perceive it. And though the rustling of this Divine Lote-Tree shall never cease nor be exhausted, yet when We found the people in the drunkenness of rejection, We withheld the Pen from mentioning the mysteries until what was decreed in the preserved tablets of glory be fulfilled. Therefore We contented Ourselves with what was inscribed in truth at a time when the swine of the earth had surrounded Me from every side and We remained without helper or supporter, would ye but know. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those whom the barking of the dogs hath not deterred from turning toward the court of their Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, and who have reclined upon the cushions of steadfastness through the power of their Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Sovereign, the King, the All-Loving, the All-Kind.</p>

<p>O Nur! The Lord of Manifestation in the Mount of knowledge, which is the prison-abode of the Desire of all worlds, maketh mention of thee. The purpose is that the Divine Call may attract His people and confirm them in that which will cause the exaltation of the Word of God. In the nights and days We have made mention of the loved ones and commanded them to chastity, purity and trustworthiness. Some have become aware and have drunk the Kawthar of knowledge from the hand of the bounty of God, exalted be His glory, while others have denied and opened their mouths in ingratitude for God’s favor. They have done that which caused the sighs of those near unto God to ascend and the tears of the sincere ones to flow. Glory be to God! The heedless servants are occupied with what they possess and are negligent and veiled from what is with God. The people of the Bayan have been seen to be the most oppressive of all peoples. Woe unto them and away with them! They have denied the verses of God after their revelation and have rejected His favor after its manifestation. Say: Fear ye God and invalidate not the Cause through what ye possess. Soon shall ye return and find yourselves in the lowest depths of the fire.</p>
<p>Thy letter which thou didst send to this servant was presented at the Most Holy Court and attained the honor of being heard. Blessed art thou, O Nur! Thou art he who hath attained unto My days and dwelt beneath My shadow. Behold, then remember when thou didst stand before the Countenance and didst attain unto the verses of God, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed art thou and thy father who believed in the Day wherein the limbs of all names trembled for fear of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We testify that he hath attained unto the Most Exalted Station and the Most High Rank. We beseech God, exalted be He, to send down upon him at all times that which beseemeth the heaven of His mercy and the ocean of His bounty. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Mention was made in thy letter of several names, each of whom hath been honored with the verses of the Most Exalted Pen that they may give thanks unto their Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. This is what hath been revealed for his honor Mirza ?adiq, upon him be the glory of God.</p>

<p>My God, my God! Thy most sweet call hath attracted me. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Signs and the breaths of Thy Revelation, O Lord of all beings, to assist me in that which beseemeth Thy days, then cause me in all circumstances to hold fast unto Thee and unto Thy verses. Verily Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who is named Muhammad, who hath turned unto God, the Mighty, the Wise. O Muhammad! Hold fast unto divine wisdom and cling unto His grace. Each day the Herald of Glory hath given and giveth tidings unto the servants, and that which is acceptable and beloved today is the teaching of God’s Cause. Blessed is he who hath, with spirit and joy, guided the people of the world to the Purpose of the worlds.</p>
<p>And We make mention of Javad who hath attained unto the Most Exalted Horizon, and We counsel him with that which beseemeth the days of God, the Lord of all worlds. And We make mention of him who is named Muhammad-Baqir and give him glad tidings of God’s tender mercy, his Lord. We have made mention of them in numerous Tablets, one letter of which cannot be equaled by all the treasures of the earth. To this testifieth every discerning knower.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who is named Muhammad-Isma’il that he may rejoice in the remembrance of his Lord and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>O ’Abdu’r-Rahim! Hearken unto the call from the direction of ’Akka. Verily, He hath made mention of thee in that whereby the hearts of the Concourse on High were attracted and the eyes of those near unto God were solaced.</p>
<p>O Mahmud! The Wronged One is in the Most Great Prison, remembering His loved ones with a fragrance that will never cease to endure throughout the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Praised.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-’Ali and counsel him to manifest great steadfastness in this Cause which hath made the limbs of all names to quake. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken, while established upon the throne of utterance in this exalted station.</p>
<p>O ’Abdu’l-Karim! The Countenance of the Ancient One hath turned toward thee, counselling thee to be trustworthy and religious, and to that whereby the Cause of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, may be exalted.</p>
<p>We make mention of Muhammad-Husayn with a remembrance by which hearts and souls are attracted. We beseech God to make thee steadfast and firm in this Most Great Cause and this Mighty Announcement.</p>
<p>O ’Abdu’llah! Blessed is the ear that hath heard My call, and the eye that hath beheld the traces of My Pen, and the face that hath turned toward the lights of My luminous countenance.</p>
<p>O Darvish-’Ali! Thy name was present before the Wronged One. The Countenance of the Ancient One hath turned toward thee from the direction of His Most Great Prison, remembering thee with a remembrance wherewith the books of the world have been adorned. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and recognized, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>We make mention at this time of him who was named ’Abdu’l-Karim, and We cast upon him from the verses of his Lord that he may be among those who are firm in this Cause whereby feet have slipped and the hearts of the doubters have been troubled.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-Rida! The Lord of Names maketh mention of thee at this time, and of all the friends, and counselleth all to that which will exalt the Word of God amongst His creatures. O people of God! In Our Tablets We have commanded all to unity and harmony, for harmony hath ever been and remains the cause of the exaltation of the Word. The triumph of the Cause cometh through the hosts of goodly deeds and character, and through the fear of God, the Lord of all worlds. O people of Baha! Hold fast unto that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. God willing, through the grace of the True One, exalted be His glory, all shall be and have been assisted in that which is His good-pleasure.</p>
<p>O Nur! Convey greetings from the tongue of the Wronged One to all the kindred. Give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and remind them of My verses. The kindred of the Name of Kamal have always been and are before Our sight, both before and after his ascension. After his ascension there was revealed from the Most Exalted Pen, specifically for him, that which hath no likeness or parallel. Verily, We purified him at the time of his ascension and forgave him as a bounty from Our presence, and drew him nigh unto Us and caused him to enter the Most Exalted Paradise as a mercy from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. All praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, majesty and power!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who is unique in His utterance, sanctified from all sight, and holy beyond what is mentioned in the realm of possibility. He is indeed the Single One Whom the Manifestations of uniqueness have not known, and the One before Whose praise the Dawning-places of unity stand powerless. He has ever been, in the loftiness of His station and the exaltation of His glory, beyond the understanding of all else. He it is Who sent forth the Messengers and revealed the Books that His servants might know His mighty Message and His straight Path. Among the people are those who have turned towards Him and found the fragrances of the days of His Manifestation, and among them are those who turned away, following those in the graves. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid all to turn unto Him and to cling to His pure, holy and luminous robe.</p>
<p>Thereafter, your letter, which was penned with the ink of love and affection, brought joy to our heart. Praise be to God that you and your kindred are enkindled with the fire of the Divine Word and have attained the recognition of the Manifestation of Divine Unity. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, that He deprive not His loved ones of the Most Great Ocean. He is indeed the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>At a specific time your letters were presented before the Most Holy Court, and answers descended from the heaven of grace. However, due to the volume of correspondence and other matters, this servant has not found the opportunity to write to you, as each day travelers arrive bearing letters from many believers, and this servant is occupied day and night writing countless replies. God willing, you should not be saddened by this delay in response and will accept this servant’s apology.</p>
<p>Regarding your intention to turn towards the Most Holy Court, it was presented, and He said: “It is most evident and clear that those who drink from the cups of recognition ever seek and yearn for the presence of the All-Merciful, for in truth He is the Cause of creation, the reason for existence, the Ultimate Goal and the Most Remote Mosque. However, as the decree of wisdom has descended from the heaven of the Divine Unity, all friends must observe it and act according to its requirements. He ordaineth for whomsoever He willeth the reward of attaining His presence. He is indeed the Wise, the Just, the Single One, the All-Informed. Blessed is he who acteth according to that which he hath been commanded. We testify that he is among the successful ones.”</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the newborn child belonging to you and Aqa Siyyid Muhammad, it was presented before the Most Holy Court. He said: “Today these names are beloved before the Throne: ?iya, Badi’, Husayn, and ’Ali. You and your brother may choose whichever one you desire.” And concerning what you wrote about the matter of marriage, this matter was conducted in the Most Holy Court in the presence of holy spirits, divine temples, and a group of pilgrims and residents. The Tongue of Grandeur specifically spoke regarding this matter.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the timing of the wedding celebration is left to your discretion. Whenever it takes place will be good and acceptable in the sight of God. Delay in these matters is not permissible. Moreover, They have stated that sending tablets to that land is not advisable at present and would be unwise, which is why few are being sent. Nevertheless, the face of divine favor remains turned toward the friends of that land, and the intention of all is witnessed before God, and deeds done for God’s sake are acceptable to Him. No soul appears among the sincere except that it is witnessed before God. Praise be to God, all have been and are beneath the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary. They must at all times beseech God not to be deprived of this supreme bounty, this greatest gift, and this imperishable sustenance, and to remain firm and steadfast in all conditions. Alas, a hundred thousand times alas, that people remain heedless and veiled from the grace of these days. All have been created specifically for the Days of God and His meeting, yet today all remain wandering in the wilderness of idle fancies. Observe, then remember what the All-Merciful has revealed in the Qur’an: “The Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds.” Blessed is the soul that today has attained the wine of certitude and, through divine power and might, has become distinguished from the people of doubt, uncertainty, conjecture and fancy. Blessed be the assured ones, and woe to the doubters. Those who doubt meeting their Lord are, by God’s life, among the heedless, the veiled, and the abased.</p>
<p>The petition of Aqa Siyyid Kazim achieved presence before the Throne. His words, exalted be His glory: “O Kazim! We have heard your call and what you composed in praise of your Ancient Lord. We beseech God the Exalted to grant you success and ordain for you what benefits you. He is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have read your verse and prose - thank God for this and be among the joyous ones. He indeed hears the call of whoever turns to Him. He is the Protector of the doers of good.”</p>
<p>Likewise, the petition of Aqa Siyyid Ahmad was presented before the Throne, and the Sun of Grace rose from the horizon of bounty specifically for him. God willing, may all hold fast to the cord of servitude and cling to the hem of divine favor.</p>
<p>Convey greetings and praise on behalf of this ephemeral one to all the friends of that land, and likewise to the honored brothers, the children of our master, and the nephew Muhammad-Husayn. Praise be to God, all are mentioned in the Most Holy Court.</p>
<p>As commanded, I am to write to you that in these days it is incumbent and obligatory upon all the friends to conduct themselves with the utmost wisdom among the people. No one should do anything that would cause tumult and commotion among the servants. You and the other friends must exert mighty effort and strenuous endeavor in this matter. The glory of God be upon you and upon your mother and your family from God, the Lord of the worlds, and praise be to God, the Object of the knowers.</p>

<p>On the night of the 11th of Muharram in the year 1302:</p>
<p>He is God - exalted be His glory, His majesty and His power!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who created creation for His knowledge, as stated in His words: “I was a hidden treasure and loved to be known, so I created creation that I might be known.” It is established through proof that He, glorified and exalted be He, neither manifests through His Essence nor is known through what His creation possesses, nor can He be comprehended through conjecture and imagination. Since the way to know His Essence is barred and proof is prevented from reaching the threshold of His door, He sent to His servants the Dawning Places of His revelation, the Daysprings of His verses, and the Manifestations of His Self, making them His path among His creation and His balance among His creatures, until the paths culminated in the Most Great Path and the balance in the Most True Balance, through which prophethood and messengership were sealed. Whoso hath known Him hath known God, and whoso hath attained unto Him hath attained unto the presence of God, for God, blessed and exalted be He, made Him a mirror reflecting His most beautiful names and His most exalted attributes. Through Him the decree of divine unity was established; were it not for Him, the clouds would not have rained, nor would the earth have yielded its fruits. Through His advent the world was adorned and the fragrance of knowledge was diffused among the nations. Upon Him be the prayers of God, His peace, His bounty, His generosity and His favors, and upon His family and His companions through whom the springs of utterance flowed throughout all possibility and the signs of the All-Merciful appeared throughout all lands, and through whom God conquered the countries and the hearts of His servants.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O God of the yearning ones, Goal of the knowing ones, and Beloved of the hearts of those drawn nigh! I beseech Thee by Him and by them, and by the signs of Thy power which have encompassed all created things, and by the manifestations of Thy grandeur which have prevailed over all possible things, to ordain the light of Thy countenance as a lamp for Thy loved ones and the meeting with Thee as life for the sincere ones among Thy loved ones. O my Lord! Thou seest Thy chosen ones aflame with the fire of Thy love and Thy loved ones anticipating the wonders of Thy grace and mercy. Their hearts have melted in their separation and remoteness from Thee, and their hearts yearn in hope of what lieth with Thee. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance, the mysteries of Thy Book, and that which Thou hast concealed from the eyes of Thy servants, to ordain for them what they desire of Thy bounty, Thy favors, Thy mercy and Thy grace. O my Lord! Draw them nigh unto Thee that they may stand before the gate of the City of Thy might wherein was raised Thy Call - the Call by which the ear of Thy Moses was privileged in the Sinai of Thy knowledge. Thou art He Whom nothing can prevent and no affair can veil. All power is within Thy grasp and all strength hangeth upon Thy Will. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O my beloved, O my beloved, O my beloved! Though outwardly this servant’s mention of you was delayed, God knoweth that his inner being and heart find rest only in your remembrance, in mentioning your love, your acceptance, your service, and your humility and submission before God, your Creator and Fashioner. At this hour, which is four and a half hours past nightfall on the eleventh of Muharram al-Haram, as I was engaged in mentioning that Beloved One before His face, He said: “O servant in attendance! We make mention of him who hath acknowledged and confessed the oneness and singleness of God and that which was uttered by the tongues of His Messengers and chosen ones. We have found from him the fragrance of the love of God and make mention of him with that which nothing can equal. We beseech Him to make him steadfast in all conditions in the service of the Self-Subsisting and to manifest through him that which perisheth not. Verily He is the Lord of all beings and the Possessor of the throne on high and of earth below. There is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We make mention of My loved ones there and counsel them with that which behooveth them and through which the Cause of their Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, may be exalted. O Muhammad! Upon thee be My peace and loving-kindness. The world hath been set ablaze by the fire of oppression and the hosts of the wicked have encompassed the righteous. From all sides is heard the rumbling of cannons. It behooveth every soul who hath believed in God and His signs to purify his heart with the water of return. We beseech God to protect His party from the tyrannous among His servants and the oppressors among His creatures. Verily He is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>Divine favors and infinite bounties have ever encompassed and continue to encompass that beloved one. In truth, in the realm of mention thou art accounted as a letter of His Word, and in the station of praise and glorification thou art manifest in the highest degree. If a letter were to be separated from a word, or should become separated, one might conceive of your mention being separate from His presence. Praise be to God! His grace encompasseth all, His mercy precedeth all, His favor embraceth all, and His bounty descendeth upon all. Praise be to God! The successive letters from that beloved one arrive like the spring rains and waves of the sea, one after another, and every letter thereof giveth joy to the soul and light to the eye of love. I beseech Him, glorified be His majesty, not to withhold this blessing and not to deprive the garden of the heart from the fragrances of the garment of His favor. If mentions are upon the tongue, there is no harm in it, for that beloved one is witness - He is witness to the multitude of occupations and dispersion of thoughts. Khwajih Hafiz - upon him be mercy and forgiveness - spoke well: “Seek not thy desire through opposition to custom, for I gained composure through that disheveled tress.”</p>
<p>The beginning of this letter was on the night of the eleventh of Muharram al-Haram when I attained His presence, and what was heard from the blessed tongue was recorded. Then occupations intervened - that is, necessary tasks, for otherwise no occupation or matter hath been or is an impediment. In any case, this station hath not needed and doth not need mention or proof - it is established, firm, known and evident. Successively and repeatedly, necessary matters prevented until this night, which is among the final nights of the aforementioned month, when the end is being or will be connected to the beginning, for it is not known whether opportunity - which is in truth the supreme elixir - will be granted and this letter will come to its close. The command is in His hand - He doeth what He willeth and decreeth what He pleaseth, and He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>

<p>By the command of Jinab-i-Samandar we impart these verses to him who is named Hasan, and do not deliver the Tablet to him except after his return to God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>In His Name, Who rules over what is and what has been!</p>
<p>Verily the Unseen, manifest in the Temple of Revelation, gives glad tidings to the world through His Most Great Name, yet most among men understand not. By God! All that was in the Books has been fulfilled, and the Tongue of Pre-existence has proclaimed: “The Kingdom is God’s, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting!” When the Hour came to pass and the Evidence appeared and the All-Merciful came with clear proof, among the people were those who turned towards Him and those who turned away. He who turned away is verily among the people of the coffin in a hidden tablet. And among them was he who said “I have a sealed book,” and thereby turned away from God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Beloved. Thus did his soul beguile him, and Satan made his vain imaginings seem fair to him. Say: By God! Though thou shouldst come with all the books of the world and with every seal that hath been engraved in the earth, it would profit thee not at all. Thus hath the matter been decreed in an inscribed tablet. Say: Can the seal suffice thee in place of the Ancient of Days? Nay, by His Most Great Name! Awaken, O heedless outcast! Say: Even wert thou to possess all the scriptures of those who have gone before and those who shall come after, each adorned with the seal of the Dawning-Places of My Cause and the Manifestations of My Names, it would profit thee not this Day except that thou shouldst follow this Straight Path. Say: O ignorant one! The Cause is mighty, mighty indeed, and this is the News that was the ultimate hope of Him Who appeared in creation by the name of God, the Powerful, the All-Possessing, the Mighty, the Loving. Say: Were We to command thee to efface what thou hast and thou shouldst hesitate for less than a moment, all in the unseen and visible realms would curse thee. Say: This is the Dawning-Place of what was revealed aforetime and the Rising-Point of revelation throughout all ages, whereby every decreed matter hath been detailed. Beware lest thou look to what thou hast; open thine eyes that thou mayest behold this most hidden, mighty, treasured Mystery. The Bayan was revealed for My remembrance and recognition, and the Tablets for this praiseworthy station. Say: O ignorant one! Fear God and speak not according to thy vain desires. Be fair in thy judgment regarding the Manifestation of God and His Cause, then regarding His sovereignty that hath encompassed all that is seen and unseen. Can the scriptures profit thee? Nay, by the Revealer of the Books, except that thou shouldst abandon what thou hast and turn to the station that was the source of revelation and inspiration from God, Who rules over what was and what shall be. This is the horizon from which appeared the hidden Unseen and the treasured Symbol, whereby the proof of the All-Merciful encompassed all contingent beings, if thou be fair and follow not every vanquished idolater. Through it the breeze of God wafted over all else, through it the standards of power were raised in all regions, and the Tongue of Pre-existence proclaimed: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Powerful, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting!” Say: By God, O thou who slumbereth! Thou hast indeed fabricated against God in what thou hast uttered, for the Bayan in its essence crieth out and lamenteth, and with loudest voice proclaimeth between earth and heaven, saying: “Not a single word revealed by Me can equal what hath been sent down from Him.” Reflect on what hath been revealed in truth, and be not of those who fabricated against God and were overtaken by their wretchedness in numbered days until punishment seized them from God, the Lord of existence. Sanctify thy breast from allusions and thy heart from indications, then look with the eye of fairness upon the Tablets of thy Lord, that perchance the Most Exalted Word might attract thee to the Most Glorious Horizon and inspire thee with what God hath intended from time immemorial. This is My counsel unto thee if thou hearkenest unto thyself, and if thou turnest away, verily He is the Self-Sufficient, independent of all created things, to this do honored servants testify. Say: By God! Had you been humble when My Name appeared before you, it would have been better for you than all you possess and all you have wrought in your days. But it hath been decreed. Soon shall you find yourself in the nethermost depths, O heedless and veiled one!</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Move in remembrance of him who buzzeth around the fire and then fleeth from the words of the wicked, that perchance the call of the Chosen One may draw him to a station where he may rend asunder the veils and go forth in the name of his Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, that he may take the choice wine of life from the hands of the loving-kindness of his Lord, the All-Merciful, drinking it in detachment from all contingent beings. Beware lest vain imaginings keep thee back from the Dawning-Place of certitude, or idle fancies veil thee from the Dayspring of knowledge. Leave behind what thou hast and what the people possess; take what hath come to thee from the Dayspring of verses. By God! This is indeed the Most Great Spirit for the bodies of nations and the cause of life to all who dwell in the earth and heavens. Be not content with the rivulet when the Most Great Ocean lieth before thy face. Hasten unto it and follow not every doubtful denier. When the wine of verses from God, the Manifestor of clear proofs, hath intoxicated thee, turn unto Him Who calleth thee to Himself, that thou mayest know Him and recognize those who have taken Him as their Lord instead of God. Thus doth command thee He Who is imprisoned in the most desolate of lands. Then will thy certitude increase and thou wilt know thy beginning, and wilt say with thy inner and outer tongue: “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having made known unto me that which was hidden, and thanks be unto Thee, O my Best-Beloved, for having opened mine eyes through the power of Thy sovereignty. I testify that Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Chosen One.”</p>
<p>Beware lest kinship hold thee back from the Lord of all creation, or heritage veil thee from the Sovereign of mankind. Place thy trust in God under all conditions, then turn unto Him. He will verily protect thee in truth and make thee independent of all else but Him. When mention was made of thee before the Countenance, this Tablet was revealed purely for the sake of God, else what have I to do with mentioning the likes of thee? The Intended One beareth witness that there is no God but He, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Most Powerful, the One. We counsel thee at the end with that wherewith he who announced unto the people the Sun of My Revelation and the Ocean of My bounty counseled, saying: “Behold Him with His own eyes.” If thou wilt ponder on what hath been sent down in truth, thou wilt say: “I believe in Thee, O Thou the Self-Sufficient, the Most High!”</p>

<p>O Czar of Russia! Incline thine ear unto the voice of God, the King, the Holy, and turn thou unto Paradise, the Spot wherein abideth He Who, among the Concourse on high, beareth the most excellent titles, and Who, in the kingdom of creation, is called by the name of God, the Effulgent, the All-Glorious. Beware lest thy desire deter thee from turning towards the face of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Most Merciful. We, verily, have heard the thing for which thou didst supplicate thy Lord, whilst secretly communing with Him. Wherefore, the breeze of My loving-kindness wafted forth, and the sea of My mercy surged, and We answered thee in truth. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Whilst I lay chained and fettered in the prison, one of thy ministers extended Me his aid. Wherefore hath God ordained for thee a station which the knowledge of none can comprehend except His knowledge. Beware lest thou barter away this sublime station. Thy Lord, verily, doeth what He willeth. What He pleaseth will God abrogate or confirm, and with Him is the knowledge of all things in a Guarded Tablet.</p>
<p>Beware lest thy sovereignty withhold thee from Him Who is the Supreme Sovereign. He, verily, is come with His Kingdom, and all the atoms cry aloud: “Lo! The Lord is come in His great majesty!” He Who is the Father is come, and the Son, in the holy vale, crieth out: “Here am I, here am I, O Lord, My God!”, whilst Sinai circleth round the House, and the Burning Bush calleth aloud: “The All-Bounteous is come mounted upon the clouds! Blessed is he that draweth nigh unto Him, and woe betide them that are far away.”</p>
<p>Arise thou amongst men in the name of this all-compelling Cause, and summon, then, the nations unto God, the Exalted, the Great. Be thou not of them who called upon God by one of His names, but who, when He Who is the Object of all names appeared, denied Him and turned aside from Him, and, in the end, pronounced sentence against Him with manifest injustice. Consider and call thou to mind the days whereon the Spirit of God appeared, and Herod gave judgement against Him. God, however, aided Him with the hosts of the unseen, and protected Him with truth, and sent Him down unto another land, according to His promise. He, verily, ordaineth what He pleaseth. Thy Lord truly preserveth whom He willeth, be he in the midst of the seas, or in the maw of the serpent, or beneath the sword of the oppressor.</p>
<p>Blessed be the king whom the veils of glory have not deterred from turning unto the Dayspring of beauty and who hath forsaken his all in his desire to obtain the things of God. He, indeed, is accounted in the sight of God as the most excellent of men, and is extolled by the inmates of Paradise and them that circle morn and eve round the Throne on high. Again I say: Hearken unto My voice that calleth from My prison, that it may acquaint thee with the things that have befallen My Beauty, at the hands of them that are the manifestations of My glory, and that thou mayest perceive how great hath been My patience, notwithstanding My might, and how immense My forbearance, notwithstanding My power. By My life! Couldst thou but know the things sent down by My Pen, and discover the treasures of My Cause, and the pearls of My mysteries which lie hid in the seas of My names and in the goblets of My words, thou wouldst, in thy love for My name, and in thy longing for My glorious and sublime Kingdom, lay down thy life in My path. Know thou that though My body be beneath the swords of My foes, and My limbs be beset with incalculable afflictions, yet My spirit is filled with a gladness with which all the joys of the earth can never compare. Set thine heart towards Him Who is the Point of adoration for the world, and say: “O peoples of the earth! Have ye denied the One in Whose path He Who came with the truth, bearing the announcement of your Lord, the Exalted, the Great, suffered martyrdom?” Say: This is an Announcement whereat the hearts of the Prophets and Messengers have rejoiced. This is the One Whom the heart of the world remembereth, and is promised in the Books of God, the Mighty, the All-Wise. The hands of the Messengers were, in their desire to meet Me, upraised towards God, the Mighty, the Glorified. Unto this testifieth that which hath been sent down in the sacred Scriptures by Him Who is the Lord of might and power. Some lamented in their separation from Me, others endured hardships in My path, and still others laid down their lives for the sake of My Beauty, could ye but know it. Say: I, verily, have not sought to extol Mine own Self, but rather God Himself, were ye to judge fairly. Naught can be seen in Me except God and His Cause, could ye but perceive it. I am the One Whom the tongue of Isaiah hath extolled, the One with Whose name both the Torah and the Evangel were adorned. Thus hath it been decreed in the Scriptures of thy Lord, the Most Merciful. He, verily, hath borne witness unto Me, as I bear witness unto Him. And God testifieth to the truth of My words.</p>
<p>The Books have been sent down for naught but My remembrance. Whosoever is receptive to their call shall perceive therefrom the sweet fragrances of My name and My praise; and he who hath unstopped the ear of his inmost heart shall hear from every word thereof: “The True One is come! He indeed is the beloved of the worlds!” It is for the sake of God alone that My tongue counselleth you and that My pen moveth to make mention of you, for neither can the malice and denial of all who dwell on earth harm Me, nor the allegiance of the entire creation profit Me. We, verily, exhort you unto that which We were commanded, and desire naught from you except that ye draw nigh unto what shall profit you in both this world and the world to come. Say: Will ye slay Him Who summoneth you unto life everlasting? Fear ye God, and follow not every contumacious oppressor.</p>
<p>O proud ones of the earth! Do ye believe yourselves to be abiding in palaces whilst He Who is the King of Revelation resideth in the most desolate of abodes? Nay, by My life! In tombs do ye dwell, could ye but perceive it. Verily, he who faileth, in these days, to be stirred by the breeze of God is accounted among the dead in the sight of Him Who is the Lord of all names and attributes. Arise, then, from the tombs of self and desire and turn unto the Kingdom of God, the Possessor of the Throne on high and of earth below, that ye may behold that which ye were promised aforetime by your Lord, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Think ye that the things ye possess shall profit you? Soon others will possess them and ye will return unto the dust with none to help or succour you. What advantage is there in a life that can be overtaken by death, or in an existence that is doomed to extinction, or in a prosperity that is subject to change? Cast away the things that ye possess and set your faces toward the favours of God which have been sent down in this wondrous Name.</p>
<p>Thus doth the Pen of the Most High warble unto thee its melodies by the leave of thy Lord, the All-Glorious. When thou hast heard and recited them, say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all the worlds, inasmuch as Thou hast made mention of me through the tongue of Him Who is the Manifestation of Thy Self at a time when He was confined in the Most Great Prison, that the whole world might attain unto true liberty.”</p>
<p>Blessed be the king whose sovereignty hath withheld him not from his Sovereign, and who hath turned unto God with his heart. He, verily, is accounted of those that have attained unto that which God, the Mighty, the All-Wise, hath willed. Erelong will such a one find himself numbered with the monarchs of the realms of the Kingdom. Thy Lord is, in truth, potent over all things. He giveth what He willeth to whomsoever He willeth, and withholdeth what He pleaseth from whomsoever He willeth. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>

<p>From the Dayspring of Divine utterance it is revealed… It is evident and clear that the Truth, exalted be His mention, is never pleased that anyone should transgress against another. Some among the servants, from every group, have transformed the breaths of the All-Merciful into the promptings of self, attributing these to the Truth. All such matters stem from heedlessness, and His holy and sanctified garment is pure and free from these. I beseech God to guide all and make them steadfast in His love. We have accepted all the tribulations of the world specifically for the deliverance and tranquility of the loved ones and their unity. At all times, Jinab-i-Haji and Aqa ’Ali have been mentioned before the Divine Presence, and without interruption the Sun of Grace has dawned and shone upon them from the horizon of favor, until certain words appeared from them which were and are contrary to God’s Cause. For the Truth has risen from the horizon of eternity specifically for the unity of the world’s peoples, yet from them have issued words that oppose the Will of God, as they have caused division. Let Haji himself and the others look with the eye of fairness: if every day a new Truth - that is, a new Manifestation of the complete sovereignty of the One True God - were to appear, how could the divine Cause remain firm among creation? Today one Truth appears, speaking a word, and tomorrow another Truth speaks a different word than the first. What then is the duty of the people? If we say these two words are seen with the same perspective, this is utterly remote from reason and wisdom, and people of insight would never utter such words. For among the utterances of Truth are commandments and prohibitions which all need, and in essential reality the order of the world, the preservation of existence, and the unity of all on earth depend upon and are connected to these. If every day a new Authority were to appear, all these matters would become void and ineffective, and the helpless people would have to abandon all things each day and turn to a new qiblih. Consider somewhat the Bayan: The example of this Revelation and the Revelation of the Point of the Bayan is exactly like the appearance of the son of Zachariah and Jesus the son of Mary. The son of Zachariah, despite his station of prophethood and the greatness of his rank, gave the people glad tidings of the appearance of the Spirit, and both were in the same age. Some of the words of the son of Zachariah were understood by the people as to their meaning, while others were not understood. Thus after the martyrdom of the son of Zachariah, some of his followers did not turn to the Manifestation of the All-Merciful, namely Jesus son of Mary, and departed from the divine law, and they still exist on earth and are known to some as Sabeans. These souls consider themselves followers of that holy one, but remain veiled from the purpose, for had they understood the purpose they would not have turned away from the son of Mary who was the beloved of the son of Zachariah and his purpose. Likewise consider the Revelation of the Primal Point, who despite His exalted station was the Herald of this Most Great Revelation. And if one possessed of insight were to observe the Bayan fairly, he would see nothing except mention of Him Who is the Origin of a new creation, and if one possessed of a refined sense were to inhale the gentle fragrance of the Bayan, he would perceive naught but the sweet scent of this Garment. This is the beginning and end of the matter of truth that was mentioned. Furthermore, whosoever drinks of this wine of oneness shall be counted among the guides and manifestations of the Manifester, so long as he dwells beneath His shadow. The meaning of unity is not to see two or ten as one - this is the very essence of polytheism and atheism itself - rather, the one who believes in unity is he who sees the Truth as one from all directions, sanctified from all names and likenesses, and beholds all else as subsisting through Him and existing by His command. And whosoever is deprived of this most pure Kawthar, which flows from the direction of the Most Great Scene, is non-existent in the sight of God, let alone being mentioned among the people of unity. Today, ears and hearts must be emptied of their own words and imaginings, that perchance they may become recipients of divine outpourings and confirmations. O Hasan! God willing, thou shalt become intoxicated with the pure, flowing waters of these merciful utterances and shalt pass beyond the world and all who dwell therein in the path of the Lord of all possibility, in such wise that no zeal shall hold thee back. And like the brilliant morn thou shalt rise from the horizon of the heaven of divine love and shalt openly and secretly acknowledge among men that which God hath acknowledged in this Tablet. Then will power be made manifest unto all, and thy station with God shall be exalted and resplendent. If thou be of the birds, wing thy flight in this spiritual atmosphere and outstrip all other birds in thy soaring. I swear by the Ancient Beauty that there is no atmosphere save this atmosphere, and no space visible except this space. O My bird! Soar in this atmosphere through My Name and My sovereignty; then, in My love, detach thyself from the worlds. By My life! The Revelations have ended with this Most Great Revelation. Whoso layeth claim to a Revelation before the completion of a full thousand years, such a one is assuredly a lying impostor. And whosoever interpreteth this verse is one who hath turned away from the All-Merciful and is counted among the losers. Although for those possessed of insight, mention was made aforetime of the dominion of Husayn lasting eighty thousand years, yet the people of Baha must at least hold to a thousand years. O Hasan and O ’Ali! Hearken unto the call of Him Who hath, for God’s sake, occupied Himself with making mention of these matters to you in this Most Great Prison. Turn ye unto Him with all your being. Thus doth command you your Lord, the Imprisoned, the Alone.</p>

<p>He is God, Exalted be His Glory: Wisdom and Utterance</p>
<p>O My Name! Upon thee be My glory! The letter from His Honor ‘T’ which he sent to thee was received and the fragrance of love and steadfastness wafted from it. Blessed is he and his father and his mother whom We named ‘Mother of the Near Ones’ in the Crimson Tablet from the Supreme Pen. Mention was made of His Honor Ismu’llah Jamal, upon him be My glory, that he had turned towards the land of M. Verily he is under the gaze of his Lord’s grace, the Compassionate, the Generous. We beseech God to strengthen him and assist him with hosts of angels to help his Lord through wisdom and utterance. Blessed is he and whoever loves him for My sake. We, from this station, send Our greetings to the faces of My loved ones who have held fast to the cord of My wisdom and acted according to what they were commanded in My perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>O My Name! We have commanded and continue to command all to wisdom. All must hold fast unto it and cling to it. In these days the Supreme Pen is at all times occupied with the mention of the loved ones. Despite the tribulations that have descended and the afflictions that have befallen Us, the Pen has not ceased. His Honor the Trustee, upon him be My glory, repeatedly mentioned in Our presence ‘T’ and the members of that household, both male and female, upon them be the glory of God and His grace. Each has been favored with special grace. We beseech God that He may enable all to serve the Cause and to that which will perpetuate their mention throughout the dominion of the kingdom and the realm above.</p>
<p>Likewise mention was made of Umm Haydar. We have mentioned her as a bounty from Us, and My mention equals not the mentions of the world nor what the peoples possess. Blessed is he who attains unto it, and woe unto him who is heedless. He is verily among the most lost in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon you and upon all who are steadfast and firm. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>O My Name! We have perused the letter from Muhammad-Hasan, upon him be My Baha, which he sent to thee. We perceived from it the fragrance of his turning unto My horizon and his orientation towards My countenance, and We found him speaking My praise and standing in service to My Cause. We beseech God to assist him, to aid him, and to ordain for him the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Time and again hath mention of him flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is he and those with him, and his mother and sister. We testify that they attained unto My presence, appeared before the gate of My grandeur, beheld My horizon, returned by My leave, and spoke My beauteous praise.</p>
<p>O people of God! In the past year this Wronged One was afflicted by the tyranny of a treacherous oppressor. From one direction came the oppression of the oppressors, and from another the ascension of the Interlocutor, whom We adorned with the ornament of acceptance and made one of the branches of My Lote-Tree. Verily the Cause is in the grasp of My power. We mention whomsoever We wish, as We wish, and We bestow upon whomsoever We desire what We desire. Yet tribulations and sorrows have not and shall never prevent the Most Exalted Pen. It hath moved and moveth in the arena of utterance, and it is the All-Knowing Speaker.</p>
<p>We make mention of Mulla Muhammad-Rida. O Muhammad-Rida! The luminary of bounty hath turned from the horizon of the heaven of the Most Exalted Pen toward thee and hath shed its radiance upon thee. Rejoice and be of the thankful ones. Say: O concourse of divines! Die in your wrath. The Hour hath come and ye are sleeping. The Cry hath been raised and ye are heedless. Say: The breeze of God hath wafted over you and ye are as dead. Say: Lift up your heads! Verily the Sun is shining from the horizon of the heaven of Revelation, would that ye perceive. Would that ye behold! The rustling and the murmuring have been raised, would that ye hear. Say: Deprive not yourselves of the Most Great Ocean. Fear ye the All-Merciful. He desireth naught for you save that which is good, would that ye know.</p>
<p>At this moment We make mention of him who is named ’Ali-Muhammad, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. Verily We mentioned him when My handmaiden who had attained unto My presence and turned toward My luminous horizon appeared before Me. O ’Ali-Muhammad! We have mentioned thee, and We mention thy father who ascended unto the Most Exalted Horizon by the command of God, the Lord of the worlds. The breezes of My verses took hold of him before his ascension and after it, and I am the Compassionate, the Generous. Blessed is the soul that ascended in My days and attained unto the mention of My Most Exalted Pen when the Seat of the Throne was established in My Great Prison. Praise be to God! All the souls mentioned have attained and been illumined by the splendors of the Sun of utterance. Glory be upon them and upon all who are steadfast and firm.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, His greatness and His power!</p>
<p>Praise be sanctified above tablet and ink unto the Educator of countless worlds, Who is worthy and deserving, Who created creation and manifested all necessary means through His mighty strength and perfect power. He bestowed sight that His signs might be beheld, hearing that His utterance might be heard, tongue that it might move in His praise, heart that it might be illumined with the lights of His knowledge, hands that they might grasp His Book, and feet that they might stand firm in His Cause. His is the grace and the bestowal, His the greatness and the praise, His the favor and the glory.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my Creator and Illuminator of my heart and Strengthener of my limbs! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy bounty and the pearls concealed therein, and by the splendors of the Sun of Thy grace and whatsoever wisdom Thou hast ordained therein, to assist Thy loved ones to remember Thee and praise Thee and to act according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. O Lord! Thou seest Nabil-i-Nabil clinging to Thy cord and holding fast to Thy robe and standing in service to Thy servants. I beseech Thee by Muhammad, Thy Beloved and Thy Chosen One, and by the ocean of His knowledge and the light of His countenance and the heaven of His wisdom and the sun of His grace, to make him assisted in that which will draw him near unto Thee. O Lord! Thou seest him speaking Thy praise; enable him to achieve that which will elevate the station of man in the contingent world. O Lord! Thou seest him in all conditions mindful of Thy verses, gladdened by Thy favors, and steadfast in Thy love amongst Thy servants. Strengthen him through Thy sovereignty, then ordain for him what befitteth Thy bounty and Thy bestowal. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>The verses of that beloved one were repeatedly recited. In truth, the page was adorned with mention, praise, supplication and adherence to the Truth, exalted be His glory. He said: “Blessed be his tongue for that which flowed from it bearing witness to what is befitting, and his heart for what it accepted, and his ear for what it heard. We beseech God to assist him, confirm him and make him successful through His grace and generosity. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.”</p>
<p>If you write anything to the spiritual beloved, His Honour Aqa Mirza Mahdi, upon him be God’s peace, convey on behalf of this servant greetings, praise, remembrance and glory. Praise be to God, they are blessed with the heavenly feast and eternal bounty which is the recognition of the Truth, exalted be His glory. May it be pleasing and wholesome unto him.</p>
<p>Another matter concerns the return of the beloved of the heart, His Honour Amin, upon him be God’s peace and favors. Until now, which is nearly a year, nothing substantial has arrived. That beloved one is aware that in these days they wrote to this servant that if you wish to receive two hundred Ottoman liras from the beloved His Honour Shaykh, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, the funds are available here. They wished to send it to His Honour, the beloved of the heart, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of Baha’u’llah, and they also sent some to purchase and send silk from Rasht. Then they suspended it, writing that they feared it might result in loss like the shawl of the previous year. In any case, if possible, they should send it. That beloved one is aware of the affairs here and the expenses of this land. Likewise, thirty Ottoman liras have been sent as a personal trust by His Honour Afnan, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of Baha’u’llah. They have written for that beloved one to send this as well. Surely that beloved one will act as befitting, but must act according to what is possible. This matter was mentioned as it was necessary, otherwise it was not and is not worthy of mention. Peace, praise, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who act according to what they are commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>All praise and gratitude belong to the True One, glorified be His majesty, Who created hearts and guided them to one another. He is the Almighty Who bestows eternal glory upon dust and places the crown of wealth upon the head of the poor. Why did Sinai become beloved of the world and mentioned among nations? What was the cause of its elevation and the reason for its nobility? From what did Sina derive its radiance and wherefore did it become the focus of the world? The Word of God was the cause, and through His grace He made stone the point of circumambulation for the world and bestowed the heart’s desire upon [clay]. In every atom the signs of His craftsmanship are perfect - an eye is needed to behold them and a perceptive faculty to comprehend them.</p>
<p>O God, my Purpose, my Adored One! Thy remembrance is the companion of hearts and Thy mention the solace of souls. Whosoever seeketh anyone but Thee hath been and shall ever be in loss, and whosoever desireth any other than Thee hath been and shall ever be bereft. Bid the sun of Thy grace to shine upon the dead, and the rain of Thy mercy to pour upon the realm of existence. O my God! The saplings of the garden seek water, and the flowers of the garden of inner meanings yearn for confirmation. Water and sun are Thy two great signs - deprive not Thy servants of these two. By Thy leave they are effective, and without it they neither nourish nor satisfy, and thus shall it ever be. Thy power maketh dust to become as the sun and earth to become as heaven. Take our hands, for we are helpless. Bestow Thy grace, for we are poor and lowly. Whatever cometh from Thee is the desire of hearts and the beloved of souls. Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Blessings and peace be upon Him Whom Thou didst choose from among all the world and didst make a Guide for the peoples. Through Him the rivers of wisdom and utterance flowed amidst all possibility, and the gate of grace was opened before the faces of humans and jinn. And upon His family and companions whom Thou didst make as guides for Thyself - through them Thou didst manifest Thy power, Thy sovereignty, Thy might, Thy majesty, Thy dominion, and Thy will. And upon those who followed Thy laws throughout the ages and centuries. There is no God but Thee, the One, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Forgiving.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the successive letters which dawned from that honored brother’s horizon of love arrived like the spring rains one after another. Praise be to the Purpose of all worlds that He confirmed you, bestowed the power of verse, granted the ability of prose, conferred the spirit of prayer, and vouchsafed the Kawthar of remembrance. Praise be to God, you have drunk from the cup of love and attained unto the blessed Word of unity. Your mention is evident among mentions and your verse and prose are manifest among words. Whatever exists has been and shall ever be through the grace of the Peerless Friend. In brief, after becoming informed and aware, you sought the station of the Master and were honored to attain His presence.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! The realm of divine knowledge hath been encompassed, and the cities of remembrance and recognition forbidden. The lamp of justice hath been beset by the winds of oppression, and the countenance of equity lieth in ambush, threatened by the wolves of tyranny. Beseech thou the True One that He may protect the horizon of justice from the clouds of His protection and safeguard the Kawthar of utterance from the hands of rebellion. The polytheists have surrounded the monotheists. Recompense for deeds hath sealed shut the gate of hopes and disrupted the course of destiny. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid the people of unity and preserve them from the artillery of the polytheists, their swords, the malice of the atheists, and their spears. Verily, He hath power over all things. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Night hath turned to morning, for the light of utterance hath dawned from its horizon, and if it be night, it hath been and shall be the best of days. Views differ: in the sight of those near and sincere, a house wherein the mention of God is raised up is the king of houses, and a night illumined by the light of praise of the Lord of Names is superior to centuries and ages. The polytheists see night, but the monotheists see an ocean of light - vast is the difference! I beseech and implore the True One, exalted be His glory, to keep that honored brother preserved beneath the shadow of His grace and to increase his power of utterance at all times. The verses of that beloved one have arrived at every occasion. The Lord hath taken them with His blessed hand and recited them. A hundred thousand praises upon your poetry and your prose! God willing, may every deed of deeds, every mention of mentions, and every letter of letters that appeareth for God’s sake become an adorning border on the brocade of the world’s scrolls.</p>
<p>Fresh tidings and a new blessing and heavenly feast: the presence of the Beloved - may the spirit of one of the two Most Exalted Names, M.H., upon him be the peace of God and His grace, and the bounty of God and His mercy - praise be to God, they have arrived with his honor ’Ali, who chose journey over rest, hardship over ease, and the turbulence of the sea over stillness in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. In truth, they were a mighty blessing, the dawning-place of joy and gladness, and the manifestation of delight and rapture. Exalted be God, the Manifestation of His grace and bounty, His generosity and munificence, His favors and glory and splendor. News of the departure of his honor Aqa ’Ali, upon him be the peace of God, had arrived, and in letters supplication was made to the True One, exalted be His glory, that He protect him and bring him to his destination. Praise be to God, before the letter was sent, the mentioned one arrived in perfect health and safety with what was with him. His reward and the rewards of those who preceded him rest with God, and we beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for them the good of the hereafter and this world. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer, the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>

<p>He is God, the Exalted</p>
<p>I wish to say that, although we have never met, I have heard much of your excellency’s praiseworthy qualities, that you behaved with kindness towards all the people, especially my followers, when you were in Tehran. They were and are most grateful for your excellency’s kindness and beneficence, and have mentioned to me the details of your grace and bounty. I, therefore, considered it necessary to give you a short account of what has taken place, that perhaps through your excellency’s attentions some may find peace and dwell in the shade of the protection of the Prince of the Age, the Monarch of the Era, the King of the World, the Most Mighty, Most Noble, and Most Great Emperor.</p>
<p>What I have to relate is as follows: I went from the capital of the kingdom of Iran to Iraq, with the permission and approval of the King and the awareness of the foreign ambassadors, and for twelve whole years I resided in Iraq. Even now I have in my possession the document (issued by) the government of Iran, (stating that) we left with (their) permission and approval. During the period of my residence in Iraq, not one unworthy or untoward action was manifested by me; all the foreign consuls who were then in Iraq will bear witness and attest to (the truth of) what I say. The government of Iran, seeing that some Iranian citizens showed and still show affection towards me, determined to act against me. Every day, the Iranian consul (karpardaz-i- Iran - Mirza Buzurg Khan?) would write a complaint to the (Ottoman) officials. Since I observed that such developments would lead to mischief, I explained things to the Governor of Iraq, Namiq Pasha. He felt that it would be wise to adopt Ottoman citizenship, and so some of my friends chose to become Turkish citizens. This, however, was contrary to the wishes of the government of Iran, and it was for this reason that they started in earnest to take action against me. They made a request of the Ottoman government, and the latter summoned me to Istanbul. The Governor of Iraq showed great affection and gave me a full account (of the affair). I for my part obeyed the decree of the government and went to Istanbul, together with some of my family, children, and servants.</p>
<p>After arriving in Istanbul, however, it became apparent that they were doing whatever the Iranian ambassador wished. We stayed four months in Istanbul and (during that time) I never went anywhere or associated with anyone. After four months, a decree was issued to the effect that we must go to Edirne. We sought to know the reason for this, and various pretexts were advanced, but it became known to us that the real purpose was to carry out the wishes of the Iranian ambassador. I complied (with the decree) and we arrived in Edirne.</p>
<p>We have been living in Edirne for five years now, and nobody has anything to complain of from me or my relatives. Let enquiries be made of the consuls resident here, that the truth of what I say may be made known. In spite of this, the Iranian ambassador has not rested content with what has been done, nor has he been satisfied. Every day, he has involved himself in some affair and lodged a complaint with the Ottoman state officials. They have accepted and continue to accept whatever he says or wishes.</p>
<p>Things reached such a pitch that, in Mansuriyya in Egypt, the Iranian consul arrested four Ottoman citizens who had committed no offence. However much they protested they were Ottoman citizens, no heed was paid to them. They even took their passports and tore them up, after which they assembled them and banished them in chains and fetters. A certain Hajji Abu’l-Qasim, who was a well-known merchant there, simply on account of the fact that he had gone to Edirne to see me, was, on his return to Mansuriyya, made the object of the hostility of the Iranian consul and, although he had committed no crime or offence, he was arrested. They impounded all he possessed then entered his house, dragged forth his daughter, and carried her to the street and the market-place. But the Ottoman government paid no heed. It is obvious that, whether out of friendship or for other reasons, the Ottoman government undoubtedly carries out and implements whatever the Iranian ambassador says, nor do they neglect his wishes or his good-pleasure. But it is far from clear what the reason for this may be.</p>
<p>Since your excellency is informed as to how things are in Iran, I beg of you to present my petition before the throne of the King of the Age, that perchance he may perform an act of grace whereby the hearts of some people may be put at rest, that all may find ease in the cradle of the protection and security of the Monarch of the World and in the shadow of his bounty. The one God is witness that I have not entertained and do not entertain any thought of myself. I am content with whatever has been written down by the supreme pen on the Tablet of Fate. From the first day that I recognized the Truth, I have set aside both life and property. Nay, at every moment I hope and pray that I may offer up my soul as a sacrifice in the path of the Beloved of the worlds. But since a large number of individuals have been oppressed, I have felt it necessary to explain how matters stand. I beg you to let no-one know of this until the purpose of this petition has been achieved.</p>

In the assemblage of the All-Merciful, in the presence of the All-Glorious, in the sacred precincts of the Most Glorious - how we miss your presence, how we miss your presence! Though outwardly that beloved one has become distant from the sacred precincts near the Beloved and from the intimate gathering of the Countenance of the Desired One, in reality you have always been and continue to be present in the most pure presence, and God’s gaze from the greatest vista remains fixed upon you. Blessed art thou, blessed art thou! For months you dwelt in the Seat of Revelation of the Lord of Names and Attributes, circling round the Ancient Beauty, exalted be His glory, and were intimate with the Branches and Twigs of the divine Lote-Tree, magnificent be their station and glorious be their praise. Every night you were blessed with the effulgences of the eternal Sun and heard directly the divine utterances from the Tongue of grandeur and majesty. Were all the tongues of contingent beings and the realities of [existence] to attempt to enumerate but a drop from the oceans of grace that flowed from the Repository, Source and Fountainhead of the Most Great Bounty unto you, they would surely find themselves utterly powerless and wanting. All this is from the grace of our Lord, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>From the right of the Most Great Throne has been revealed, exalted be His glory: “O Hasan! Upon thee be the glory of God, His remembrance and His praise.” The Most Ancient Pen declares: The wayfarers have become a barrier between the Sun and Its radiating lights, thus the delivery of divine trusts has been delayed. Grieve not at this, for every matter is dependent upon its appointed time. When its time comes to pass, that which thy Lord, the Possessor of Names and Attributes, hath ordained shall be made manifest. God willing, be in the utmost joy and fragrance and be not saddened by this. The essence of every matter and above every deed has been and shall ever be the love of God. Whosoever attains unto this, it behooveth him to be content with whatsoever God hath decreed for him. Blessed art thou for having attained, heard, seen and known. Be steadfast and be of the thankful ones.” Thus endeth what the Tongue of Revelation hath spoken.</p>
<p>Furthermore, convey infinite expressions of devotion and greetings on behalf of this servant to Mulla ’Abdu’l-Husayn. All his petitions were presented before the Most Holy Throne. We beseech God to assist him in that which He loveth and is pleased with. However, what this evanescent servant deems advisable is that he should turn his face toward the Desired One and attain the presence of the Throne, that is, to accompany you on your return.</p>
<p>Additionally, according to the blessed command, if there be any Huququ’llah available with the aforementioned Haji, fifty […] should be taken and distributed among the loved ones of God and the children of those who were martyred in His path, and the handmaidens who remain without spouse, according to the following details: Baba, upon him be the glory of God […] the sons of ’Abdu’l-Wahhab Bey who was martyred in the path of God […] the handmaids of God who remain without spouse, the wife of Mirza Khuda-Virdi who left her husband and believed in God […] the wife of ’Abdu’l-Fattah who was martyred in His path […] the sister of Najaf-’Ali ’Amu who believed in God […] [Mah] Bibi ’Ammih […] five tumans […] Furthermore, broadcloth should be purchased and given to Asadu’llah Bey who was a servant of the Cause. They said: “O Hasan! Worldly means are not available, otherwise these amounts would not be fitting. That which is worthy and befitting the souls of the believers shall, by My life, before the Truth, remain treasured and preserved, and ere long they shall attain unto it.” End.</p>
<p>A single seal bearing the Greatest Name, may His glory be exalted, which was promised has been sent. However, it is commanded that no one should make a copy of it or reproduce it on paper. This has been forbidden to the believers. After completion, it should be placed in a location and its cover sealed firmly with a seal and sent to the Most Holy Court. God willing, they have been and will be vigilant in all matters [pertaining to the Cause of God] and mindful of [the divine counsels] which they heard without veil or barrier from the tongue of the Lord of Lords, and be ever-mindful of these among His servants. The request and hope of this evanescent servant is that you convey to all the loved ones of God whom you meet in every quarter boundless expressions of devotion and the Most Sublime, Most Mighty, Most Glorious greeting on behalf of this servant. Furthermore, the Most Great Consort of God and [the Most Great Consort of God], may God sanctify the mention of [their gestures] above the pen, desired to write something special with the pen of loving-kindness and mercy, but an eye ailment prevented Their Honors from expressing what they intended. They instructed this servant to specifically convey Their greetings and glory to your honor. Upon you be the glory and grandeur of God from the dwellers of the pavilion of His might and the domes of His exaltation and the sanctuary of His holiness and the house of His infallibility. Moreover, if you hear mention of any marriage arrangement regarding the Most Great Branch, may his glory and station be exalted, pay no attention to it whatsoever and remain occupied with what you had intended, whether concerning the Most Great Branch or the Most Great Branch, exalted be their mention and may the spirit of all worlds be sacrificed for them both. Upon you be the glory of God and the glory of the denizens of all the worlds. Likewise, the blessed Leaf of the divine [Lote-Tree], exalted and mighty be their most glorious glory, conveyed wondrous greetings and mighty, sublime glory. Then upon you be the glory of God from the branches of the Tree of His singleness and the leaves of the Tree of His oneness and the twigs of His majesty and grandeur. The Tablets of Q and T and T and […] have all been sent to your honor to be delivered.</p>

<p>There hath come before the Throne from thee a letter, then another letter thereafter, and We found them purified from the allusions of them that make allusion, sanctified from the references of them that make reference, and detached from the mention of aught else but Me. Thus it behooveth thee and those who have been raised up by Our Will and a spirit from Our presence - thus were We the Senders. The Hand of Power took thy letter and toward it was directed the gaze of God, thy Lord, as a favor from Him unto thee, that thou mightest be of the thankful. We commanded him who was present before the Throne to read it, and when he read, there spread from it the fragrance of holiness that wafted from the direction of thy heart. Thus do We teach whom We will and inspire whom We will among Our near-serving servants.</p>
<p>We have heard thy cry in thy longing to meet thy Lord, the Most Merciful, in those days wherein all the peoples of the realms were veiled from His beauty, save those whom the hand of the All-Glorious seized and delivered from the depths of self and passion, and brought nigh unto the shore of a mighty sea. We witnessed the fire of thy love in thy words, as though it were ablaze in every letter of thy letter. Blessed be the loins from which thou didst spring forth and the mother who bore thee! At that moment the Concourse on High take pride in thy noble being. We have indeed raised him up at this hour in the most excellent manner and have accepted from him what escaped him in the former life and have ordained for him an exalted and glorious station. All this is of Our favor unto thee and Our mercy toward thee, for thou hast entered a station which none enter save they whose eyes turn not to what hath been created in the realm of origination and invention, and who turn only to the Manifestation of God, the Mighty, the Sublime, the Great.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou for having attained unto this station and having drunk from the cup of certitude and having detached thyself from all the worlds. Verily, they who have hastened this day to their Lord’s grace - these are the most excellent of people and the most distinguished in the sight of thy Lord. By God, the True One! The people of Paradise glory in their presence, and the servants who dwell beyond the pavilions of eternity send their prayers upon them. These are servants whom God hath honored above His creatures and His servants, and made them pure from the defilement of idle fancy, and chosen them for His Own Self, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Encompassing. Be thou steadfast, O servant who gazeth upon the Throne, in the Cause, such that all else shall testify that on that Day none amongst them shall be mentioned between the heavens and the earth. What thou hast mentioned in thy letter was that which We had revealed aforetime in the Best of Stories, which We made a testimony unto all created things. By My life! Thy mention of this verse is better in the sight of thy Lord than the kingdom of the heavens and earth and all that hath been and shall be created. My All-Knowing Self sufficeth as witness to what I say. We have therefore accepted thee in truth, nurtured thee with the hands of grace, and caused thee to drink from the ruby cup of divine dominion the choice wine proffered by this Youth, in Whose praise the denizens of the Kingdom have spoken, saying: “By God! This is no mortal. This is none other than a noble angel.” We have arrayed thee with the robes of grace, caused thee to dwell beneath the sacred Lote-Tree, and preserved thee from the mischief of every mischief-maker - they who had believed in My Self aforetime, but when We changed the garment of Names and manifested the Countenance with another name, they denied My Self, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Thus was their falsehood in the former time made manifest. The curse of God be upon the liars! Arise to fulfill thy Lord’s command, then teach the people with such wisdom as thou art able, for thus have We ordained for every soul, and We are verily powerful to do so. And if thou seest those who turn away from this Beauty, say: “O people! Fear God and be fair in your own selves. If ye deny this Beauty Who hath appeared with all signs, by what proof do ye uphold your faith and in your hearts rejoice? Do ye imagine that ye believed in the Bab aforetime? Nay, by My Self! For He hath now appeared with all names and is established upon a mighty and glorious throne, calling you with all signs, yet ye answer Him not. Rather, ye assail Him with the darts of discord and feel no shame before Him Who strengthened you in His Cause, made Himself known to you, and gave you glad tidings of this sacred, mighty, and exalted Manifestation.” Say: “O people! Come, let us take what we have and enter the abode of those who were among the concourse of the Torah and the Gospel. I shall read from God’s Tablet, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Powerful, and ye shall read what ye have, and we shall ask them which is greater, that perchance through their confirmation the sun of fairness may shine from your hearts and ye may be numbered with the fair-minded.” Thus have We commanded thee, taught thee, inspired thee, imparted to thee, and mentioned thee in the Tablet, that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and be of those who remember and render great thanksgiving. And the splendor that hath shone forth from the direction of the Throne be upon thee, thy brother, thy sister, and thy kindred who have believed in God and His signs and who are steadfast in a straight and true path.</p>

<p>In the name of our Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High!</p>
<p>I addressed unto thee aforetime an Epistle in the lucid Arabian tongue, and I now reveal for thee this Tablet in wondrous Persian prose, that thou mayest hear, in the glorious accents of the Nightingale of ’Iraq, the sweet melodies of the nearness of the heavenly Paradise that had, ere this, been intoned in the language of Hijaz. Perchance thou mayest become pure spirit; attain, without taking a single step, the loftiest stations of mystic ascent; and explore, without leaving thine outward habitation, the furthermost reaches of the worlds of inner significance. Thereupon wouldst thou, with a divine rapture, experience true spiritual attraction, lay down thy life in the path of the Friend, and sacrifice thy soul in the wilderness of His love. This indeed is the meaning of stillness in flight and flight in stillness, of fluidity in solidity and solidity in fluidity.</p>
<p>To continue: It is clear that the wayfarers in the wilderness of search and longing, of attainment and reunion, have numerous degrees and countless stations. Some, after spiritual struggle and physical toil, ascend from the lower reaches of “no God is there” to the lofty bowers of “but God”, flee from the shadow of negation to abide in the limitless realm of affirmation, and abandon the privation of a transient existence for the bountiful assemblage of reunion. This is the uttermost limit of the realm of effort and striving.</p>
<p>Others, without receiving the least intimation of “no God is there”, pass beyond the highest horizon of “but God”; without even tasting a dewdrop of the degrees of self-surrender ascend unto the kingdom of life everlasting; and without partaking from the wellspring of utter abnegation quaff the wine of the Ancient of Days. These souls, as they traverse the stages of wayfaring and ascend unto the stations of reunion, walk a different path and occupy a different rank.</p>
<p>Still others, without having perused a single letter of the kingdom of names or acquired the faintest intimation from the realm of attributes, which pertaineth to this world, dawn above the invisible horizon of eternity and return again thereunto. A hundred thousand seas of glory surge in their luminous hearts, and yet to outward seeming their lips are parched; a myriad rivers of holiness stream within their breasts, and yet no trace thereof is to be seen; the books of God’s consummate wisdom are recorded upon the tablets of their hearts, and yet they breathe not a word thereof in the world of appearances. They dwell in the Egypt of certitude and journey in the lands of resignation. They are intoxicated with the beauty, and entranced by the glory, of Him Who is the All-Glorious. Heart to heart they whisper hidden secrets; soul to soul they unfold abstruse matters. The mysteries of the Divine Essence glow upon their brows, and the lights of Divine Unity shine from their peerless faces. They clothe themselves in the robe of concealment and cast their sleeves over both this world and the world to come. Without wings they soar, without feet they walk, without hands they grasp and hold. They speak an unknown tongue and observe an unseen grammar, of which all the world’s inhabitants know not a single letter, save those whom thy Lord hath willed. Unto each hath a share been vouchsafed in His Book, and they shall all attain unto that which hath been destined for them.</p>
<p>It is clear and evident that, in this Dispensation wherein the banner of utterance hath been raised aloft and the candle of discernment hath been lit, there is no Lord but the Exalted One. He it is Who is one in His essence and one in His attributes, single in the kingdom of names and peerless in the realm of actions. It is by virtue of His blessed name that the seas of Divine Unity have been made to surge; it is through the power of His resistless command that the immutable decrees of destiny have been enforced; it is through the potency of His sovereign might that the dictates of fate have been fixed. Who hath the power to soar in that exalted atmosphere or to cherish another beloved than Him? We all abide beneath His shadow and seek our portion from the ocean of His grace. However far the gnat may fly, it can never traverse the length and breadth of heaven, and however high the sparrow may soar, it can never attain the tree of immortality.</p>
<p>Since all do not possess the same degree of spiritual understanding, certain statements will inevitably be made, and there shall arise, as a consequence, as many differing opinions as there are human minds, and as many divergent beliefs as there are created things. This is certain and settled, and can in no wise be averted. Now, it is clear that some are virtuous, others are sinful, and still others are rebellious. One must call the people to love and faithfulness, to zeal and contentment, that the sinful may be admonished and the ranks of the virtuous may swell. Nor is it possible that there be no sinners: So long as the name “the Ever-Forgiving” shineth resplendent above the horizon of existence, there will be sinners in the world of creation, for the latter cannot appear without the former and the former cannot exist without the latter.</p>
<p>Our aim is that thou shouldst urge all the believers to show forth kindness and mercy and to overlook certain shortcomings among them, that differences may be dispelled; true harmony be established; and the censure and reproach, the hatred and dissension, seen among the peoples of former times may not arise anew. Perchance they may be educated and, in the latter Resurrection, inflict not upon that cherished Spirit and Essence of existence, that exalted and subtle Reality, the least of that which the Point of the Bayan was made to suffer.</p>
<p>Moreover, a reply to thine enquiries was sent aforetime. It is evident that whatever question is asked will be answered through the ocean of eternal grace, but such questions also add to the burden of duties imposed upon the servants. That which hath been recorded at God’s behest in the Persian Bayan is indeed sufficient unto all, and none will be held to account for what it hath not commanded. Consider how numerous were those in the early days of the Revelation who obeyed, without the slightest deviation, every least one of its injunctions and yet reaped no benefit therefrom. The beginning of religion is love for God and for His Chosen Ones, and its end is to manifest that love to His servants.</p>
<p>I swear by God! Whoso faileth to obey the commandments of God can in no wise be numbered among His loved ones, for among the conditions of His love is to follow His commandments and observe His prohibitions. But since these are the days of concealment, and the Sun of eternity remaineth hidden beneath the horizon of being, one must gather together everyone with love and protect them. The time for the completion of the commandments and the perfection of deeds will assuredly come.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>A Book from the Wronged One, Who is imprisoned in the fortress of Akka, to him who desires to drink from the Kawthar of life from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Most Merciful, that he may remind the people through this Most Great Remembrance and give them glad tidings of this News which hath been inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds. We previously sent unto thee verses from the garden of inner meanings, and this is yet another time, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the King of earth and heaven, and bring men nigh unto the horizon of thy Lord’s revelation, the Bestower, the Bountiful. O thou who gazest upon the countenance! Arise to fulfill the command of thy Master and give glad tidings unto the people of this Revelation whereby the Mountain was stirred, and the darkness was illumined. Be not of the patient ones. Silence is praiseworthy except in proclaiming My Cause, and seclusion is desirable except in this wondrous Day. Leave the house of silence with utterance whereby the hearts of the world may be attracted and nations be awakened. Thus doth the Most Great Name command thee from this glorious station. Say: By God! The sun hath been eclipsed and the moon darkened, and the Greatest Spectacle hath appeared, and the Lord of Destiny calleth out with His most exalted call, summoning all to His most sublime horizon. Blessed is he who heareth and seeth, and hath attained unto the lights of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say: O people! The Sure Hour hath come, and the Striking Hour hath appeared, and the Deafening Blast hath been raised, and We see the mountains passing away, and the earth telling its tale, yet the people are in evident doubt. Nay, We see them as if struck down. Thus doth the Lord of all beings inform thee from this station which hath been named by all names in the Book of God, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: This is the Day wherein the creaking of the Most Exalted Pen and the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing have been raised in the kingdom of creation. Blessed is he who hath strength to hear and hath arisen to serve God, the Lord of all names, and woe unto every heedless doubter. Say: O people! Abandon the cups of fancy and vain imaginings, then look before your faces. By the life of God! The ocean of certitude hath surged, and the fragrance of the garment of thy Lord’s mercy, the Forgiving, the Merciful, hath been diffused. Say: We have indeed honored the learned and chosen them for My remembrance and praise, yet when My Self appeared from the horizon of the world they turned away, save whom thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great, wished. Say: The seal of the Choice Wine hath been broken by His name, the Self-Subsisting, yet most of the people remain heedless. How many a learned one hath been debarred from the ocean of knowledge, and how many an ignorant one hath drawn nigh, drunk, and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Beloved of the worlds!” The bounty is in His hand - He ordaineth whatsoever He willeth for whomsoever He pleaseth. Whosoever saith “why” or “wherefore” hath indeed disbelieved in God’s Revelation, His proof, His evidence, and His sovereignty. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken. He is, verily, the Omnipotent, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Verily We found thy heart turned unto God; therefore have We mentioned thee and sent down for thee verses and dispatched them unto thee, that thou mayest rejoice and be of them that are steadfast. Know thou the value of this station, then preserve it as thou wouldst thine eyes. Thy Lord is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. By My life! The treasures of the earth in their entirety cannot equal one remembrance of thy Lord - to this testifieth every learned one illumined by the lights of the Manifestation in this radiant morn. Hearken, O thou who art turned unto God, to the call of Him Who summoneth thee for the sake of God. By God! I have desired naught for Myself; I have accepted all tribulations to manifest that which I was commanded by the Mighty, the Trustworthy. Beware lest the affairs of the world withhold thee from the remembrance of thy Lord. The world in its entirety shall perish, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the Goal of all seekers. Look not to the creatures and their sayings; hearken unto that whereunto the Truth calleth thee - this verily is the certain truth. The horizons are filled with the signs of thy Lord, yet the people are in manifest blindness. Rend thou their veils through thy Lord’s Name, then give them to drink of the choice wine of utterance through His wondrous remembrance.</p>
<p>Know thou that We have adorned the heaven of knowledge with the stars of commandments and laws. Blessed is he who hath recognized and acted according to that which was commanded by the Ancient Sender-down. Act thou according to what We have revealed in Our Most Holy Book, then bid the people to observe what is therein. He desireth to cause all to enter the Most Exalted Paradise and the Supreme Heaven, yet We have found the people among the dead. Sprinkle upon them from the ocean of My utterance by My leave, that perchance they may arise from the graves of heedlessness and turn unto the All-Knowing, the One.</p>
<p>When thou attainest unto My Tablet and art seized by the rapture of My verses, turn thy face toward the Prison and say:</p>
<p>I testify that Thou art the Dawning-Place of God’s signs, the Dayspring of His proof, the Source of His command and the Recipient of His revelation. Through Thy appearance the sun rose from its setting place, and by Thy call all things were attracted to their Creator and the creation to their Maker. Thou art He Who hath borne all tribulations and hardships in their entirety. I testify that Thou hast arisen to fulfill God’s Cause with a sovereignty that the might of kings could not prevent, nor the clamor of the subjects hinder. I beseech God through Thee to assist me in this Cause in such wise that nothing whatsoever shall prevent me, and to grant me the greatest steadfastness. Verily He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth.</p>
<p>O my Lord! Thou seest me standing before the door of Thy grace, clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy loving-kindness. I beseech Thee by the Name through which the earth was overturned and its high places made low, to forgive me and whosoever hath acknowledged Thy unity and oneness. Then cause me to speak Thy praise amongst Thy creatures, that through Thy power I may arise to compensate for what hath escaped me in Thy days. O my Lord! My days have passed, and what remaineth of them shall likewise pass. I beseech Thee not to cast me out from the pavilion of Thy mercy, nor keep me far from the shade of the Tree of Thy bounty. O my Lord! I testify that I am the poor, the lowly, and that Thou art the Rich, the Powerful, the All-Forgiving, the Bountiful. O my Lord! Look not upon Thy servants and their deeds before the court of Thy Cause, but look to the heaven of Thy generosity and the ocean of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy grace. Thou art the All-Compelling, before Whose sovereignty and power all things have testified. There is no God but Thee, the Exalted, the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>Thou art the Most Exalted in the Abha horizon.</p>
<p>This is a Book wherein is mentioned that which causeth tears to flow from the eyes of them that are nigh unto God. O Pen! Make mention of that which hath befallen the Remembrance of God and His Beauty, that perchance God may thereby raise up one who will regard this Cause with his own eyes and will not be hindered by the clamor of the polytheists, who will ponder this Revelation in the days when He was among the servants, encompassed by the hosts of Satan, who will sanctify himself from all allusions and will consider the proofs of the Prophets and Messengers.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear ye God, then be ashamed before Him Who created you and created the heavens and earth, and sent down unto you that which made you independent of all peoples of the past, and made you the evidence of His Self amongst all worlds, and counseled you in all the Tablets not to follow your desires on the Day of Revelation, and not to be veiled by the Primal One of the Bayan nor by what was revealed in My Book. For verily all that appeareth from Me is dependent upon His command and is suspended upon the will of Him Who is with Him. Verily He doeth what He willeth. Not a line remaineth but that He hath counseled you therein concerning this irrevocable and mighty Cause.</p>
<p>Ye recognized Him and believed in Him, as ye claimed, and accepted what was sent down unto you from the heaven of mighty and sublime glory. When those days passed, He appeared with another name and sent down unto you what He had sent down before of the mighty, powerful and wondrous verses of God. Ye witnessed from Him what ye had not witnessed from any other, and none denieth this save every aggressive transgressor. He sacrificed Himself at every moment for the Cause of God, His Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Yet ye believed not in Him and denied after your profession of faith, and were not content with what God had chosen for you. Rather, ye assailed Him each day with fresh attacks and rose up to war against Him after all religions had opposed Him. Ye feared not God Who created you for His meeting and gave you glad tidings of His Own Self, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Be ye of the God-fearing. He hath ordained that, exalted and mighty as He is, He shall not be known except through Him, and should He manifest Himself at another hour, none hath the right to object, for He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Despite this, O people of the Bayan, ye have committed that which hath caused the Faithful Spirit to sit in ashes and the eyes of the denizens of Paradise to weep, and then the dwellers of the holy veils. Therefore doth the Eye of Grandeur weep while ye rejoice and are of those who make merry.</p>
<p>By God, O people! I was lying upon my couch, but the breeze of God awakened me, and the Spirit of God revived me, and the Tongue of God spoke upon my tongue. I am not at fault. Ye behold me not with your own eyes, but rather with mine - thus were ye commanded by One mighty and all-knowing. O people! Do ye imagine that the Cause is in my hands? Nay, by the Self of God, the Omnipotent, the Transcendent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! By God, were the Cause in my hands, I would not have manifested myself unto you for less than an instant, nor would I have uttered a word - and God is witness unto this and is all-knowing.</p>
<p>If my Beloved were to command me to carry stones from the mountains, it would be dearer to me than to associate with these polytheists. I departed from among the servants alone and wandered for two years in the wilderness, detached from all who dwell in the realm. When the appointed time came, He returned me to the people once again, and the matter was decreed by Him, not by my self and desire. Every atom beareth witness to this, were ye but of them that hear. Would that the people were aware of the root of the Cause! By the True God, none hath knowledge of it save myself, yet We concealed it and made known mention of one created by My word, to safeguard the Dayspring of Revelation. But when he witnessed the prominence of his name, he rose against My oppressed and lonely Self.</p>
<p>And thou, O servant, ponder the Cause of God, for His Cause is too great to be concealed, and His signs too manifest to be veiled by the shrouds of the polytheists. Would that thou wert with Me and knew what hath befallen My soul! But what is decreed hath come to pass. Therefore arise to serve the Cause, then aid God as thou art able, and be not of the patient ones. Forsake the world, then take the cup of eternity and drink therefrom, and be not of them that hesitate. Purify thyself from all allusions, then ascend unto the horizon of God, the Most High, the Most Great. Thus do We command thee out of love for thyself, lest thy feet should slip from the path of God, the Manifest, the Mighty, the Luminous. And glory be upon thee and upon every discerning believer.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath subdued the world through the Most Great Name, through which the All-Merciful revealed Himself unto the son of Imran on the Sinai of utterance and caused him to hear the sweetest call from the Tree of Eternity, that verily there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise. Through it were the hearts and souls enkindled with the fire of longing, and every yearning one hastened to the ocean of nearness and reunion, and every seeker was drawn to the Supreme Horizon, and every one who turned did turn his face toward God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Blessed is he who hath clung unto it, detached from those who disbelieved in God and denied His presence after having been promised it by the tongue of the Prophets and Messengers. I testify that they are in doubt concerning the meeting with their Lord, and I bear witness that they are among the most lost in the perspicuous Book. Praise be to God Who hath manifested what He promised us and made us to be among those who have attained to hearing His call and have turned toward the Dayspring of His Revelation and have spoken His beauteous praise. This is the Day wherein hath appeared that which was treasured from all eternity and concealed within God’s knowledge. By God! The eyes were created for this Day, and the ears to hearken unto the rustling of His Most Exalted Pen, and the tongue for His sweetest praise, and the heart for the love of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter reached this evanescent servant. I read it and found therein the fragrance of thy love for our Lord, the Lord of the heavens and earths. We beseech God to strengthen thee and those who are there and who have turned to the Ultimate Goal and the White Pearl, and who have held fast to the Sure Handle, and who have turned their hearts to God, the Master of the Last and the First. We ask Him, exalted be He, to preserve them that there may appear from them that which beseemeth this blessed Day wherein the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the Single, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. God willing, may you be enkindled at all times with the fire of the Tree of divine knowledge and be gladdened by His remembrance. That which is in truth everlasting and enduring hath been and shall ever be the love of God and steadfastness in His Cause. Praise be to God that thou art occupied with service to His Cause. Whoso is for God, God shall be for him, and assuredly in all times shall divine confirmations encompass the conditions of those accepted souls who in these days have turned toward the Supreme Horizon.</p>
<p>Mulla Muhammad-Shafi’, upon him be the Glory of God, wrote a letter to this servant and forwarded the names of those who have, through divine grace and heavenly confirmations, attained unto the wine of meanings. All the names were presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and from the Dawning-Place of generosity and grace, loving kindness was shown to each one, one after another. Praise be to God for this, for the Point of the Bayan, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake, hath said that all things exist that they may be mentioned in His presence. Blessed are those mentioned souls whose names were remembered before the Divine Throne and who have all attained unto the remembrance of God. God willing, it is hoped that specially for each one of them wondrous and exalted Tablets will hereafter be revealed from the heaven of God’s Will and sent forth. Since a letter was previously submitted to Mulla Muhammad-Shafi’, this time, due to the extensive writing of the verses of God, there was no opportunity to trouble him again. At a time when this servant was present in the Most Holy Court, He commanded: “Write to the Imam, upon him be the Glory of God.” His word, exalted be His majesty: “O Imam! Give thanks unto God for having attained unto His presence and for having drunk the Kawthar of reunion from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the Munificent Bestower. We make mention of thee even as We mentioned thee before, and We counsel thee to observe wisdom, lest that occur which would disturb the hearts of those who have turned towards God.” In all circumstances, he and the assured souls must be mindful of wisdom, lest the barking of dogs be raised. All are commanded today to observe wisdom. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Wronged One hath, from this forbidden place, turned His face towards those who have turned to God in thy region, that they may rejoice and give thanks unto their Lord, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Convey greetings from God to all and remind them of God’s bounties, that they may be gladdened thereby.</p>
<p>This servant further submitteth that I convey greetings to Mulla ’Abdu’l-Ghani and the other true friends, and as commanded, the passages they had written were presented at the Most Holy Court and were accepted. Blessed is he, again blessed is he, and blessed are they who have attained unto the knowledge of God and His love, which was the cause of creation. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to adorn all the loved ones of that land with the ornament of steadfastness and, through His perfect power, to make each one shine like a brilliant lamp, that they all may become the cause of guidance for those who wander in the wilderness of error. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>And concerning what was written about Fat?u’llah, upon him be the Glory of God, regarding his intention to journey to the desired land, it was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. He said that since the Imam had attained unto the presence, in these days it is not advisable for anyone to outwardly turn towards the desired quarter. He ordaineth for whomsoever He willeth the reward of those who have attained unto His presence, beheld His countenance, and heard His call. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Say unto Fat?: Be patient, for thy Lord shall grant thee the reward of those who have drunk the wine of reunion. Be steadfast in the Cause and give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>And this evanescent servant conveyeth infinite greetings unto him. Furthermore, Aqa Mirza Ja’far-Quli intendeth to journey in that direction, but since his affairs were not in order these days, it has been delayed. God willing, he will later journey to that quarter. The Glory be upon you and upon those who have believed in God, the Single, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>Thereafter, one envelope containing sacred, glorious and blessed Tablets was sent last week, and now another envelope previously described in detail is being sent. This evanescent servant beseeches and hopes that the True One, exalted be His glory, will assist that spiritual beloved one to exalt His Word. Verily, He is powerful over all things. At this moment while engaged in this writing, another envelope arrived containing fresh and flowing verses which, like a newly arrived flower, diffused such a fragrance of praise for the Beloved of all worlds that it gave strength to the heart and keenness to sight. However, these have not yet been presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. God willing, they will attain to the hearing of the Lord of Names this evening or tonight.

Glory, praise and salutations be upon your honor, upon those with you, and upon all who are faithful, from whom the sincere ones perceive the fragrance of faithfulness in the days of God, the Lord of all worlds.

<p>24th of the blessed month of Safar 1302</p>
<p>Alas! Alas! O Beloved of my heart! Grief hath seized me at the completion suddenly, to such degree that my sighs and lamentations have ascended. Verily the Pen hath stopped and the Tongue is perplexed. The servant complaineth of his anguish and sorrow unto God, the Lord of all worlds and the God of all who are in the heavens and earths. After the completion of the letter, that which was the cause of infinite sorrows arrived. Glory be to God! How can one, despite claims of faith and recognition and acceptance, deviate from the straight path, abandon truth and become self-centered? Through the composition of two words or the expression of vain imaginings, pride seizes him such that he becomes deprived of the ocean upon ocean of tenderness and mercy from the Truth, exalted be His glory. Today verses have filled the world and evidences have encompassed all things. Every child has been and is capable of writing certain words and letters. As once one of the well-known friends said to this evanescent servant that the carpet of inner meanings has been so widely spread and expansion has reached such a degree that every tongue-tied one has become articulate. The Supreme Pen hath spoken concerning the aspects of utterance in such wise that every child’s heart hath been touched, and he would mention that his faculties were so filled with the words of Truth, glorified be He, that when we take up the pen we write that which we deemed impossible to express even a letter thereof. In any case, according to reports a new incident hath occurred and how greatly is this servant grieved. Although outwardly the details are not known, this servant with utmost helplessness beseecheth the Truth, exalted be His glory, that He may not leave us to ourselves for an instant and deprive us not from the lights of the sun of faithfulness. What happens that a person showeth the utmost love and humility and submissiveness and acceptance and helplessness and evanescence and nothingness, and then through one movement or change becomes utterly deprived? This servant and your honor and all friends must pray that perchance doubts and vain imaginings may be truly lifted from among the people and that the friends of Truth may hold fast unto the cord of providence with perfect humility and submissiveness and pure servitude. By the life of our Beloved and your Beloved! This station hath such sweetness that whoever findeth it will not let go, will complete his service and will not abandon faithfulness. What can I say? While I was observing and deriving pleasure from several original verses of that beloved one, at that moment news arrived and prevented this servant from that with which he was occupied. And this is due to the love which this evanescent one hath had and hath for the divine friends, and he desireth that at all times they may irrigate the lands of existence with the rivers of humility and submissiveness and resignation and contentment and faithfulness, that they may appear with refined, sublime and beautiful leaves and flowers and fruits. Today no harm hath been or is greater for the Cause than discord, and this returneth to these servants, otherwise He is indeed independent of us and of our mention and of what we possess and of what hath been created between the heavens and the earth. Your honor and this servant and those who have held fast to the strong and firm cord of His providence bear witness to this. There is fear that from these words that beloved of the heart may also become sorrowful. In truth this evanescent one and that beloved one and all friends must pray for each other that perchance the Most Great Protection may preserve all. Again, glory and praise and spirit and mercy be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who hearken to your words concerning the Cause of God, the Exalted, the Mighty.</p>

<p>His Excellency Aqa Muhammad-Baqir Naraqi, upon him be the Glory of God</p>
<p>He is the One Who sendeth down from the heaven of utterance whatsoever He willeth</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified from knowledge and understanding, beseemeth and befitteth the Desired One of the worlds, Who from a single drop from the ocean of His generosity brought the world of existence into being, and adorned absolute nothingness with the ornament of being. He is the Omnipotent One Whose Word’s influence hath encompassed the world, and the effulgences of Whose Will’s Luminary have illumined the realms of earth and heaven. The clamor of the world held not back His cloud of light from its outpouring, nor did the tumult of the world prevent its effusion. His might was not weakened by all created things, nor was His Will prevented from its dominion and power by the hatred of the opposers and deniers. Glorified be His greatness, exalted His dominion, and mighty His proof!</p>
<p>And then, thy letter which thou didst send in the name of Jud, upon him be My glory, reached the Most Holy Court, and this response hath been sent down from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of all men: O thou who hast turned toward My horizon! Hear My call from the direction of My prison. Verily, He remembereth thee even as He remembered thee before, and hath sent down that whereby bodies have taken flight and mountains have passed away like the passing of clouds, and the Herald proclaimeth: The Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Greatness and the Might belong to God, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower! We have heard thy call and whatsoever was manifested from thy tongue, both outwardly and inwardly. We have answered thee through this Book whereby the idols have been thunderstruck and the hearts of the worshippers of vain imaginings have been shaken, and every polytheist who denied the beginning and the return hath lamented. Give glad tidings to My loved ones on My behalf and remind them of that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of My utterance, that it may attract them to a station wherein the desires of men shall not change them, nor their might, nor shall that which is with the people prevent them from that which hath been sent down from the Supreme Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets.</p>
<p>In the Persian tongue, hearken unto the divine call. Some time ago thy letter arrived and attained unto presence and hearing, and this time too the letter which thou didst send in the name of Jud, upon him be My glory, was brought to the presence and presented by one of the Branches who is named ?iya’, and this response hath been sent down from the Dayspring of divine revelation and the Dawning-Place of His Cause, that thou mayest rejoice and be of them that render thanks. In these days countless sorrows have arrived from all directions. Certain treacherous souls in the great city, inflamed with the fire of greed and avarice, have committed that which hath caused the people of the cities of justice and fairness to lament, and likewise the actions of some in various regions have become the cause of great sorrow. Today the people of Baha must attract through righteous deeds and guide to the highest horizon. We have previously said: “My affliction is not My imprisonment, nor that which hath come upon Me from Mine enemies, but rather the deeds of My loved ones who associate themselves with Me yet commit that which causeth My heart and My pen to lament.” Verses like this have repeatedly been sent down. Glory be to God! The people of Baha should recognize every soul at their first meeting. By the life of God! The companions of self and passion are evident and manifest from the people of righteousness and godliness. These two groups have been and are distinct from each other. O companions of the right hand! Strive that perchance the servants may be sanctified from the taint of tyranny and immorality and may purpose to attain the most exalted summit. We beseech God to grant attentive ears and penetrating vision. Convey to all the loved ones of that land greetings from the Wronged One, and gladden them with the splendors of the Sun of meanings and utterance. We make mention of the sons of Khalil and the heirs of Kalim, both male and female, and We beseech God to aid them all in that which is befitting of His days.</p>
<p>O Heydar-Qabli-’Ali, upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness! He has ever been and continues to be favored by the Will of God, steadfast in service, speaking in remembrance, and turning with his heart in acceptance. Blessed is he who hearkens unto his word concerning this momentous Announcement.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to Yehuda on behalf of the Wronged One. We make mention of him and beseech God the Exalted to kindle him with the fire of His love, to adorn him with the ornament of service to the Mighty, the Inaccessible, and to enable him to act in accordance with what hath been ordained in His perspicuous Book. God willing, thou shalt be aided in that which conduceth to the sanctification and detachment of the servants.</p>
<p>Abu’l-Fadl, upon him be My Baha, hath done what was meet and seemly for him. He is indeed among the sincere ones in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Muhammad-Qabli-Hasan and give him the glad-tidings of his Lord’s mercy, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. We make mention of him who hath turned with his eyes through a remembrance that shall endure throughout the permanence of God’s kingdom, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We make mention of him who is named Aqa Khan and counsel him with that which shall exalt the station of man - and I am the True Counsellor. We beseech God to ordain for thee and for those who have believed the good of the hereafter and of this world. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>As to their intention to journey forth in these days, wisdom doth not permit it. We beseech God to ordain for them what He hath ordained for His chosen ones. He is verily the All-Hearing, the Responsive.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Baqir! Praise be to God, thou art remembered in the presence of the Wronged One, and the gaze of loving-kindness hath been directed towards thee and the steadfast souls of that land. The petitions of the distinguished traveler have repeatedly reached the Most Holy Court. We beseech God to protect him and to send down unto him that which shall abide with him in all the worlds of His worlds. He is, verily, powerful over all things. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon thy sons and upon those with thee, those whom the doubts of the barking ones have not prevented from God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>’Ali-Qabli-Heydar, upon him be My Baha, hath made mention of what ye sent. He hath arisen to serve My Cause and hath spoken in My beautiful praise. We beseech God to strengthen him, to aid him, and to ordain for him every good that He hath sent down in His perspicuous Book. Praise be to God Who is the Object of the mystics and the Beloved of the hearts of them who are nigh unto Him.</p>

<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and that this Youth is His proof unto all who are in the heavens and on earth, His sovereignty unto all who are in the realms of Revelation and creation, the Spirit of glory unto those in the Concourse on High, the Breath of holiness unto those in the Kingdom of Names, and His Most Great Name unto those who dwell in the Ark of Glory. His are the most excellent titles and the most exalted similitudes, which none save He hath known. Thus hath the Sun of utterance shone forth from the horizon of the Lord of all names and attributes with a mention wondrous to behold.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Do ye deny God’s sovereignty and grandeur, then His proof and His power? Fear ye God and follow not your idle fancies. Follow ye the religion of God and His command, for this is better for you than all else created between the heavens and the earth. God is my witness to what I say. Cast away what ye possess, then take hold of God’s Tablet with the power that proceedeth from Him, and be not of them who, though awaiting the days of God, when His days came and the appointed time was fulfilled and the lights shone forth from behind the veils, denied them and turned back in rejection.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Cleanse your hearts from allusions and veil not yourselves with words. Turn ye towards the holy precincts, the seat of resplendent holiness. They who have denied the verses of the All-Merciful, these have departed from the stronghold of His loving-kindness and denied God’s favor after it was sent down from the clouds of sublime glory made manifest. Say: I am God’s stronghold amongst you, His manifestation in your midst, and His proof unto all in the kingdom. My manifestation is My proof, and that which floweth from My pen is the evidence of My Self. Thus was it sent down in truth on that day from the heaven of sublime and exalted glory. And thou, O servant, hold fast unto the cord of the Cause and be not disturbed when the clamor of the polytheists is raised, when the pillars are shaken and every lofty mountain is laid low. Stand thou firm in the Cause of God in these days the like of which the eyes of creation have never witnessed. Erelong thou shalt behold the sinners fearful through their dread of God, seized by the hosts of divine wrath from One mighty and powerful.</p>
<p>By God the True One! They who make mention of the Primal Point this day yet deny this proof are belied by the tongue of the All-Merciful upon the seat of glory well-beloved. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear ye God and deny not Him through Whom the Beauty of the Divine Majesty was made manifest, through Whose name the crimson sea was stirred, the clouds of destiny were rent asunder, and the hosts of divine inspiration came with banners of mighty strength. Judge ye fairly within yourselves and open your eyes. If ye deny these verses, by what proof do ye feel assured within yourselves? Nay, by My Self, the All-Merciful! Ye shall not find within yourselves a particle of certitude. Thus was it inscribed by the Pen of the All-Merciful in the Mother Book. They who recite the verses of God yet deny their Revealer, these are seized by desires from every direction. All things belie them, as every discerning and informed one doth testify.</p>
<p>And thou, O servant, if thou desirest that the might of the All-Glorious protect thee from Satan’s darts, detach thyself from all who are in the heavens and the earth and from whatsoever hath been ordained in the worlds of creation. Then turn thy heart to the holy and praiseworthy shore and open thy tongue in utterance, saying: O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst separate all created things, and through which Thou didst establish Thyself upon the throne of Thy name, the All-Merciful, to make me sincere unto Thy face and detached from all else save Thee. Then grant me of the fruits of the Lote-Tree of Paradise and leave me not, O my God, to my self and my desires. Then establish for me a seat of truth with Thee, then remember me through the signs of Thy glorious bounty, then join me with those servants of Thine who feared no one in Thy path and remained steadfast in the Cause which was inscribed in the Mother Book. O Lord! Aid me through the wonders of Thy help, withhold not from me the glances of Thy glorious care, and drive me not from the gate of Thy mighty grandeur. Verily Thou art He Who hath ever been sovereign over all created things and powerful over all beings. Thou givest to whom Thou willest from the wonders of Thy grace and deniest whom Thou willest from the proximity of Thy glorious mercy. Verily Thou art powerful over all things. O Lord! Make my feet steadfast in Thy Cause, then make mine eyes expectant for the wonders of Thy care and mine ears attentive to the melodies of Thy glorious favors. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest and Thou hast ever been the Encompasser of all things. O Lord! Make me not disappointed in what I have desired from the heaven of Thy grace and favors, and leave me not dejected from drawing nigh unto the seats of the holiness of Thy gifts and care. For verily, O my God, I have detached myself from all else save Thee and have turned toward the city of Thy presence and the metropolis of Thy nearness, and have held fast to the ark of Thy protection and clung to the cord of Thy grace, and I now stand, by Thy leave, before the gate of Thy mercy. O Lord! Praise be to Thee for having remembered me through the Pen of Thy Command and for having sent down upon me that which befitteth the heaven of Thy care and the clouds of Thy tenderness and mercy. By Thy glory, O my Beloved! Wert Thou to make me abide for the duration of Thy eternal might and were I to thank Thee for the gifts wherewith Thou hast distinguished me among Thy creatures, I would still find myself powerless to render thanks for the least of what Thy knowledge encompasseth, and verily Thou art cognizant of this.</p>
<p>Thus have We commanded thee and inspired thee that thou mayest be receptive to what We have imparted unto thee, that thereby thou mayest be steadfast in a Cause wherein none can be steadfast save they who have detached themselves from all directions and entered beneath the shadow of this Countenance which hath been witnessed from the horizon of the Spirit. The Spirit and glory and splendor be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who have rent asunder the veils through My sovereignty which hath ever been mighty over the truth.</p>

<p>He is God, the One with power over all things, and all through fear of Him are filled with dread, though they perceive it not. Glorified then be He Who hath sent down the verses in truth, and will continue to send them down as He pleaseth. And verily He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. He bestoweth authority upon whomsoever He willeth through His command, and verily He hath power over all things. He shall grant His servants whatsoever they ask of Him, and shall cast the fear of God into the heart of whomsoever He pleaseth, and shall guide those who have detached themselves unto Him with their wealth and their souls. Thus doth He recompense the doers of good.</p>
<p>O servant! Give glad-tidings unto them who have believed in God and His signs that they should not grieve over anything, nor let Satan bar them from God’s path, nor think evil thoughts of God lest they be counted among the heedless. Announce unto My servants that they should be content with what We have ordained for them and desire not what We do not desire for them. Thus was the command from Us in the Torah and the Gospel and the Psalms, and thus do We judge from Our presence those who are God-fearing.</p>
<p>Say: Put your trust in God in your return and your abode, and follow not the vain desires of those who disbelieved and turned away after having believed. Thus were We empowered over whatsoever We please, and We cause those in whose hearts is disease to turn away from rancor, that it may be a reminder to the God-fearing.</p>
<p>Say: Verily those who have believed in guidance and remained steadfast in the fear of the Cause, the Spirit shall appear unto them and God shall come to them in canopies of light, and their faces shall shine with the light of their Lord, whereby the heavens and earth shall be illumined. Therefore rejoice, O ye sincere ones!</p>
<p>Thus doth He bestow upon whomsoever He willeth, and cast knowledge and wisdom upon those who have persevered in His path and have placed their trust in Him.</p>
<p>Say: Fear God, then follow what the Spirit casteth unto you, and walk not in the ways of Satan after We have sent down the verses in a Book mighty and wise, wherein no falsehood can enter, wherein the measures of all things have been decreed, and wherein every matter hath been expounded in clear detail, that ye may know the paths of truth and guidance and avoid grave sins and indecency, and be among the guided ones.</p>
<p>Thus do We turn evil away from you as We turned it away from those who came before, and We mention them now in the tablets with most beautiful and gracious mention.</p>
<p>Say: These are among the melodies of the Spirit that give you glad tidings of the meeting with God and speak with pure truth, that it may be a light and mercy from Our presence upon those who have believed and been patient. And thus doth He fully reward the doers of good - those whom nothing can bar and who fear no one, and when they hear the call from thy Lord’s presence, they arise to render aid and tarry not a moment when the angels of the Spirit receive them with light, saying: “Enter the garden that hath been raised up in the word of victory, and be not among the fearful.”</p>
<p>Say: Verily those who have left their homes, detached themselves unto God, migrated for His sake, and journeyed in His path that they might circle round His Being and visit the invisible beauty of His countenance - these are the companions of truth and guidance. Upon them be prayers from their Lord and forgiveness and a great reward from God.</p>
<p>Were the servants to recognize and perceive the Cause, they would surely act as these have acted, and their spirits would leave their bodies in their longing for the meeting with God. But they remain veiled therefrom, having occupied themselves with their own selves, and are among the heedless.</p>
<p>Say: God is well-pleased with you and hath ordained for you what He desired, and He will mention you in the Book of the Cause upon tablets of mighty splendor, and will honor you with His meeting, and will grant you the blessing of visiting His beauty and the Ka’bah of His Being, and will assist you in the Cause as He pleaseth. Thus doth He deal with the doers of good.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse! Remind the servants of God not to slay those who have believed in God and His signs, and if ye witness one in the Bayan who believed and turned away, then turned back and retreated, then transgressed and disbelieved, remind him with love and according to what God hath prescribed in the Book. And if he remembereth not, leave him to himself and put your trust in God, and be not of them that interfere, for God hath prohibited you from this. No matter can be except after His leave, and thus hath it been detailed in the Book as a detailed exposition of all things, and sent down according to a just and certain measure. Say: God will accomplish His purpose concerning whomsoever He willeth, and will seize those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God after having believed and turned towards Him. Verily there is no God but Him, and He will assuredly punish the wrongdoers.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! Forgive these souls, then forgive me and have mercy upon me, then pardon me for what I have committed before Thee, for this is a station Thou hast reserved for Thyself and made it a testimony of Thy Being and a guidance and a light and a mercy unto all the worlds. Thou knowest, O my God, that I have chosen naught for myself and desired naught save the manifestation of Thy power in Thy dominion and the tokens of Thy sovereignty in Thy lands. And when I witnessed that these souls have turned toward Thy holy court and directed themselves to the realms of Thy mercy, I desired to make mention of them with the most excellent mention from Thee, that it might become a remembrance for others. Thou knowest how the ocean of rancor and hypocrisy surgeth in the breasts of those who claim faith openly yet disbelieve in secret, who follow their idle fancies and attribute them to Thyself, and who desired for Thy servant what they desired. Therefore forgive them and inform them of their condition and remind them of Thy days, then guide them to the straight path, for they know nothing and possess nothing for themselves. Have mercy upon them through Thy bounty, for Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest, and Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful.</p>
<p>Say: Here hath the morn dawned from the dayspring of the divine cloud, and the Spirit of Holiness hath spoken the truth, and the Light hath come in clouds of radiance, and God hath arisen with His Cause, and the Face hath appeared from behind the veils. Hasten ye, and be not of them that tarry.</p>

<p>The Tablet of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing Speaker</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down by the All-Wise to him who hath believed in God, the Single, the All-Informed, that it may draw him to a station where neither the happenings of the world nor the denial of nations who have violated the Covenant of God, the Lord of all worlds, can grieve him. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and that which thou didst send to My Name. We have answered thee through this Book, by which the limbs of the ignorant have trembled and every remote learned one was thunderstruck.</p>
<p>O servant of God! Thou art he who hath won My call, My Tablets, the traces of My Pen, and that which hath flowed from the right hand of My Throne. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the worlds!”</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Ahmad. We have remembered him before and do so at this time. O Ahmad! The Wronged One is between the fangs of wolves, and the idolaters have perpetrated that which hath caused every truthful, faithful soul to lament. They have cast truth behind their backs and taken up their own idle fancies. They are indeed among the abject ones.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! The Wronged One remembereth thee and announceth unto thee the grace of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. No mention can equal His mention, as attesteth He with Whom is the clear Book. Blessed is he who hath attained in this Day unto the traces of My Pen and hath clung to My Strong Cord. We beseech God to aid thee in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to ordain for thee what He hath ordained for His near servants.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! The scene of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, hath been adorned through His being established upon a mighty throne and His call before the faces of His servants. He is the Powerful, the Almighty. Neither My imprisonment hath prevented Me from the remembrance of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, nor hath the oppression of those who have disbelieved in the Day of Judgment frightened Me. Behold, behold: this is the Finger of Power whereby the heaven of idle fancies hath been cleft. Hear, hear: this is the scratching of My Pen which hath been raised before the faces of the mystics, then the learned ones, then the kings and the sovereigns. Say:</p>
<p>“O Lord of Power! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Scene, whereby the hearts of men were disturbed, to make me steadfast in Thy love and firm in Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Ibrahim! Sorrows have encompassed Me from those who have disbelieved in the All-Merciful. They are assuredly among the wrongdoers. Verily, he who stood before My face and wrote down that which proceeded from the mouth of My Will hath been taken by the oppressors as a lord for themselves apart from God. They are indeed among the most lost ones in My Great Book.</p>
<p>O Ibrahim! Behold and remember those who soared on the wings of detachment until they reached the place of sacrifice and gave up their spirits in My path and all they possessed for My mighty, wondrous Cause. Verily, Hasan hastened by God’s power and might to the place of sacrifice in such wise that neither his worldly wealth, nor the clamor of the nations, nor the ranks of kings, nor the hosts of the oppressors could hold him back. He gave up his spirit in My path with such joy as to amaze the Concourse on High. Yet most of the people are among the deniers. They make mention of Abraham yet deny what hath appeared in the days of the Glorious One. They are indeed among the heedless in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Qasim! Hear what hath been raised from the direction of My loving-kindness for My friends. Verily, there is no God but He, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. When thou drinkest the choice wine of My utterance, say: My God, my God! All praise be unto Thee for having guided me, made me know Thee, and strengthened me to turn unto Thee. I testify that Thou hast manifested Thyself for the guidance of Thy creation and their drawing nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Chosen One. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy mysteries hidden in Thy knowledge and by the waves that surge from the ocean of Thy utterance to make me hold fast to Thy cord. Verily, Thou art the Strong, the Most High.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who is named Muhammad-before-Ismail. Say: We have made mention of the Sacrifice before, and if thou desire, We shall make mention of another and say: By God! The denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise were struck with wonder when Husayn turned toward the place of sacrifice. He hastened with his spirit and soared on wings of longing, and walked with the feet of eagerness until he appeared at that station before the face of the Lord of all beings. He said:</p>
<p>My God, my God! This is my spirit, my soul, my body, and my limbs. I desire to sacrifice them in Thy love and in Thy path. Alas, alas, for Thy greatness and my meager provision, for Thy loftiness and the insignificance of my deeds! I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign over the seen and unseen, to adorn my deed with the ornament of Thy acceptance. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-before-Baqir! The names have ended with thy name. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hasteneth to the horizon of My good-pleasure and acteth according to what I have revealed in My Book. Blessed is he who hath drunk the choice wine of life from the cup of the bounty of My Name, the Most Merciful. Blessed is he who hath cast away all else save Me and clung to the hem of My loving-kindness. Blessed is he who hath taken the choice wine of revelation from the hands of My grace and drunk thereof in My Name. Blessed is he who hath been set ablaze with the fire of My love and hath spoken My praise before the faces of My servants. Blessed are My friends there who were not prevented by the oppression of the oppressors from turning to My horizon, nor by the ascendancy of the aggressors from this Great Announcement.</p>
<p>O Abdullah! We make mention of thee once again that thou mayest find the fragrances of revelation and be of the thankful. This is a day wherein the earth hath shone with the light of God, the Goal of them that know, and the heaven with the signs of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed is the servant who hath held fast to that which he hath been commanded, and woe unto every heedless and remote one. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for thee and My friends that which will draw you nigh unto Him, remind you of His signs, and illumine you with the lights of His Kingdom. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. And We ask Him to write for thee that which shall profit thee in every world of His worlds. Verily, He is the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon My friends there who were not prevented by the oppression of the oppressors from clinging to the hem of the robe of My mercy, nor by the ascendancy of the aggressors from this Great Announcement.</p>

<p>O Muhammad! Well is it with thee, for thou hast been attracted by My Call, learned of My path, been taught My Cause, and been guided to My momentous Announcement. Thy letter hath reached the Most Great Prison. We have heard thy praise and remembrance, and have answered thee with a Tablet that no books in the world can equal, and have remembered thee with a remembrance whose light, shining from the horizon of the divine Tablet, hath caused all other remembrances to bow down before it. Of this beareth witness He with Whom is a manifest Book. Thou art he who hath held fast to the cord of thy Lord’s bounty, clung to the hem of His mercy, and turned towards His horizon when the people were in grievous error. Say: O people of the Furqan! Hearken unto the call of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Verily it hath been raised in the prison before the faces of all religions. Follow not your selfish desires, but follow Him Who calleth you unto God, the One, the All-Informed. Say: Beware lest the manifestations of this world and its ornaments prevent you from Him by Whom the Dove of Glory warbled in the All-Highest Paradise, and the Maiden of inner meaning sang in the Most Exalted Heaven, crying out and saying: The Day is come, and the people are in wondrous doubt. Say: O people of Faran! Read ye what is with you and what hath been sent down from the heaven of the Will of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Fear God, cast aside idle fancies and vain imaginings. The Self-Subsisting hath come with a Cause before which all who are in the heavens and on earth cannot stand. When thou hast drunk the choice wine of revelation from the cup of Mine utterance, and been attracted by My remembrance and My call, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou seest this servant turning toward Thy horizon, directing his face to the lights of Thy countenance, soaring in the atmosphere of Thy nearness, firm in Thy oneness and singleness, and holding fast to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. O Lord! Thou seest the tears of mine eyes in my separation from Thee, and my sighs in my remoteness from Thy presence. I know not, O my Aim and my Beloved, what Thou hast ordained for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen, by Whose movement Thou hast subdued the earth and heaven. Hast Thou ordained for me to attain Thy presence and to stand before the gate of Thy grandeur, or hath Thy binding command and Thy firm decree prevented me therefrom? I beseech Thee, O Lord of all being and Educator of the seen and unseen, by Thy command whereby the rivers flowed, the trees bore fruit, and the seas surged, to make me in all conditions speak Thy praise and stand firm in Thy Cause, in such wise that the limbs of Thine enemies may quake and the hearts of those who have denied Thee and Thy signs may be perturbed. O Lord! Thou seest me turning to Thee in all conditions and holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the sweet savors of Thy revelation to aid Thy servants to acknowledge what Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy generosity and what hath flowed from the Pen of Thy grace. Thou art He Whose power all created things have testified to, and Whose sovereignty all things possible have witnessed. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And We make mention of the Friend, upon him be My glory, and We remind him of the verses of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, and We give him glad tidings of His mercy which hath preceded all created things and of His bounty which hath encompassed existence itself, both small and great. O Friend! Hearken unto the call of Him Who hath been wronged. Verily, He hath accepted all manner of tribulation for the exaltation of the Word of God, yet the people are in manifest denial. We stood before all faces and summoned them to the most exalted Summit and taught them that which would draw them nigh unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. Among the people are those who have been attracted by the sweetness of My call, and We have sent down for them that which was a fountain of life for all who dwell within the realm of possibility. And among them are those who turned away from the Face, following every doubting learned one. And among them are those who arose in opposition, and those who pronounced sentence of death against Me. Thus was the matter decreed, yet most of the people remain heedless. Blessed art thou for having turned towards Me and borne witness to that whereunto God did testify before the creation of the heavens and the earths. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord, and my Support, for having remembered me whilst I was in the midst of them that turned aside. I beseech Thee to assist me in Thy remembrance and Thy praise and in the service of Thy Cause. Thou art, verily, the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Upon thee be the glory of God, the One, the Single. We make mention of those who turned towards God when the horizon of Revelation was illumined with the light of God’s loving providence, the Mighty, the Great. And We desire to make mention of the friends of God and His loved ones, both male and female, who have ascended unto the Most Exalted Companion. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Bountiful, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. The glory which hath dawned from the heaven of bounty be upon you, O people of Baha. Ye are they who have not violated the Covenant of God and His Testament. Ye have turned unto Him and have recognized His Manifestation, His grandeur, His sovereignty, His might, His power and His dominion. Blessed are ye, and joy be unto you, for ye have attained unto the traces of the Most Exalted Pen before your ascension and after your ascension to the Most Glorious Horizon. We beseech God to forgive you and to remit your sins, to rain down upon you from the clouds of His heaven of generosity the showers of His mercy, and to ordain for you that which shall adorn you with the ornament of joy and ecstasy. He, verily, is the Omnipotent over all things. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Thus hath the Sun of utterance shone forth from the horizon of proof. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen. Woe unto every sinful denier.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Hearken in the Persian tongue. In the days when all were scattered by the onslaught of tyranny and concealed behind veils, this Wronged One arose to promote the Cause in such wise that the oppression of the world could not prevent Him from uttering the Word. God is Our witness and Our testament. No fair-minded person can deny this fact. And when the world was illumined by the light of the Cause, all rushed forth from behind their veils with drawn swords - that is, the deniers of the Bayan. In any case, beseech God to protect the servants from the new delusions of the deniers. He is the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted! This is a letter from the Prisoner to the loved ones of God who have believed in Him and in His verses, the wondrous One that has been sent down, that they may hear My call from this Prison and be apprised of what has befallen Me at the hands of the legions of Satan. Know ye that at all times I drink from the cups of destiny, though I called the servants to naught but God, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Powerful. And whenever I called them, their hatred increased until they arose to shed My blood. God is witness to what I say.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Slay Me not with the swords of your rejection. I have come to you with the remembrance of God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Fear God, O people, and spread not corruption in the earth after its reformation, and shed not blood. Thus has God commanded you in tablets of manifest glory. Dispute not concerning the verses of God after their revelation, and consume not the property of others unjustly. Fear ye the Day when deeds shall be gathered together and ye shall be recompensed for what ye committed in your vain life - and that is a momentous day. Remember God in the watches of the night and the ends of the day, and follow not the paths of the heedless. Be steadfast in the love of God such that the harm of all creation combined shall not cause you to slip. Be patient in adversity and tribulation, and trust in Him in all circumstances. He has ordained for no one save what is best for him, and He is verily the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>Be patient in hardships even as this Prisoner has been patient under that which has befallen Him in the path of God, the Just King, the Single, the All-Knowing, the Praiseworthy. By God! There has befallen Me at every moment that which would cause all things created between earth and heaven to tremble, and none is aware of this save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear God and deny Him not, for this would be a wrong against your own selves, were ye of those who know. Beware lest the world and what has been created therein delude you, for soon shall ye return to dust with manifest regret. Blessed is he whom the Spirit befriends in his solitude, and with whom the denizens of the highest Paradise associate with spirit and mighty fragrance. Say: Upon those who die in the love of God and the Manifestation of His Cause shall descend the angels of the Cause with glad tidings from their Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate. The breezes of the All-Merciful shall waft upon them from all directions, and maidens of Paradise with downcast eyes shall circle round them with chalices and vessels, magnifying God before their faces and blessing them with melodies that draw nigh the hearts of those brought near. Say: O people! Deprive not yourselves of that which has been ordained for you in the paradise of your Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Beware lest ye turn to that which perishes and passes away; rather, turn to that which endures in the heaven of Command. Thus does this Prisoner counsel you, if ye be of them that act.</p>
<p>And if thou seest Him of the Letter Ha, convey unto him My glorification, then say: “Upon thee be the remembrance of God and His glory, then the remembrance of all things, then the praise of them that have known. Thou art he who hath detached himself from every relation for the sake of God, thy Beloved and the Beloved of the worlds. Beware lest thou be troubled by aught. Stand firm in the Cause, then remind the people of this Cause which God hath made a retribution unto the idolaters and a mercy unto them that have recognized His unity. Grieve not for what hath come to pass in the year of tribulation, for it was ordained in the preserved tablets of might. We have informed you beforehand through the tongue of the Manifestation of My Self, Who was afflicted at the hands of the idolaters. Soon shall this earth be changed from what the hands of the evil-doers have wrought. When thou hearest this, be not troubled nor grieve, but place thy trust in all things in God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers of old. He hath ever been alive in the Most Glorious Horizon, observing and seeing. Thus hath it been sent down aforetime, and now from the heaven of God, the King, the Mighty, the Wise. Thus have We informed thee of the tidings of the unseen which none hath known save thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O servant! Convey what We have imparted unto thee and be not of them that are patient. Then remind Him of the Letter Ha from this Prisoner, that he may aid his Lord as he is able and be not of the silent ones. Say: His aid is through utterance and that which proceedeth from the tongue. Thus hath it been ordained by the Mighty, the Ancient of Days. Beware lest thou be silent in the remembrance of thy Lord. Proclaim His Cause that perchance through thy proclamation the warmth of His love may be generated in the hearts of the sanctified ones. Hearken unto My words, then detach thyself wholly from all else save God, thy Lord, that thy face may shine with His Name amongst the worlds. Soon shall there come unto you a manifestation from among the manifestations of Satan with tablets from hell. Shun him and them, cast them behind thee, and take hold of the tablets of God with a strength from Him and a clear authority. If the people would gather around the law of the love of God, they would surely be united and become of them that are well-assured. Then convey My glorification unto all the loved ones of God, that the fragrances of glorification may stir them and cause them to soar in the atmosphere of nearness and sever them from the idolaters.</p>
<p>And if thou seest the handmaiden of God who hath arisen by herself to make mention of her Lord and praise her Creator, give her the glad-tidings of a great bounty from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Say: Blessed art thou, O Leaf of Paradise, for the breezes of God’s will have wafted over thee and quickened thee with the life of thy Lord, the Quickener, the Mighty, the Powerful. Hold fast unto the Tree and turn not to anyone, for He will verily protect thee in truth, and He is the best protector and helper. We have heard thy call and answered thee before, and again in this Tablet, and this is indeed a great favor. Make mention of all created things from this Prisoner, then glorify their faces from thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And the Spirit and Glory and Splendor be upon you, O loved ones of God, from this moment unto the day which none among all the worlds can reckon. And praise be to God, the Beloved of them that have known and the Object of desire of all who are in the heavens and on the earth.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most Great!</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down in truth from God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. It summons the people to pure truth and protects them from the evil ones. Say: O people! I am but a servant of God and His bondsman. I have come to you from the direction of God with a message from Him. Beware lest you deny God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say: I have called you only unto God and desire for you naught save that which draws you near to His exalted and impregnable court. Will you drink putrid water and deprive yourselves of the Kawthar and Salsabil? Will you worship the calf and turn away from the Lord of all worlds? Will you gather around a mere pool after the Most Great Ocean hath appeared? What aileth you, O heedless ones!</p>
<p>Fear God and follow not your idle fancies. Soar in the atmosphere of the mercy of your Lord, the Most High, the Supreme. Say: O people! He is indeed in the Most Glorious Horizon and calleth you from this Supreme Horizon, saying that this is He of Whom We gave you glad tidings in all the Tablets, and from Whom We took your covenant - the Mighty, the Wondrous. He hath come to you with the truth, with My signs and My clear tokens, and reciteth unto you that which all created things are powerless to comprehend. Say: The Spirit hath ordained through His mighty and wondrous Pen, and through it He quickeneth all created things, should they turn unto Him in clear submission. Whoso drinketh of this Salsabil shall never die. By God! Death fleeth from him even as the idolaters flee from the monotheists.</p>
<p>Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the bounty of these days and cling to mere forms and images. Sanctify yourselves from all that exists in the worlds and turn your faces toward the countenance of your Lord, the All-Merciful. This is better for you than all that hath been created between the heavens and the earths. O people! Remember the days of My manifestation and what I brought from God, the Most High, the All-Knowing. All the learned ones of the earth opposed Me - some ridiculed My verses, some belittled My person, and some denied Me after I had come to them with manifest truth.</p>
<p>Fear God, O people, and act not as did Our heedless servants. Help your Lord through this Name, the Mighty, the Impregnable. Did ye but know, ye would expend all that ye possess and sacrifice your very selves to enter beneath His shadow - how much more to attain His presence, the Mighty, the Impregnable. Fear God and deny not the Most Great Bounty, and be not of the heedless ones. We revealed the Bayan for His sake, yet ye were not content with its decree of faith. Alas for you, O idolaters! All things flee from your deeds, and were ye to recognize what ye have done, ye would flee from your own selves, O ye deniers!</p>
<p>The eye of eternity hath never witnessed any more unjust than you, and the Concourse on high are bewildered at your deeds. We created the Ridvan of the Bayan in His name and adorned it with the fruits of knowledge and inner meanings and the roses of truth for His Own impregnable and mighty Self. Yet ye were not content that He should have authority over even a single leaf of the leaves that grew from one of its trees, O oppressors! Say: The Most Great Ocean hath flowed from His finger and now surgeth in His remembrance, were ye but of those who know. Yet ye have denied Him [even] a drop therefrom. What aileth you, O heedless ones!</p>
<p>Hearken unto My words and make amends for your deeds, that perchance God may forgive you through His grace and absolve you of your transgressions, which are weightier than all that hath been created between the heavens and the earths. Be fair, O people, then look toward the direction of justice. Have ye seen any Kawthar sweeter than this Kawthar which [floweth] over fragments of ruby and from which is heard the remembrance of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting? Think ye that ye hear what ye have heard in this Ridvan? Nay, by His very truth, were ye to search throughout all the regions of the heavens and earth. Fear God, O people, then detach yourselves from all things that ye may find the sweetness of the remembrance of your Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Compelling. Purify yourselves from all else, then turn ye unto God, the Beloved of them that know. And thou, O servant, give thanks unto God for having attained His presence and heard His melodies and stood before Him when He was seated upon His mighty throne. At that time none among all created things recognized Him, and His countenance shone forth from behind seventy thousand veils of light, and God was witness and well-aware of this. When the appointed time was fulfilled, We revealed the Face with manifest sovereignty. Thereupon all who are in the heavens and on earth were terrified, save a few souls who are among them that rejoice in the All-Glorious Paradise. Say: O people, is there any doubt about God, or about this Revelation which hath appeared with the truth, or about the proofs of the Prophets and Messengers? Whoso doubteth this Cause hath not believed in God, nor in His messengers, nor in those whom God hath sent with truth and made them the manifestations of His Self amongst the worlds. Cast aside all things behind thee, then speak forth in praise of His exalted and great Self. Say: Verily He hath appeared with the truth once again and speaketh through all things that there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, then call the people unto God, thy Lord, and be not of them that hesitate. Verily thou hast with God, thy Lord, a mighty station if thou remainest steadfast in His Cause in such wise that the cawing of the deceived moveth thee not. Know thou furthermore that the Revelations have ended with this Most Great, this Most Mighty Revelation. Whosoever shall lay claim to this exalted, mighty and impregnable station before the completion of a thousand years, hath indeed corrupted the Cause and falsely attributed that which is not unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of all creation. Thus hath it been sent down unto Me in truth from the presence of an ancient Ordainer, and We have informed thee as a favor from Us unto thee and unto every discerning believer. Convey My glorification to the faces of My loved ones, to all males and females, to every young and old, and say: Praise be unto God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who is Sovereign over all Names!</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Be thou ready to hearken unto the Voice of the Wronged One. He, verily, desireth to make mention of thee at this time. The glances of the tender mercies of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, have been directed towards thee. He hath aided thee to turn towards Him when all learned ones turned away, and guided thee to His path when the people were lost in manifest doubt. He enabled thee to go forth from thy home, turning thy face to the Most Exalted Horizon. Thou didst traverse the ways until thou didst arrive and attain His presence, and didst hear the Voice of God, the Lord of the worlds, and beheld that whereunto eyes were created to see and ears to hear His wondrous call. Give thanks unto God for this supreme bounty, and be not of them whom sorrows have overtaken in the days of their Lord, the All-Merciful. We desire to behold thee content with that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to see thee among those who rejoice. By the life of God! He who hath ascended is, verily, in an exalted station with thy Lord, and desireth not to return to this world. Thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Witnessing, the All-Knowing. We have recorded his mention in the Crimson Tablet through My Most Exalted Pen. This is a bounty from Our presence which nothing that the people possess today can equal. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who was named Muhammad-before-Rida, that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the Lord of all mankind, the Lord of the Throne above and of the earth below, and be of them that have attained. Thou hast indeed attained unto My revelations, turned towards My horizon, held fast unto My cord, and clung to the hem of the robe of My mercy, which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. Let not the happenings of the world grieve thee. Verily, it is the abode of trials and tribulations. To this testifieth the Creator of the heavens and the Lord of Names. Soon shall all that is therein perish, and there shall endure only that which hath flowed from the Pen of thy Lord, the All-Knowing. We have made mention of thee before, and at this time. Render thanks unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden. Thou hast created me through Thy grace and brought me forth through Thy generosity and enabled me to recognize the Dayspring of Thy Revelation, the Dawning-Place of Thy signs, and the Manifestation of Thy Self on a day when most of Thy creatures turned away from Thee, violated Thy covenant and Thy testament, disputed Thy signs, and denied Thy proof and Thy testimony. I beseech Thee, O Thou the Desire of the hearts of them that know Thee and the Beloved of the hearts of them that are sincere, by the breezes of the morn of Thy manifestation and by the fruits of the Tree of Thy Cause and by the fragrances of Thy days and by Thy verses which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy will for Thy servants, to draw me ever closer to Thy most exalted horizon in all conditions and to ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen servants. O Lord! I am he who hath turned unto the lights of Thy countenance and held fast unto the cord of Thy forgiveness and pardon. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me the stream of Thy mercy nor deprive me from the ocean of Thy favors. Wilt Thou turn away the poor one from the ocean of Thy riches or remove the needy one from the gardens of Thy nearness? I implore Thee by the pavilion of Thy glory and the banners of Thy signs to ordain for me that which shall abide with me in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all beings and the Educator of all things visible and invisible. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Generous, the All-Bountiful, the All-Hearing, the All-Answering.</p>
<p>Hear ye in the Persian tongue, O Muhammad-Rida! Praise be to God that through the favors of the Lord of all beings and the traces of His Pen thou hast attained, and by the light of His knowledge thou art illumined. Give praise to the Desired One of the world that afterward He did not withhold thee from His grace. Outwardly thou art distant, but inwardly near. He is the Gracious, the Merciful. The whole world was brought from nothingness into being for this blessed Day, yet heedlessness and pride have prevented all from hearkening to the call of Him Who spoke upon Sinai. They are seen wandering confused and bewildered in the wilderness of ignorance. The recompense of deeds hath been made manifest and hath prevented all save whom God willeth. And ye have attained unto that which hath had and hath no likeness. Verily the Cause is in His hand; He guideth whom He willeth unto His straight path.</p>
<p>His honor Ahmad, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, hath attained unto that which hath been revealed from the Divine Pen in the Book of Meanings. O Ahmad! Upon thee be My glory. Know thou the value of this station. Convey My greetings unto the people of God in that land. Say: I swear by the Sun of utterance which shineth and is manifest from the most exalted horizon of possibility that ye are all mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and are the recipients of His favors. Today is the day of mention and praise and the day of service. Deprive not yourselves. Ye are the letters of the words and the words of the Book. Ye are saplings planted by the hand of loving-kindness in the soil of mercy, and have been nurtured by the showers of grace. He hath protected you from the tempests of polytheism and the thunderbolts of infidelity, and hath reared you with the hands of tenderness. Now is the time for fruits and leaves, and the fruits of the divine tree have ever been and are goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. Withhold not these fruits from the heedless. Show them forth with spirit and joy, with wisdom and utterance. If they accept, the aim is achieved and life is manifest; otherwise, leave them to their vain imaginings.</p>
<p>O people of God! Strive ye that perchance the hearts of the diverse peoples of the world may be cleansed and sanctified from rancor and hatred through the waters of your forbearance and loving-kindness, and become worthy and receptive of the splendors of the Sun of Truth. We convey greetings to all and give them the glad-tidings of the outpourings of the lights of the Lord’s favors. O friends! Know ye the value of these days, for they will soon come to an end. At all times counsels of loving-kindness have flowed from the Pen of the Merciful. Blessed are they who have hearkened and acted, and whom the doubts and appearances and diversities of these two days have not kept back from the straight path and the mighty announcement. O people of God! Upon you be the glory of God and His favors and the mercy of God and His grace. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. There is no God but Him, the Exalted, the Great.</p>

<p>The Beloved Friend, Aqa Siyyid Faraj’u’llah - upon him be the peace of God - may read:</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power!</p>
<p>It hath been said before concerning the description of truth that should anyone desire to know it, he must needs remove the veils of glory without indication. For these veils there have been and are diverse meanings. In the primary degree and first station, by ‘veils’ are meant the divines of Iran, for these souls have been the hindrance to the knowledge of God - glorified be His Majesty - and nearness to His chosen ones and servants. They have ever been the cause of discord and the source of upheaval. In the second station and other degree are means that prevent man from attaining unto God. These means are at times outward things, at times occurring matters, and at times vain imaginings and idle fancies which appear denser than mountains. Upon complete observation and scrutiny, it becometh evident that their sources are those same heedless souls aforementioned. However, in the sight of the brave and the men of valor, the veils of the world and the coverings of the nations were not and are not worthy of mention. With the finger of trust they have rent them asunder, and with the arm of detachment have they shattered them - that is, the idols of vain imaginings. Exalted be their stations and magnificent their conditions and ranks! Neither commerce nor trade distracteth them from the remembrance of God. These are the manifestations of steadfastness and the dawning-places thereof. In all conditions they gaze toward God and are detached from aught else. The changes and transformations of the world and its occurrences alter them not nor make them sorrowful. They act for God, speak for God, are turned toward God, and trust in God. Blessed are they and joy be unto them!</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God, my Desire and my Hope! I testify that were all mention to be endowed with as many wings as the number of all created things, and were they to soar from the First which hath no beginning unto the Last which hath no end, they would never attain unto the court of Thy glorious majesty. How then can my mention and the mention of them that make mention of Thee, or my description and the description of them that describe Thee, ever befit Thee? I testify, O my God, by Thy greatness and Thy sovereignty and Thy loftiness and Thy power, and by my effacement before the Word of affirmation and the traces of Thy Pen, O Lord! Thou seest my weakness and my poverty and my need. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy knowledge and whatsoever lieth hidden therein by Thy command and Thy will, that Thou assist me and Thy loved ones in Thy remembrance and Thy praise. O Lord! Thou seest the weakness of the unitarians and the might of the idolaters. Their cannons have encompassed Thy realms and their bullets the horizons of Thy domains. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance that Thou protect the people of unity from the fire of their oppression and their tyranny and their might and their deceit. Verily Thou art the Powerful One Whom neither their conditions nor their might can frustrate. O Lord! Thou seest and knowest Thy servant who hath turned toward Thee and chosen exile through what hath befallen him from Thy irrevocable decree. I beseech Thee that Thou protect him with the hosts of the unseen and the seen, and that Thou open before his face the gates of joy and relief. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>[…] And then your letter arrived, bringing joy and delight, for it was adorned with the mention of God, exalted be His glory, and also brought glad tidings of good health, and furthermore news of association with his honor, the beloved of hearts, one of the two Most Exalted Names, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious. By the life of the Desired One, verily the servant remembers him in the nights and days, and he is before his eyes at all times. After its reading and review, it was presented before the Face, and He said: “O Farajullah, upon thee be the peace of God, His mercy, His grace and His blessings. His bounty hath encompassed the world and His mercy hath preceded all. The heaven testifieth to His greatness and the seas are signs of His generosity. Ask thou of Him whatsoever is befitting and expedient, for man knoweth not that which is to his benefit or harm. Jesus, son of Mary, in his communion with God, supplicated saying: ‘Thou knowest what is in my soul, and I know not what is with Thee.’ We beseech God to grant that which causeth the exaltation, elevation, loftiness and ascendancy of being, and to ordain that which leadeth to nearness, certitude and steadfastness. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to change thy sorrow into the greatest joy, and thy will into what He willeth, and thy desire into what He desireth. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, and the Most Merciful of the merciful.”</p>
<p>His is the praise and glorification, and His is the might and the bestowal. He hath ever ordained for His loved ones that which is the cause of joy and exaltation. The ocean of His mercy is surging and the heaven of His grace is upraised. In all conditions we hold fast to His cord and cling to His robe, and in humility and supplication we beseech Him to aid His loved ones as behooveth them. He is the Hearer and the Answerer. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Convey my greetings to all the friends in that land, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, on their behalf, for that which will cause the manifestation of the fruits of the Tree of existence. Verily, He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Especially to the beloved, honored, magnified one of the two Most Exalted Names, his honor A.L., upon him be the Glory of God and His care. Praise be to God, all are adorned with the blessed Word of Unity and are assured of and submissive to that which God hath revealed in the Book. Their mention hath ever been and still is in this land. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon God’s loved ones in all regions, and praise be to God, the One, the Chosen One.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath raised up His Cause and manifested His sovereignty in such wise that neither the doubts of the skeptics, nor the utterances of the polytheists, nor the pronouncements of those who have denied the Day of Judgment could hinder it. Verily, He is the Single, the One, the All-Powerful, Who hath ever been supreme over all who are in the heavens and the earth, and exalted above the comprehension of those who dwell in the kingdoms of creation and command.

<p>May my spirit be a sacrifice for your steadfastness. When this evanescent servant was lying upon his bed, one of the chosen ones named Siyyid Javad entered bearing your letter. When I sensed the fragrance of your sincerity to God, our Lord and your Lord, I sat upright and was blessed with its contents. When I read and understood it, it was presented before His face, and when what your heart had uttered in love of God, the Lord of the worlds, was presented, then the Kingdom of Utterance spoke and said: “Blessed art thou, O Muhammad, and joy be unto thee, O Mustafa! Thou art he who hath been confirmed in the love of God, the Lord of Names, and hath called the people to His supreme horizon, and hast remained steadfast in His Cause in such wise that neither the whisperings of the servants nor the doubts of those who disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, caused thee to slip. Blessed are the people of Iraq who were stirred by the breezes of revelation in the days when the Sun of the horizons shone forth from the horizons of the land. Blessed be their faces, for they have turned toward My horizon, and their ears, for they have been blessed to hearken unto My call.”</p>
<p>The Wronged One remembereth them and beseecheth God to aid them to remember and praise Him with wisdom and utterance, and to strengthen them to act according to what they have been commanded in His mighty Book. We make mention of the imprisoned one who hath attained the recognition of God and hath drunk the choice wine of love from the hands of His bounty. He is, in truth, the One Who confirmeth and seeth. From this most exalted station We send Our greetings upon them and upon those who have attained what they have attained, and We remember them with a goodly remembrance.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Face! Thou hast known what thou didst mention concerning Ibrahim and his companion in the land of Sad. We were in the land of Sad and did not witness what was witnessed. Know thou this and be of them that understand. We beseech God to aid those who have believed with sincere truthfulness and to make them standards of truthfulness and steadfastness among all people. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>It behooveth thee to conceal the Cause of the Wronged One from those who are submerged in the sea of passion, to such an extent that they have denied the Furqan and the verses of the All-Merciful. We have forbidden mention and utterance in those regions and their surroundings. Conceal thou and be of them that conceal, for We have found the people bereft of fairness, as every discerning one doth witness. Beware, beware lest thou reveal the Cause to blind eyes or speak to deaf ears. The people are asleep; when they die they shall awaken. Thus doth the Wronged One inform thee, and He is, verily, the Truthful, the Trustworthy.</p>
<p>It behooveth no one to draw nigh unto him who hath denied the Prophets and Messengers and hath acknowledged what he possesseth of the promptings of Satan, nor to hear his words. Say: Keep away, O servants of the All-Merciful, and be ye manifestly on your guard. Their deeds testify to what is within them, and their words reveal them. By the life of God! Their conduct maketh manifest what is in their hearts. God is clear of these people, as doth testify what the All-Merciful hath sent down in the Furqan and unto the Prophets and Messengers.</p>
<p>Conceal what We have imparted unto thee concerning Ibrahim lest he become aware of what We have made known to thee. Hold fast unto wisdom in all circumstances lest a disturbance arise therein. We beseech God, exalted be He, to protect you from the scheming of every schemer and the falsehood of every liar. He, verily, hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>Moreover, We counsel you to maintain the greatest concealment concerning him and concerning all who claim to believe, unless they come to thee with a clear proof. Believe not every speaker. Preserve the pearls of knowledge in the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, from every distant betrayer. Peace and glory be upon thee and upon all who have believed in God, the One, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Most astonishing of all is those who deny God and His verses. Yet this is not the first instance of opposition, nor the first denial, nor the first discord, nor the first hypocrisy, nor the first rejection, nor the first turning away, nor the first objection. Servants before have uttered what these utter now, and they shall speak even more grievously hereafter. But God will manifest His Cause as He has manifested it before, despite them. He is, verily, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>I marvel at him whom thou hast taken as a companion. I beseech the Almighty to make him steadfast in His Cause and purify him from the deeds of the idolaters. A tablet hath been sent to him in response, as wisdom requireth, that he might be among the tranquil ones. It behooveth you to be forbearing with him until God delivereth you from his company. This servant imploreth God to protect His servant Ibrahim. I observe that he consorteth with every corrupt one and associateth with every transgressor, and verily he is more harmful than poison. His own tongue would bear witness to this, were he to be among the fair-minded ones. You must conceal all that is mentioned in this letter, lest there arise the clamor of the heedless ones who have cast the ordinances of God behind their backs and followed every accursed satan.</p>
<p>As to the dervish, this servant hath presented his petition before the Throne, and he hath been granted pardon, should he be among the steadfast and firm ones. Give him the glad tidings of this bounty that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones. This servant beseecheth his Lord to preserve him from the promptings of desire and enable him to be obedient and perform pure deeds. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Bountiful. This evanescent servant conveyeth his greetings unto him and unto Ibrahim and unto the loved ones in that place, and I beseech God, the Lord of the worlds, to grant them success. Praise be to God, the Goal of the mystics.</p>

<p>He is God, the Radiant, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>To reach the presence of Mulla Muhammad Ja’far that he may behold the Greatest Scene.</p>
<p>O Ja’far! Rend asunder the veils of idle fancy, for We have rent them by a sovereignty from Our presence and a power from Our side, and I am, verily, the One Who prevaileth over whatsoever I desire, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Then open thine eyes and behold the words of thy Lord. By God! A single letter thereof outweigheth all that hath been created in the heavens and the earth. Cast away the world and all that is therein beneath thy shadow, then emerge from behind the veils with manifest radiance. Consider within thyself: if thou wert to deny these verses, by what evidence would thy faith in God, the Supreme, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, be established? Take heed lest leadership debar thee from the remembrance of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Arise to serve God and set thy foot upon the head of sovereignty, then hasten to the shore of the Cause in this blessed spot, whose very atoms proclaim that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Soar with the wings of holiness beyond all names and their kingdom, then beyond all attributes and their dominion, then enter the seat of security, the station wherein the fire is kindled from the Lote-Tree of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Chosen One. This is what We have ordained for thee, if thou be of them that comprehend. Wouldst thou content thyself with a mere cup when faced with the surging waters of this Most Great Ocean? By God! This beseemeth thee not, for We have ordained for thee a holy and glorious station. By God! One breath drawn in this Cause is better for thee than the treasures of the heavens and the earth - this is a revelation from One mighty and wise. After the manifestation of God, can anything profit anyone? Nay, by My All-Knowing, All-Informed Self! Shatter the idols of imitation, and if thou findest thyself weak, seek strength through My Name, the Victorious, the Powerful. If thou believest not in God and His verses, at least deny them not, and withhold not the hand of harm from God’s Cause, the Supreme, the Victorious, the All-Encompassing. By God! If thou wouldst hearken unto all things with the ear of thine inmost nature, thou wouldst hear from every atom what Moses heard, and wouldst testify that there is none other God but Him, and that this Ancient Sovereign is established upon a glorious throne. O My Name! By God! I speak not of Mine own desire, but the Spirit speaketh within My breast. These words are not from Me but from One mighty and powerful. Fear God Who created and fashioned thee, and deny not that whereby thy faith in God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds, was established. Hearken unto what I have enjoined in the Tablets, and cast not the commandment of God behind thy back, nor be thou of the heedless ones. Taste from the Kawthar of eternity from the hand of Baha, and deprive not thyself of the sanctuary of immortality, nor be of them that are veiled. Say: O concourse of divines from the people of the Bayan! Do ye act as acted the divines of the Qur’an when the Beauty of the Cause appeared with His name, the Most High, the All-Knowing? By God! This is an injustice from you against God, your Creator, whereunto every discerning and insightful one doth testify. Beware lest thou turn to the world and its ornaments, for soon shall sovereignty perish while the face of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beautiful, shall endure. Thus have We cast upon thee from the verses of the Cause that thou mayest witness the power of thy Lord and be of them that are assured.</p>
<p>And if there cometh to thee he who is named Ahmad, mention him with a mention from Us, that perchance the fragrances of grace may attract him and draw him nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Generous. Say: O servant! We counseled thee when thou didst depart from before the Throne that thou shouldst speak naught but pure truth and shouldst not veil the beauty of the Divine Unity with the veil of fancy and imitation. Yet thou hast forsaken the Cause of God and wert among the forsakers. O servant! Make thy presence a presence of fairness and justice, then ponder that which thou hast believed in concerning God, the Mighty, the Powerful. For if thou findest that which thou hast believed in the presence of this servant, then deny not the signs of thy Lord and be not of the doubtful. And should anyone say these verses were not revealed according to primordial nature, even as they have said and were not ashamed before God Who created them and created all things - whereat the eyes of grandeur have wept, though they perceived it not and were among those who rejoiced. Say: By God, O people! This is He by Whose Pen’s command was created the primordial nature of every soul and the nature of the heavens and earths. Thereupon the Holy Spirit stood before the Throne and proclaimed: O people of the Bayan! Fear God and say not that which would cause the hearts of those near unto God to be consumed. By God! I and all who dwell in the Most Great Paradise were created by the will of this Beauty. By God! The denizens of the highest paradise circle round Him, were ye but to behold. And furthermore, if ye desire that the Sun of Truth should shine forth from the horizon of a luminous dawn, then gather together those who were given the Furqan and others from all other faiths, then read what ye possess and what hath been sent down from the heaven of eternity from the presence of the All-Knowing Revealer. And if they find any difference between them, then ye stand upon a matter from matters - nay, by Him Who holdeth my soul in His hand, none shall find any difference save the souls of the idolaters. By God! The Most Great Spirit hath rent its garments by reason of what hath befallen Him Who is the Manifestation of God’s Self from His oppressed servants. Say: O people! How long will ye stand upon the ground of allusions? Ascend from this station, then strive to attain unto the Cause, that ye may be among those who attain. And whoso purifieth the sense of fairness from the catarrh of hatred shall surely find the fragrance of truth from these missives even as one findeth the musk-like fragrance, and shall be of the assured ones. Thus have We taught thee and inspired thee out of love for thee. If thou acceptest, it shall be for thyself, and if thou turnest away, thy Lord is in truth independent of all worlds. And praise be to God, my Beloved and the Beloved of the mystics.</p>

<p>The Friend is eternal and all else perishable. O Husayn! Be intimate with the remembrance of God and heedless of aught else, for His remembrance is a companion without duplicity and an associate in perfect harmony - a guest who betrays not and a comrade who works neither harm nor treachery. It is a reliable assembly and a steadfast and established intimate. It is a faithful friend who, wherever thou goest, accompanies thee and never parts from thee. It transforms sorrow into joy and wipes away the rust of heedlessness.</p>
<p>This is the Day wherein the attractive Word of God is suspended between earth and heaven, drawing unto itself the essences of the hearts of all created things. As for those souls who have not ascended from their earthly habitations, the decree of former religions and their rejection has been issued concerning them from God. I swear by the Sun of inner meanings that were there to be found but a particle - nay, less than that - of the essence concealed in a mountain, the attractive and distinguishing Word would assuredly draw that particle and separate it from that mountain.</p>
<p>Thus do you observe in the Concourse of the Bayan that whatsoever hearts were pure, souls sanctified, and breasts holy among that people have ascended to the most exalted stronghold and the ultimate station of the Divine Lote-Tree. And whatsoever souls were impure and sullied have returned to their origin. For a mere fancy they have turned away from the King of certitude, and through attachment to a passing shadow they have become heedless of the eternal Beauty. They are now seen before God as the most rejected of the world and the most limited of all people, for they have disbelieved in that which is greater, more perfect and mightier than that wherein they had previously believed and whereof they had boasted over other peoples. Thus doth God render vain the deeds of those who disbelieved and associated partners with God, and were in doubt about meeting their Lord after He had appeared with all the signs and with manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>O Husayn! The chalices of eternity and extinction have both appeared with utmost manifestation and evident emergence, borne by the angels of paradise and hell. How excellent is the state of that soul who becomes the recipient of the chalice of eternity and leaves the chalice of extinction to its people.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Behold the Cause of God today as thou wouldst the sun, and all created things as mirrors. Any mirror that faces and turns toward the sun will have its image reflected therein, clear and evident. Today, in any heart that turns toward the Divine Beauty, the lights of His countenance become manifest and visible, and without this it remains deprived, nay, as one lost. Today none have turned except a few, and these are the essences of existence in the sight of God.</p>
<p>The Most Exalted Pen declares: None but Mine ear can hear My words, and none but Mine eye can recognize My beauty. How can the eye afflicted with the ophthalmia of desire behold the Most Great Scene? My love hath been the physician for all ailments, and My affection shall be the healer of all diseases. Know divine love to be purifying - wherever it enters, no defilement remains. It transforms illness into health and sin into mercy. Blessed are the souls who attain unto this matchless grace.</p>
<p>Therefore, O thou servant who art assured in God, be thankful that thou art mentioned before God among the enduring letters. The cloud of His All-Merciful grace hath rained upon thee, and the clouds of His glorified bounty have showered their favors upon thee in thy native land and praiseworthy station.</p>
<p>You have taken up residence in the City of Divine Love. God willing, strive at all times to attain and be nourished by His wondrous mercy which is specially designated for that time, for in every moment the Divine Beauty sheds Its most wondrous effulgence. The heedful ones have no share of this celebrated grace. You must remain steadfast in the Cause of God and strive to the extent possible to teach His Cause, for today this most exalted and glorious station is the nearest of all things that draw one nigh unto the King of Names and Attributes. O Husayn, follow in the footsteps of the Servant and walk therein, and never be saddened by any afflictions that may come to pass. By Him Who holdeth my soul in His hand! If God’s infinite worlds were limited to this world, and its delights confined to what is witnessed by its people, I would never have subjected Myself to these countless afflictions. Consider the near ones among the Prophets and the tribulations each endured in the path of God. By the Most Exalted Pen! Were anyone to possess consciousness even less than an atom and reflect upon this utterance, they would never pay heed to this world nor be saddened by its existence or absence. Moreover, they would become assured of that which none hath been assured save those whom God hath aided to recognize Him and whose eyes He hath opened to witness His mysteries. Were I to mention the afflictions We have endured in this City, you would surely be saddened, but know this much: By Him Who caused the tongue of dawn to speak His praise! From the beginning of creation until now such tyranny hath never appeared, nor hath anyone endured what the Beauty of the Divine Unity hath endured, and thereby all things have lamented, though they perceive it not. And I say: Nothing shall befall Us except what God hath decreed for Us. In Him do We put Our trust, and upon Him let the near ones place their trust. Jinab-i-Nabil-i-’Ali is with Us; be thou assured concerning him and give thanks unto God for having made him one of His companions among the worlds. Praise be to God that he beholdeth the Most Great Scene with his eyes, heareth the words of God with his ears, and with his heart is turned to His remembrance. Blessed is he and blessed are ye. Convey the mention of this Wronged One to the loved ones of God.</p>

<p>These are verses that appeared in the pavilion of eternity and the canopy of holiness when the Most Great Name arrived from the direction of the All-Glorious in the land of Samsun, which is near a great sea. Then the hosts of God’s revelation descended with such adorning power that all who are in the heavens and earth were struck with awe, and before them shone the Sun of Beauty in a holy and refined temple. And He addressed the Ark with that which had flowed from the Pen of God aforetime in the Tablet wherein We addressed the celestial Mariner with a hidden sorrowful call, and with that which was revealed at that time in this Tablet from a holy and luminous Pen. And whosoever wishes to become acquainted with the mysteries of the Cause from the presence of One wise and knowing, let him look into these two Tablets that he may recognize the mysteries of God, that his eyes may be solaced thereby, and that he may be among those endowed with certitude.</p>
<p>The time of the noon-tide hath been fulfilled in the pavilion of holiness, and the Beauty of the Divine Identity hath emerged with a noble and glorious countenance. Say: The journey through dust hath ended at the shore of a mighty ocean. Therefore doth the eternal pavilion weep, and the luminous holy ark rejoice. O Divine Mariner! The promise We made thee with the tongue of truth all-knowing hath come to pass. Make thyself ready to transport the Spirit of God upon the ark of all creation through this Cause both new and ancient. All that We promised thee shall be made manifest unto thee in truth, if thou be of the patient ones. We informed thee beforehand of all that would transpire, yet none among the peoples of the world took notice thereof. We kept them unaware by reason of that which their hands had wrought, and this is manifest justice. By God! Those who enter beneath thy shadow shall be seized by the torment of a great trial.</p>
<p>Say: By God! This is God’s touchstone, established with justice, distinguishing between truth and falsehood, and doubt from certitude. But do thou purge thy vision from human limitations and turn not thy gaze away from this luminous countenance. Waft upon them the sweet savors of grace, that perchance they may be delivered from their vain imaginings and be turned unto God, the Mighty, the Wise, and that their hearts may be purified from their desires and they may attain unto a holy and wondrous homeland, and that perchance the veils of blind imitation may be consumed and the beauty of divine unity may shine forth from the niche of refined hearts. Weigh not the servants by God’s measure, for they weigh at all times and are among the unfaithful. Rather forgive them and overlook their misdeeds, for thou art indeed the Generous, the Lord of abundant grace. When thou hast closed thine eyes to transgression and opened them with beneficence, there waft over the peoples of all worlds the sweet-scented breezes of holiness, that they may become aware within themselves how God hath preferred them above all creation, made them His companions, honored them with His presence, and sent down unto them the fruits of union from a manifest holy tree, clothed them in the raiment of distinction, preferred them above all that was and shall be, and inscribed their names in preserved tablets of glory. All this shall be confirmed in them if they alter not God’s favor unto themselves, recognize His bounties unto them, and render thanks at all times.</p>
<p>And thou, O Ark of the Cause, bear thou these souls and sail upon the sea by God’s leave, the Mighty, the Powerful. O Ship of Holiness! Rejoice within thyself, for upon thee hath come the glorious and noble Beauty. O Sea of Eternity! Let thine eyes be solaced, for upon thee hath come the Sea of the subtle Spirit. For this wert thou created before all seas, that thou mightest be among the perceiving ones. Therefore, honor the guests of God, the servants who have embarked upon thee and come unto thee, and be not among the agitated ones. Guard the trust of God and be not unfaithful in thyself, and be not among the treacherous ones.</p>
<p>O Fish of the sea! Rejoice within yourselves, then remember your Creator, for ye have attained unto the presence of God in days wherein the Sun of Beauty hath shone forth from the dawning-place of an ancient Name.</p>
<p>O Air of the sea! Waft upon the pure and luminous bodies whom God created from the light of His Essence before the creation of the heavens and earth, and be thou gladdened within thyself and rejoice in thy spirit, for God hath provided thee with a subtle spiritual breeze. By God! The dwellers of the sea have rejoiced and [the inhabitants] of the land have cried out, for the Beauty of the Divine Identity hath departed from the pavilion of eternity and settled upon an ark of sublime nearness.</p>
<p>Say: O people of mystery! Grieve not over anything, but instead rejoice in the holy, exalted, all-knowing joy of God. Say: This is indeed the joy that hath seized all created things and encompassed all who dwell in the worlds, and it shall seize none to the exclusion of others who turn unto the holy, glorious and luminous countenance of God.</p>
<p>Say: This is the grace that transmuteth all atoms into the beauty of the Divine Identity, closer than the mention of ‘Beloved’ by the lover. Thus do We cast down the verses of the Spirit and spread the carpet of grace over all who dwell in the kingdom. And verily, We call unto thee, O Fount of Holiness, at the end of this utterance, for upon thee hath descended the Fount of God, the All-Subduing, the Mighty, the Most Upright.</p>
<p>O Ocean of Oneness! Be thou gladdened within thyself, for upon thee hath settled the Ocean of Joy - and this is indeed a great bounty. O Sea of Glory! Be thou delighted in thy spirit, for upon thee hath descended the Sea of God, the Most Exalted, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Blessed art thou, for around thee have gathered the spirits of those near unto God, and in that moment all atoms came forth and arose in thy atmosphere, and were among those who gazed, that the breezes of holiness might waft over them from the direction of oneness, from this Paradise that is veiled yet revealed, hidden yet manifest, concealed yet visible. Blessed are they and blessed is he who entereth beneath its shade, is honored by attaining its presence, drinketh from its cup, and holdeth fast unto its strong and mighty cord.</p>
<p>Thus have We perfected Our grace upon those of old and those of latter days, and have sent down from the clouds of holiness that which purifieth the hearts of the mystics. We have ordained for all things the garment of guidance, that they might turn unto Him and be numbered among the God-fearing. Thus have We ordained in the heaven of Our command that which enricheth all the worlds.</p>

<p>O Siyyid Mahdi, hearken to the call of the Wronged One from the direction of the Lesser Prison. He wishes to make mention of thee with a mention that shall endure as long as His most beautiful names and most exalted attributes endure. Blessed is he who has found the fragrance of utterance, detached from all else save God, and has held fast to the cord of God’s command, the Lord of all worlds.

We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to forgive thee and thy parents, and those who have turned to the Most Great Manifestation and believed in God, the One, the All-Informed. Verily, He forgiveth whom He willeth through His mercy, and chastiseth those who have denied the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>We make mention of those named Muhammad-’Ali and Muhammad-Baqir, and We make mention of them with that which will strengthen them and draw them near unto God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. We beseech God to ordain for them what He hath ordained for His chosen ones, and to send down upon them from the heaven of His bounty the table of His knowledge. Verily, He is the Protector of the doers of good and the Ultimate Goal of the sincere ones and those near unto Him.</p>

<p>Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! I testify that Thou wast a hidden Treasure wrapped within Thine immemorial Being and an impenetrable Mystery enshrined in Thine own Essence. Wishing to reveal Thyself, Thou didst call into being the Greater and the Lesser Worlds, and didst choose Man above all Thy creatures, and didst make Him a sign of both of these worlds, O Thou Who art our Lord, the Most Compassionate!</p>
<p>Thou didst raise Him up to occupy Thy throne before all the people of Thy creation. Thou didst enable Him to unravel Thy mysteries, and to shine with the lights of Thine inspiration and Thy Revelation, and to manifest Thy names and Thine attributes. Through Him Thou didst adorn the preamble of the book of Thy creation, O Thou Who art the Ruler of the universe Thou hast fashioned!</p>
<p>I bear witness that in His person solidity and fluidity have been joined and combined. Through His immovable constancy in Thy Cause, and His unwavering adherence to whatsoever Thou, in the plentitude of the light of Thy glory, didst unveil to His eyes, throughout the domains of Thy Revelation and creation, the souls of Thy servants were stirred up in their longing for Thy Kingdom, and the dwellers of Thy realms rushed forth to enter into Thy heavenly dominion. Through the restlessness He evinced in Thy path, the feet of all them that are devoted to Thee were steeled and confirmed to manifest Thy Cause amidst Thy creatures, and to demonstrate Thy sovereignty throughout Thy realm.</p>
<p>How great, O my God, is this Thy most excellent handiwork, and how consummate Thy creation, which hath caused every understanding heart and mind to marvel! And when the set time was fulfilled, and what had been preordained came to pass, Thou didst unloose His tongue to praise Thee, and to lay bare Thy mysteries before all Thy creation, O Thou Who art the Possessor of all names, and the Fashioner of earth and heaven! Through Him all created things were made to glorify Thee, and to celebrate Thy praise, and every soul was directed towards the kingdom of Thy revelation and Thy sovereignty.</p>
<p>At one time, Thou didst raise Him up, O my God, and didst attire Him with the ornament of the name of Him Who conversed with Thee (Moses), and didst through Him uncover all that Thy will had decreed and Thine irrevocable purpose ordained. At another time, Thou didst adorn Him with the name of Him Who was Thy Spirit (Jesus), and didst send Him down out of the heaven of Thy will, for the edification of Thy people, infusing thereby the spirit of life into the hearts of the sincere among Thy servants and the faithful among Thy creatures. Again, Thou didst reveal Him, decked forth by the name of Him Who was Thy Friend (Muhammad), and caused Him to shine brightly above the horizon of Hijaz, as a token of Thy power and an evidence of Thy might. Through Him Thou didst send unto Thy servants what enabled them to scale the heights of Thy unity, and to yearn over the wonders of Thy manifold knowledge and wisdom.</p>
<p>I testify, O Thou Who art the Lord of the whole creation, and the Desire of whosoever hath sought Thee, that, amidst Thy creatures, They resemble the sun which no matter how often it riseth and setteth is still the one and the same sun. Whoso maketh any distinction between any of Them hath truly failed to attain the ultimate purpose, and to reach the highest goal, and hath been deprived of the mysteries of unity and of the lights of sanctity and oneness. I testify, moreover, that Thou hast decreed that none on the face of the earth should equal Them, and none of Thy creatures be able to be compared with any of Them, in order that Thine own singleness and peerlessness might be recognized and established.</p>
<p>Glorified, immeasurably glorified be Thy name, O my God! How can I ever befittingly mention Thee or sufficiently praise Thee, that Thou hast manifested Him by the power of Thy might, and caused Him to shine above the horizon of Thy will, and made Him the Day-Spring of Thy signs, and the Dawning-Place of the revelation of Thy names and Thine attributes? How bewilderingly mysterious, moreover, O my God, is His nature and all that Thou hast infused into Him, through Thy strength and by the power of Thy might! At one time He appeareth as the water which is Life indeed, sent down out of the heaven of Thy grace, and poured forth from the clouds of thy mercy, that Thy creatures may be endued with new life, and live as long as Thine own Kingdom endureth. Every drop of that water would suffice to quicken the dead, and to set their faces in the direction of Thy favors and Thy gifts, and to rid them of all attachment to aught else except Thee. At another time He revealeth Himself as the Fire which Thou didst kindle in the tree of Thy unity, whose heat melted the hearts of Thine ardent lovers when He Who is the Day-Star of the world shone forth above the horizon of ’Iraq. I testify, O my God, that through Him the veils of human fancy were burnt up, and the hearts of men were set towards the scene of Thy most resplendent glory. I implore Thee, O Thou Who art the Supreme Ordainer, not to suffer me to be deprived of the breezes which are wafted in Thy days, the days whereon the sweet smell of the raiment of Thy mercy hath been shed abroad. Neither do Thou keep me back from Thy most great Ocean, every drop of which crieth out and saith: “Great is the blessedness that awaiteth him who hath been awakened from his sleep by the breath of God which, from the source of His mercy, hath blown over all such of His creatures as have set themselves towards Him!” Thou seest, O my Lord, how Thy servants are held captive by their own selves and desires. Redeem them from their bondage, O my God, by the power of Thy sovereignty and might, that they may turn towards Thee when He Who is the Revealer of Thy names and attributes is manifested unto men.</p>
<p>Cast upon this poor and desolate creature, O my Lord, the glance of Thy wealth, and flood his heart with the beams of Thy knowledge, that he may apprehend the verities of the unseen world, and discover the mysteries of Thy heavenly realm, and perceive the signs and tokens of Thy kingdom, and behold the manifold revelations of this earthly life all set forth before the face of Him Who is the Revealer of Thine own Self. Direct, then, his eyes, O my God, towards the horizon of Thy loving-kindness, and make steadfast his heart in its attachment to Thee, and unloose his tongue to praise Thee, and make him able to hold fast the cord of Thy love, and to cling to the hem of Thy bounteousness, and to proclaim Thy name amidst Thy creatures, and to recount Thy virtues throughout Thy realm, in such wise that no obstacle will deter him from turning to Thy name, the All-Bountiful, and no veil shut him out from Thee, in Whose hand is the dominion of utterance and the kingdom of all names and attributes!</p>
<p>Hold Thou the hand of this seeker who hath set his face towards Thee, O my Lord, and draw him out of the depths of his vain imaginations, that the light of certainty may shine brightly above the horizon of his heart in the days whereon the sun of the knowledge of Thy creatures hath been darkened through the shining of the Day-Star of Thy glory; the days whereon the moon of the world’s wisdom hath been eclipsed through the appearance of Thy hidden knowledge, and the manifestation of Thy well-guarded secret, and the revelation of Thine enshrined mystery; the days whereon the stars of men’s doings have fallen through the rising of the orb of Thy unity and the shedding of the radiance of Thy transcendent oneness.</p>
<p>I beg of Thee, O my God, by Thy most exalted Word which Thou hast ordained as the Divine Elixir unto all who are in Thy realm, the Elixir through whose potency the crude metal of human life hath been transmuted into purest gold, O Thou in Whose hands are both the visible and invisible kingdoms, to ordain that my choice be conformed to Thy choice and my wish to Thy wish, that I may be entirely content with that which Thou didst desire, and be wholly satisfied with what Thou didst destine for me by Thy bounteousness and favor. Potent art Thou to do as Thou willest. Thou, in very truth, art the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Happy is the man who hath recognized Thee, and discovered the sweetness of Thy fragrance, and set himself towards Thy kingdom, and tasted of the things that have been perfected therein by Thy grace and favor. Great is the blessedness of him who hath acknowledged Thy most excellent majesty, and whom the veils that have shut out the nations from Thee have not hindered from directing his eyes towards Thee, O Thou Who art the King of eternity and the Quickener of every moldering bone! Blessed, also, is he that hath inhaled Thy sweet savors, and been carried away by Thine utterances in Thy days. Blessed, moreover, be the man that hath turned unto Thee, and woe betide him that hath turned his back upon Thee. Praised be Thou, the Lord of the worlds!</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Sanctified, the Mighty, the Beautiful!</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! In this moment I confess and acknowledge my powerlessness to know Thy supreme Self in Thy Most Exalted Name, and my incapacity to comprehend Thy Essence, O Thou in Whose grasp lie the kingdoms of names. For the loftiest hearts of them that are nigh unto Thee, and the highest understanding of them that are devoted to Thy unity, are bound by Thy will, held within Thy grasp, and created by Thy command. How then can the created soar in the atmosphere of nearness to the Essence, or attain unto the Lord of earth and heaven?</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee! O my God, I testify in this my station before Thee that the most eloquent have not reached the court of Thy singular glory, and the most learned have not comprehended the wonders of Thy knowledge and understanding. All who are enamoured cry out in the wilderness of separation, yearning for Thy nearness, and all who are longing call forth in the Sinai of longing, seeking reunion with Thee. Some have attained the ultimate of what they sought of the gems of Thy mercy and the essence of Thy bounty, while others have perished in their exile and separation from Thee, never finding the path to Thy nearness and meeting with Thee.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee! Whenever I consider my self and my deeds in Thy kingdom, bewilderment and sorrow seize me to such degree that I become despairing of the sweet fragrances of Thy glorious mercy and deprived of the glances of Thine eye of grace. Yet whenever I turn, O my God, to the wonders of Thy mercy and the gems of Thy bounty, the breezes of assurance waft upon me from the direction of grace and loving-kindness.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God, my Beloved, my Lord and my Support! Beseemeth it One like Thee to deprive him who hath placed his whole trust in Thee, who hath detached himself from all in the heavens and the earth, and who hath taken refuge in the sovereignty of Thy grace? By Thy glory, O my Beloved! Even shouldst Thou give me all that Thou hast created and shalt create, and make me sovereign over all who dwell in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation, and seat me upon the throne of grandeur and power and the seat of loftiness and independence, yet deny me the sweet fragrances of Thy mercy and the breezes of Thy bounty for less than a moment - by Thy glory, my soul would not be content, my heart would not find peace, and my spirit would find no rest.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee, O my Beloved! How exalted are the stations of Thy sovereign glory, and how abject are the ranks of Thy servant’s lowliness in his love for Thee! How resplendent are the manifestations of Thy wealth, and how evident are the expressions of poverty in Thy servant! By Thy beauty, O my God, my abasement and poverty, then my distress and desperation have reached such a state that abasement itself flees from my abasement, and the very essence of adversity takes flight from my adversity.</p>
<p>Hast Thou decreed, O my God, that the glances of Thine eye of mercy shall never again turn to Thy glory? Hast Thou inscribed, O my Beloved, upon the tablet of Thy preservation that Thou wilt not send upon Thy servant the holy winds of Thy grace? Then would weeping itself weep at my weeping, and the secret of fire would burn from my burning. I know not, O my God, in what thing I might find joy in Thy dominion, or by what matter I might find solace in Thy realm, after my shirt has been stained with my blood through what hath befallen me from the swords of hatred and rancor, and my heart has been pierced by the spears of the people of tyranny and wickedness. They have been made happy by Thy irrevocable decree and Thy destined destiny. Yet with all this, O my Most Exalted God and my Most Glorious Beauty, I have nothing wherewith to occupy myself, or find solace in, or trust in, such that I find myself stripped of every praiseworthy attribute and devoid of every acceptable quality.</p>
<p>O my God! Thou hast not given me a pen wherewith I might write the verses of Thy glorious oneness, nor knowledge whereby I might ascend to the sublime heaven of Thy unity, nor wisdom through which I might soar to the holy precincts of Thy singleness, nor certitude by which I might travel through the realms of Thy divine dominion. I have no heart to comprehend the wonders of the signs of Thy sovereignty, no wings to fly in the atmosphere of Thy oneness, no power to enumerate the manifestations of Thy craftsmanship in the horizons of Thy knowledge and the souls of Thy wisdom, no strength to raise the banners of Thy triumph and victory, no eye to witness the radiance of the lights of Thy beauty, no tongue to mention Thee in the paradise of Thy exaltation, no sense of smell to inhale the fragrance of the garment from the Joseph of Thy mercy, no ear to hear the melodies of the dove of Thy rapture and longing, no hand to grasp the scrolls of Thy unity, and no foot to hasten to the shore of the ocean of Thy nearness and reunion.</p>
<p>Therefore, O my God, what wilt Thou do with this poor one who hath confessed all this against himself, and who, despite this utter destitution, hath arisen before the gate of the city of Thy supreme mercy and arrived at the pavilions of Thy mighty grace? Wilt Thou, O my God, turn him away from Thy gate, from which Thou hast never turned away anyone throughout all eternity? Nay, by Thy glory! Thou wilt not disappoint him of the garment of Thy grace, nor wilt Thou deprive him of the sanctuary of Thy reunion and the shelter of Thy mercy, unless he should seek from Thee aught except Thyself - and this can never be, for Thou wert when naught existed with Thee, and Thou wilt ever be as Thou hast been. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst bring the contingent beings into existence and didst manifest all created things, and through which Thou didst rend asunder the veils from the face of all who are in the heavens and on earth, that Thou mayest cause this poor one and these poor ones who have emigrated with him to enter the city of Thy riches within the pavilion of Thy glory and might. Then assist us with the wonders of Thy help, clothe us in the garment of Thy love, and deprive us not, O my God, of what lieth with Thee - and nothing lieth with Thee save Thyself - and my hope is in none save Thee. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>

<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God and my Beloved! All servants exalt Thee above any other, and all created things sanctify Thee from all else. Yet I, in my powerlessness and poverty, have found none besides Thee from whom to exalt Thee, and have witnessed none except Thee by which to sanctify Thee. By Thy glory, O my God, whenever I have sought other than Thee, I found it naught, and whenever I desired other than Thee, I witnessed it not. And whenever I descend from the most exalted heights to the lowest depths of earth, I find nothing except signs of Thy oneness, tokens of Thy singleness, intimations of Thy lordship, and evidences of Thy self-subsistence, to such extent that were Thou to remove Thy signs from existence, nothing would remain in Thy kingdom and no letter would be witnessed in Thy realm. Thus hast Thou made the night and day as two signs, effacing the sign of night and making the sign of day illuminating, that the sovereignty of Thy power might endure in the dominion of all possibilities, and the lights of Thy countenance might shine forth in the kingdom of all created things. None shall attain to the mystery thereof save him whom Thou hast made to dwell in the kingdom and then made him as a proof of the sun.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou! How mighty is the sovereignty of Thy power which hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them! How resplendent is the dominion of Thy might which hath filled all who dwell in the realm of the divine cloud and all below it! Glorified art Thou, O my God! All existence seeketh Thee yet findeth Thee not, and all [witnesses] witness Thee yet know Thee not, for when they turn to their own stations and conditions apart from Thee, they forget Thee. And when they forget Thee, Thou causest them to forget themselves, as recompense for their deeds. Thus are they veiled from visiting Thy presence, beholding Thy countenance, and gazing upon Thy beauty, and they become of those deprived of meeting Thee, rejected from Thy presence, barred from Thy court, and are among the losers and the remote ones.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I know not by what tongue I should call upon Thee nor by what utterance I should invoke Thee. I know not, O Thou Who art my heart’s desire, how Thou wishest me to describe Thee. Shall I describe Thee by Thyself or mention Thee through another? If Thou desirest to hear Thy description from Thyself - and this is worthy of One like Thee - yet none can do this save those whom Thou hast made repositories of Thy knowledge and treasuries of Thy light. And if Thou desirest to witness Thy description from another - this is impossible for One like Thee, for mention of that which cometh not from Thee befitteth Thee not, nor is worthy of Thee, nor can ascend to the heavens of Thine eternity, nor rise to the sanctuaries of Thine oneness.</p>
<p>Glorified, glorified art Thou! All descriptions fail to reach the court of Thy glory and all attributes cannot attain to the sovereignty of Thy power, for Thou hast not determined for Thyself the true measure of Thy station, nor hast Thou limited Thy countenance to the description of Thy creation. By Thy glory, O Beloved, none can describe Thee and none can mention Thee, for Thou hast not described Thyself save by Thyself, nor characterized Thine Essence save by Thine Essence. Glorified art Thou! I have been among those sincere at Thy gate and those repentant in Thy remembrance.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by him whom Thou hast chosen for the wonders of Thy Cause, fashioned for the ornaments of Thy power, selected for the repositories of Thy mystery, and singled out for the splendors of Thy countenance, that Thou inspire me with what Thou lovest of the comprehensive words of Thy remembrance, clothe me in the garments of Thy pardon, shelter me with the cloaks of Thy loving-kindness, and give me to drink from the cups of Thy forgiveness, for I am Thy servant and am in Thy hand, seeking refuge at Your threshold, taking sanctuary in Your presence, clinging to the sovereignty of Your mercy, and beseeching the King of Your grace. Would You, O my God, distance one whom You reared for Your servitude? Would You, O my Aspiration, forsake one whom You trained for Your service? Would You, O my Hope, deprive one whose eyes await the descent of Your mercy? Would You, O my Lord, deny one whose sight You caused to be fixed upon the manifestation of Your pardon? Far be it from You, nay far be it from You, to cast out whom You have drawn nigh, reject whom You have honored, destroy whom You have quickened, or silence whom You have caused to speak. Glory be unto You! Glory be unto You! You are He Who does what He pleases and ordains what He desires. None can resist Your command or prevent Your deed. There is no God but You, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>I know not, O my God, if You do not wish me to describe You throughout the lands, why then have You inspired me with these words? And if You love that I should mention You among Your servants, why then have You cast me away from all directions? Nay, by Your glory! Rather, You have honored me, even if You have seated me upon a speck of dust, and You have called me, even if You have turned me away from all doors. How mighty is the sovereignty of Your Lordship over me, and how sweet is the dominion of my servitude to You! How exalted are the wonders of Your glory toward me, and how resplendent are the tokens of my abasement before You!</p>
<p>Glory be unto You! I have been foremost among sinners, and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful. Hear my call, for in Your hand is the dominion of all worlds. I bear witness before You, O my God, at this moment when none is with me besides You, that I am a servant who has believed in You, in Your verses sent down from Your presence, and in Your Book dispatched from Your side, such that I have believed in every sign before its appearance and after its setting, and at the time when its beauty shone forth and its light gleamed, submissive to Your command and humble before the sovereignty of Your countenance. I have commanded the servants only what I heard from Your tongue or witnessed in Your Book, lest they differ in Your Cause and spread corruption in Your lands. In all matters I have desired only to spread Your favors and manifest Your knowledge, and I desire naught but to follow Your command and to stand firm upon what the Countenance of Your glory and the King of Your presence has willed, that the fire of Oneness might be kindled from the Tree of Your eternity and the reality of Your Absolute Unity might be proven upon the throne of Your grandeur. Glory be unto You! Glory be unto You! I am among those who remember and worship You, and I say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Dawning-Place from the Horizon of Eternity!</p>
<p>O Husayn! The Wronged One remembers thee on this night wherein were revealed the verses of thy Lord, by which every atom proclaimed the praise of God, the Lord of Names and Attributes. Verily thy Lord is the All-Informing, the All-Knowing. We bear witness that thou hast believed in God and turned toward the Supreme Horizon when those who denied God, the Lord of the worlds, turned away from it. Thou didst turn by Our leave and didst traverse land and sea until thou didst attain unto this Great Prison. Thou didst seek the ultimate goal and the highest aim until thou didst stand before the Gate and didst hear the call of the Wronged One when He was in the hands of the heedless. Blessed be thine ear for what it heard and thine eye for what it beheld of this luminous Horizon. Thou didst attain, didst hear, didst visit, and didst return by His leave. Verily He is the Commander, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to My loved ones in all lands, then remind them that I have mentioned their names in this mighty and impregnable spot. Say: O loved ones of the All-Merciful in all lands! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One from this Prison, whereat the Concourse on High and the dwellers of Paradise have lamented, yet most of the people are among the heedless.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qablih-Husayn! Hear thou in the Persian tongue the call of the Wronged One, that perchance the friends of Truth might drink from the Kawthar of utterance and be found steadfast and firm in the Cause of the Beloved. Say: O friends! The world hath never had, nor hath it now, any constancy, for its changes and transformations have been witnessed at all times. They who possess pure vision and behold the Most Great Scene pay no heed to its diverse colors. They fix their gaze upon the Truth and cling fast unto Him. God willing, may all be gathered under one word and arise to teach the Cause of the Beloved of the worlds, and in all conditions remain within the bounds of wisdom. This is a word that hath been revealed in God’s Book time and again. God willing, they should manifest themselves with goodly character and pure deeds. By the Sun of the horizon of certitude! Discord, contention and strife lead to the wastage of the Cause, while teaching the Cause with joy and fragrance leadeth to its exaltation. Let them abandon their own will and desire and hold fast unto the Will and Desire of God. This is the greatest means for the salvation of the world and the preservation of nations. Blessed is the soul that hath heard the divine call and tasted its sweetness. Most people have recited and read the Furqan, which distinguisheth truth from falsehood, throughout ages and centuries, yet having not found the sweetness of the All-Merciful’s utterance, they remained deprived of its mysteries and meanings.</p>
<p>Say: O friends of God! This is the day of steadfastness and firmness. Ye must rend asunder the veils of idle fancy through the power of the Lord of Names and manifest such steadfastness in God’s Cause that none may find occasion to turn away or object. Shatter the idol of vain imaginings and the false deity of conjecture by the name of your Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. Say: Glorified art Thou, O Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen! Thou art He at Whose separation the hearts of them that are nigh unto Thee among Thy servants were consumed, and at Whose remoteness rose up the sighs of the sincere ones among Thy bondsmen. Thou art He Who manifested Thyself and called out with Thy most sweet call betwixt earth and heaven, summoning all unto the Dayspring of Thy revelation, the Dawning-Place of Thine inspiration, and the Source of Thy Cause. Among the people are those who heard and hastened unto the ocean of Thy grace, and those who heard and turned away, and those who were seized with such doubts as to be prevented from hearkening unto the verses of Thy grandeur and were kept back from the paths of Thy glory and nearness. O my Lord! I testify to that whereunto Thou didst testify before the creation of the heavens and earth, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Thou hast ever been sanctified above the mention of all created things and the praise of all possible things. From all eternity Thou hast been one God, single, peerless, unique, independent, exalted above the praise of Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones, and sanctified from the mention of Thy Messengers and Thy trustees. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, seeking the gate of Thy bounty, the heaven of Thy generosity, and the ocean of Thy grace. O Lord! I am the poor and hopeful one, and Thou art the All-Giving, the Generous. I am the weak and lowly one, and Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, the Trustworthy. I beseech Thee by Thy most exalted Self, and by the Most Great Word, and by Thy most beautiful Names and Thy most sublime Attributes, that Thou write down for me with Thy Most Exalted Pen what Thou hast written for those who have heard Thy call, who were attracted by Thy verses, who sought refuge in Thy presence, and who clung to the cord of Thy favors. Ordain for me, O God of the world and Beloved of the nations, that which will profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Thou knowest what is within my soul and seest what is in my heart. O Lord! I am the ignorant, the heedless one who hath clung to Thy all-encompassing knowledge and Thy great bounty and the mercy that hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. Then I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Kingdom and the mysteries of Thy Dominion to ordain for Thy servants that which will draw them nigh unto Thee, inspire them with Thy remembrance and praise, and give them to drink of the Kawthar of Thy knowledge and the Salsabil of Thy utterance. Verily Thou art He Whom nothing can frustrate and no affair can hinder. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy power and sovereignty, and Thou ordainest what Thou pleasest through Thy command and might. There is no God but Thee, the All-Giving, the Munificent, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name to send down from the clouds of Thy bounty that which will purify me and Thy servants from the doubts of the enemies of Thy Self and from what they have wrought in Thy days. Then forgive, O my God, those who have raised their hands to the heaven of Thy generosity and have turned to the horizon of Thy grace and hastened to the sun of Thy forgiveness and clung to the hem of the robe of Thy favors and gifts and drawn nigh unto the ocean of Thy bestowal. Verily Thou art the Pardoner, the Generous. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who is unique in His grandeur, singular in His call, and exalted through the Name that is the Sovereign of all names. Verily He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but He, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And praise be to God Who hath sent down the Book and adorned it with verses of commandments and laws that the peoples might benefit therefrom, they who have cast away vain imaginings and turned to the horizon whence shone forth the sun of the knowledge of our Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Verily He hath desired naught from all that hath appeared except to manifest His generosity, His grace and His bounty to His servants. He, verily, is the Bestower, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter reached this servant, and I read what was therein and presented it before the Throne, offering it unto God, the Mighty, the All-Wise. I beseech God to assist thee and to raise up others like thee who shall acknowledge that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath acknowledged amongst the nations. He, verily, is the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>This ephemeral one makes mention that thy letter arrived and brought boundless joy, for the sweet savors of the love of the All-Merciful were inhaled therefrom. God willing, thou shalt at all times be assisted through the confirmations of the All-Merciful Lord and be engaged in the remembrance and utterance of the True Sovereign. The supplication thou didst present to the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court was offered, and forthwith a Tablet was revealed from the heaven of God’s Will and sent forth. God willing, thou shalt attain unto its presence and be perfumed with its fragrances.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention regarding the Huququ’llah, writing that a certain one possesseth both cash and property, and while the Huququ’llah on the cash is clear, the property is in a place where none will purchase it so that the Huququ’llah might be separated from it, and if he wished to pay from the cash it would not suffice, and the individual himself would lose his livelihood, and the property yields no rent - in such case what is required? The decree of God is that property from which no profit is derived, that is, from which no benefit is obtained, no Huququ’llah is payable thereon. He, verily, is the Ruler, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention regarding the name Ibn, there is no objection, but outwardly he should be named after the manifest name ’Abbas, the Most Great Branch of God - may my spirit and my very being be offered up for the dust of His footsteps.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write regarding Aqa ’Ali-Akbar who hath ascended unto God, it was presented, and the word of forgiveness was manifested from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful’s utterance regarding him. Blessed is he in that he attained unto mention during his lifetime and unto God’s forgiveness and mercy after his passing and ascension.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write regarding Aqa Muhammad-’Ali, mention of him was made in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. A brief prayer was revealed from the heaven of divine Will and was sent. Let him recite it. This is what God hath revealed from the heaven of Will and Purpose:</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great</p>
<p>Say: Glory be unto Thee, O God, Lord of all things and Creator of names! I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou didst shatter the idols and dispel all vain imaginings, to immerse me in the ocean of certitude, O Lord of all religions. My Lord! Aid me in that which Thou hast willed through Thy sovereignty and revealed in Thy perspicuous Book. My Lord! This is a day wherein the pages of contingent being and the Books which Thou didst reveal unto Thy Messengers and chosen ones have been adorned. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me the outpourings of the ocean of Thy grace, nor to shut me out from the door which Thou hast opened unto all who are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth. My Lord! I am weak and have clung to Thy Name, the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Ordain for me from Thy bounty that which shall profit me in this world and the next. Verily, Thou art the Giving, the Bountiful, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>God willing, may they become blessed and confirmed through the reading of these exalted and blessed words which have appeared from the Dayspring of the Divine Will.</p>
<p>Furthermore, convey greetings on behalf of this poor and lowly one to all those souls in that land and in the land of N and R who have drunk from the Divine Chalice and are gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon. O friends! O ye who drink the choice wine of the mercy of the All-Merciful! This is a great day. Great is its worth, great is its station, and great indeed is that which transpireth therein. Ye must regard the vain imaginings of the heedless souls and the suppositions of the idolatrous forms as null and void, and drink at all times from the Salsabil of certitude in the name of the Lord of the Day of Judgment. The tongue was created for this day, and the eye came into being from the realm of nothingness for this blessed day. By the life of God! This is the day of ears and hearts, that they might see and speak and hear and preserve in the treasury. Say: Strive, that ye may not remain deprived of the bounteous grace on such a day as this. Although, praise be to God, in that garden the flowers of inner meanings have bloomed in the name of the Eternal Beloved and the blossoms of utterance have appeared in the name of the Desired One of all things, yet God willing, may their fire be seen as ever more enkindled and their light more manifest at all times through the influence of the Divine Word. This evanescent servant beseecheth the true Sovereign to preserve those flowers of love from poisonous winds and cold blasts, that they may ever remain smiling with perfect freshness and delicacy. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Bountiful. Glory be upon you and upon those who are with you and upon those who have attained unto the recognition of God and are assured of His presence, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath ordained traditions and established laws openly, and made their source the Essence of existence and His Book sent down to him who was invested with the mantle of divine presence, through whom the mention of prophethood was sealed and there began that which draweth men nigh unto the Lord of creation. And the prayer rising from the horizon of the will of our Lord, the All-Merciful, be upon him and his family and his companions who turned toward the House and circled round it and entered through its gate. They are the emblems of victory and the standards of the Cause. Through them was the edifice of divine knowledge made firm in the contingent world and the light of the Cause shone forth amidst the concourse of religions. Blessed is he who hath heard their words and found solace in their company and clung to their hem and held fast to that which they possessed. And woe unto him who was heedless and turned away and denied.</p>
<p>Verily doth the servant, throughout the nights and days, beseech God to exalt His religion and manifest His proof even as He manifested it aforetime, and to honor His loved ones and chosen ones after the abasement which caused the dwellers of Paradise and the denizens of the retreats of nearness to lament. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the servant attained unto your letter which began with the mention of God, our Goal and your Goal, our Object of worship and your Object of worship, and the Object of worship of all who are in the heavens and on earth. When I received it and read it and understood it, I hastened to the place of circumambulation and presented that which you had uttered by the tongue of your Lord. Then He spoke, and His sweetest utterance was: “O thou who art present before the Countenance! The Wronged One hath heard that which the tongue of love hath spoken in the kingdom of creation. Blessed is he who revealed it and he who read it and he who heard it and he who sent it. O Yahya! The Wronged One remembereth thee and remembereth His loved ones there who were beneath the glances of His grace. We send Our greetings from this station to them and to My loved ones and friends in the land of Sad and other regions. And We remember and send Our greetings to the people of the House, and We beseech God to draw them nigh unto Him in all conditions and to provide them with the best of beginnings and endings, and to ordain for them the Kawthar of reunion. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth through His word ‘Be’ and it is. There is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God! Divine favors have been and are bestowed upon them. His grace hath encompassed them and His mercy hath preceded them. All that hath been manifested concerning them is a speaking witness and a truthful testimony. This ephemeral one offereth greetings and glorification to each one of them.</p>
<p>Concerning what the honored Leaf - that is, the esteemed sister, upon her be Baha’u’llah’s glory - had written requesting mention of them in the Most Holy Presence: On Monday morning, the twentieth of the revered month of Sha’ban, this servant was present before Him and submitted mention of them. He expressed such loving-kindness toward them and all the household members, both female and male, that this servant is incapable of describing it. God is witness that such utterances were revealed that were they to be cast upon a mountain it would crumble from longing, were they upon the seas they would surge, and were they upon hearts they would melt. God willing, may they be joyous in all conditions and remain engaged in the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory. And concerning their expression of regret at not receiving the missive from the household members, upon them be His most glorious splendor: their missive, at the time of departure from the first location, attained the utmost bounty. The humility of the honored sister, upon her be the glory of God and His loving-kindness, is considered as a goodly deed. One sigh in separation from God, exalted be His glory, can rend asunder a hundred thousand veils and reach the ultimate station. Blessed be the sigh and the grief that appear and manifest in His path. In any case, their deeds were presented and accepted. Happy are they, and the subsequent missive will also, God willing, attain to a glory unprecedented.</p>
<p>Concerning their mention of Aqa Mirza Fadlu’llah and Aqa Muhammad Hasan, upon them be the glory of God, and their degrees of longing: praise be to God, they have inhaled the fragrances of loving-kindness and attained to mention. Blessed be they both.</p>
<p>Concerning their mention of the esteemed aunt, upon her be the glory of God, and her purpose: it was presented and He said: “Our Lord! Forgive me and those who have appeared before the Countenance and her and her sister’s son.” This ended. This is a great glad-tiding. God willing, may all attain the robe of forgiveness. We continually beseech this from God, exalted be His glory, and it will surely be adorned with the honor of acceptance. With the All-Bountiful, no matter or deed is difficult. All affairs are within His mighty grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>To the gentlemen who are present in that land, I convey greetings and glorification to all, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to gather all once again beneath the shade of the Tree. These days are the celebration of one of the Most Exalted Names - everyone’s place is empty, but this servant, in lieu of congratulations, is engaged in praise and glorification in the Most Exalted Place of Security, and on behalf of those gentlemen offers congratulations and felicitations, and sometimes on their behalf, if sweets come his way, partakes of them, for He has said that our celebrations are now like the celebrations of the angels of heaven - meaning the outward means are absent as they are, but praise be to God, the true good endureth with the endurance of the Kingdom. Peace be upon you and upon God’s righteous, sincere, and unified servants, and the mercy of God and His blessings.</p>

<p>O Mahdi! In the name of the one peerless God. O Mahdi! These are grievous days when all the spirits of the worlds are in trembling and perturbation, until the breeze of gracious favor seizes whom it will and grants them dwelling in the loftiest chambers on high, and until the winds of justice pass over whom they will, consigning them to the lowest depths of hell. All this proceedeth from the command of thy Lord Who doeth as He pleaseth and shall not be asked of His doings. But today thou must be accounted among those companions who are not barred by any allusion from the holy gardens of the Divine Unity, nor deprived by any expression from the sublime and glorious Paradise. Although the hand of divine grace doth openly and secretly nurture His servants that they may behold all who are in the world within the grasp of God’s power, in such wise that they are not excluded by any bond nor deprived by any counsel. Even as thou hast observed that after the widespread acceptance among all the servants of the Quranic references concerning the Promised Qa’im and His appearance in Jabulqa and Jabulsa, as well as the mention of the Seal of the Prophets which was the explicit text of the Book, God created servants who rent asunder all these references and evidences and the veil of clear text that was recorded in the Quran. Now ponder a little how it came to pass that despite all these explicit recorded texts, servants were created who acknowledged that there hath been a Prophet from a beginning that had no beginning and will be unto an end that hath no end. O Mahdi! Take wing and become light as a spirit, unburdened by all else but God, that thou mayest be enabled to traverse the realms of eternity and its holy gardens, until thou becomest aware of mysteries that none hath known and of which not a letter hath been discovered. That which in these days hath been and shall be beloved before God, the Lord of earth and heaven, above all else, is the unity of sanctified souls to such degree that no distinction can be perceived or observed between them. For the enemies have set out to turn the people back to the first step, even as thou hast observed in the Quranic Dispensation how they nurtured all in mere delusion, such that they preferred darkness to light and were content with dust rather than the Lord of Lords. Moreover they have intended to cut off the root of the Tree and its branches, and to demolish the House of Unity and its pillars. They have been content with an imaginary remembrance of the Truth for the sake of their leadership and the promotion of their names among the servants. To turn away from such persons hath been and shall ever be the nearest path to God’s good pleasure, for their influence is like a penetrating poison, save for those who possess the antidote of the name of their Lord, the Most High, Who hath been and shall ever be, without change or alteration, and who perceive and inhale the fragrances of Truth from every direction. This is of God’s grace upon him.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Beware that thou fix not thy gaze upon the world and turn away from its people, except from those in whose hearts thou findest love for thy Lord. Exert mighty endeavors and sublime efforts that perchance thou mayest cause some souls to become mindful through the remembrance of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, for in this day all are worshipping and prostrating before mere vain imaginings, and at every moment they devise new schemes that they might cast some hatred against this servant into the hearts of men. Thus doth the Pen of thy Lord teach thee that thou mayest be of those who are well-informed. Move in perfect unity with the loved ones, in such wise that discord may be utterly removed. His honor Ism-i-Munib is journeying to those parts. You and Mirza Mahdi must show him utmost consideration. Concerning him, naught but mighty and sublime words have been revealed from the holy precincts, and the innate fragrances, according to his capacity, are wafting and passing through him. We hope that ye may walk in the purified land and be seated and abide upon the most holy and most exalted throne in the sacred paradise. Move with utmost tranquility and remember with utmost love. Let no sorrow overtake thee. In every breath be other than thy former self, and with every step advance beyond thy previous step, that thou mayest be occupied at all times in purifying and sanctifying thyself. This is the mystery of that utterance which sayeth that man should record his deeds each day and present them at the next Manifestation. The purpose of this statement is man’s awareness of his own deeds, that perchance he may become conscious and turn from evil to good, and from the remoteness of doubt to the nearness of certitude. And peace be upon him who recognizeth the truth through truth and through that which appeareth from His presence, and who is detached from all the worlds. My purpose in these utterances hath been and is naught but the purification of illumined souls. Otherwise, by Him Who holdeth the reins of existence in His grasp, I have ever wished to dwell in a place where no one’s hand could reach this hem which is purified from all hands - as indeed came to pass, and now I sit alone in My house, having chosen seclusion from all. Thus hath the breeze of holiness wafted upon thee from this Pen that thou mayest find peace in thyself and be of them that are tranquil, steadfast, and faithful. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Mahdi! The tablet thou didst send, which bore witness to the gems of submission and resignation and bespoke the sorrow and grief of thy heart, was presented at the Most Holy and Supreme Threshold and was seized by the grasp of the power of “He doeth whatsoever He willeth” and was observed by the Most Holy, Most Impregnable, Most Exalted, Most High glances. Well is it with thee and with what thou hast drunk from the chalice of recognition. Strive then to be among those who are firmly established.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! The successive outpourings of the favors of the Lord of Names and Attributes have been uninterrupted, and the fragrant breezes of glorious divine gifts have been ceaselessly wafted. Strange it is that despite recognition of the Beauty of the All-Glorious - which is the supreme divine gift and the greatest bounty of the Sovereign of transcendent might - thou art nevertheless distressed and sorrowful.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Cast off the garment of sorrow and adorn thy inner and outer being with the robe of joy. Although a grief hath encompassed the Beauty of the Lord of all worlds such that were a single word thereof to be cast upon all created things or revealed to all beings, thou wouldst find them all thunderstruck and bewildered. For this Divine Beauty hath, for twenty-two years, successively and continuously cast the verses of triumph upon all existing things and hath fortified the pillars of His Cause with the iron of His Own triumph, such that His dominion is manifest over all the worlds and His sovereignty encompasseth all possibility.</p>
<p>Then came the departure from Iraq. Surely thou hast heard how the Luminary of the horizons shed His radiance upon all the world. By God! No soul was seen but it became submissive, and no tongue was observed but it was rendered speechless before the All-Merciful. And in such wise did the Sun of utterance shine forth from the horizon of the words of the All-Glorious in every dwelling place and spot that it illumined and enlightened all who dwell in creation with the wondrous rays of its dawning light, save those who veiled themselves and allowed their own desires to come between them and their Lord, until the establishment of the throne of the All-Merciful ended in this land of Paran.</p>
<p>What more can be said of the envy and hatred of the people of tyranny and iniquity, who have at all times inflicted that which the ear is powerless to hear and the heart is far too feeble to comprehend? I complain of my grief and sorrow unto God. And now the King of eternity hath retired to the house of concealment, withholding His gaze entirely from beholding mankind and keeping His countenance pure from the sight of the people. Yet the enemies desist not from their hypocrisy, displaying at every moment strange new artifices.</p>
<p>In these utterances no purpose is intended save that thou mayest be informed of these wondrous matters and the griefs that have been visited upon Us, and that thou mayest not find thyself sorrowful except for the sorrow of this wronged Being. Therefore do all eyes weep for my loneliness and all hearts burn for my oppression.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Today, forget thyself and arise to make mention of the Truth. Be enkindled by this divine Fire which blazeth and surgeth forth in the Tree of these words, that perchance through the warmth of thy heart souls may pass from the north of coldness to the right hand of warmth, and may appear and become manifest like divine lamps of love between earth and heaven. For today no soul possesseth aught for another, and all who are in the heavens and on earth stand at the station of heedlessness, until such time as one may be blessed to purify the ear of his heart from transient melodies and become honored and blessed to hearken unto divine words.</p>
<p>Today the most important of all matters has been and shall be unity with the loved ones who have drunk from the holy cup of Baha and have settled upon the crimson ark that saileth upon the Most Holy Sea. Walk ye together in perfect fellowship and unity, for through this unity the mighty Cause of the Lord of creation shall become manifest and the foundations of the tyrannical souls shall be demolished and destroyed.</p>
<p>His honor Ism-i-Munib hath intended to go to the City of God. Thou must walk and associate with him in perfect love, in such wise that the fragrances of love may waft and the winds of discord may be utterly cut off and prevented. Assuredly exert your utmost effort in these mentioned matters, and this is a command than which no command in creation can equal it. Therefore act according to what thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, hath commanded thee.</p>
<p>In previous Tablets it was mentioned that your being in that land had a wisdom from thy Lord, the Chosen One, and now some of it hath become manifest. Surely you have noticed this and the rest shall also become manifest. For this reason be thou neither grieved nor sorrowful. I swear by the One Holy Being that complete love hath been and shall be for thee, and thy residence in that city was due to the divine decrees and destined events. Soon thou shalt know and become of […] and shall discover the wisdom of thy Ancient Lord. Likewise, perfect unity with Aqa Siyyid Mahdi is beloved, and also with the rest of the loved ones and companions, as was mentioned, except for him who hath gone forth from the fortress of his Lord - for him there is no mention nor existence, and he is of them that are as nothing.</p>

<p>These are the verses of God which have been sent down in truth, and verily they are a manifest Book. He hath made them a proof from Him and a remembrance for all the worlds. By them have the measures of the Cause been determined and every wise matter distinguished. He hath made them an enduring testimony for all who are in the heavens and on earth - none shall deny them save every heedless and remote one. Verily they are the living waters whereby the hearts of all created things are quickened. They are the Kawthar of the All-Merciful - whoso drinketh thereof shall never thirst. Blessed are they that drink! By them God distinguished between truth and falsehood, light and darkness in centuries past, and will continue to distinguish thereby unto the end that hath no end. Thus hath the matter been decreed upon tablets of sublime glory.</p>
<p>O servant! Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the direction of thy Lord’s throne, the Most High, the Most Great - that there is no God but Him. He created all things for the knowledge of His Own Self, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. He sent to every city a Messenger from His presence to bring them glad tidings of God’s good-pleasure and draw them nigh unto the seat of security, the holy and exalted sanctuary. Among the people were those who were guided by God’s guidance, attained His presence, and drank from the hands of submission the pure water of life, and were of the assured ones. And among them were those who turned away and denied God’s signs, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>The centuries passed until they culminated in the Lord of Days, the day whereon the Sun of the Bayan shone forth from the horizon of the All-Merciful and the Beauty of the All-Glorious appeared with a mighty name. Then did all arise in opposition. Among them were those who said: “This is naught but a man who hath forged a lie against God, the Ancient of Days.” And among them were those who said he was possessed, as did one of the divines declare in My presence - and We are witness to this. And among them were those who said: “He speaketh not from his innate nature, but hath stolen God’s words and combined them with his own words.” And by what issued from their mouths, the eyes of grandeur wept, while they remained seated in their places, rejoicing. […]</p>
<p>When the appointed months and numbered years had elapsed, the heaven of destiny was rent asunder, and the Beauty of the Most High came with the truth upon the clouds of names, clothed in another garment. Thereupon they rose up in hypocrisy against this Light shining from the horizon, broke the Covenant, disbelieved in Him, warred against His person, disputed His verses, denied His evidence, and were numbered among the idolaters until they arose to slay Him. Such was the condition of these heedless ones. When they found themselves powerless to achieve this, they resorted to craftiness and in every season they bring forth a new plot to destroy thereby the Cause of God. Say: Woe unto you! By God, thereby you destroy yourselves, and verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is independent of all worlds. Nothing can add to Him nor can any decree diminish Him. If you believe, it is for your own sake, and if you disbelieve, it returns unto you, and His hem is sanctified from the defilement of the idolaters. O servant who believeth in God! By God, were I to recount to thee what hath befallen Me, souls and minds could not bear it, and God is witness to this. As for thee, guard thyself and follow not these people, and be of those who ponder the Cause of thy Lord. Know thy Lord by His own Self, not by aught else, for naught else will suffice thee in any way, and all things bear witness to this, if thou art of them that hear. Come forth from behind the veil by thy Lord’s leave, the Mighty, the Bestower. Then take the chalice of immortality in the name of thy Lord, the Most High, between earth and heaven. Then drink thereof and be not of the patient ones. By God, at the moment the cup toucheth thy lips, the Concourse on High will exclaim, “Happy art thou, O servant who hath believed in God!”, and the denizens of the cities of eternity will cry, “Joy be to thee, O thou who drinketh from the cup of His love!”, and the Tongue of Grandeur will proclaim, “Glad tidings to thee, O servant, for thou hast attained unto that which none have attained save those who have detached themselves from all that is in the heavens and the earth and were of them that are detached.” Thus have We inspired thee and taught thee that thou mightest rejoice within thyself and follow the command of thy Master, the Ancient of Days. And glory be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>

<p>In the name of God, transcendent is His glory, His grandeur and His power!</p>
<p>Praise be unto the Creator of the world and befitting unto the Sustainer of all nations, Who in His consummate wisdom hath bestowed upon every soul a gift and granted unto each a portion that can neither increase nor diminish. His ordainment cannot be altered by the world of destinies, nor can it find a way unto Him. He is the Sovereign Who hath adorned the world through the hosts of justice and equity. Intelligence is the first interpreter, and from it justice is made manifest, and through justice are ordered the affairs of nations. Blessed is the soul that hath been adorned with the ornament of justice and illumined with the light of intelligence. This raiment is, in the first degree, the most excellent adornment for the temples of kings. Should they achieve it, they shall attain unto all good, and should they be deprived thereof, they are not worthy of mention. The Manifestation and Revealer of justice and intelligence is the Sovereign of existence and the King of the Divine purpose - namely, the Seal of the Prophets, may my spirit be a sacrifice for all who were at the beginning and at the end. He is the representative of the Truth, and He is the manifestation of the most beautiful names and most exalted attributes. Upon Him be blessings and peace, and upon His family and companions, the conqueror of lands and guide of servants.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by the lights of the Sun of intelligence and justice to protect Thy monotheistic servants from the evil of the polytheists who have broken Thy Covenant, denied Thy signs, and surrounded Thy cities and habitations. O Lord! Aid Thy loved ones to obey Thy Cause and to submit to the manifestations of Thy commandments and ordinances. O Lord! Withhold them not from the ocean of Thy good-pleasure, then ordain for them through Thy bounty that which will draw them nigh unto Thee. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Prophets and Thy chosen ones to inscribe for Thy monotheistic servants, with Thy Most Exalted Pen, the good of all worlds among Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>To continue: thy letter hath been received. Praise be to God, it brought tidings of thine health and well-being. After experiencing joy, delight and gladness, I approached the Presence and attained the honor of hearing these words from our Lord - may our souls be a sacrifice for Him:</p>
<p>“O ‘Ali-Akbar! We beseech the Lord of Destiny and the Sovereign of mankind to aid thee in whatsoever is pleasing unto Him. In the early days We established rules and principles for the assembled souls, that all might attain, through God’s grace, to His manifest and hidden bounties. All this was done with the permission and leave of this Wronged One - some in Alif and Sin, others in Ba and Ya, and in Haifa and ’Akka, and Nun and Sad - that all might attain, through God’s grace and mutual assistance, to the good things recorded in the Book and the bounties ordained in His knowledge. The purpose was that they might be occupied and enjoy the bounties of these few earthly days, while beseeching God - exalted be His glory - night and day for the salvation of all on earth, that perchance through the grace of the sincere ones and the monotheists the fire of envy and hatred might be extinguished and all might gather as one soul beneath the shade of the Tree of Divine Unity. Let them likewise supplicate and beseech the true Omnipotent One that the banner of peace and security might once again be raised aloft and the light of the words ’There is none other God but Him’ might illumine the world. All the friends of God must strive for the reformation of the world. If outward means are cut off, they must hold fast to spiritual means through humility and supplication. God is powerful and generous, His Will encompasseth all things and His decree prevaileth. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>“For thee and for him who hath ascended to the Supreme Companion, that land - namely the land of Nazareth - hath been designated. By no means relinquish it. Engage thyself therein, placing thy trust in God. We beseech Him to bestow His blessing and withhold not His bounty. This Wronged One hath never in His lifetime considered His own interests; whatsoever He hath uttered hath been for the good of His loved ones. Blessed is the servant who hath attained, the ear that hath heard, and the eye that hath seen. Under all conditions, remain mindful of the remembrance of God and act according to that which hath been revealed in the Book. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Merciful.” [End]</p>
<p>Praise be to God! Through His bounty thou hast attained, and in His prison what hath issued from the blessed Tongue shall enable thee to attain the outpourings of the True Bestower of abundance. Of this there is no doubt. O honored brother! We must seek divine confirmation from the Truth that we may act in accordance with that which exalteth the Word of Unity. From the recompense of thirteen hundred years’ deeds hath weakness resulted. Had our deeds been worthy of the court of the Self-Sufficient, the Supreme, assuredly the might of polytheism would not have seized us, nor would we have been afflicted with countless trials. Thou and this servant and all the friends must turn unto Him and seek deliverance from Him, that perchance His all-encompassing forgiveness may reach us and His mighty grace may grant salvation. He is the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful. Convey greetings from this evanescent one to the friends in that land. All are remembered. For some time no word hath come from the honored master Sabri Efendi, upon him be God’s peace. God willing, may he be confirmed and assisted, and may He cause his affairs to proceed according to what He loveth and desireth. Likewise do I send greetings to the honored friend Aqa Muhammad-Rida, upon him be God’s peace, and to the others, and I beseech from the Truth the protection of all. Verily He hath power over all things and is worthy to answer prayers. Peace be upon you and upon God’s sincere servants.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise be worthy of the Lord of the unseen and the visible, Who through His complete power created man and made him the manifestation of His names and attributes. Exalted is He Who made him the dawning-place of His signs, the manifestation of His evidences, the dayspring of His revelation and the source of His command. He is the Most Great Talisman in the world. The “man” who is here mentioned refers, in its primary degree, to the Seal of the Prophets - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake. He is the manifestation of the words “He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden.” He is the Primal Point from which all the books of the world have been derived and elaborated. He is the true Most Great Sign and the spiritual Farthest Mosque. He is the Kaaba of God among creation and the Frequented Fane amidst His servants. Whosoever acknowledges His mission and grandeur and greatness - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - his acknowledgment of all God’s Messengers is confirmed and established. Blessed are the people who turned to Him, who drank from the ocean of His bounty, and who acted according to His bidding. The claim of every pretender in this regard has not been and will not be accepted. The servant beseecheth His Lord to open the eyes of those who have turned away from His straight path and cast the Cause of God behind their backs, taking that which every ignorant doubter hath uttered. And prayers and peace be upon Him and His family and companions throughout the duration of the earthly and heavenly kingdoms.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world and the Beloved of the nations! I beseech Thee by the treasuries of Thy knowledge and the repositories of Thy wisdom and that which was hidden in Thy Name, to acquaint Thy servants with that which they have neglected and draw them nigh unto a station wherein they will behold Thy manifestation, Thy power, Thy might and Thy sovereignty. O my Lord! Vain imaginings have kept them away from the ocean of Thy nearness, and idle fancies have withheld them from the heaven of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee by the steadfastness of Thy chosen ones and Thy pure ones, and by the tears of them that are in love with Thee and yearn for Thee, to assist all to achieve what Thou hast willed through Thy sovereignty. Verily Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Thereafter, it is submitted that your letter, time and again, brought joy and recalled the days of reunion. It is a messenger sanctified from provisions and supplies and free from toil and hardship. In truth it is a spiritual courier and a luminous herald, especially when it proceeds from one who is adorned with the ornament of the love of God, glorified be His majesty, and whose heart is sanctified from the dust of the world. In any case, after being presented before His presence, He said: “God willing, may they be successful and assisted in all conditions in that which is loved by God.”</p>
<p>Today is the day when all must hold fast to the cord of wisdom, for the false one appears in the guise of the truthful, and the treacherous in the name of the trustworthy. Beseech ye God to protect all from the evil of malicious, atheistic, false, and treacherous souls. Verily He is the Protector of those who place their hopes in Him. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Peace, mercy and glory be upon thee and thy family and My loved ones in that place and upon every assured and steadfast believer.</p>
<p>Regarding what was mentioned about Abdullah Ansari, upon whom be God’s mercy, and his words - this matter was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and He said: “O Abdullah! From the mention of that word, it became evident that you perceived the sweetness of the Divine Call. Now reflect upon the stations of those souls who hear this word from the tongue of the Manifestation Himself, and beseech God that all may attain to the recognition of this Most Exalted and Most Glorious Station. Verily, He speaks that which guides the people to His mighty and impregnable Kingdom.” After delay and postponement, this evanescent servant was enabled to present this response and send it forth. This is naught but the result of the attention and prayers of the friends of God, exalted be His glory. This servant submits that mention has been and continues to be made of you and the friends of God in the Most Holy Court. God willing, may all succeed in preserving their stations. In truth, this response was greatly delayed, but this matter was due to wisdom. Today, this evanescent servant and all friends are commanded to observe wisdom, lest the clamor of every heedless and remote one be raised. God willing, may you eternally partake of the choice wine of divine love and the Kawthar of the All-Merciful’s utterance, and with utmost joy and fragrance remain occupied with the mention and praise of God, exalted be His glory. Verily, He is the Protector of those who remember Him, the Guardian of those who are steadfast, the Friend of those who are firm, the Helper of those who are patient, and the Supporter of those who act. Praise be to Him, for He is the Lord of all worlds. I request that you convey greetings and salutations on behalf of this ephemeral one to the friends in that land who have drunk of the sealed wine and who are gazing toward the Supreme Horizon. Praise be to God, mention of the friends of that land has been and continues to be made among the Concourse on High and the denizens of Paradise. Blessed is the soul who does not lose this station due to vain imaginings and the affairs of this transient world, and who, through the Name of God, exalted be His glory, succeeds in preserving it. Their call is continuously raised without interruption. Many matters are now veiled due to the weakness of the servants, but God will reveal what He wishes. Verily, He does not allow the reward of the doers of good to be lost. There has befallen you in the path of God that which has been recorded in the Books, Tablets and Scriptures. Blessed are you, O friends of God, and joy and felicity be upon you. Glory be upon you, and the Spirit be upon you, and the mercy of God and His blessings.</p>

<p>Praise, sanctified above all expressions and meanings, befitteth the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Sublime Court of Him Who is the Beloved, Who, with one word, seized hold of the world of being and, with another, adorned all things with the ornament of existence. Verily, He is God, the Single, the One, the Alone, the Self-Subsisting. Neither the conditions of the world nor the doubts of men can frustrate Him. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>To continue: thy letter, which was adorned with the handwriting of him who circulateth throughout the land by God’s command, truly brought joy and increased gladness. We beseech God, the Powerful, the Ancient, to transform this gladness into a carpet whereon all His loved ones and chosen ones may gather in perfect fellowship, unity, love and harmony, that all may raise one call and move with one motion, and that this servant may be engaged in serving them all.</p>
<p>After becoming apprised of the contents of the letter, I turned towards the Beloved of the worlds and the Goal of them that have recognized Him. When I entered His presence and laid the matter before Him, thereupon the Tongue of the All-Merciful spoke in the Kingdom of Utterance, and His exalted Word was this: “O Muhammad-Hasan! We called thee after We created thee, made thee known after We manifested thee, and aided thee until thou didst attain to a station which God hath made the point round which circle the Concourse on High and all who dwell in the Kingdom of Names. Then did We cause thee to hear My Most Exalted Word and showed thee the lights of My countenance after the extinction of all things, and gave thee to drink of the Kawthar of life from the hand of My bounty. Give thanks unto God for this favor wherewith nothing that hearts and minds can comprehend can compare.”</p>
<p>Reflect upon God’s grace and His bounty, that thou mayest become aware of the lights of the Sun of grace and the ocean of His bounty. By My life! If thou wert to become aware, thou wouldst continue to cry out “Thine is the praise, O God of the worlds!” until the time of thine ascension. This utterance was in thy letter which the servant present laid before Him - thy words: “Since the time I was dismissed from the honor of attaining Thy presence, no token of bounty hath been shown to this evanescent one.” To speak thus in the face of the ocean of God’s bounty was not and is not permissible. Even if thou wert to praise the Beloved of all possibility with a hundred thousand tongues, it would still be little and insignificant compared to this supreme bounty and magnificent gift. The whole world was brought from the concealment of nothingness into being for this Day. How many divines, mystics and saints beseeched God, the Exalted, for the privilege of attaining unto this Day, yet when it appeared and shone forth, all remained veiled. But thou, through God’s grace, bounty, mercy, generosity and favor, wert aided and didst attain thereunto. Thus doth My Most Exalted Pen testify, and thus doth the Tongue of Grandeur speak in its mighty prison.</p>
<p>From this station We send Our greetings to the faces of My loved ones in that place, who have drunk the choice wine of My love, who have spoken My praise, who have conveyed My Cause, who have arisen to serve Me and to serve My loved ones, who have cast aside all else but Me and have taken fast hold of that which they were commanded in My perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>We make mention of thy wife, who believed in her Lord after she heard His mighty and wondrous call, and We make mention of My handmaidens who have rejoiced in My Day, who have heard My remembrance and have turned towards My luminous horizon.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about the handmaiden of God, the mother of Bahiyyih Sultan, upon her be the Glory of God, mentioning her hardship, this matter was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. The Tongue of Grandeur spoke this most exalted word: “Upon thee, O My handmaiden, upon thee, O My handmaiden, be patience and forbearance in whatsoever hath befallen thee in the days of God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting. Put thy trust in Him under all conditions, and it behooveth thee to be content and well-pleasing in this Day wherein all things have proclaimed: ‘The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Loving.’ It behooveth thee to remember thy Lord with this remembrance which the Tongue of Eternity hath spoken at this moment:</p>
<p>“I beseech Thee, O my God, by the appearance of the Self-Subsisting after the Qaim, and by His signs, His evidences, His manifestations and His attributes, to ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will benefit me in every world of Thy worlds. O my Lord! I am a handmaiden among Thy handmaidens who hath turned unto the heaven of Thy bounty, the ocean of Thy generosity and the sun of Thy favor, and I know not what will benefit me in Thy sight. The knowledge of all things is in a Mighty Book. O my Lord! Ordain for this handmaiden of Thine that which will cause her to be joyous under all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God that you have been blessed repeatedly with the choice wine of divine utterance. This is that same sustenance which hath been recorded in the divine Scriptures and Books, both of the past and of the present. Glorified and exalted is He above my mention, my description, my praise and the praise of all who are in the heavens and the earth. How can the understanding and minds of the servants comprehend this most great favor? We are all powerless and wanting, and He is the Strong, the Mighty. And furthermore, whatever you had expressed of the degrees of powerlessness, nothingness, evanescence, remembrance and praise regarding the most mighty, most pure Branches of the Divine Lott Tree - may my spirit, my being and my essence be a sacrifice for the dust of their footsteps - this servant presented it with the utmost humility and submissiveness on your behalf. They showed favor and likewise offered greetings. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the mention of God, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>He is the All-Hearing from His Most Exalted Horizon!</p>
<p>Praise be sanctified above mention and utterance, befitting the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court of that Desired One Who caused the Kawthar of eternity to flow forth from the Most Exalted Pen, and through a drop thereof bestowed everlasting life upon those who have turned unto Him. This drop, in its first station and primary rank, appeared in the form of a point, and through it He brought forth from the realm of the unseen into the sphere of existence the knowledge of the first and the last. And when its service found acceptance, it became intimate with the letter Ba, and through it was raised aloft the knowledge that there is none other God but Him, and the banner of triumph and victory was unfurled. He is the One with such power that neither the might of all created things nor the force of all contingent beings can stay His will.</p>
<p>Blessed are those souls who have drunk from the Salsabil of the word “He doeth whatsoever He willeth” and have found themselves detached from the world and all who dwell therein. When thou hearest the scratching of My Most Exalted Pen and drinkest the choice wine of revelation from the cup of the bounty of the Lord of all beings, say:</p>
<p>“Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens! I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and to Thy greatness and Thy power. I beseech Thee by the Lamp of Thy Cause whereby Thou hast illumined the world, and by Thy Most Great Name whereby Thou hast guided the nations, to make me in all conditions one who extols Thy praise, who stands firm in service to Thy loved ones, and who clings fast to Thy cord. O my Lord! Thou seest my turning towards Thy horizon and my orientation towards the lights of Thy countenance. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, whom neither the swords of the enemies could prevent from turning to Thy Most Exalted Horizon, nor the clamor of the divines from Thy mention, O Thou Who art the King of earth and heaven, and Lord of the Hereafter and of the former days. O my Lord! Thou seest the sinner who seeketh the ocean of Thy forgiveness and pardon. I beseech Thee by Thy generosity which hath encompassed the world to forgive my misdeeds and transgressions, and to ordain for me that which will keep me steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the oppression of the aggressors, nor the doubts of the suspicious, nor the signs of those who have denied the Day of Judgment shall hold me back. O my Lord! Withhold not from me what Thou hast purposed from the heaven of Thy grace. Illumine my pillars through Thy bounty and mercy, and my heart with the lights of the Day-Star of Thy Manifestation. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.”</p>
<p>A letter thou didst send to this Servant hath been mentioned before the Wronged One. The fragrance of acceptance and faith wafted therefrom. We beseech God to manifest from each of the loved ones of that land that which is conducive to the guidance of humanity, and likewise to cause to flow that which is the cause of life for the peoples of the world. This is not difficult for God. Consider Salman and Abu Dharr, to what station they attained after acceptance. His grace made Tammar one of the righteous, and His justice distinguished the virtuous from the wicked. This is the meaning of the words “He maketh your low ones to be high ones and your high ones to be low ones.” Reflect upon the disciples of Jesus, son of Mary - they were engaged in collecting tithes and catching fish, yet through the rays of the Sun of proof they attained to such a station that they captured the world. For they detached themselves from all that they possessed and turned unto that which was with God and held fast unto it. They effaced their own will in the Will of God and arose to serve - such service that neither the might of the obstinate Jews nor the idol-worshippers could deter them from the Creator of all things. We beseech God to aid and protect all. Yet some of the people of the Bayan are occupied with matters that cause division and discord. They have abandoned the foundation and think only of finding a calf to which they may cling, thus becoming the cause of another sedition. All must beseech God, exalted be His glory, for that which will exalt His Word and cause steadfastness in it. The Most Exalted Pen counseleth thee to that which is the cause of preservation and elevation, and hath enjoined and continueth to enjoin wisdom upon all the friends of that land, lest there appear from them that which would disturb hearts and souls. The loved ones of that land have ever been and are beneath His gaze. We have mentioned him who hath ascended unto God with a mention whose fragrance shall not fade nor its breezes be cut off. Verily it shall endure as long as the kingdom and the heavenly kingdom endure. To this beareth witness the Lord of might, when He was established upon the throne with manifest sovereignty. He who was named Muhammad-’Ali in the Book of Names - upon him be the glory of God and the glory of all who are in the heavens and the earth. We have purified him from that which beseemeth him not and have raised him to a station whereof the pens are powerless to make mention.</p>
<p>We make mention of thy son who was named Muhammad-Hasan, and We have mentioned him with that which hath been revealed for him at this time from the rain of the mercy of his Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>O Rafi’! Today the Word of God hath been and is superior to a hundred children. Strive ye to attain unto the good-pleasure of the Friend and to manifest that which shall be recorded eternally in the Book of God. These are the true children, the true delight of the eye, and the true posterity. Thus hath spoken the Wronged One when sorrows encompassed Him through what the hands of the oppressors had wrought. O people of Baha! Grieve not over anything save that which hath befallen Us at the hands of the heedless. We have been patient in hardship and tribulation and have commanded the people of Baha to show forth beautiful patience.</p>
<p>We make mention of the mother of the child and give her the glad-tidings of that which hath been revealed on this night. Glory be from Us upon those who have taken the cup of immortality in My Most Great Name and have drunk therefrom despite every heedless and suspicious learned one.</p>

<p>O Nabil-i-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of Destiny! He is the One Who uttereth Justice!</p>
<p>Praise and glory beseem the Almighty Lord Who, in the midst of tribulations and while in the hands of enemies, proclaimed “Verily, I am the Lord of all beings.” The might of Pharaohs deterred Him not, nor did the power of tyrants hold Him back from His purpose. With the knowledge that He doeth whatsoever He willeth, He departed from the Realm of Eternity to the kingdom of creation, that He might quicken the dead through the divine breathings of revelation and heavenly inspirations, and lead them to the horizon of glory. The purpose of bearing countless afflictions and trials was that the world might be purified from the smoke of hatred and rancor, and that every soul might find itself in the seat of truth and the gathering-place of security.</p>
<p>O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of My knowledge! The religion of God and His prescribed Law have ever been the cause of love and unity, yet through misunderstanding they have become the source of enmity and discord. Strive that perchance this span-long world might be illumined with the light of harmony. From that which hath been sent down from the heaven of divine knowledge, it is clear and evident what the purpose and intention hath been - that the servants of the world might turn from bestial characteristics toward spiritual and luminous qualities, and become purified from unseemly deeds and actions.</p>
<p>Beseech thou God that no party like unto the Shi’ih sect might again appear in the world. O thou who gazest upon My countenance! I swear by the Sun of Truth that until now this Wronged One hath not revealed the hidden mysteries. All the claims of those people have been and are like unto Jabulqa and Jabulsa. They have failed to distinguish between God and His creation. They have not even perceived the fragrance of true unity, and yet they count themselves among the most exalted of all people. No deed is witnessed from them save corruption, rejection and malediction.</p>
<p>Beseech thou God to illumine the world with the light of justice and to assist and confirm His Majesty the Shah. Despite the impertinence of some in the early days, He hath repeatedly in recent years protected the oppressed from the tyranny of the ignorant - once in Ha and Mim, again in Qaf and Mim, and in other places, as when He graciously granted freedom to the prisoners in the Land of Ta.</p>
<p>My God, My God! Thou seest my state, my tribulation, my trials, my imprisonment and my sorrow. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst open the doors of hearts, and by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance before all faces, to assist His Majesty the Shah in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the throne on high and of the dust below.</p>
<p>O My Nabil! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness! Thou art well aware of how this Wronged One hath, from the inception of this Cause until now, arisen before the faces of all with manifest power and might, without any veil or covering. Whensoever the Cause of God was exalted and the Day-Star of His Revelation shone forth, some heedless one would emerge from behind the veil and act in such wise as would cause the servants to hesitate. In the Land of Mystery [Baghdad], despite the manifestation of the mubahalih [spiritual contest], and the exaltation of the Word, Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfahani rushed to Mushiru’d-Dawlih–upon him be the Glory of God–seeking refuge and requesting a daily stipend. By God! At this My heart, My Pen, and My very being lamented. And now Isfahani, together with his companion, is present at the Threshold, engaged in plundering wealth, consumed by such flames of greed and passion that the Pen is powerless to describe. Poor trustworthiness writhes beneath the talons of his treachery, while piety, like the phoenix, remains hidden and unseen. Yet despite all the afflictions that have befallen Us and these endless tribulations, neither tongue nor pen is restrained. The oppression of the oppressors and the might of the aggressors have not prevented Us. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid those who have turned away to turn toward Him, and those who have denied to acknowledge Him. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>Thy letter that thou didst send to this servant hath arrived. At that very moment, the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will, specifically for the aforementioned one–upon him be My glory. We beseech God to aid him to grasp it through His strength and His power. A blessed scroll was sent; peruse it and send copies thereof to the lands of Khah, Shahrud, and Mashhad, as well as to other cities. A volume of the Divine Book is being sent today from Ha [Haifa] that it may reach thee, and specifically for the names mentioned, wondrous, sublime and mighty verses have been revealed and dispatched. Would that they might understand from whence these verses are revealed and in what state they are revealed! By God! Were the people of the world to look with fairness, all would turn to the most exalted Summit. It is not known by what excuse the hesitant justify themselves. By My life! Were the Primal Point [the Bab] present, He would surely arise before all faces and record that which descendeth from the Kingdom of grace and bounty. Say: O people! Look ye at My signs and that which hath proceeded from the ocean of My utterance. Verily, it will acquaint you with that which hath been hidden from you through His wisdom. He is verily the All-Patient, the Concealer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The signs of thy grief have saddened this Wronged One. The glances of My loving-kindness have ever been directed towards thee. To this all things bear witness. Hold fast unto that which We have revealed for thee aforetime. Look not to the people and their ways, but unto the Truth and His sovereignty. Thou hast ever been and continue to be remembered, to this the Mother Book beareth witness at this moment. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention regarding thy nephew Muhammad-’Ali–upon him be My glory–this dependeth upon thine own judgment and is acceptable in the sight of God. The glory that shineth from the horizon of this heaven be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, who love thee and hearken to thy words concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne and the Lord of this firm and impregnable Cause.</p>

<p>Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Mahmud, who hath attained Our presence and won the honour of recognition</p>
<p>TABLET OF GOD, THE ALL-PROTECTING, THE SELF-SUBSISTING</p>
<p>He is the One Who calleth from the Most Exalted Horizon in the Prison of ’Akka</p>
<p>God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who speaketh this day amongst the people is indeed the Lord of the Kingdom of Utterance, the Hidden Treasure, and the Concealed Mystery that was veiled from all eyes and inscribed by the Pen of God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Through Him hath the decree of the Book been established, both in the beginning and at the end, and the Tongue of Grandeur hath proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Best-Beloved.</p>
<p>O Mahmud! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Mighty, the Loving. I bear witness that thou hast cast aside all things, turning thy face toward the Kaaba of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Thou didst leave thy home, seeking the Lord of the House, until thou didst arrive and attain the presence of the Countenance and didst hear the call of God, the Lord of existence. We bear witness that thou hast attained unto that which was recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in this Prison, whereby the Cause of God, His sovereignty, His majesty and His power have been upraised, and wherein every hidden matter hath been revealed. Remind My brothers on My behalf and give them the joyful tidings of that which hath been ordained for them by the Pen of Decree from God, the Mighty, the Powerful. We have remembered them, and do remember them, with that which attracteth the hearts and souls. Say: Be not grieved by the deeds of those whose idle fancies have withheld them from reflecting upon the ultimate fate of things. By the life of God! Their actions shall profit them not. Soon shall they find themselves in the torment ordained for them by God, the Lord of Hosts.</p>
<p>Hear thou the Divine Call in the Persian tongue! Some have imagined that through the shedding of blood and the persecutions visited upon the friends the wounds inflicted upon hearts would be healed. Far, far from the truth! Rather, from every drop a new creation is brought forth, and from every affliction countless bounties are made manifest. Today the lovers have been so transported by the Word of the Beloved of the worlds that they regard the world and all that is therein as a handful of dust. Say: O people, by the life of God, this Call bestoweth eternal life and conferreth everlasting grace. Deprive not yourselves thereof. Fear ye God, O people, and be not of the heedless. Cast away what the world possesseth and take hold of this Manifest Book which acquainteth you with the Command of God, draweth you nigh unto the pavilion of His glory, giveth you to drink of the Kawthar of His utterance, and guideth you to His straight Path.</p>
<p>Today the lovers have a melody, and the City of Love is illumined and purified by the sweet and holy breaths of the friends of God, exalted be His glory. In truth I say these wrongs shall not be lost. The fire of hatred shall leave its traces until the end that hath no end, that all may become aware of the tyrannies perpetrated by the manifestations of iniquity and wickedness against the dawning-places of righteousness and piety. Hath any power been witnessed in the world, or will ever be seen, that can withstand the power of God? Nay, by His own Self, the True One!</p>
<p>O people of Iran! Beseech ye God that He may assist His Majesty the Shah to do that which beseemeth his station in this Day, and that He may not withhold from him the outpoured bounties, the eternal offerings, and the everlasting verses. Glory be to God! At times it hath been heard that His Majesty hath declared: “We have hitherto shown no favor to this community, nor manifested any mercy towards them. However, We now desire to deal with them with justice and equity.” Nevertheless it became clear that these words were not from the Shah, or if they were, his blessed intention was altered due to the whisperings of the tale-bearers of the world.</p>
<p>That which today is the cause of greatest astonishment is that His Majesty the Shah hath made no distinction between friend and foe, and hath regarded the true friends as enemies - God forbid! O Shah! Reflection is needed; perchance thou mayest become aware of those wicked souls who have been and are lying in wait. The intention here is not to refer to outsiders, but rather to one whose name none dare mention, yet whose deeds and intentions are clear and evident to those possessed of insight.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! What hath veiled the investigators! To say more would exceed the bounds of wisdom, yet We beseech God to assist and confirm His Majesty the Shah and grant him the knowledge to perceive, for should he become aware, he would hold fast to that which would ensure the perpetuity of his sovereignty and the reformation and advancement of his realm. That which is now the greatest means for His Majesty the Shah from the King of all means is that he should take a firm covenant from the Book that speaketh and from the Kingdom of Utterance, for this sacred covenant is immune from annulment and change; alteration shall not touch it nor shall obliteration reach it. Besides this, no other means that could ensure the exaltation and elevation of the standard of sovereignty can be perceived. Verily, other means existed before, but their time hath passed. O Mahmud! Upon thee be the grace of God and His mercy, which hath preceded the unseen and the seen. Say: O my God, my God! Cast me not out from the door of Thy bounty, and withhold me not from the ocean of Thy generosity, and sever not the cord of my hope through Thy might and power. O Lord! Thou seest the thirsty one yearning for the stream of Thy mercy, and the essence of nothingness seeking the word of Thy proof, and the river of poverty desiring the sea of Thy wealth. I beseech Thee, O Protector of them that are near, O Deliverer of the sincere ones, O Shelter of the sorrow-laden, to illumine the countenance of the sovereign with the light of Thy justice, and to adorn him with that which will draw him nigh unto the court of Thy bounty and the seat of Thy favors. Then aid him, O my God, with the hosts of earth and heaven, and the armies of the seen and the unseen. Verily, Thou art powerful to do what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the Almighty. Within Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on the earth.</p>

<p>At the outset, this servant beseeches his Lord to make your station at the Sacred Threshold an impregnable fortress and to protect you thereby from the evil of every barking dog, every rebel, every transgressor, and every slanderer who have made it their nature to wrongfully consume the wealth of the people and their habit to calumniate the servants by following the misguider.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O God, Lord of all beings and Educator of all created things! Thou seest Thy righteous loved ones in the hands of the wicked, and there hath befallen them, through their evil deeds, that which hath caused the very rocks to cry out. I beseech Thee by the Light whereby the darkness was illumined, and by the Drop whereby Thou didst manifest the seas, and by the Point whereby Thou didst expound the Books and the mysteries of Revelation, and by Thy Beloved through Whom Thou didst create existence and made Him the Guardian over the unseen and the seen, and through Whom Thou didst perfect Thy religion amongst Thy servants and manifest Thy Cause throughout the lands - to assist Thy servants in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. O Lord! Illumine the world with the light of knowledge and trustworthiness, and send down upon Thy servants that which will purify them from the defilement of self and passion, and draw them nigh unto Thy glorious station and Thy mighty court. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest.</p>
<p>That beloved spiritual one’s letter arrived. Praise be to God, from it wafted the fragrance of resignation, reliance, steadfastness, trustworthiness and power. I beseech the Most High to exalt you through His Name and honor you through His mention and manifest through you His virtues and attributes, that through you the signs of steadfastness and religion may spread among all creatures, and the truth may be realized through your deeds and actions. Verily, He is the Strong, the Triumphant, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. After reading it repeatedly, he proceeded to the Sacred Spot and it was presented before His presence. He - may our spirits be sacrificed for His sake - said: “Praise be to God Who hath aided the Afnan to manifest the truth and that which beseemeth him in such days wherein the oppressors desired to veil the beauty of trustworthiness with their own treachery and the beauty of truthfulness with the veils of their lies. Praise be to God, thou wast assisted to deliver eloquent words and didst mention that which was a light shining from the supreme horizon of the heart. Blessed be thy tongue for having spoken the truth in such wise that the clamor of the people of greed and passion and the howling of the people of tyranny and wickedness did not prevent thee from mentioning the truth. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid you with the hosts of the seen and unseen, to preserve you through His sovereignty and guard you through His power. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>O Amin! We have heard thy call. Praise be to God for having enabled thee to achieve that which hath won the glory of acceptance. Say: My God, my God! Thou seest us in the hands of the heedless and the transgressors. We beseech Thee to assist us to hold fast unto that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book and unto deeds from which the fragrance of Thy good-pleasure may be wafted. Thou knowest that we desire naught save trustworthiness and religiousness and truthfulness and purity. Ordain for us that which Thou hast ordained for such of Thy servants as act and such of Thy creation as are sincere. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.”</p>
<p>In truth, His honor the esteemed gentleman (upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah] the Most Glorious) hath uttered a word that leaveth no room for denial by anyone, and that word hath testified and doth testify to truth and righteousness, for the station of attribution is established and all are aware. In any case, they stated that they had uttered a blessed word - blessed be he! And that which was forbidden is different from this. Praise be to God, they have uttered a complete blessed word, and in truth it hath been sanctified from both acceptance and denial. No acceptance hath been or is more conclusive than this. The heedless and the opponents have said many things. Praise be to God, arrival in that land proved that His honor was not and is not among those who flee, for after departing from that land they wrote to their own kind that the others had fled. Glory be to God! Every person of understanding is bewildered by what they have said and done. I beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon them the recompense of their deeds. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the favors of Truth are evident from every direction, and refraining from discussion regarding the claim hath itself been a form of divine assistance. The beloved of the heart, the Observer (upon him be God’s peace), hath arrived and is headed in that direction. It became known that Sayyalih had made a mistake regarding the Name, and no new command reached them afterwards, thus the delay. God willing, after the assurances of His Excellency the Ambassador (may God, blessed and exalted be He, strengthen him) - that is, the assurance regarding collecting the claim and its receipt - if it is requested there is no harm. Verily God is the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy. If they judge with justice and are successful, they must give recompense for the calumnies of those people so that the lies and slanders of those base people become evident to all. And regarding what they said that Muhammad-’Ali himself would bring and give our dues - this statement too was among the distinguished utterances. We beseech the Most High to assist His loved ones in that which will cause trustworthiness, religiosity, chastity and faithfulness to be exalted. God willing, let there be loving conduct with all people. The association of some may be intended to hear words which they can use as a pretext. What was said at first should be mentioned exactly as it was, without addition or subtraction. In that land there are many investigators and mischief-makers. The first single word was and is sufficient. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon the Afnan, and upon you, and upon those who love you, and upon God’s sincere servants.</p>

<p>O My Name! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. The letter of Farajullah - upon him be My glory - which he wrote to thee hath attained the honor of being heard in Our presence. The fragrance of the love of the Best-Beloved of the worlds was wafted from it. Likewise, he sent to this Servant that which testified to his acceptance, humility and lowliness before God, the Lord of the worlds. Due to events occurring in this land, there was delay in responding and showing favor until this time when the Most Great Branch appeared before the Countenance and made mention of you. We have mentioned thee in such wise as nothing can equal. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>At this time when the Tongue of Eternity speaketh and the Pen moveth, the Ancient Countenance hath turned toward the land of K and maketh mention of Faraj - upon him be My glory - that he may rejoice in his Lord’s favor and be among those who are steadfast. O Faraj! There hath befallen the Wronged One that which hath caused the dwellers of Paradise and those who circle round My mighty Throne to weep. Servants who have denied God and His sovereignty and turned away from His gracious Cause have risen against Us. Yet the Wronged One, in the midst of tribulation, continued to voice His beauteous praise and remember His loved ones in all directions. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. Neither the power of the world nor the might of nations hath deterred Us. We have arisen, without veil or covering, and spoken that which hath caused the limbs of the polytheists to quake. Blessed art thou and those who have held fast to the Most Great Cord and have arisen to serve My manifest Cause.</p>
<p>We have heard thy call time and again, and We answer thee at this hour. We make mention of the youth who mentioned thee before the Countenance and heard the call of God, the Lord of the worlds. He hath attained and won to his goal, as the Mother Book beareth witness in its exalted station. O youth! Hear the call and be not of the heedless. We make mention of H and S. He arose in the earliest days to serve the Cause, as beareth witness He Who speaketh in all things that there is no God but Me, the Single, the All-Informed. We have commanded the servants not to speak regarding him. We have forgiven him as a bounty from Our presence, and We are verily the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Faraj, upon thee be My Glory! Thy mention hath been made before the Wronged One. I swear by the tribulations of this Wronged One that whosoever today attaineth unto any of My remembrances hath attained unto all good. We beseech God to aid thee in such wise that thy name may never set from the horizon of names, nor thy remembrance from the heaven of mention, nor be touched by decline. Convey My greetings to the loved ones of that land and give them the glad-tidings of God’s favors. His honor Amin, upon him be My Glory, during the days he was present before the Face, made mention of that land, and repeatedly mentioned each one in the Most Holy Court, and likewise the party of God at the gate of Isfahan. We beseech God to aid them and grant them success in that which He loveth and is pleased with.</p>
<p>Say: O people of God! Today ye must be set ablaze by the traces of the Most Exalted Pen and the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing - an enkindlement that would consume all dampness and coldness which are the cause and reason for lassitude and hesitation, that all may speak forth in praise and thanksgiving and arise to serve. Say: O people of God! Know ye the value of these days and seek from God that which endureth and lasteth. The days are transient, things are transient, colors are transient, wealth and riches and might and glory are all transient. What a pity that man should be deprived of the eternal Kingdom for the sake of that which perisheth. From the beginning of the Cause until now, the Pen of God hath, for the sake of God, uttered that which is the cause of salvation for all and eternal everlasting life. Well is it with them that hear, and well is it with them that act!</p>
<p>His honor Ha and Sin hath, from the beginning of the Cause, turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and hath borne in the path of God that which none save God is aware of. The gaze of favor hath turned toward him from the horizon of the Prison, that he may be of the thankful ones. Verily We have forgiven him and purified him. Thy Lord loveth faithfulness and commandeth all to observe it. Blessed is he who hath held fast unto that which God hath willed and hath detached himself from his own desires in this Great Announcement. Those who have attained unto His presence, nothing whatsoever shall harm them. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist him and aid him in His remembrance and praise and in serving His manifest Cause, and to make him a standard of His name. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>We send greetings to the leaves of that land and make mention of them with such mention that the whole world and whatsoever is therein cannot equal a single letter thereof. Soon that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen shall appear and become manifest to all the world. Consider what was in the beginning and what hath now come to pass. The will of God cannot be hindered by the will of creation, nor can the penetrating influence of the Most Exalted Pen be prevented by the clamor of ignorant divines. Thus hath He revealed the utterance, pearls of knowledge. When thou hast attained unto them say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds, and glory be unto Thee, O Desire of the worlds! My spirit be a sacrifice unto Thy grace and unto Thy favor. Despite what hath befallen Thee, Thou hast remembered Thy devoted friends.</p>
<p>If thou shouldst meet his honor Amin, convey My greetings. Say: Verily We have mentioned every name thou didst mention before the Face, and We mention it as a grace from Us, and I am verily the Compassionate, the Bountiful. O Amin! Thou didst enter by My leave and depart by My leave. Thou didst stand before My face and didst speak in remembrance of My party and My loved ones who have held fast to My cord and clung to the hem of the robe of My mercy, and who have soared in My atmosphere and spoken My praise and hastened unto My straight path. The Glory be upon thee and upon him and upon those whose names thou hast mentioned on this dark night from the Pen of God, the Powerful, the Strong, the Triumphant, the Mighty.</p>

<p>He is God - exalted be His glory, majesty and power!</p>
<p>The servant testifies that there is no God but Him, acknowledging His oneness and confessing His singleness, and with certitude in what He has revealed in His Book. Verily He is the Sovereign before Whose hosts the world cannot stand. He does as He wills by His command and decrees what He desires. He is indeed the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose manifestation mysteries were revealed and that which was hidden in the hearts of the chosen ones who Thou madest the repositories of Thy revelation, the dawning-places of Thy inspiration, the fountainheads of Thy Cause, and the daysprings of Thy laws. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and by the Word through which all created things were moved and all existing things were ordained, to assist Thy chosen ones, Thy loved ones and Thy trustees to celebrate Thy praise and glorification and to serve Thy Cause, that there might appear from them that which would cause those near unto Thee to inhale the fragrance of immortality through Thy Most Exalted Name. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Conquering, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O my Lord! Withhold them not from Thy outpourings which none has comprehended save Thy knowledge and none has recognized save Him Whom Thou hast made the Manifestation of Thy names, attributes, signs and tokens. Protect them from the evil of those who have encompassed the people of Thy oneness in Thy realm, and through whom there has come to pass that which has caused the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise and the Verdant Isle to lament. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having enabled those who have acknowledged Thy oneness to remain patient in adversity and tribulation. There is no God but Thee, the Lord of earth and heaven, and the Sovereign over all names. Thou art indeed the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>And now, O beloved of my heart, the words composed of the letters of the Book of love for the Lord of the worlds and the Goal of all nations have left their effect upon all limbs, members and pillars - an effect of which it is said that it enters with milk and departs with the soul. How wondrous is this most great mystery of love! Though a thousand volumes be written about it, it would still appear deficient. It is the first adornment and the cause and reason for the continuation of existence. In one station it bestows life and grants spirit, in another it makes one utterly evanescent, and in yet another it confers an enduring, eternal power. I have no name for this mystery and this reality. Whatever is said of it is other than it and beneath it, for by God’s will it has become the cause and reason for creation. After gaining awareness and knowledge, approach was made to the presence of His countenance and He said: “Praise be to God! A carpet has been spread that the hands of the morning breeze are powerless to fold. Blessed are its people! None but the people of determination and joy have access to this carpet. The world is seen to be in turmoil through the tyranny of the nations. Each day it is afflicted with a new ordeal and from every corner a tribulation arises. O people of unity! Through your existence the world exists. Strive that perchance the world may be adorned with the ornament of justice and equity and attain unto that which God has willed. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who has turned towards Egypt and blessed are God’s loved ones there. We make mention of the two Most Great Names as We have mentioned them before and will mention them hereafter, and those whom the doubts of the people of polytheism have not prevented from recognizing the unity of God, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Wise. Peace be upon you and upon God’s sincere servants.”</p>
<p>The station of loving-kindness and compassion is evident, both outwardly and inwardly, through utterance. Every word speaks, nay every letter testifies and bears witness to the Most Great Bounty. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to preserve these stations and increase them with each moment. He is the Powerful, the Able One.</p>
<p>That which that beloved one observed and mentioned in the dream indicates the exaltation of the religion of God and His Cause among the servants. As for the weeping, it is joy - this is what the servant heard from the tongue of his Lord. They stated that whatsoever came to pass and was revealed, all was and is evidence of loftiness, elevation, exaltation and steadfastness. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to make your honor one who aids, stands firm, and speaks forth in His Name with wisdom and utterance. Although mentioning this matter is to achieve what is already achieved, as that beloved one has been and is, praise be to God, already successful.</p>
<p>And regarding what was written about ’Ammar, these details that were submitted are clear and evident. Your honor has fulfilled and continues to fulfill the Covenant and Testament, and there has been no doubt or uncertainty. Whatever is with them will return to this Spot, but it has not yet emerged from the unseen. After its emergence, whatever is wise and befitting to the time will be made manifest. End.</p>
<p>To the beloved of the heart, that is, the direction of the two Most Exalted Names, his honor Aqa Siyyid ’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, I convey countless salutations and greetings. Surely by now he has returned from Egypt. This servant is ashamed before him, for whatever he might express, there still remains more to say. Perhaps God will bestow His grace and enable its expression, for it is not and has never been within the power of ones like this servant. I convey greetings to each of the loved ones in that land, and I beseech God, glorified be His Majesty, for health, well-being, blessing, bounty, confirmation and success in all that He loves and is pleased with. May they ever dwell beneath the shade of the Tree of loving-kindness, standing in His service, mentioning His remembrance, and gazing toward His horizon. Peace, praise, glory and splendor be upon your honor and upon the near-servants of God.</p>

<p>Glorified be His Most Exalted Station, His Grandeur and His Power!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath sent down the verses and manifested the clear evidences and caused the Supreme Pen to speak forth betwixt earth and heaven. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And blessings and peace be upon Him Who is the source and end of existence, the Ultimate Goal and Refuge, through Whom the Morn of Revelation sang and the Nightingale trilled upon the Mount, and upon His family and companions through whom the horizon of the world was illumined and the Temple of the Cause was established upon the Most Great Throne - they who strove in the path of God with their wealth and their souls until the valley flowed with their might and the Zawra smiled through their benevolence.</p>
<p>To continue: O My loved one! Thy missive hath arrived, and manifest is the effect it hath produced. By the life of God, it was spirit itself, adorned with the remembrance of Him Who is the Goal of all creation and embellished with the praise of the Best-Beloved of all the worlds. Your reward is with God. God willing, be occupied at all times with the remembrance and praise of God, exalted be His glory. Give out the Tablets according to the requirements of the time, for in these days some are fearful, some are anxious, and for others, due to wisdom, it is not permissible to give them. Ye must wait until the time is ripe, and time arriveth more swiftly than lightning. The intention is that until ye are informed of the conditions of the friends, make no mention of the Tablets. Every sapling in the Garden of Utterance that deserveth the water of mercy, bestow upon it the water of inner meanings, and God, exalted be His glory, saith “Well is it with him.” This matter should be before the eyes of that loved one according to the command. Counsel all the friends to patience, calm and dignity, and say: O friends of God in the earth! Ye are honored in all the divine worlds through the name of the True One, but in this transient world which will end more quickly than aught else, ye have been afflicted with abasement. In the path of the one true God ye have heard taunts and witnessed tribulation, ye have been imprisoned and have laid down your lives, but because of the tyranny of a few heedless ones, ye must not transgress the bounds of God – that is, ye must not molest any soul. All that hath befallen you hath been for God’s sake, this is the truth, no doubt lieth therein. And now too refer all matters unto Him, trust in Him and commit all unto Him. Assuredly He will not abandon you, of this too there is no doubt. No father delivereth his child to the lion, and no shepherd entrusteth his sheep to the wolf. Surely he exerteth his utmost in their protection. If for a few days, in accordance with consummate wisdom, outward affairs proceed contrary to one’s desire, there is and was no harm in this. The intention is that all should fix their gaze upon the Supreme Horizon and hold fast to that which hath been revealed in the Tablets. They should not step into the realm of corruption, nor place their feet in the arena of contention and conflict. They should assist God, exalted be His glory, through the hosts of patience and resignation, through goodly deeds and character, and through wondrous and sublime words. In these days, in one of the Tablets, this exalted word hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen – glorified be His utterance: “At all times, hold fast to that which will cause the exaltation of the Word of God. Goodly deeds and a praiseworthy character are the hosts of God in this supreme Revelation, and likewise are blessed and goodly words. These hosts attract hearts and unlock the gates of cities. This weapon is sharper than the weapons of the world.” Ask God to assist all to fulfill that which hath flowed from His Most Exalted Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets. By the Day-Star of the heaven of inner meanings! If the friends were to act, or had acted, according to that which was revealed, the whole world would guard them as the pupils of their eyes, and the hosts of the unseen would protect them from behind. All things have been and are among the hosts of God. The winds are reckoned among His troops, the mountains among His armies. Moses with but a staff threw the world into turmoil, for it appeared through God’s command and arose to serve Him. God willing, it is hoped that the hidden staff will part asunder the sea of self and passion, and guide all unto God. Verily, He hath power over all things and is worthy to answer prayer.</p>
<p>According to His blessed command, in the Land of K thou shouldst convey greetings to the mother of the sanctuary – upon her be the Most Glorious Glory of God – and likewise to the paternal aunt and the daughters of the paternal aunt and all the kindred, one and all, and give them the glad-tidings of God’s favors and the mention of the Wronged One. In truth they have suffered greatly in the path of God. They have not been, nor will they be, forgotten, and are mentioned in the Tablets from the Supreme Pen. Some time ago, a Tablet was specifically revealed and sent to each one; therefore, this time there was a pause. We convey greetings to each one of the men and women, and give them glad-tidings of God’s special favors. And likewise, gladden the rest of the friends in that land with the mention of the Most Great Scene. The honored cotton-carders are truly engaged in service. Blessed are they both. Verily, We make mention of them and give them glad-tidings of God’s favors and mercy. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the kindred of Muhammad-Sadiq – upon them be My Glory. God willing, may they manifest that which God loveth and act according to that which hath been revealed in the Book, and with the hosts of deeds and character rout the ranks of the devils. God willing, may all attain unto the hearing of the Call of God and hold fast unto His path. [Here endeth the sacred text]. This evanescent one begs that greetings and salutations be conveyed to each of the gentlemen and friends who are present in that land. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings. The Servant. The first of the month of Safar, 1301.</p>

<p>O My Name, Al-Mahdi! Your letter which you sent to My servant who was present before the Great Throne has arrived. Say: O people of the world! By God, neither your veils, nor your words, nor your conditions, nor your manifestations, nor that to which you have turned can prevent the Most Great Name. He is verily the Truthful Speaker, the Manifest, the All-Informed. He turns to the right and says: “There is no God but I, the Evident Truth,” and to the left: “There is no God but I, the Chosen One.” Say: Through Him do all atoms proclaim: “There is no God but He, the All-Knowing, the Powerful, the Mighty.” Say: The Books have been adorned with My Name and the Bayan with My wondrous mention. Whosoever denies Me, say: Bring forth what you have, O heedless and remote one! You have taken the pond and forsaken the Most Great Ocean behind you. Arise in My Name and say: “I repent unto Thee, O God of the worlds!” Say: Through My mention have all mentions been realized, and through My manifestation it has been established that there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>Say: Die in your wrath, then be consumed in the fire of your rancor. By the True God, the Supreme Horizon has been illumined by the Sun of My Most Glorious Name, and the Lord of Names has come with an authority that neither your clamor nor what is in your hearts can prevent. We speak at all times and say: O people of creation! By God, this is He Who was promised in God’s Books, and this is He but for Whom no Prophet would have spoken, no Messenger would have been sent, and no Book would have been revealed. He is verily the Truthful, the Trustworthy.</p>
<p>Take the wine of certitude in My Name and abandon what you possess of conditions and idle fancies. Say: Through My fragrant breezes have the gardens been perfumed, and through the lights of My countenance has creation been adorned. Turn and observe, and be not of the heedless ones. Beware lest you act as you acted before, and beware lest you be of the ignorant ones. Has not the Trumpet been sounded? Has not the Lord of Manifestation appeared? Turn that you may hear what has been raised from His Supreme Horizon on this Day which God has announced in His mighty Tablet.</p>
<p>Observe and reflect upon those who have taken for themselves idols besides God and followed them in what they commanded them, and thereby went astray and led others astray until the earth was reddened with the blood of the Beloved. Say: Be fair and be not of those who turn away. We do not wish to mention them by their names lest your clamor be raised. My mercy has preceded My wrath, My grace My punishment, and My loving-kindness those who are in the heavens and the earth. There has befallen Me from the people of the Bayan that which befell not Him Who revealed the Furqan nor My chosen ones and My messengers before. To this bears witness whosoever was in My days and was of the fair-minded ones.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Follow ye that which the All-Merciful hath revealed, and draw not the sword of tyranny against Him Whom ye invoke by night and by day. Fear ye God and be not of the losers. Hold fast today unto the Most Great Cord and follow not the idle fancies ye possess. With Us are not the allusions of men; We speak and call out through that which hath caused the fragrances of the All-Merciful to waft throughout all possibilities. Thus doth My Pen speak and inform you of that which I possess, if ye be of them that hearken. Know ye, then inform your likes that the gate of heaven hath been opened through My Most Glorious Name, and the Hidden Mystery hath appeared through the Sovereignty of Names, calling out with the most exalted call: “O people of creation! By God, this indeed is the Existent One, this indeed is the Promised One, this indeed is the Intended One, this indeed is the Worshipped One, this indeed is the Witnessed One, this indeed is the manifest Truth, the Speaking One, the Impregnable Mystery. Whoso denieth Him hath denied God throughout all ages, and whoso acknowledgeth Him hath acknowledged God, the Lord of all worlds.”</p>
<p>O people of the Bayan! By God, ye have perpetrated that which hath caused the Primal Point and the Concourse on High and those settled in the Kingdom of Names to lament. Ye have committed that which none in the world hath committed, and perpetrated that which none among the peoples of the earth hath perpetrated. To this beareth witness the tongue of My grandeur and those who circle round My exalted Throne.</p>
<p>O My Name! Remember when thou wert with Me on the mountain and didst witness the moaning of My heart and became acquainted with the ocean of My grief at what was inflicted upon Me by those who dwelt round about Me and in My vicinity. By the life of God! Were I to recount My tribulations, all things would cry out and weeping would be raised between the heavens and the earths. Say: None may enter this most exalted station save with a pure heart, a sanctified mind, and a radiant countenance. This is the station wherein was raised the call of Moses when He said: “O Lord, show me Thy beauty,” and heard: “Thou shalt not see Me,” and the station wherein was raised the call of the Spirit and the call of them that are nigh. Whoso entereth therein and doeth that which the All-Merciful hath not permitted, the denizens of the pavilions of holiness shall disavow him. To this testifieth every just and discerning one.</p>
<p>How often have We seen some in error and grievous sin, and concealed it as a grace from Us. Verily thy Lord is the Concealer, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. Ask thou God to grant them success in returning, or to make known to them the way of departure. This is better for him who hath believed in God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. Say: Take hold of the reins of your passions, then seek forgiveness that God may forgive you as a grace from His presence. Verily He is the All-Forgiving, the Mighty, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Thus have We expounded for thee, O My Name, that thou mayest remember My tribulations and what hath befallen Me at the hands of the heedless ones. Say: O My loved ones! Reflect when We named the prison the Most Great Prison and informed you of this at the beginning of Our arrival. Verily He is the Knower of Truth, informing you of what is to come. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Glory be upon the people of Baha who have not broken God’s Covenant and His Testament and have followed that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in His perspicuous Book.</p>

<p>O Kamal, upon thee be the Glory of God! He is God, the Most Mighty, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>O Kamal! Hearken unto the call of this Beauty Who hath been afflicted at the hands of the idolaters and findeth no helper nor supporter. They seek to slay Him with the swords of hatred, then raise an outcry among themselves that they might cause doubt to enter the hearts of them that have believed and taken the path unto this station.</p>
<p>By God! Such tribulation and hardship have befallen Me as no loving ear can bear to hear with steadfastness. At this the Pen of Command weepeth at My state, and the fingers of holiness at My suffering, and the Ancient Beauty behind the pavilion of sublime glory.</p>
<p>O Kamal! Hear My call and shun them that have disbelieved after having believed, and have denied God’s truth and sovereignty, and have remained far removed from the shore of this bounty. Raise up the pavilion of glory beside this expanse wherein hath been raised God’s tabernacle through this Name that hath shone forth from the horizon of holiness with wondrous sovereignty. Leave the people and what they possess, then turn thy face unto thy Lord. By God! All else are but bondsmen, nay rather they are as nothing, wert thou to know. Save he that hath laid hold on the Most Great Handle and hath detached himself from all the worlds.</p>
<p>O Kamal! This is the day wherein thou must make mention of thy Lord amongst the people and convey to them what We imparted unto thee when thou wert in Our presence and the Sun of Beauty shone upon thee from the horizon of this heaven which hath been, from time immemorial, exalted in God’s name with truth. Know thou that My brother desired to kill Me and shed My blood, but God sent the hosts of the unseen and prevented him from what he purposed. When he witnessed his own powerlessness, he then slandered this Youth, though thou knowest We had taught him, reared him, and protected him through all months and years. By God! We exalted his mention that he might aid his Lord, yet he chose to veil his face in fear for himself. When the breezes of assurance wafted from Our presence, he then arose to plot in such wise as would astound every person of keen insight. Thus did it befall the Youth from him who was created by His word and was raised up by His command, and God is cognizant of all things.</p>
<p>Take thou the pen and write concerning this Cause what God hath cast into thy heart, and verily the Spirit will aid thee at all times. Beware lest thou associate with those in whose hearts thou findest hatred for God and the Manifestation of His Self, and remain under impregnable protection. Grieve not at separation, but rather remind the people of the days of attaining My presence and what thou didst hear from the tongue of God, thy Lord, and what thou didst witness of the wonders of His power and sovereignty, that perchance the people might cast down the idols of their selves and take the path unto Him Who occupieth the throne.</p>
<p>The Glory be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and upon those who remain steadfast in love. Convey Our greetings unto thy wife and give her the glad-tidings of the mercy that hath been sent from God’s direction. And likewise unto thy mother who dwelleth with thee, that she may rejoice within herself. Thus hath the mercy of thy Lord encompassed thee and those with thee, whether female or male.</p>
<p>Then the tongue of God spoke concerning the mention of thy brother whom He named in the Kingdom of Names ‘Mahmud’, that it might be a remembrance and honor for him from that day until the Day when God shall come with a wondrous Cause. O Mahmud! Hear what the Tree of Eternity calleth thee from beyond the ocean of grandeur: “Verily, there is no God but Him, and He Who hath appeared is the Truth through His manifestation and sovereignty and His tidings which were, in all the tablets, supremely great.” Were We to mention to thee what We have witnessed in the path of God, neither couldst thou bear to hear it, nor could the Pen move to record it - and God is sufficient witness to this. O servant! Forget not My grief and tribulation, and remain steadfast in thy love for thy Lord, for those who disbelieved and associated partners with God have risen in opposition with great deceit and guile. O Mahmud! Deliver the Cause of thy Lord unto those whom thou findest heedless of Him, that perchance they may arise from slumber and remember this Wronged One Who hath fallen into a deep pit, having no helper to help Him nor any supporter to support Him. None bore His throne at that time save His own Self, and none was aware of this save God, with Whom is the knowledge of all things in clear and perspicuous tablets. Thus have We made mention of thee that thou mayest remember thy Lord at all times and be of those who are remembered in resplendent and glorious tablets. Know then, O Mahmud, that those who cannot distinguish right from left, nor sun from shadow, when they witnessed that the Sun had set behind the veils of imprisonment in this realm which was hidden beyond the veils of the Cause, arose in hypocrisy and opposed this Light that shone forth from the horizon of the universe with a command that encompassed all the worlds. Thou shalt not behold these people except as scattered dust in the air, having neither stability nor permanence. They followed what their souls and desires commanded them, and thereby went astray and led others astray from the path that was straight and true. Beware that thou turn not unto them nor to what proceedeth from their lying tongues. Turn away entirely from them, then set thy face toward a beauteous countenance. And the glory be upon thee and upon thy spirit and essence and thy family and upon those who have been attracted by the fragrances of the All-Merciful from the direction of this Paradise which was, by the truth in truth, luminous before the face of glory.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, unto Him belong grandeur and majesty</p>
<p>In these days brevity is preferred to lengthy exposition; a concise yet meaningful word from a volume of letters is more beloved, goodly and excellent with the friends of God. Therefore, this evanescent servant has grasped the cord of brevity lest it cause difficulty. I bear witness that there is no God but Him, in acknowledgment of His oneness and in recognition of His singleness. And I bear witness that He sent the Messengers and revealed the Books for the guidance of His creation and their attainment unto what He desired, until He sealed prophethood with Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and the Books with His Book. This servant beseeches his Lord to assist His friends and chosen ones in that which He loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p>Thereafter, your letter was received and as it was adorned with the mention of God, glorified be His majesty, it bestowed the food of joy, bounty and gladness. God willing, may you ever dwell beneath the shade of the Tree of Providence, occupied with the remembrance and praise of God and His chosen ones. This is the enduring bounty. The world has no constancy - its winds sometimes bear glad tidings and sometimes warnings. In spring one hears from it the tidings of life, and in autumn the warning of death, and its very changeability testifies to its transience and nothingness. Therefore the people of knowledge and insight have not attached their hearts to its ornaments nor been deceived by its trickeries. Blessed is he who has forsaken it and shunned it, and woe unto him who has turned towards it and clung to it. However, engagement therein for the benefit of the servants of God and for one’s own benefit to an extent that does not lead to the fire of greed and passion has been and is praiseworthy. The King of the Messengers - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - has said: “The one who earns his living is beloved of God.” Blessed are those souls whose deeds have been and are wholly for God and for His sake.</p>
<p>O brother! This evanescent one has thus far sent several letters to you. It is quite clear and evident that the heartfelt love of this servant has caused him to mention you time and again. How many gentlemen and friends have repeatedly taken the trouble to send letters, and this servant has not been able to reply, as this servant has taken up residence in a corner, holding fast to the cord of trust in God and subsisting on His provision, having no opportunity for discourse. Nevertheless, you had complained. This evanescent one would be content and grateful if in a year he could manage to write even one line in response to the friends. In any case, the purpose of this representation is that you and the friends should be content with one reply from this servant. God is witness and testifier that time and opportunity are rare, otherwise I would trouble you at all times. God willing, may you ever be assisted in the remembrance and praise of the Beloved of the worlds. And if you return to your lands, it would be beloved for the sake of remembrance of some. The rest of knowledge is with God, our Lord and the Lord of all things, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, and the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Mention hath been made of Jinab-i-Haji Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah]. Praise be to God, he hath been assisted through divine grace. God willing, may he be blessed in all conditions with the bounties of the All-Bountiful Lord. Likewise mention was made of Jinab-i-Karbila’i Muhammad-Aqa. All must turn unto God and occupy themselves with that which profiteth all who dwell on earth. Today is the day of reformation, and the human world is in need of remembrance and prayer, for the people of truth are few and surrounded while enemies encompass from all directions. Surely you have heard the account of Alexandria and Islam and others. The divine religion hath been weakened and the adversary strengthened, yet the cause and reason for this weakness which hath persisted over successive years remaineth unknown and hidden from all. For were they to become aware of its cause and reason, they would surely arise to remove it. The people are heedless and veiled, and this servant is silent and sorrowful. All must, with the utmost humility, submission, reverence and supplication, beseech from the Self-Sufficing Lord whatsoever shall cause the removal of corruption and the reformation of the world. I convey greetings to the friends and beseech God to aid them all in that which is befitting. The servant beseecheth his Lord to draw them near unto Him and to send down upon them from the heaven of His grace mercy and blessing from His presence. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Likewise I convey greetings to Jinab-i-Aqa ’Ali-Akbar and Karbila’i Mirza Aqa. All must conduct themselves with perfect wisdom. Mention is not permitted in that land, nor is writing, for the people are heedless and imagine that these recluses have been and are engaged in that which was and is unworthy of human dignity. We seek refuge in God from this, ask His forgiveness and turn repentant unto Him. Verily He is the All-Hearing, the Answering.</p>
<p>I convey greetings to Jinab-i-H and Sin. They have always been mentioned in this land. God willing, may they remain preserved beneath the shadow of God’s grace and be adorned and assisted with praiseworthy attributes and goodly deeds. This land is not free from movement, therefore the sending of letters is not permitted. God willing, may all the friends be assisted to observe the wisdom revealed in the Book and be aided to achieve that which is acceptable in the presence of God. Peace and remembrance be upon you and upon those with you whose names thou didst mention, and upon the servants of God, the unitarians.</p>

<p>Praise be to the One God, Who is worthy and befitting, Who in every day unites through His Most Exalted Word and separates through His decree. In truth, He has manifested the hidden mysteries within the hearts and breasts of His servants. The effects of His blessed Word aforetime have appeared - His exalted Word: “A party in Paradise and a party in the Blaze.” The people of the right hand are manifest and illumined with the lights of the Kingdom, while the companions of the left hand are tormented by the fire of greed, avarice and desire. No word was revealed aforetime except that its effects became manifest and its cause evident. Verily, the polytheists play with their vain imaginings and desire to extinguish it as did the peoples before them. Far, far be it! No power or might can prevent the influence of the Supreme Pen and the Most Exalted Word. The Lord - may our spirits be sacrificed for Him - hath said in the Tablet to the Sultan: “God hath made tribulation as morning dew upon His green pasture, and as a wick for His lamp through which earth and heaven are illumined.”</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God, Lord of the world and Desire of the nations! I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty which hath encompassed existence, and by the light of Thy Cause which hath illumined the hearts and souls, to aid the deniers to acknowledge, the heedless to turn, and the polytheists to recognize Thy unity, and enable them to return unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous. My God, my God! Thou seest Thy servant who desired to make mention of Thine Afnan who detached himself from all else but Thee and chose for himself a station near Thy mercy after he attained Thy presence, circumambulated Thy House, and achieved that which was ordained in Thy Books. O Lord! Thou seest him standing, speaking, remembering Thy mention, Thy praise and Thy service. O Lord! Strengthen him through Thy sovereignty, then assist him with the hosts of utterance throughout all possibility. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the Bestower. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Protector over what shall be and what has been.</p>
<p>May my spirit be a sacrifice for your remembrance, steadfastness and love! The blessed letter, which truly gladdened the heart and brought joy to the soul, perfumed the earth like spiritual musk. Its fragrance testified to that which befits this Day. After the expansion of body and exhilaration of spirit, it was brought before His presence and attained the honor of being heard. The Lord, may our spirits be His sacrifice, said:</p>
<p>“O Afnan! Upon thee be the peace of God, His grace, His glory and His mercy. Thy mention in these days brought joy. Although the unseemly deeds of the servants have darkened the world, yet the Ancient Beauty, being in Himself luminous, remains unchanged and bestows without receiving. O Afnan! The deniers have appeared with calumnies unprecedented, and despite their greed, avarice, vain desire, and betrayal of people’s wealth, they still claim truthfulness. They have joined the lying Sheikh Muhammad. That heedless one has imagined those two liars to be people of faith and devotion. Nay, by God! Soon their falsehood, infidelity and hypocrisy will be revealed. We beseech God to grant His servants new life through the Kawthar of thy love and remembrance. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty. The Glory from Us be upon thee, upon the son, upon those with you, and upon God’s righteous and sincere servants.”</p>
<p>Glory be to God! Despite people’s awareness of their own condition and the cause of their abasement among the people, they commit that which will forever remain recorded in the pages of time. Soon they shall see the recompense of their deeds. Verily God is the Just, the Ruler, the Avenger, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>I convey greetings to the friends of that land, especially to his honor the beloved of spirit and heart, the honored Aqa Siyyid Aqa, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God. I offer greetings and praise, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for eternal bounty and everlasting sustenance for him. Verily He is the Generous, the Munificent. May the apple of the eye of Ibn-i-Jenab-i-Na?ir, Jenab-i-Aqa Nuru’llah, Jenab-i-Aqa ’Ali-Akbar, Aqa Muhammad and Rif’at, upon them be the Glory of God, be adorned with the ornament of health and engaged in remembrance and praise. Each is mentioned and blessed with the favors of the Desired One. The servant beseeches his Lord to assist them in all conditions in that which befits His Cause and them. Verily He is the Helper, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Jenab-i-Darvish, upon him be God’s peace, praise be to God, arrived in perfect health and attained the presence. Blessed and joyous be he! We beseech God to assist him in all conditions to serve His Cause, to mention Him among His servants, to remain steadfast in His lands, and to make him among those who shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.</p>
<p>As for the account of ’Ishqabad, praise be to God, the late and elevated Haji Muhammad-Rida, upon him be the oceans of God’s favors and mercy, attained martyrdom. Jenab-i-Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’l-Karim, upon him be the Glory of God, has sent a letter regarding this matter. His honor Ism-i-Jud, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, will send a copy which will reach the blessed vision. The Glory, the Remembrance, the Mercy and the Praise be upon you all and upon those with you, and those who love you and hear your words for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is God – exalted be His glory, the Greatness and Power!</p>
<p>Praise sanctified beyond the bounds of time and space, and hallowed above mention of possibility and impossibility, befits that Beloved One Who, through a single call issued from the Source of His Will, adorned all contingent beings with a new creation. Through that call, the voices of all things were raised up, all bore witness to the oneness of His holy Being and became vocal in His remembrance. How lofty is that call, and how short do fall the minds of all created things from recognizing it! By it the mountains passed away as the passing of clouds, the Balance was set up, the Bridge was laid down, and there appeared the Day wherein all people stood before the Lord of all things. By it the Leaf spoke forth, the Rock cried out, the Divine Lote-Tree called aloud, and the Dove of Oneness cooed “The Kingdom is God’s this Day, the Lord of what was and what shall be!”</p>
<p>Thereafter, it is submitted that two letters from you arrived, and due to wisdom and certain matters their reply was delayed. The One True God bears witness that you have been and will continue to be remembered at all times. Your letter was presented before His Presence, and thus did the Tongue of the Beloved speak: “Blessed art thou for having attained unto recognition and for turning towards the Desired One, and for arising to serve His firm and wise Cause. He will assist thee as He assisted thee before, and will ordain for thee that which shall gladden the hearts of those who have turned towards Him. Grieve not over anything, for He will extend His bounty unto thee as He willeth. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.”</p>
<p>God willing, may you be occupied at all times with the mention and praise of the Beloved of all possibility. Regarding what you wrote about …, it is known that you have been and continue to be engaged, to the extent possible, in serving the Cause and assisting the loved ones of God. We beseech God to send down for you that which shall gladden the hearts of your loved ones and grieve the hearts of your enemies. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>As for what you mentioned about the Indian, his circumstances were and are known. Yet how strange that after all that was sent down to him from the heaven of favor, and despite being explicitly commanded to proceed to the house of [initial], he nevertheless delayed and was fearful. It was entirely clear and evident that had even an atom’s weight of harm been destined to befall him, such a decree would never have appeared from the horizon of the Cause. As was witnessed, glory be to God, the power of Truth is visible from the horizon of will at all times, yet most are heedless of perceiving it. The wine of vain imaginings hath so seized the people that they cannot distinguish truth from falsehood nor darkness from light, save whom God willeth, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to all the loved ones in that land. God willing, may they all at all times drink from the everlasting fountain of divine knowledge and remain oriented toward the horizon of His Cause. We beseech God to aid them in that whereby their mention shall endure through the perpetuity of His names and attributes. For this world is transient, especially in these days when all atoms cry out: “O ye who have eyes, see! O ye who have ears, hear! O ye who possess hearts and minds, understand!” How many souls in every moment have returned and are returning to dust. Strive ye to achieve such deeds as will cause the persistence of souls and the perpetuation of their mention, for today the mention of every soul in the Book is reckoned among the people of eternity. Blessed are they who possess understanding. These are the days of the manifestation of that which was in the Tablets, and the Suriy-i-Ra’is is witness and testimony thereto. God, the Exalted, the Great, hath spoken the truth. We have believed in Him and His Book which distinguisheth between truth and falsehood, light and darkness. And peace and blessings be upon His Beloved, through whom the Night Journey was adorned and every noble station was honored. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to Mulla ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory. This servant has observed what was mentioned in the letter of Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory. Praise be to God that they have been aided to follow God’s command, for all are enjoined to engage in craft, trade and agriculture. However, they must act according to what hath been revealed in the Book - that is, they should send something to their families and inform them. These deeds which all are commanded to perform in God’s Book have been and shall ever be the cause of glory and the source of blessing and the manifestation of bounty. God willing, may the True One, exalted be His glory, bestow blessing upon their craft and agriculture. Praise be to God, their mention hath been made in the Most Holy Court.</p>
<p>Likewise, I remember Aqa ’Ali-Muhammad. God willing, may he be occupied with the remembrance of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High in all conditions. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid him in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Once this servant was present before His countenance, and the Tongue of Grandeur addressed him specifically, saying that if he would act upon what was mentioned, he would surely attain infinite divine favors. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid him in this. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have heard and responded and attained unto clear certitude. Praise be to God, the Master of the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise be fitting and worthy of that Intended One through Whose finger of will the spheres of the kingdom of utterance are set in motion, and by Whose blessed Word the world is adorned and distinguished with the ornament of existence. The might of the powerful and the dominion of rulers have not hindered His Will, nor is His Purpose halted by the clamor of the parties of the earth who are outside the blessed Word of unity. Glorified be the Creator, glorified be the Maker! His decree flows, His command pervades, His Will penetrates, and His Purpose prevails. The banner “There is none other God but Him” has been raised, and the standard “He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth” is unfurled - and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. And blessings and peace be upon the waves of the ocean of His knowledge and wisdom, and the rivers of His recognition amongst His creation, and upon Him through Whom the outpourings of the world and the stations of nations were consummated - He Who was named with ?a following Mim, and with Mim preceding Dal. He is the One through Whom appeared the Most Beautiful Names and the Most Exalted Attributes. Were it not for Him, the decree of the House would not have been raised, nor would that which was preserved in the treasuries of the unseen have been manifested. And upon His family and companions, through whom the limbs of the world trembled and the hearts of nations were attracted, and through whom God’s path was made manifest in all else, and through whom the proof was completed and the bounty perfected, and the fear of God encompassed all regions, and His signs appeared in all lands. Exalted are their stations and ranks - through their attainment the teeth of Paradise and its maidens smiled, the trees and their branches swayed. Glory be unto Thee, O my God and the God of all who are in the unseen and the visible, and the Sovereign of existence, and the King of the Promised Day! I beseech Thee by the winds of the spring of Thy mercy and the swords of Thy power and might, to protect Thy monotheistic servants from the evil of the polytheists and oppressors. Then inscribe for them, by the Pen of Thy will, that which befits the heaven of Thy bounty and generosity. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Thereafter, I make mention to that spiritual beloved that, praise be to God, thy letter arrived like a herald bearing glad tidings, for it brought news of health and mention of well-being. Indeed, the station of both these is most exalted, for it hath been previously stated: “Knowledge of bodies and knowledge of religions,” with knowledge of bodies being given precedence, for if health be lacking, memory becomes impaired and the faculty of understanding grows cold. But when health is attained, both the outward and inward senses remain firm in their respective stations and engaged in their service. Glory be to God! Though each manifesteth in its own manner, no discord appeareth. Were one to attempt to fully describe the degrees of a single soul and all that it containeth, one would need to enumerate and compare every particle of creation. In truth, man is the greater world, and the world is but a lesser reflection of him, as hath been said: “Were I to speak of it, it would overwhelm minds; were I to write of it, many pens would break.” I fear these scattered utterances might lead matters to such a state that even after much back and forth the subject would remain incomplete and unfinished.</p>
<p>After being informed and reading it in the presence of His countenance, He uttered words that were such that if cast upon stone, the water of life would flow therefrom, and if cast upon clay, streams of wisdom and explanation would surge forth. That beloved one himself knows what the spirit says and does to the body, and what the spring breezes bestow upon the garden. This station needs no mention. In the Land of Mystery, in one place, He spoke this supreme utterance: “O Javad! Thou wert with Me and didst witness My patience and the waves of the ocean of My utterance. Reflect on what caused Me to raise the Call between earth and heaven.”</p>
<p>Verily, I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to assist that beloved one and adorn him with the ornament of health, and to soon grant that which is the purpose of his soul and the desire of his heart. The glad tidings of the well-being of the honored Afnan, upon them be all glory, have arrived from every direction. Whatever occurred was for the best. Thus has spoken the Lord. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, that they may ever dwell beneath the shade of His favor and repose under the shadow of His mercy.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about the two exalted brothers, upon them be the peace of God, their situation was presented. He said: Let them not be sorrowful. Praise be to God, they are adorned with the ornament of recognition and acknowledge and confess the Word of Unity. In this case, they must at all times drink from the ocean of joy and partake of the cup of delight. If for a time affairs proceed contrary to their wishes, it matters not, for assuredly God’s grace will make amends. None but God, exalted be His glory, is aware of the consummate wisdom. Say: Be confident in God’s grace and mercy. This is for him who holds fast to God’s mighty cord.</p>
<p>Regarding what they mentioned about the delay in Beirut and the loss incurred in taking the shop, let them not be sorrowful. Now they should consult with the honored beloved, the esteemed Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be God’s peace, and Aqa Muhammad Mu??afa. Whatever emerges from the consultation, let them act upon it. As commanded, you too should be present in that meeting. He said: Convey My greetings to the two brothers and say: He is with you and will assist you, and He is the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>Praise be fitting unto that Desired One, unto Whom the hearts of all seekers have been turned from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end, and glorification beseemeth that Worshipped One, unto Whom the eyes of all the peoples of the world, both past and future, are fixed, from Whom they implore, and unto Whom they return. Glory be unto God! Whatever we might say or write will remain unsaid, for speech is but the fruit of comprehension, and comprehension itself beareth witness to its own impotence. The pinions of those nigh unto God, despite all their ardor and ecstasy, their attraction and rapture, are debarred from this atmosphere, and the wings of men are bound and fettered. No thought or knowledge or intelligence can traverse beyond heaven and earth - all that exists lieth between these twain. Yet the guardians of the pavilion of grandeur and the sentinels of the sanctuaries of the Kingdom exist above a hundred thousand visible worlds. This heaven, compared to that heaven, is as the earth before this heaven - nay, I seek God’s forgiveness from every limitation and delimitation. The fettered wing knoweth not how to soar, and wings besmeared with clay cannot transcend their bounds.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee to transmute our despair into hope, and to accept from us what we have failed to achieve in Thy days. Were it not for Thy grace, Thy generosity and Thy bounty, who would be able to utter a word, or take a step, or turn toward any direction, or make any sign? Glory be unto Thee, glory be unto Thee! Exalted is Thy knowledge and mighty is Thy remembrance! It beseemeth Thee alone to make mention of Thyself and to describe Thy beauty, and this transcendeth the station of Thy servants, for they cannot attain unto Thy mysteries and that which Thy wisdom requireth. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>To continue: your letter was received. We offered thanks for your well-being and We beseech Him to assist you at all times and not deprive you of the breezes of His grace. May He bestow a bounty every moment and grant a gift every instant, for His door is open, His generosity evident, His grace manifest and His favor apparent. No sin of any among the first or the last has ever prevented His gifts. The pouring rains bear witness, the flowing rivers testify, the abundant blessings make clear, and the descended table speaks. For were He to withhold, none of what was mentioned would exist. Existence itself bears witness to this and testifies to it. After reading, it was presented. The Lord said: “O Rida, may God be pleased with you and you be pleased with Him. When these two states of pleasure are joined and achieved, there will appear from their horizon that which shall bestow light upon the world. For whosoever has drunk a drop from the ocean of divine good-pleasure and attained true bounties, they are recorded and inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Book of Names among the Concourse on High. Blessed is he who has drunk, and woe to the heedless. O Rida, We counsel you in all conditions to fear God, to goodly deeds, and to that which causes the manifestation of love and kindness. What does the Book say? That which benefits you. What has God commanded? That which brings salvation and bestows rest. The sayings are for us to hear, become aware, and walk the path - a path cleansed and purified by the breezes of divine favor. Now the truth has become distinct and the tongue is silent. The Command is in the hand of God, the Lord of all religions and Creator of all possibilities. If ?abri Effendi, upon him be the peace of God and His favor, is there, convey greetings from the Wronged One. Verily We send greetings upon him, his family and those with him, and We beseech God to grant him what he loves and desires. Verily He has power over all things. And peace be upon you, O Rida, and upon those with you, and upon those who act according to what they were commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds, through which God has separated truth from falsehood, and through which were raised the pavilions of security and safety and the tent of rest and tranquility. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.”</p>
<p>I send greetings to my beloved friend Sabri Effendi, upon him be God’s peace, favor and mercy. The paintbrushes, each of which was in truth a banner in the world of love and a standard in the realm of devotion, arrived. We planted them - let us see what fruit they will bear and who shall partake thereof. God knows best. How blessed are those souls who plant for God’s sake and leave it for God’s creatures. The springtime consumption and sustenance of a single being lasts but a day or two. We beseech God with utmost humility and supplication to grant us the strength to plant trees whose fruits will forever benefit and nourish the inhabitants of earth. In any case, praise be to God, the manifestations of his love are cherished and accepted. We beseech our Lord and our God to decree for him a goodly reward and make it a treasure for him in His presence. Verily He is the Guardian of those who place their hopes in Him. Praise be to Him, for He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones. If it would be possible with the utmost joy and fragrance to send a few seeds with the qualities that this servant has described, it would be most beloved, for they will be planted in his name and their fruits will be for all. If this would cause the slightest trouble, this ephemeral one would not be content. I send greetings to Qurratu’l-’Ayn - upon her and her mother be the peace of God, our Lord and the Lord of the throne and earth. And praise be to Him in the hereafter and in this world.</p>

<p>O Ibn Abhar! Hearken unto the call of God, Lord of destiny. He biddeth thee to make mention of Him and sing His praise, and to arise to serve His irrevocable Cause. One of My loved ones who attained My presence and drank from the Kawthar of reunion from the hand of My bounty hath appeared before the Wronged One. We have made mention of thee with a Tablet that calleth out between earth and heaven and summoneth all unto God, the Mighty, the Loving. God hath forgiven those who did what they were forbidden in the Book, through a command from God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Say: Fear ye God, O people, and be not like unto them who hear God’s command and judgment yet act not accordingly. Give thanks unto your Lord that He hath forgiven you ere mention was made of your deeds. He is verily the Forgiving, the Kind. We counsel you to observe trustworthiness and godliness, and that which hath been revealed in the Book of God, the Lord of existence.</p>
<p>O Ibn Abhar! Make mention of Husayn on behalf of the Wronged One and give him the glad-tidings of the favor of the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. Say: O Husayn! Hold fast unto the cord of wisdom and speak forth with utterance, lest the clamor of them who have denied both the seen and the unseen be raised. We have mentioned thee aforetime with verses that have enraptured hearts and minds. We beseech God to aid thee to make mention of Him and sing His praise, and to serve His irrevocable Cause.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Isma’il and give him the glad-tidings of My favor toward him and of that which hath been sent down for him from the Most Exalted Pen in this exalted station. Beware lest thou and the believers be kept back from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, by that which the people possess. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon thy son whose name hath appeared in this protected station.</p>
<p>We have desired to make mention of My handmaiden and My leaf, whose name We have mentioned and for whom We have revealed that which nothing in creation can equal, and We have written for her in the Crimson Scroll from My Most Exalted Pen that which none hath comprehended save God, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection. O Mother of Ashraf! By My life, the Maids of Paradise in the most exalted Paradise speak of thy virtues and qualities. Rejoice thou in My revelation of this most hidden mystery. Thy Lord is verily the Compassionate, the Kind, the Forgiving.</p>
<p>O Iman! Thou hast attained unto My mention time and again. Recognize the station of this supreme favor and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the world and Master of eternity! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name to assist me to act according to that which Thou hast revealed in Thy preserved Tablet. We have heard thy call and forgiven thee. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>We have desired at this time to make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Quli, that he may hold fast unto the Sure Handle, detached from the cords of the world. And I am the Counselor, the All-Knowing. Mention was made of thee before the Wronged One, and We have remembered thee with this wondrous Tablet that thou mayest rejoice and be of them that are thankful. Beware lest anything whatsoever keep thee back from the straight path of God.</p>
<p>O Messenger! The Lord of the Day of Judgement hath at this hour drawn nigh unto thee and made mention of thee in such wise that the fragrance of utterance hath been wafted throughout creation and the Spirit hath spoken in the highest paradise. Hearken, hearken, O ye people of grace and bounty! By God, the call of your Most Glorious Lord hath been raised between earth and heaven. And when they heard it, their conditions were transformed: some were thunderstruck, some were attracted, some placed their fingers between their teeth and looked to the right and left like one bewildered and dumbfounded, and some gave up their lives in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. Thus did My Most Exalted Pen move, and from it appeared that which tongues are powerless to mention, the pen to describe, and ears to hear. Blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of the verses and was of them that have attained.</p>
<p>O Siyyid Hamzih! We have made mention of thee before, and at this hour, as a token of grace from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Blessed is he who standeth firm whom the might of the world hath not caused to sit, blessed is the speaker whom the clamor of the nations hath not silenced, blessed is the seeker who hath aimed with his heart toward the ultimate goal, and blessed is the just one who hath dealt equitably in this most mighty, most holy, most glorious Cause. He is, verily, of the people of Paradise in the estimation of God, the Lord of the mighty throne.</p>
<p>O Ibn Abhar! Convey My greetings to the friends of God on behalf of the Wronged One, and give them the glad-tidings of the waves of the ocean of utterance of God, exalted be His glory. Praise be to God, today the Most Great Luminary is shining and the heaven of bounty is upraised. All must be set ablaze with the fire of the love of God and guide the people of creation to the horizon of the All-Merciful through wisdom and utterance. That which was forbidden before and they committed, the forgiveness of God, exalted be His glory, hath effaced it, and before the news reached them they attained unto divine mercy, pardon and forgiveness. This is attested by what We sent before. Verily thy Lord is the All-Informed, the All-Knowing. The Most Exalted Pen counseleth all in that which is the cause of salvation in the divine worlds.</p>
<p>O Ibn Abhar! By the lights of the Sun of Truth which shineth and gleameth from the horizon of the prison, the harm of the unseemly deeds that have been forbidden by the Most Exalted Pen in the Book returneth unto the Truth, and likewise causeth the Cause to be withheld from being made manifest amongst the servants. We beseech God that henceforth all may act according to what God hath decreed, that they may attain unto the Word of His good-pleasure. Today the hosts of God and His helpers are goodly deeds and praiseworthy qualities. With these hosts must the hearts, minds and breasts of the servants be conquered. Say: Take ye the fear of God with the hands of submission and contentment. Verily He is your supporter, your uplifter, your helper and your deliverer, on the part of God, your Lord and the Lord of the exalted throne.</p>

<p>May my spirit be a sacrifice for Thy love! The blessed, sublime and lofty letter which was the dawning-place of eternal joy and boundless gladness reached this evanescent servant. And as it conveyed news of thy arrival and the well-being of thy radiant self, it brought forth joy beyond all measure and count. Praise be to God that through the assistance of the divine protecting hands thou hast arrived in that known land in utmost comfort, protection and health. We praise God for this great and glorious blessing and this mighty gift, for which it behooveth that the spirit of this poor, evanescent servant be sacrificed. But what can I say? After separation from that Beloved One, how the burning fire of separation hath been kindled in the heart and soul of this evanescent one in such wise that no pen can reckon it nor tablet bear it. It is a fire that, no matter how much the waters of remembrance are poured upon it, they but increase its heat, blaze and intensity, and it shall not be quenched save by the water of reunion. We beseech God to grant it what it desireth and to let it witness what it seeketh and hopeth for, for verily He answereth him who calleth upon Him.</p>
<p>I implore the True One, exalted be His glory, to ordain perpetual union and nearness. May ye continually take and drink from the hands of grace and bounty the never-ending chalice of reunion with the everlasting Beauty - drink ye! drink ye! And this servant sayeth: May it be pleasing unto you! May it be pleasing unto you! May I be a sacrifice unto thee - there is no end to this sea of longing that could be reached by the vessels of mention and utterance, especially at this pressing time when there is no opportunity for presentation and temerity, as at this moment [name] hath arrived and urgently requesteth a petition. Now this servant is perplexed whether to present himself in the Most Holy Presence and submit the written matters, that perchance from the ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance that which causeth the water of life to flow may be bestowed, or to defer it to another time and trouble thy noble mind with these unworthy words, for time is short and there is no opportunity for what [I desire]. The former is preferable, and He is the Lord of the hereafter and the former times.</p>
<p>Say: O thou who art young in years but mature in faith! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Verily He is the Speaker, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have received thy glorification and have sent thee glorification from this luminous horizon. Upon thee, O rose of the paradise of Samandari, be My glorification and My splendor at all times. That which thou didst write hath been presented before the Throne. We have read it and accepted it. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Generous. May the Glory rest upon thee and upon thy father and thine uncle, then upon those who are in that House wherein the mention of My Beautiful Name hath been raised. The brother of Ahmad - upon them both be the Glory of God, the Single, the One - hath been named before the Throne ‘the Luminous One.’</p>
<p>To that most revered and honored companion, namely [his] eminence Haji, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s blessings - I present this expression of pure devotion and most sublime, exalted and glorious praise. Though outwardly separation has occurred and they have taken leave, yet most times they are remembered in the presence of the Truth and are the object of the gaze of the Most Great Scene and the glances of favor from the Lord of Destiny, and continue to be so. The Branches of the Divine Lote Tree and the Twigs of the Sacred Tree of Glory specifically instructed this servant to convey their mention and praise. Similarly, all the beloved of God, collectively and individually, send their praise and glorification to that loved one and [his] eminence Haji - upon you both be Baha’u’llah’s blessings and favors.</p>
<p>To my spiritual friend, [his] eminence my brother, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s eternal blessings, I present sacred, transcendent and sublime praise. Its conveyance depends on that loved one’s favors - whether to deliver it personally or to send and convey it through correspondence. Furthermore, a letter arrived from [his] eminence Haji and [his] eminence Haji Aqa Baba, upon them be Baha’u’llah’s blessings, written from Aleppo. Praise be to God, they arrived safely and in good health in that land with the people of Baha’u’llah, upon them be His blessings. This too was cause for complete joy. Blessed are they for having migrated unto God and traveled by His leave and command. We beseech God to assist them in serving Him and promoting His Cause as befits them in the days of their Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Another request: in every city where you meet the friends of God, convey wondrous and sublime praise on behalf of this evanescent servant. May the Glory be upon you and upon all the beloved of God.</p>
<p>The Servant of God</p>
<p>19 Jamadiyu’l-Avval 1291</p>
<p>May I be your sacrifice. The two Tablets specifically for [his] eminence Aqa Mirza Hasan and Aqa Mirza Siyyid Rida were not sent, as it was observed they would break within the envelope. God willing, they will be sent soon with anyone who sets out. That loved one may give this glad tidings and be assured.</p>

<p>He is the Most High, the Most Exalted, the Most Supreme!</p>
<p>We remind those who drink from the Salsabil of love and traverse the desert of affection of words that will guide pure hearts to the ocean of oneness, draw assured souls to the eternal paradise, lead the figuratively poor to true wealth, bestow the crown of everlasting glory upon the spiritually abased, and shower divine knowledge and holy wisdom upon all created things, were the people to turn to the wondrous rays of Beauty.</p>
<p>It is clear and evident to every person of insight that the purpose of the creation of beings has been and ever shall be the knowledge of God. It is manifest and certain that this knowledge cannot be perfected through imagination, nor completed through conjecture and words, for in the realm of words all differing sects are partners. As may be observed, all the dwellers of earth, one and all, consider themselves creatures and recipients of sustenance, and deem themselves to be dwelling beneath the shadow of God’s names and attributes. Thus in every nation and religion there exist certain names which they consider to be channels of divine grace and means of divine mercy.</p>
<p>In this regard, therefore, all who dwell on earth are alike and similar, differing only in the names they use, just as the tongues of all the earth’s inhabitants differ, and likewise the names of their chosen ones and saints differ. In such circumstances, the people of truth must needs have a conclusive proof and an established evidence and station, that they may be distinguished from all created things and not be content with that to which people cling. For all today walk according to their own desires while attributing these to God, exalted be His mention. All are immersed in error while calling it guidance.</p>
<p>Thus did the Supreme and Most Exalted Sovereign establish for Himself a touchstone and criterion, that it might become known which soul has attained to the knowledge of God and which has remained deprived. The day when this divine touchstone appears is known as the Day of Distinction, for on that day the truthful are distinguished from the false, and the lover from the deceitful. This touchstone is the manifestation of the divine meaning in a new temple and novel attire. Thus, whosoever acknowledges and submits to that absolute meaning in this new and glorious attire is truthful in his cause; otherwise he was and shall remain a worshipper of words and fancies. For the purpose of mention and words has been the knowledge of God, and one who has not recognized the Source in His manifestation - what value or effect could the derivative possibly have?</p>
<p>The acts of God are in themselves proof of His truth, as has been and is observed - what mighty matters and great tribulations have occurred and continue to occur, such that no one had or has the capacity to bear even a drop thereof, yet He alone has borne them all. No testimony has been or is more conclusive than these matters. Furthermore, beyond these stations, the Truth is distinguished from all the world and its peoples by His every movement and stillness, such that any eye that is cleansed of the dust of jealousy will, upon mere encounter and observation, recognize Him, and every heart that is sanctified from the veils will instantly attain unto His knowledge, distinguish truth from aught else save Him, and discern the difference between them. Today all the mystics who have claimed and still claim to possess mystical knowledge have contented themselves with the knowledge of an imaginary Invisible One, and with a mere word have they satisfied themselves in lieu of the spiritual realms. They have not yet grasped this truth: that every invisible must have a visible manifestation, and every word must possess a meaning. A word bereft of meaning can never yield fruit, and an imaginary invisible can never bestow wealth. Therefore the people of truth who hold fast unto the Truth must recognize the Beloved in His new attire, and hasten with heart and soul to His love, that they may be set ablaze with the fire of His love and return to the Source of His presence, which is the goal of immortal hearts and the dawning-place of the resplendent Sun. This is the revelation of the Bayan in the heaven of utterance. Therefore, O friends, hearken unto the call of your true Friend, and occupy not yourselves with the things of this world and whatsoever is therein. Deprive not yourselves of attaining the presence of the Beauty of your Beloved, Who desireth for you naught save everlasting dominion and an eternal kingdom. He hath never desired aught for Himself, and hath had no purpose except the manifestation of justice and the attainment of His loved ones to the eternal, holy gathering-places. God sufficeth as a witness, and those who possess the knowledge of the Book. Now some effort is needed, that the Friend be not seen as a stranger, and the rose be not considered as a thorn. The fragrance of the rose is sufficient witness for it, and the very being of the Friend is adequate proof. I hope, God willing, that a soul from among the people of truth in that land may arise with divine love and gather all the people of that land on the shore of the ocean of oneness, that all the people of that region may become as one soul, and the coldness of remoteness and separation may be wholly transformed and eliminated by the warmth of nearness and union. All this is from the grace of God, the Most Exalted, the Most High. And peace be upon him who followeth guidance.</p>

<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath come with the truth is the Lord of all worlds and the Most Great Name through Whom was revealed that which lay hidden in God’s knowledge and concealed from the eyes of men. Through Him the trumpet was sounded and those in the graves arose, and the trees proclaimed that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Great. But for Him the mysteries would not have been revealed, the trees would not have spoken, and the hidden pearls would not have emerged from the seas. Thus did the Tongue of Grandeur speak while in the palace which God made the point of circumambulation for those near unto Him and the sincere ones.</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified from mention and eulogy, beseemeth the Lord of the Kingdom of Names Who, through the Most Great Name, aided the world and guided it to His straight path and His mighty announcement. Through one exalted word He so attracted the pure hearts and illumined souls that it caused wonderment among the Concourse on high. Exalted be His dominion, exalted be His command, glorified be His majesty and His power, and there is no God but Him.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest toward the horizon of the Revelation! Hearken unto the call of Him Who conversed on Sinai. Verily it hath been raised from the prison of Akka, and from it the breezes of revelation have wafted among the servants and the fragrances of inspiration between heaven and earth. Thus hath the matter been decreed from before God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: O people, by God the Day hath come and the Lord of the Kingdom is established upon the throne of Revelation, speaking that which hath caused the hearts of the sincere ones to take flight. This is the Day promised in God’s Books of old, and this is the Cause before which, when it appeared, the necks of the deniers were bowed down.</p>
<p>O Shah Khalil! The Wronged One hath turned toward thee from His Most Great Prison and hath mentioned thee in such wise as nothing on earth can equal. To this testifieth He Who speaketh in every state “Verily He is God, there is none other God but I, the Single, the All-Informed.” Take hold of God’s Book with the power bestowed by Him, detached from those who have mounted the steed of passion and committed that which hath caused the Pen of Baha to lament in this glorious and wondrous station. Certain souls have spoken concerning this Wronged One that which hath caused the divine Eye of Justice to weep.</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Aid Thy loved ones to turn unto Thee and to hold fast to the cord of Thy oneness. O Lord! Illumine their hearts with the light of Thy knowledge and their eyes with the vision of Thy signs and their tongues with Thy praise and glorification. Thou art He through Whose Name Thou hast raised the banner of “He doeth whatsoever He willeth.” There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Khalil! Upon thee be the glory of thy Lord, the All-Glorious. That which thou didst send to the presence of My Most Great Branch and His Honor, the Name of Bounty, hath been presented before Our face. We have mentioned thee in this perspicuous Tablet. Convey My greetings to the loved ones of God and say: Know ye your station and preserve it through the name of the Peerless Friend, for thieves have been and still are lying in wait. Blessed is the face that hath turned toward the Most Sublime Horizon and the heart that hath turned unto Him. This is the Day of steadfastness. All must manifest themselves in such wise that no opportunity be left for the deniers and the perverters to turn away or raise objections. Ere long, all that is visible shall be rolled up by the hand of power like a scroll, and that which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen specifically for the loved ones shall become as manifest as the sun. Say: O friends! Of what are ye afraid? Of whom do ye fear? In the Tablet of the world there hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen that which hath been and still is the cause of the awakening of all who are on earth. Blessed is he who hath taken the choice wine of revelation from the hand of the bounty of his Lord and hath drunk thereof once in His name and again in remembrance of Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.</p>
<p>My handmaiden Mar?iyyih hath been and is mentioned in My presence. Say thou: A death unto the heedless! An anguish unto the frozen ones! The King of Days hath come! That Hidden One hath appeared by name! That Perfect Treasury hath come! Despite the desire of the ignorant ones! These words have repeatedly flowed from the Supreme Pen that perchance they may cause joy and gladness to the hearts and souls of the loved ones. That which floweth from the Most Sublime Pen is sweet and pleasant, and in the conjunction of these two are signs for the fair-minded and evidences for the sincere. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon those who have turned with radiant faces toward the Most Sublime Horizon and have said: “Here am I, O Lord of all beings! Here am I, O Thou Who art the Goal of all in the heavens and on earth!”</p>

<p>O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Word through which were enraptured the people of Baha, and by Thy Most Glorious Name through which hearts were drawn to Thy Most Sublime Horizon, and by that Name through which Thou didst transform darkness into light and tyranny into justice, and through which the ships of Thy Cause did sail upon the sea of Thy will - to aid Thy servants to turn unto Thee and to direct themselves towards Thee. O Lord! Withhold not Thy creatures from hearkening unto the call of the Tree planted in the Most Exalted Paradise, nor from beholding that which hath appeared from the horizon of Thy bounty, O Thou Who art the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens! Thou art He through Whose generosity all created things have testified, and through Whose grace all contingent beings have borne witness. There is none other God but Thee, the Commander, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Lord! Thou seest Thy servant clinging to the cord of Thy grace and holding fast to the hem of Thy mercy. He desireth for himself naught but what Thou hast desired, and he, despite his weakness and poverty, wisheth to make mention of one of Thy Afnans who hath arisen wholly to serve Thy Cause, who hath turned to Thy horizon time and again, and who didst aid Thee when the Seat of Thy Throne was in the Most Great Prison through that which the hands of the nations had wrought. Verily, all grace is in Thy hands and bounty is within Thy grasp. Thou ordainest for whomsoever Thou willest whatsoever Thou pleaseth. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy tribulations and by what hath befallen Thee at the hands of the enemies of Thy Self, to ordain for him what Thou hast ordained for the Manifestations of Thy Self and the Daysprings of Thy Cause. Thou art He Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleaseth. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>My spirit be offered up for your detachment, and for your steadfastness and service. The trace of thy most elevated pen which was adorned with the love of God and illumined with the lights of supreme steadfastness was received, and with its two wings it soared until it was presented before His presence and was read, and when it was completed and concluded, the Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, spoke:</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Hearing, the All-Responding</p>
<p>O thou who soarest in My atmosphere, who uttereth My praise, who standeth in service to My Cause, who holdeth fast to the cord of My loving-kindness, and who drinketh the choice wine of My love! Give thanks unto God for having adorned thee with the ornament of distinction among His friends and for having accepted from thee that which proceeded from thee. Verily, He desired thee and loved thee from the earliest days. O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that thou hast been and art remembered in the presence of the Wronged One. Today the brocade of the Book of Divine Favor is adorned with this blessed word that was revealed aforetime: “Whoso is for God, God is for him.” The Wronged One beareth witness that thou hast attained unto this most exalted station and this supreme summit. We beseech God to assist thee under all conditions in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>We have accepted what thou didst offer purely for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds. Convey My greetings unto My Afnan and remind them of that which My Most Exalted Pen hath spoken, and illumine them with the lights of the Orb of My loving-kindness. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Compassionate, the Generous. There is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>To the honored ladies of the Afnan - the sister, her daughter, and her granddaughter - we convey greetings and glory. Praise be to God that they have attained unto that which was mentioned and recorded in God’s Book, both past and future. May the glory that shineth resplendent from the horizons of the heaven of grace and bounty be upon you and upon those who are with you, who love you, and who hearken unto your words concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of this wondrous Day.</p>
<p>Though your honor is not physically present, you have been and are mentioned in a remembrance that hath surpassed all remembrances of the world. The honored Mr.&nbsp;Haji Siyyid ’Ali, upon him be the glory of God, arrived with your letter. All that was written therein attained the honor of being heard and was adorned with the ornament of acceptance. By command, each of the mentioned Afnan of the Blessed Tree attained unto that which hath no likeness or parallel. This evanescent servant also conveyeth greetings and glory to the honored and esteemed masters - may my spirit be sacrificed for their love - and I beseech from the True One for them that which beseemeth His grace, favor, generosity and bounty. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those who are with you and who hearken unto your words concerning God’s momentous Call, the Most High, the Most Great. And praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having enabled Thy loved ones and the leaves of the tree of Thy love to do that which beseemeth them in Thy days, namely to stand firm in Thy Cause and to arise in a manner befitting their kinship to Thy Beauty and the Manifestation of Thy Oneness. Blessed is he who hath been named with the Name that hath borne tribulations in every age and dispensation in the path of Thy love, and blessed is the leaf whom Thou hast related to Thyself and mentioned in the tablets of Thy glory from the Pen of Thy bounty. Thou knowest, O my God, when her petition and letter reached Us, wherein her cry and lamentation were raised concerning Thy Cause and what befell the Beauty of Thy oppression, how the fire of grief seized the very elements of this ephemeral one. Yet, O my God, I was gladdened from another perspective when I saw her steadfast in Thy love and firm in Thy Cause and obedience. Blessed is she for having fulfilled Thy promise and not broken the Covenant on this Day of Separation. Therefore, O my God, assist him and that leaf in all that Thou lovest and approvest, for verily Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>The missive from that honored one, from whose words wafted the fragrance of love for the Ancient Lord, reached this evanescent servant, as did the petition of the leaf which had been submitted to the threshold of the Divine Throne, together with the letter she had written. Blessed and sanctified be that honored one and that leaf who were not prevented by the cawing of the crows from the Beauty of the Lord of the Worlds, and who were not veiled by the waters of the statements of rejected souls from the sweet stream of the utterance of the Merciful One and the flowing waters of the knowledge of the Glory of the All-Glorious. This is naught but from the divine, invisible confirmations and the hands of pure bounty which preserved that honored one from that which befitteth not thy kinship to Him, and confirmed thee in that which beseemeth the manifestation of His favors unto thee.</p>
<p>Another supplication that the beloved leaf addressed to the Most Holy Court, and a letter that they had written, were both presented in full before His most exalted presence. The Wronged Beauty is witness that what heat was kindled in the heart upon reading them, for whatsoever was written and spoken was for God and for His sake. Every word that issues forth from the mouth with sincerity for God’s sake has been and will ever be effective throughout all existence. What more can I say of how many manifestations of grace and appearances of the favors of the Beauty of Unity I witnessed regarding your honor and that leaf. By God! Were I to attempt to recount them, the ocean would be exhausted ere I could complete mention of what I witnessed of the Ancient Beauty’s favors toward you. God willing, may they ever be confirmed by God’s special favors, which today are the confirmations of steadfastness in His Cause, and be gladdened and rejoiced through His wondrous favors. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Forgiving. The Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet specifically for your honor and that leaf hath been revealed from the Source of God’s Will and sent. Convey infinite greetings from this evanescent one to all the friends in that land, especially to the honored friends Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’llah and Aqa Mirza Ahmad, upon them be the glory of God and His favors, whose mention hath always been in your book and who have been mentioned at the Divine Throne. Convey infinite greetings to them on behalf of this servant. And regarding their request for a special Tablet, it was presented and the utmost favor was shown regarding them. God willing, hereafter a sublime Tablet specifically for them will be revealed and sent. Since regarding this bearer’s journey it was arranged that only replies to supplications would be sent, therefore it was not sent this time. And regarding the question about the blessed verse “Verily the Ta’ hath entered and from the land of Fa’ My Herald hath appeared,” there was no opportunity to specifically present it before the Most Holy Court, but what this servant hath understood from this blessed verse and other verses revealed in the divine Tablets is that it refers to the appearance of unacceptable souls in certain lands and is not specific to that land. We beseech God to protect all from the schemes of the schemers and the deceptions of the fabricators and liars. And regarding what was written about the hidden matter, God willing, details will be presented and afterwards an answer will be sent. And regarding what was written about the non-receipt of those funds, this servant was greatly surprised that Jinab-i-Amin delayed in the matter of the Truth. This is extremely strange from him. These days they have not yet arrived. Furthermore, after these detailed submissions, Jinab-i-Aqa Hasan, upon him be the glory of God, arrived and delivered your bundle of letters. God willing, the reply to that will arrive soon too. Convey infinite greetings from this evanescent servant to all the friends who have drunk from the cup of love and assurance and become free and detached from all else but God. The Branches of the sublime, impregnable, exalted divine Lote-Tree and the Twigs of the divine Tree remember, praise, glorify and extol your honor with wonderful spiritual remembrances and sublime, most glorious salutations, as do all the loved ones of God, both those who circle round and those who are imprisoned - all convey infinite greetings to your honor. Convey exalted and most glorious greetings and remembrances to your children and household, all of them. Indeed remembrance, glory and radiance be upon you.</p>

<p>Most esteemed friend, his honor Agha Muhammad Rida may take note.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His station in greatness and power.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of God - exalted be His glory - in creating creation hath been the manifestation of bounty, mercy and loving-kindness, that all might be nurtured by the hands of grace and be adorned with the ornament of goodly character. The cause of ease, tranquility and assurance in the world of existence hath ever been and shall continue to be virtuous conduct. This station is an unfathomable ocean - were this evanescent one to attempt to make mention of its fishes, pearls and hidden treasures, he would need to compose a book equal to the books of the people. Every discerning mystic beareth witness to that which hath been mentioned, and every informed scholar doth testify thereto. Blessed are they who observe with fairness and hold fast to justice. In such case no matter shall remain obscure, nor shall doubts and imaginings veil them. This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth God - exalted be His glory - to aid this servant and His loved ones to achieve that which is the cause and means for the manifestation of true humanity in the world. Verily He hath power over whatsoever He willeth.</p>
<p>Thereafter, two letters were received from your honor, and as they indicated and bore testimony to the well-being of that esteemed friend, they bestowed the gift of joy and granted the food of gladness. However, that honored one should not be saddened by the delay in reply, for as you know, this servant is surrounded by diverse occupations, especially in these days when he must attend now to the garden, now to the ornamental grounds, and now to the farm, regarding certain matters pertaining to the garden. Otherwise I would have considered it necessary to reply to that friend, and God sufficeth as witness. God willing, may we arise with pure hearts, sanctified souls, and steadfast feet to serve humanity. Rancor and hatred beseemeth not the people of truth, even if it be toward those who have gone astray. This is the straight path, the mighty cord, and the command of God, the Just King, the Manifest Truth.</p>
<p>You wrote mentioning the esteemed Sabri Effendi and his displeasure. God is my witness that this servant has heard nothing about this until now. For some time I have been residing outside the city at Bahji. When Aqa Ghulam-’Ali came, after receiving permission he attained my presence and met with this servant for about ten minutes before departing. And when Sabri Effendi came, this servant was at [Zeib], and after arriving at the garden I heard that he had come. This servant went specially to Akka just to see him, but they said he had left early in the morning. However, in Akka there were certain statements attributed to Haji Aqa - God knows the truth - and this servant immediately returned to the garden. In truth, in these days the planting of trees is dearer to this evanescent one than the planting of souls, for faithfulness, like the phoenix, is rare. Glory be to God! Sabri Effendi became friends and acquainted with these souls here through love - how could they abandon what came before and cling to that which lacks it? This servant denies this matter unless proven by clear evidence. When news arrived from Beirut of Sabri Effendi’s coming, God is my witness that great joy and delight appeared and I was awaiting his arrival so that I could inquire about his days of travel and journeying through the lands. However, after his arrival they specially summoned him to Mazra’ih with the intention of meeting him there in the evening after tea, but it became known that he had asked permission and departed, and afterwards went to Nazareth. This servant was greatly surprised, but considering that all matters are bound to their appointed times, remained silent and waiting for the time when the sweet fragrances of love and fellowship would waft. This servant remains firm upon the ancient covenant and pact, and God willing shall remain steadfast. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to illumine his departure with the light of return, for at the time of his leaving he was very loving and enkindled. And if any slanderer has spoken, they surely had no purpose but to cause mischief. God willing this too shall become evident, for the rays of the Sun of Truth have endless manifestations, and when its light appears, convey on behalf of this servant greetings and salutations to him. God willing may he be confirmed and assisted in that which God loves, and be adorned and blessed with divine favors. The cord of this servant’s friendship does not appear to be weakened by such things. Although human beings have not been and are not free from mistakes, through God’s grace - exalted be His glory - there is hope that He will not make this servant a cause for extinguishing the light of love. And I beseech Him to graciously grant me the appearance of that which increases His light and radiance. Verily He is the Powerful, the Hearer, the Responder.</p>
<p>I convey greetings to my honored friend, son of him who ascended to the Supreme Companion. May he be confirmed and assisted in that which leads to the exaltation and elevation of his station. From Alexandria his honored brother has sent a letter which was forwarded - let it be delivered. This servant beseeches his Lord to assist those who have turned towards Him in that which He loves and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Lord of all beings and the Master of the hereafter and the former times. May his honor Aqa Ali Muhammad be engaged, God willing, in joy and fragrance, and be protected from pain and illness. May the saplings in his garden, God willing, be verdant and flourishing from the rain of divine favors in this spiritual springtime. Convey greetings on my behalf to his mother. Peace and Glory be upon you and upon those who are with you.</p>

<p>O thou who gazest upon the countenance of God, exalted and glorified be He! In most of His Tablets He hath enjoined wisdom upon His loved ones. Nevertheless, certain souls who claim attachment to the Truth speak of that which God hath not permitted. Although the triumph of God’s Cause in this Revelation hath been through praiseworthy conduct, goodly attributes, wisdom and utterance, yet some have perverted the meaning of triumph according to their own desires. The triumph of the Cause hath never been, nor shall it ever be, through disputation, contention, conflict and corruption. God is quit of those who speak of their own accord and bid men to do what they themselves have been forbidden in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The triumph of Truth and the propagation of His Cause have been and shall ever be through wisdom and utterance, and utterance must needs be proportioned to the capacity of each soul. Say: O friends! It hath been revealed and sent down aforetime from the Supreme Pen that ye should scatter the seeds of divine wisdom and understanding in pure and goodly soil. Ye are spiritual physicians and true sages. Men are afflicted with the maladies of ignorance and unwisdom. The ailment of each one must needs be determined, and then treatment administered with the healing remedy of the Most Great Name according to his capacity and measure. For instance, should one speak at the outset concerning Divinity to one of the followers of the Qur’an who is afflicted with the malady of vain imaginings and whose highest understanding is confined to the station of leadership and guardianship, he would surely perish, for he hath failed to comprehend the meaning of the Qur’anic verses concerning the Day of Resurrection and the appearance of Truth from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of Unity, nay, he hath not even caught their fragrance. Therefore, at first one must speak with him according to his capacity until he advanceth from the stage of childhood to the station of maturity and becometh able to bear the Most Exalted Word that hath shone forth from the Dayspring of the Will of the Lord of Names.</p>
<p>I swear by the Sun of the horizon of My sanctity! The harm and trials inflicted upon this Wronged One by the rulers, divines and peoples of the earth have never concerned Me. Rather, what has caused grief and affliction are the deeds that have been manifested by those who claim to love the Truth. Certain souls have turned towards the Most Holy Court without permission, and upon returning have spoken according to their own desires, attributing these to the Truth. Thus have some seekers become veiled by the deeds of others. God has commanded all to be known for righteousness, religion, trustworthiness, truthfulness, purity, humanity and faithfulness. Nevertheless, they have acted with the utmost cunning and deceit in appropriating people’s wealth. Some have entered various lands declaring that the property of others is permissible for the friends to take and that the law of the Book has been abrogated. We seek refuge in God from such rejected utterances and abhorrent deeds! The people of truth have no attachment or concern for their own wealth, let alone allowing their pure hands to be sullied with the property of other peoples. No one’s property is lawful unto another. Whosoever has today drunk from the waters of sanctity and turned towards the horizon of divine revelation must not stain his radiant hem with the dust of treachery. He who departs from this station has made mention of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High a snare for his own desires. Say: O My loved ones! Shun him and his like. Thus doth this momentous announcement inform you. Such harm hath touched My station that the Most Exalted Pen is occupied with these words. Weep then for My hurt and tribulation, O thou who gazest upon My countenance and speaketh My praise!</p>
<p>Say: The friends of God must be manifestations of divine wealth and contentment. The fragrance of sanctification and detachment must at all times waft from them for the purification of the world’s peoples, that every possessor of smell may discover from them what they find not from others. Blessed is he who hath heard the call of the Wronged One and followed what he was commanded in this mighty Tablet. God’s forbearance hath caused some to become heedless, for whenever anyone outwardly proclaimed their faith, the outpourings of the ocean of grace were bestowed upon them, and later whatever appeared from them contrary to God’s good-pleasure was veiled. This forbearance and concealment became the cause of their heedlessness and boldness, to such extent that they considered God unaware and negligent. Say: Nay, by God! He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge and with Him is a guarded tablet. Much unwisdom hath appeared and continueth to appear from the loved ones. You must, according to your capacity, make the divine friends aware, that all may become informed of wisdom, teaching, and those matters that lead to the exaltation of the Cause.</p>
<p>Thy letter was previously received and We heard from it thy call to the Lord of the worlds and found from it the fragrance of thy sincerity and ardor in the love of God, the Lord of the knowing. Verily, thou hast a station with the Throne. Be thankful unto God for this great bounty. We have sent down this Tablet for thee that thou mayest inform the people of its contents, that perchance they may arise to fulfill what they were commanded in the Book of God, the Most Holy, the Sanctified, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Convey My greetings to My loved ones who have been blessed by the breaths of My Pen and illumined by the lamp of My providence shining upon the worlds. Glory be upon thee and upon those with thee who hearken unto what thou speaketh concerning the Cause of God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>

<p>O Pen! Time and again have sorrows come to pass that have caused the people of Baha to grieve–they who have believed in God, the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens, who have soared on the wings of recognition in the atmosphere of certitude, and who have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken throughout creation. O My Most Exalted Pen! Calamities have befallen thee that have caused the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise and the highest Heaven to lament, and those who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide to weep. Hear My call, then make mention of the calamity by which sorrows have encompassed My Name, the Self-Subsisting, and whereby patience and forbearance have fled and been scattered throughout the lands.</p>
<p>Say: O Most Exalted Leaf, mentioned in the Crimson Book! Thou art she whom God created to arise for the service of His Own Self, the Manifestation of His Cause, the Dawning-Place of His Revelation, the Dayspring of His signs, and the Source of His laws. He strengthened thee in such wise that thou didst turn wholly unto Him when the servants and handmaidens turned away. Thou didst hear His most sweet call and didst respond to it, and thou wert with Him in all conditions, until thou didst migrate from the Land of ?a to Zawra, and from Zawra to the Land of Mystery, and thence to this Prison which hath been designated by every name by God, the Creator of the heavens. Thou wert, during the nights and days, blessed with His presence, gazing upon His countenance, circling round His throne, hearing His call, dwelling in His house, clinging to His cord, and holding fast to the hem of the robe of His bounty and grace, until destiny overcame thee with that which was written in the Book of God, the Lord of the former and latter generations. Thou didst endure its hardships until thou didst sacrifice thy spirit in His path before His face. Blessed art thou, O My handmaiden, O My leaf, who art mentioned in My Book and inscribed by My Most Exalted Pen in My Scriptures and Tablets.</p>
<p>I testify that thou didst drink the choice wine of understanding from the cup of utterance, and didst endure in His path whatsoever befell thee of hardships and trials. We bear witness that thou didst believe in Him and in His Books and His Messengers and in that which He hath sent down from the heaven of His Will and the atmosphere of His Purpose. Rejoice thou at this moment in the Most Exalted Station and the highest Paradise and the most glorious Horizon, inasmuch as the Lord of Names hath made mention of thee. We testify that thou didst attain unto all good, and God hath raised thee to a station round which circle all glory and every lofty station.</p>
<p>Thou wert lying upon thy couch while the Most Great Branch stood in attendance upon thee, and beneath him the other Branches, then the kindred and handmaidens who were among the people of the pavilions of glory and chastity, then those whom God hath made to be the leaves of the Tree of His Cause and the fruits of the Tree of His bounty. The Branches would enter thy presence with greetings and would leave with sighs of anguish and sorrow. After the ascension of thy spirit, their tears descended and their sighs ascended, and every possessor of a heart and station lamented before thy Lord, the Lord of the earth and the heavens. Alas, alas! By thy grief the people of the pavilion of glory and the tabernacle of grace were grieved, and the eyes of those who circle round the Throne shed tears at thy calamity. The Most Great Terror appeared, and eyes wept before the face of thy Lord, the Chosen One. And we, the near ones, lamented in such wise that by our lamentation the people of the highest Paradise and the most exalted Paradise and the most glorious Concourse who circle round the will of their Lord, the Master of Origin and Return, in the eternity of eternities. O Exalted Leaf! Thy grief hath today turned day into night, joy into sorrow, and tranquility into agitation, until sorrows encompassed all who dwell in the realm of possibility, such that the Hidden Name, the Treasured Secret, and the Self-Subsisting One - Who sacrificed Himself for the One standing before all faces - were grieved. O Pen! Be patient, for sorrows have overtaken both the seen and unseen. Set aside what thou wert occupied with and say, turning to God, the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the grief of Thy chosen ones, the tears of Thy leaves, and the sorrows that have melted hearts throughout the lands, to forgive Thy male and female servants who have remembered her according to what hath descended from the heaven of Thy bounty and the mouth of Thy will. O Lord! Thou seest how cares have encompassed the manifestations of Thy Self-Subsisting Name, and sorrows have surrounded the dwellers of the pavilion of Thy glory and grandeur. I beseech Thee by their sighs and tears concerning what hath befallen Thee in Thy days, to send down upon Thy household that which may tranquilize their hearts and give rest to their souls, lest they commit what would increase Thy sorrow in Thy days. Then forgive every maidservant who hath entered Thy house and lamented what occurred on this day which Thy decree hath altered, and which hath grieved Thy friends and chosen ones. Then assist Thy servant who is present, who hath stood firm in Thy service, shared in Thy tribulations, and spoken Thy praise. Then forgive, O my God, the maidservant who journeyed and those who left their homes until they arrived and heard, then returned, and those who sought Thy grace, Thy gifts, Thy generosity and Thy bestowals. Verily Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest. If Thou shouldst desire, Thou wouldst turn grief into joy in Thy kingdom, and the essence of care into delight among Thy servants. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous. Then I beseech Thee once again, O God of Names, by the penetrating influence of Thy Command, the all-encompassing nature of Thy Will, the mysteries of Thy Book, and what hath flowed from Thy Most Exalted Pen in Thy Scrolls and Writings, to forgive on this day all Thy male and female servants who have turned to Thee, attained to Thy remembrance, and arose to serve Thee. Verily Thou art the Generous, the Forgiving, the Kind, the Merciful. There is none other God but Thee, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>

<p>Here is beloved of heart and soul, Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be all glory and splendor. He is God, exalted be His majesty, greatness and power.</p>
<p>O my beloved! The fragrance of your words has caused me to turn toward you, and your remembrance in the love of God, your Creator, has moved me to mention that which will gladden you, from our Beloved and your Beloved. By God’s life! Not a day has passed except that you were before my eyes, and the glances of my Lord and Master’s favor were directed toward you. I read, understood and presented it, whereupon He said - and His sweetest utterance is this:</p>
<p>O Mustafa! Upon you be My peace and My glory! Give thanks to God for having honored your countenance, loosened your tongue, and drawn you near to Him. We beseech Him to expand your cause and grant you every good thing sent down in His perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>We make mention of the physician, upon him be My glory, and give him glad tidings of My remembrance of him. We counsel him to remember God and praise Him, and to do that which will exalt His firm and mighty Cause. We beseech the Most High to assist him in achieving what he desires in love of his Lord. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Conquering, the Powerful.</p>
<p>We make mention of the imprisoned one, upon him be My glory, that he may rejoice and be among the thankful. We beseech God to assist him to serve the Cause with spirit and fragrance, and to ordain for him the reward of what he desires. Verily, He is the Munificent Giver.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Khalaf, who was previously mentioned before the Wronged One, that he may rejoice in My remembrance of him and My attention to him from this far-distant spot. By My life, O Khalaf! My remembrance of you is greater than what you and all people possess. If you were to turn to it, you would find from it the fragrance of eternity - to this testifies every knowledgeable and perceptive one. Grieve not over anything, trust in all matters in God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Ibrahim Khaffaf, whose letter was presented before the Wronged One while He was in this mighty prison. O Ibrahim! Give thanks to God for having assisted you and caused you to recognize Him when the earth was in evident smoke. Beware lest the affairs of the world sadden you. Hold fast to the cord of your Lord’s mercy, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We ask of God for you the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, He is the Lord of all beings and the Sovereign of the throne and earth. Verily, He is the Single, the One, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>We make mention of his sister and beseech God the Most High to forgive her through His grace and grant her what He has ordained in Paradise of His bounties and favors. Verily, He is the Generous, the Bestower, the Hearing, the Responding One.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Yusuf, that he may praise his Lord for having assisted him to believe in what the All-Merciful has revealed in the Furqan: “Those who believe in the unseen, and establish prayer, and spend of that which We have provided them.”</p>
<p>We make mention of the servants of God in that place and counsel them to perform good deeds and develop spiritual qualities, and to do that which will exalt God’s religion among His heedless servants. The nation and government have been weakened by what the hands of the oppressors have wrought. It behooves you to supplicate God in the nights and days that He may aid His Cause on earth through the hosts of the unseen and the visible. Verily, He has power over all things and is worthy to answer.</p>
<p>That which the imprisoned one sent has arrived in the prison and has been honored with acceptance. One of them was especially distinguished and honored, and He commanded me to send one of them to your presence, which I shall soon dispatch by His might and power. I beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist all who are on earth to remember Him, praise Him and obey Him, that the religion may be made manifest in its entirety, though the idolaters be averse. The Command belongs to God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>And I greet Hussein Effendi, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], and his brothers. May the coolness of eyes, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon the loved ones of God in Zawra and upon your family and those with you, and the mercy of God and His blessings. Then I greet the most dear brother Haji Abbas, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], and Jamshid and Abdul-Karim, upon both of them be 966 [Baha’u’llah]. I beseech God on their behalf for that which befits His all-encompassing generosity. Praise be to God, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>

<p>O beloved of my heart! Another letter from your presence reached the servant, adorned with the mention of God, blessed and exalted be He. After my recognition and reading of it, I presented it before my Lord and Master. He spoke, and His sweetest utterance is: “We have heard what the Physician, upon him be My glory, and the Prisoner, upon him be My loving-kindness, have mentioned, and We have understood what they desired in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. Whosoever shall free the House from the Amalekites, verily for him shall be a great reward with God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. God shall soon free it through a command from His presence, even as He freed the Ark aforetime. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>“And We make mention of Abdullah who desired to serve his Lord. Say: Blessed art thou for what thou hast done and intended. Be thou assured that He is with thee in all conditions. Verily, He does not suffer the reward of the doers of good to be lost. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist thee in what is right and to make thee among those who have performed in the path of God that whose fragrance shall never cease to endure through the continuance of His most beautiful names and His most exalted attributes. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Verily, he whom God has enabled to achieve this must needs give thanks to Him throughout the dominion of earth and heaven. Blessed is he who has attained unto this mighty cause.</p>
<p>“And We send Our greetings to the loved ones of God in those regions and We counsel them to fear God and to that whereby His decisive and wise Cause may be exalted. O Mustafa! Upon thee be My peace and My glory, and upon thy sons, and upon those with thee who have held fast to the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds.” And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. The End.</p>

<p>O joy of my heart and beloved of my soul, his honor Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be all Glory of Glories. He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Grandeur.</p>
<p>Praise be to the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, Who by His command breathed into the Supreme Pen, whereupon appeared men who cast aside all likenesses and examples and arose to promote the Cause with a firmness more enduring than mountains. They are those whom nothing upon which the name of any created thing hath been placed could deter from God, the Ordainer of destinies. They are those through whom the horizons were illumined and the decree of the Covenant was manifested on the Day of Separation, and through whom the Most Great Servitude appeared among the concourse of creation, and every hesitant one hastened to the Most Sublime Horizon. Exalted is our Most Glorious Beloved, through one letter of Whom the Kingdom of Names was created and the Call was raised between earth and heaven that there is none other God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. I pray, I salute, and I glorify those who remember Him at morn and at eventide. These are servants who perceived the fragrance of the garment in the Day of God and will perceive it unto the eternity of eternities. Exalted is the Lord of the beginning and the end, through Whom the Nightingale of Eternity warbleth that there is none other God but He, the Bestower, the Generous. My spirit be a sacrifice unto your mention.</p>
<p>The servant hath attained to that which wafted from the right hand of your remembrance and your faithfulness, whereby were stirred the leaves of love which had sprouted from the Tree that was raised up in steadfast, firm and luminous hearts. God knoweth that its stirring hath moved me and its manifestations have affected me. I took the letter and ascended until I attained the presence of the Beloved and presented what was therein. Thereupon the sphere of utterance was set in motion and the Tongue of the Intended One spoke that which every witness and witnessed one is powerless to describe. By the life of God, I found myself incapable of recording what the Tongue of the Beloved uttered from the most exalted station. Can the drop enumerate the waves of the sea? Can the atom define the effulgences of the sun? All things testify to my powerlessness, and all that was created by the Most Exalted Word to my evanescence. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist me and strengthen me in that which I have been commanded. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is He Who overshadoweth all possibilities and is powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His mighty and wondrous Word. And at the end of the utterance, the Tongue of the Intended One spoke: The Supreme Pen hath testified time and again to him and hath acknowledged his sincerity, his love, his devotion, his remembrance, his praise, and his standing in service to this Cause whereby the mountains were shaken. End.</p>
<p>And regarding what you mentioned concerning the prisoner, upon him be the Glory of God, it was presented and this is what the Beloved spoke in reply: We make mention of the prisoner who hath attained unto tribulation in the path of God, the Lord of Names. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist him and strengthen him in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Lord of the Throne and earth, and the Sovereign of the hereafter and of the former days. And as for what he desired regarding leaving the city, We have permitted him in what he desired and We counsel him with the Most Great Wisdom and give him the glad-tidings of the remembrance of the Wronged One, Who hath turned toward him from this Most Exalted Station. End.</p>
<p>And concerning what you mentioned about the Fast and what his honor Siyyid Javad, upon him be the Glory of God, wrote - the truth is with you. It would have been more fitting for him to inquire and write to you that whereby the light of certitude might be made manifest.</p>
<p>As for your mention of Muhammad Surur Effendi, upon him be the Glory of God [669], the servant beseeches God, his Lord, to give him to drink that which will cause him to speak in His Name and to arise to serve Him. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the One with power over all possibilities. That which is seen today upon the face of the earth shall pass away, and that which is done in the path of God, the Lord of Lords, shall endure.</p>
<p>As for what you mentioned regarding Darvish Ata, upon him be the Glory of God [669], the servant has presented and recited what he composed before His countenance. Praise be to God that he has attained to the mention and praise of God. I was gladdened to find the fragrance of your pleasure in him. I beseech the Lord to guide us by such a fragrance time after time, instance after instance, phase after phase, hour after hour, and moment after moment. Verily He is the Powerful, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>As for what you desired regarding the presence, the servant has presented it. Thus did the tongue of the Beloved speak: “O My servant! Thou knowest My loving-kindness, My love and My tenderness for him, but wisdom hath prevented Me from granting this request in these days, and We have postponed it to another day. Convey My Great Glory to him and give him the glad tidings of My beauteous mention.” The servant conveys His Great Glory to you in accordance with what was commanded. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist us in serving Him, obeying Him, mentioning Him, praising Him, and in that which will cause the exaltation of His Cause among His creation. Verily He is the Bestower, the Answerer.</p>
<p>As for what you mentioned regarding Khan, upon him be the Glory of God [669], the servant presented what your honor wrote concerning him. The Beloved said: “This demonstrates his orientation and his turning to God. We beseech God to make him firm and steadfast in what he was upon. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty. We convey from this station Our Great Glory upon him and upon all who have held fast to this firm cord, and We convey Our Great Glory upon the faces of My loved ones who are there, and We counsel them to the Most Great Steadfastness and that which will profit them in the Hereafter and in this world. Verily He is the Helper, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>The Glory be upon your honor and upon those who were with you, and upon those who have drunk from the Kawthar of divine knowledge from the hands of the bounty of our Lord, the Merciful. And praise be to God, the Master of the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who is established upon the throne with majesty, might and grandeur, and Who speaks whereupon the trumpet is blown, those in the graves tremble, and all in earth and heaven swoon save whom God, the Lord of Names, willeth. Through Him was hoisted the banner “He doeth what He willeth” and raised the standard “On that day dominion shall be God’s, the Lord of all mankind and Master of both this world and the next.” He is the One from Whose court of glory the decree of truth is never absent, even should He decree existence for the non-existent, and from Whose holy atmosphere no flutter of the wings of defiance is heard, even should He permit what was forbidden from time immemorial. He is the One worshipped, to Whose majesty and sovereignty all atoms testify, and to Whose power and might all created things bear witness. The Qayyum is he who arises to make mention of Him and speaks His praise, and the steadfast one is he who attains constancy in His Cause. Exalted, exalted is He Who speaks the truth! Exalted, exalted is He Who is tried among the people! Exalted, exalted is He Who sees Himself alone amidst the multitude and single among the throng! Praise be to God Who made tribulation an adornment for His loved ones, thereby beautifying them among His creation and His creatures. He is the Ruler Whom the veils of the world and the mists of the nations have not hindered, and none has comprehended what lieth with Him save His Self, as attesteth he who hath knowledge of the Tablets. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. He is the Sovereign from Whose knowledge nothing escapeth and Whose decree nothing can frustrate. He is the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God testifieth that there is no God but Him, and He Who biddeth the people to righteousness and godliness is the Goal of all creation, the One mentioned in the ancient scriptures, and the Speaker in the kingdom of creation. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Another calamity hath come to pass through that which was inscribed by the Pen of Destiny from God, Creator of earth and heaven, whereupon grief hath overtaken the loved ones of the All-Merciful. It behooveth thee to make mention of this affliction, concerning which the Tongue of Utterance hath spoken in the Kingdom of divine exposition. Through thee doth God console whom He willeth among His loved ones and comfort those who have believed in His signs, submitted to His sovereignty, and acknowledged that which the tongue of His grandeur hath acknowledged when seated upon His throne - that there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The tale of sorrow hath returned, for a star hath vanished from the heaven of My love and a letter from the book of My affection. Thereby have the people of the realms of My knowledge lamented - they who have cast aside all else but Me, clung to the hem of My grace, and attained unto the ocean of My mercy and the sun of My bounty.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One Who hath been designated by this name. He remembereth thee at this hour when sorrows have encompassed Him by reason of what hath befallen Him at the hands of them that have turned away from the All-Merciful. Thou art he who witnessed the Most Great Terror on a day wherein a speckled serpent pursued My Name, the letter ?a, through which was planted the Tree of Faithfulness amidst all created things. I bear witness that thou didst experience that Day and didst endure from the enemies that which none knoweth save God, the Lord of all names, and heard from them what no ear among all created things hath heard, and witnessed what no eyes of the faithful have beheld. Blessed art thou, O Husayn, for having attained unto the testimony of God on this Day wherein the Path hath appeared and the Balance hath been set up. I testify that thou hast fulfilled thy covenant and observed the rights of God and His Cause. Thou art he who cast away idle fancies and hastened unto the ocean of certitude which surgeth before the face of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Munificent. Thou art he whom neither the signs of the wayward nor the utterances of the idolaters deterred. Thou hast shattered the idols of vain imaginings through the name of thy Lord, the Self-Subsisting, and turned toward the Supreme Horizon when it was illumined by the manifestation of God, the Lord of the throne on high and of the earth below. Joy be unto thee, O Husayn, for having quaffed the choice sealed wine. Happy art thou, O Husayn, for having attained unto My Preserved Book which proclaimeth throughout the world and among the peoples thy recognition, thy remembrance, thy submissiveness, thy humility, thy faithfulness and thy steadfastness in this Cause whereby feet have slipped and necks have bowed. Blessed art thou for having ascended with joy and fragrance unto the presence of the All-Merciful, where thou beholdest thyself in that most exalted station and hearest that which the Lote-Tree of the utmost boundary doth speak. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who loveth thee and turneth toward thee after thy passing and uttereth thy praise for what befell thee in the path of God, the Lord of all lords. We beseech God, exalted be He, to console thy brother who chose exile in the path of God, the Lord of all creation, and attained unto His presence when the Sun was shining from the horizon of Zawra, and who migrated with him until he entered the Land of Mystery, whence he was banished with his Lord until he entered this Great Prison. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid him to preserve this station and draw him nigh unto Him at all times.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of eternity and Sovereign of the nations, Who calleth out through the Most Great Name! I beseech Thee by the blood of Thy near ones which was shed in Thy days for love of Thee, and by the hearts of them that are aflame with love for Thee, which were pierced by the arrows of the enemies in Thy path and for the manifestation of Thy Cause, to assist Thy loved ones to remember Thee and praise Thee and to stand firm in this Cause, than which no greater hath been ordained in Thy dominion and Thy realm. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest, and verily Thou art the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>He is God - exalted be His station, the Most Great, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath illumined the horizon of the world with the Sun of His Most Great Name, and hath commanded all to be trustworthy and faithful, and to that whereby His Cause may be exalted amongst the peoples. Among men are those who have turned to the Supreme Horizon and acted according to that which was commanded by God, the Lord of Names; among them are those who have halted in perplexity; and among them are those who have turned away and committed that which hath caused the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Cities of Names to lament, until matters reached such a pass that, by God, the sun of trustworthiness hath been darkened among creatures and the moon of faithfulness hath been eclipsed among men. Blessed, blessed, then joy be to him who hath been faithful to God’s Covenant and His Testament, and hath acted in such wise as to exalt the Cause of God above all else. And woe betide him who hath been overcome by his passions and hath committed that which is forbidden in the Book of God, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
<p>I have received your letter and learned of your love for God and service to His Cause. After gaining this knowledge and understanding, I approached the Most Exalted Presence until I stood before His countenance and presented what you had mentioned. Thereupon the tongue of the Beloved uttered that which was a remedy for the world’s ills and healing for whosoever desireth his Ancient Lord. We beseech God to assist you in your current endeavors and aid you in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Protector of the sincere ones and the Answerer of the prayers of the supplicants. My soul be a sacrifice for your love! God knoweth, and all else bear witness, that this servant loveth to hear at all times that which your tongue uttereth in remembrance of my Beloved and your Beloved. My ear is ever attentive to your address, for through it my breast is dilated, my frame is stirred, and my heart is gladdened. Should my reply be delayed, this is not due to heedlessness or indifference - to this both heart and soul bear witness, and they are with you; ask them, for they are just and truthful, and it is hoped their testimony will be accepted by you. And beyond and above them is the testimony of Him Who hath spoken and speaketh the truth. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding what you mentioned about the name Qurratu’l-’Ayn, this servant had not seen that letter nor was it presented before His countenance. After my learning of it, turning toward Him, ascending and presenting it, he was named “The Trustworthy”, entitled “The Wondrous”, and given the kunyih “Father of Faithfulness” in the presence of Him Whom I cannot adequately describe before the peoples who have been veiled by the veils of idle fancies and thereby been prevented from witnessing that which hath appeared, shone forth, emerged and risen from the horizon of possibility. Exalted, exalted is He! Whosoever pondereth upon the Manifestation of God and His power, and the sovereignty of God and His grandeur! Can the Pen bear to carry remembrances, or the Tablet have strength to be the bearer of mysteries? Nay, by His chosen Self! All have proven powerless, and the tongue of God hath testified to the powerlessness of all, before the creation of all, the mention of all, the description of all, and the appearance of all. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>By thy life, at the time it was presented before the Countenance, I found the Lord of all beings to be saddened, and this was not due to any causes but out of compassion for him who was named Khidmat-’Ali. Blessed is he for having been honored by the mention of the Beloved and adorned with the loving-kindness of the Desired One. It behooveth him to strive with the utmost effort and endeavor to discharge what is due from him of the rights of the servants. Thus hath the Lord of creation decreed in the Books, the Psalms, the Scriptures and the Tablets. I know not, O My beloved, whether the world hath been perfumed by the fragrance of the Beloved or hath been deprived thereof, and whether the heaven hath recognized the Sun shining from its horizon or remaineth heedless and bare, and whether the earth hath recognized the honor of His footsteps upon it or remaineth ignorant and negligent, and whether the trees have become aware of the breezes of reunion wafting upon them or remain veiled behind the veils. Yet I observe the air to be of utmost delicacy and gentleness, and the light as though it hath acquired radiance from the face of Him unto Whom all things turn. Blessed is he who hath turned unto, clung to, sought after and held fast unto God, the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven. At times the Spirit turneth toward the mountains and saith: I perceive from thee the fragrances of the Beloved, as though He had passed over thee - hast thou recognized this or art thou among the heedless? And at times it wandereth through the dwellings and saith: I perceive from thee the sweet savors of the Manifestation - hast thou known this or art thou among the veiled ones? By thy life, O My beloved, the Pen hath taken from Me its reins and moveth, and I know not toward which direction it turneth - toward the hilltops or the branches, or toward the deserts and wilderness. He verily knoweth best what moveth upon the earth or ascendeth into the air, and He is in truth the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. In all circumstances, I beseech Him, exalted be He, to grant him success and assistance, and to open before his face a door whereby his affairs and the affairs of those who have believed in God, the Single One, the All-Informed, may be set right. As to what ye mentioned concerning Haji ’Abbas, upon him be the glory of his Lord, We beseech God to send down upon him a blessing from His presence and to protect him from all that He abhorreth. The servant conveyeth his greetings to him and to the loved ones of God in that place. His teaching work hath been entrusted to your care and kindness. Glory be upon you and upon your household, and may he present himself before you and receive from you that which shall profit him in the Cause of God, your Creator and the Creator of all worlds. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. The Servant. 4 Rama?an al-Mubarak 1295.</p>

<p>Your letter, which was sent through him who is bound for that realm - upon him be the Glory of God - arrived and was presented. These exalted words were revealed from the heaven of grace, the Source of verses. His words, exalted be His majesty:</p>
<p>“O Muhammad-Husayn! Your letter was presented before the Wronged One through the servant who is present. In all conditions fix your gaze upon God, speak of Him, and place your trust in Him. Should man attain unto communion with God, exalted be His glory - that is, should he experience His remembrance, praise, love and sweetness - he will never be distressed by life’s bitterness. This is the Day of Truth, for the Sun of Truth has dawned. This is the Day of Certitude, for the light of His countenance shines forth from the Prison land, radiant and manifest. He who has attained unto the water will derive no benefit from the mention of a mirage. This is the Day of revelation and witnessing, for that which was hidden is now manifest, resplendent, speaking and revealed. In such circumstances and in such days, sanctified souls must free themselves from the chains of idle fancies and vain imaginings through the Name of the Lord of all beings. The people of truth who today have partaken of the Kawthar of the utterance of the All-Merciful and have received their portion from the ocean of life are and shall remain the manifestations of God’s life-giving Name. The name of death has no place in that gathering. The name of death belongs exclusively to God, exalted be His glory. Who would dare transgress the bounds set by God? Whosoever transgresses is recorded as one of the people of hell-fire in the Most Sublime Vision, in the Scriptures and Tablets. We have forbidden the people of God from murder, conflict, strife, corruption and whatsoever grieveth the hearts. How then could it be that the friends of God would plot against you? Hold fast unto the manifest certitude, turning away from idle fancies and vain imaginings.”</p>
<p>Given the divine laws, commandments and prohibitions that have been recorded by the Supreme Pen in the Book, how could it be that the loved ones would plot against one another? Perhaps someone spoke a word to you in jest. Nevertheless, this servant beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to sanctify you and some of the friends from whatsoever is unbecoming, and to adorn you with that which is befitting. If souls who have accepted the Faith would hold fast with joy and fragrance to that which the All-Merciful has revealed, surely the lights of faith and justice would have encompassed the world. Concealment and forgiveness are among the characteristics of mercy, and mercy has encompassed and preceded all things visible and invisible.</p>
<p>Concerning the mention that was made of Mashhadi ’Ali, it was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. These are the words that the Tongue of Grandeur spoke: “O ’Ali! Strive to adorn thyself with the requirements of this Most Great Cause. Place upon thy head the crown fashioned of the pearls of detachment and trust in God, upon thy feet the new shoes that signify steadfastness, and upon thy frame the robe of piety. God willing, may all be adorned with these luminous, precious and enduring garments. Thy mention was made in the Most Holy Presence, and these brilliant words were revealed and flowed forth from the Dayspring of the Cause. Blessed is he who recognizes, acts, and attains unto that which God hath revealed in the Book.”</p>
<p>With regard to what was written that the physician inquired about sleep - such matters are not worthy of question, and this servant did not submit them, for this matter has been mentioned in several places and its ruling has been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen. Furthermore, today is not the day for questions. Several years ago this blessed verse was revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance - exalted and mighty be His Word: “This is not the day for questions. It behoveth every soul, when he heareth the Call, to say: ‘Here am I, here am I, O Lord of Names!’ and ‘Here am I, here am I, O Desire of the worlds!’”</p>
<p>Some souls, in what they say, intend either sophistication or jest. How many souls in this Most Great Revelation have asked questions about wisdom and other abstruse matters, and answers descended and were revealed from the heaven of the favor of the Lord of all return. Yet no trace remained of those souls. For example, one of the philosophers asked about the Uncompounded Reality, and an answer was revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance according to his capacity, yet it yielded no fruit. Today some are seen to be irreligious, some doubtful, some bewildered, some stupefied, some hesitant, and some turned away. In such circumstances, one must hold fast to the cord of patience and observe the horizons and one’s own self with the eye of insight. In one place He says that the veil of the people has reached such a state that silence has gained precedence over speech.</p>
<p>Concerning your mention of Aqa Muhammad-Sadiq, upon him be the Glory of God, his mention was submitted at the Most Holy Court, and the Sun of Grace rose from the horizon of favor in relation to him. God willing, may he be occupied with the mention of Truth. This evanescent one also conveys greetings and praise to the aforementioned souls, upon them be the Glory of God. Glory be upon you and upon every truthful speaker who stands firm in service to the Cause of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O Ahmad in Sad! He is the Single, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Most High, the Sublime!</p>
<p>Blessed is He in whose hand is the Kingdom of the dominion of the heavens and earth, and He, verily, is knowing of all things. His is the bounty and the grandeur, His is the power and the sovereignty, His is the might and the loftiness, His is the strength and the dominion. He giveth sovereignty to whomsoever He willeth and taketh away sovereignty from whomsoever He willeth, and He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He willeth, and He, verily, is knowing of all things. He hath created all who are in the heavens and on earth by His will, and createth as He willeth by His command, and He, verily, encompasseth all things. Say: Verily He shall appear as He appeared in truth, and He shall not be limited by any limit, nor indicated by any indication, nor veiled by any veil. He shall appear as He willeth to whomsoever He willeth, and We are witness unto this.</p>
<p>O believer in God! There hath come before Us that from which We have inhaled the fragrances of God wafting from a holy and glorious quarter, which God hath caused to be revealed through the pen of His Name Husayn at the sacred seat, and unto which He hath imparted words of transcendent might. Know thou that a single letter thereof is more precious than the creation of the heavens and earth - this for him who is possessed of true insight. Therein are inscribed the mysteries of the Cause by a hidden holy pen, which none can fathom save they who have detached themselves unto God and are steadfast in the true faith. In but one letter thereof lieth treasured the mysteries of knowledge and wisdom from the presence of One mighty and wise. Were We to expound a single letter thereof, all the tablets would not suffice, nor would all pens complete it, nor could any scroll encompass it. For each letter thereof hath its interpretation, and each interpretation its inner meaning, and each inner meaning yet deeper meanings, and symbols and allusions unto whatsoever God willeth. Thus hath the matter been decreed at the right hand of the Throne. We have withheld mention thereof by reason of the malice that hath appeared in the hearts of them who claim faith for themselves yet are in grievous transgression. Therefore do thou rend asunder the veils and emerge from behind the clouds with mighty certitude, lest allusions veil thee as they veiled the people of the Furqan through mention of the Seal in a preserved and mighty Book which was sent down unto Muhammad, the Messenger of God, from the presence of a sovereign and manifest King. Know thou that Truth itself is sufficient proof for all who are in the heavens and on earth, and needeth no evidence or demonstration if thou be well-informed thereof. When He desireth to make Himself known unto His servants, He manifesteth Himself through a proof that all who are in the heavens and earth are powerless to produce, that His grace may be witnessed by all worlds. Without this, none can know Him and no proof can be established for anyone. Thus have the measures of the Cause been ordained by the Pen of Him Who knoweth all things – save whom thy Lord willeth, and this hath been decreed in truth in the glorious and noble Tablets. Blessed is he who wavereth not from this Path, and whom the whisperings of Satan shall never turn aside, though every sinful transgressor oppose him. Thus know thou all that hath been mentioned in thy Tablet, then conceal these pearls within thy breast and spread them not before every malicious rebel. And if thou findest a pure heart, inspire it with what We have inspired thee of these mysteries which were veiled within the sheltering protection of the Command. Otherwise, conceal them with the utmost concealment and disclose them not before those who follow Satan in their own selves and are vehement in their hatred. Therefore render thanks unto God for having sent thee the sweet-scented breezes of holiness and cast upon thee the word of truth and inspired thee with that whereof the people were veiled. Say: We were in the midst of the servants for months and years, yet none recognized Us, and thus were all wrapped in thick veils. And when the idolaters rose against Us and cast Us into prison in that land, We revealed Our true Self in spite of them and every wretched denier. The Spirit and Glory and Splendor from Us be upon thee and upon thy spirit and thy heart and upon those who were swift to win the good-pleasure of God.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Mighty, the Powerful</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath trained His loved ones in His path through adversity and tribulation, that all may fix their gaze upon Him and turn unto Him in all conditions, whether in hardship or ease, in poverty or wealth. Thus hath He caused that spiritual friend to be ever engaged in His praise and remembrance. In truth, this is a mighty station. The servant beseecheth his Lord to enable all to attain unto this and to assist them in that which beseemeth His Revelation and His days. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>The letters of that spiritual friend have been received time and again, and after reading each one, We presented them before the Face of the Lord. He heard them and said - sweet are His words: “O thou who drinkest the wine of My love! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison. Verily it draweth thee nigh unto God, the One, the All-Informed, even as it drew thee nigh before. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous.” Praise be to God, the inner matters are confirmed and known, while the outward affairs are contingent upon the requirements of consummate wisdom. Every time hath its effect and every moment its fruit. Knowledge is with the Eternal God. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to open before thy face, through the key of His Name, the All-Giving, the gates of His grace, mercy and bounty, and to rain down upon thee from the clouds of His generosity the showers of His blessings and riches. He is verily the Compassionate, the Generous, the Munificent, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Recite what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “And whosoever feareth God, He will make for him a way out, and will provide for him from whence he expecteth not. And whosoever putteth his trust in God, He will suffice him. God will surely accomplish His purpose. God hath set a measure for all things.” Recite this blessed revealed verse every day. He is the Source of grace and bounty, the Dawning-Place of mercy and glory. God willing, the closed door shall open and suspended matters shall be set in motion.</p>
<p>O Siyyid Farajullah, upon thee be the peace of God. Thy mention hath been made before the Wronged One, and We beseech God to send down that which will exalt thy station. In these days Iran is in turmoil, the fire of oppression is ablaze, truthfulness, sincerity and justice are concealed, while tyranny, corruption and oppression prevail. Glory be to God! Most of the people of Iran are observed to be deprived of human virtues. They have ever cursed and reviled the Sunnis while praising themselves, but divine justice did not remain hidden and shone forth like the sun from the horizon of will. This Wronged One beareth witness that no party in the world hath been more heedless, more rejected, and more foolish than the Shi’ih party. They are sheer ignorance, yet consider themselves the repository of knowledge. Their deeds testify to their station and rank. They martyred the Lord of the world and all beings in such wise that rocks cried out in lamentation, yet to this day they remain unaware of their unseemly acts. They martyred the King of the throne of faith in the name of infidelity, yet they perceive it not. In any case, beseech and We beseech God not to deprive any of His servants of His grace and favor.</p>
<p>O Thou one God! Make the heedless aware, guide Thy poor ones to the ocean of Thy riches, and cause Thy opposers to taste the sweetness of turning unto Thee. Thou art the Powerful One Whom the power of the world hath not and cannot prevent. We testify that Thou art the Strong, the Triumphant, the Mighty, and worthy to answer prayer.</p>
<p>We make mention of the friends and beseech for each a manifest bounty. Blessed is he who holdeth fast unto the Covenant and fulfilleth his pledge to his Lord, the Master of the Day of Separation. In these days tidings that are the cause and source of grief have arrived continuously, but since they have come to pass in the path of God, they were instantly transformed into joy. In truth, the station of the lovers and their characteristics have become and are becoming evident and manifest through trials and tribulations, and that which hath no likeness or parallel hath been revealed by the Pen of Truth concerning them. The servant beseecheth God that He deprive not His servants of the wonders of His mercy and confirm them in returning and repenting unto Him. He is the Powerful, He is the All-Choosing. I convey greetings and praise to the friends in that land, and I implore God, exalted be His glory, to open a door that shall never be shut. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. As to what was written regarding the funds, according to His command it will be mentioned to some, but its receipt appeareth difficult, as this year the wheat trade in this land hath greatly increased. The friends and others are each occupied with acquiring it; most have been unsuccessful and remain idle. If it be possible to receive it from someone in that land, it would seem preferable. We beseech God to make easy these most difficult matters and to keep that spiritual loved one joyous in all conditions. Verily, He is near to the doers of good and the One Who setteth aright the affairs of them that are detached. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Peace and praise and remembrance and glory be upon you and upon God’s friends there, and upon the sincere ones and the monotheists among His servants, and upon every steadfast and firm one, and every faithful and trustworthy one.</p>

<p>In the name of the one God! The Call of God is raised from the direction of Akka, saying: “Blessed is he who hath turned unto God and hath hearkened with both outer and inner ear to His divine call.” Such souls are the people of the Most Great Vista and the partakers of the Most Pure Wine - especially those who, in these days when the darkness of vain imaginings hath seized most of mankind, have not been hindered from turning toward the Court of Oneness. For this reason have the Manifestations of the past, from time immemorial and forever after, made mention of these souls in their Tablets. In this tribulation it is observed that the truly sincere ones are rarer than red sulfur. Were the servants to perceive the sweetness of the divine call and recognize the greatness of the Source of the Word, all would turn unveiled toward the Lord of Lords. From time immemorial and forever after, infinite oppression hath been visited upon the divine Manifestations from the daysprings of pharaonic might, yet with utmost power and sovereignty They bore all, that perchance a few souls might be sanctified from the murk of doubts and imaginings and ascend to the heights of divine oneness. Although all witnessed that these Sources of divine authority endured hardships solely for humanity’s salvation, they did what they did - may God’s curse be upon the wrongdoing people! All know that this world hath no permanence, and when death’s messenger cometh, no veil can conceal him, no power can prevent him, no tyrant’s might can turn him back. Despite certain knowledge of this station, in these numbered days when none knoweth whether tomorrow they will be above the earth or beneath it, all walk the path of self and passion, heedless of God, the Most High and Glorious. They vainly imagine they can extinguish God’s Lamp amidst creation and prevent the divine Tree from yielding Its holy, celestial fruits. This is as if a salty drop were to oppose and seek to repel the sweet, surging ocean. Did the veils of the people of the Hijaz prevent the Sun? By God, the fingers of destiny rent asunder the veil that intervened, and It shone forth from the horizon of glory! The holders of outward authority have ever forbidden people from turning to the Court of Oneness and have disliked the gathering of servants at the Most Great Ocean, for they have regarded and still regard such gathering as the cause and means of undermining the foundations of sovereignty. Yet by Him in Whose grasp is the control of all things, the gaze of God’s loved ones hath ever been and shall ever be sanctified from attention to such matters. These things have been spread by the corrupt. Now most imagine that this servant desireth universal rule in the earth, although in all Our Tablets We have forbidden the servants from accepting such rank, for it yieldeth naught but tribulation and affliction, unless one should accept it for God’s sake to help His Cause. Kings are the manifestations of divine power, and what is intended is their justice - if they observe this, they are related to the Truth. Soon will the veils be rent asunder and the manifestation of Names and Attributes will seize most of the servants, and all will testify to the sanctification and transcendence of those near to God’s court, let alone His exalted Self. We thank God that He enabled His servants and supported them in His love and good-pleasure, opened their eyes that they might behold Him and know Him, and did not withhold them from this Sun which has dawned, and from this Sea which has surged, and from this Heaven which has been upraised, and from this Grace which has descended, and from this Lamp through whose light the earth has been illumined. Verily He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst behold in thy dream, give thanks unto God for having revealed Himself unto thee, unveiled to thee His beauty and admitted thee into the pavilion of His glory. Then know thou that what thou didst see is truth, there is no doubt therein, and the matter is as thou didst see. God will soon manifest from this horizon a light and power whereby the sun shall be darkened and the traces of those who have waxed proud before God shall be obliterated, while the faces of the sincere shall be illumined thereby. Soon shall the lights of thy Lord’s countenance encompass all who are on earth. Verily He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Though it hath not been explained in detail, yet from that which hath been revealed from the Source of the Command, the purpose is clear. The interpretation of the dream itself is manifest - every person of insight and vision will recognize it.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! These are Thy servants who have left their homes out of longing to meet Thee, and have forsaken their native lands yearning for the court of Thy mighty throne, the visitation of Thy beauty and presence before Thee. They have been prevented therefrom by reason of what the hands of Thy creatures have wrought. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst attract the hearts of them who are nigh unto Thee and didst cause them to be detached from all else besides Thee, that Thou write down for these servants every bounty from the treasuries of Thy generosity, every favor from the repositories of Thy munificence, every mercy from the heaven of Thy Will, and every good thing Thou hast sent down for Thy chosen ones. Then raise them, O my God, to such a station where sorrows cannot prevent them from turning to Thy face, nor can the vicissitudes of the contingent world disturb their joy in Thy days. Moreover, ordain for them, O my God, the good of this world and the world to come. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Doer of what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Exalted!</p>
<p>This is an epistle from this Prisoner unto him who hath believed in God and desireth to turn his face toward the direction of His good-pleasure, that he may be numbered among those endued with certitude. Its verses have been sent down at a time when sorrows have encompassed this All-Knowing, All-Wise and Most Luminous Pen from every direction, and there hath befallen the Manifestation of God’s Self that which hath caused the breaths of holiness to be cut off from the realm of contingent being and the breath of the All-Merciful from the peoples of all worlds. This is the truth, of a certainty. Were We to recount what hath befallen Us, all things would weep, and the peoples of the heavens and earth would lament. They shed the blood of the Spirit, then adduce His verses as proof, oppose God’s Self and the Manifestation of His Cause, and yet recite His words. Woe unto such heedless ones! The eye of creation hath not witnessed any more unjust than these who commit oppression and then within their own souls wail and weep that they might cause confusion to spread throughout the land among the servants. Thus have their base desires and passions seduced them, and they are numbered among the idolaters.</p>
<p>O servant! Arise to serve and obey God, then take what hath proceeded from His exalted fingers and flowed from His most luminous and transcendent Pen. Enter then into the abode of the idolaters among the concourse of the Bayan and say: O people! Fear your Lord, the All-Merciful. This is verily the Beauty of the Most High Who hath dawned above the horizon of the Cause with such a radiance as hath caused the dwellers of the heavens and earth to swoon away, save those whom God hath preserved through His grace, delivered through His sovereignty, upheld by the hands of His mercy, protected through His truth, and made to be of the well-doers.</p>
<p>O people! Fear God and associate not partners with Him Whom the Primal Point Himself would make mention of in His days, and would weep and lament for what ye have wrought against His Beloved. O company of deniers! Fear God and be ashamed before His Beauty, for verily He hath come unto you with that wherewith ’Ali came before, and before him the Messengers of God, the Almighty, the Most High, the Most Great. There hath appeared from Him that which hath appeared from no one else, as ye have heard and are among those who have heard. Beware lest ye oppose Him for Whose meeting the denizens of the Paradise of Firdaws and the realities of those nigh unto God yearn. If ye possess any proof or testimony greater than what hath appeared in truth, then bring it forth, O company of liars! Can one who remained hidden in his house be compared with one who stood forth before all peoples? Be fair, O people, and be not of those who witnessed the power of God with their own eyes, then denied it through what Satan commanded them, and were of those who turned aside.</p>
<p>And thou, O servant, grieve not over anything, neither fear anyone. Stand firm in the Cause of God and His religion in such wise that the people of allusions among the company of infidels shall not deter thee. We have found the people of the Bayan to be more veiled than previous peoples, for We counselled them in all Our Tablets not to cling to anything at the time of the Manifestation, yet they have clung to everything and denied their Lord, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. We commanded them in all Our scrolls not to be veiled by anything when God would come upon the clouds of light, and to be among those who would turn unto Him, forsaking all that they possessed and turning their faces toward God their Creator. Yet they disbelieved and took the Calf for their god instead of God, deviated from the Path, and were numbered among the idolaters. Know thou moreover that time hath brought Me so low that he who prided himself on serving Me hath risen in opposition […]</p>
<p>Know then that time hath brought me low, until even those who boasted of their service to me and their attainment of my presence arose in opposition. Thus did we experience treatment from those whom we had protected through nights and days lest they be touched by the afflictions of former religions. God is witness to what I say. When they witnessed that the Cause had been raised in truth, they arose in opposition against me. By God, were I to mention what hath befallen us, the ears of the lovers would be unable to bear it. Leave thou the world and whatsoever is therein behind thee, then stand firm in the Cause of God and His love, and be of those whom nothing deterreth in the path of their Creator and who arise to aid His Cause and glorify His Self, the All-Compelling, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. Whoso desireth to aid his Lord in these days shall be reinforced by the hosts of the seen and the unseen. Thus hath the matter been ordained by your Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, in the tablets of destiny, whereto the dwellers of the all-highest Paradise bear witness, yet the people are in manifest heedlessness.</p>
<p>Purify thy heart from the world and all that is therein. Leave these people, then grasp the fingers of detachment - that cord through whose movement all creation moveth and invention is attracted - that thou mayest become a standard of guidance between the heavens and the earth, and a mention of the Divine Unity among all who dwell in the dominion of creation. Then remind, from Our presence, those servants who have detached themselves from the intimations of every idolater and the opposition of every opposer, who have shattered the idols of vain imaginings and drunk the choice wine that was sealed from the fingers of their Lord, the All-Merciful, in the garden of good-pleasure. By God, these are God’s friends on earth; through them the heaven raineth and the earth bringeth forth. Thus have We expounded the matter that thou mayest stand firm in thy Lord’s Cause and be of those who are firmly rooted. And the spirit and glory and splendor rest upon thee and upon those who circumambulate the Kaaba of God, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>God willing, your honor must not be remiss in educating the people. Proclaim the Cause of thy Lord and be not silent, for silence is praiseworthy save in My remembrance. Thus do We command thee out of love for thyself, that thou mayest be of those who attain. Convey from this Prisoner greetings to the people of God, both men and women. Then give greetings to the face of the sister of knowledge, that perchance she may be attracted within herself and ascend among His devoted maidservants.</p>

<p>O Name of Generosity! Upon thee be My Baha! The letters from Samandar which he sent were presented before the Wronged One and attained the honor of being heard. Concerning what was written about the teacher, We have accepted what he hath done in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: O teacher! Thou art the first teacher who hath attained His good-pleasure and whom God hath mentioned in His perspicuous Book. We testify that thou hast attained that which was sent down from My holy Kingdom in My Most Holy Book and hast acted according to what thou wast commanded by God, the Exalted, the Great. We have made these verses the recompense for what thou didst in His path and have sent them unto thee that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Ruler, the All-Wise. Through them We have immortalized thy mention and made thee remembered in all the schools of the world. Verily, thy Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful. Rejoice in what hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen in the prison of ’Akka as a favor from Us unto thee and unto those who have held fast to this firm Cord. The glory be upon thee and upon every learned one who hath attained unto this mighty Cause.</p>
<p>O Samandar! Convey what hath been revealed for him. God willing, another bounty shall be bestowed upon him. A robe of honor shall be granted, though it be but a shirt; yet that shirt is more precious in the sight of God than all that the kings and rulers possess. O Samandar! The teacher hath attained unto that which most of mankind are powerless to comprehend. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. God willing, the children must exert their utmost effort in acquiring knowledge and penmanship. What was sent was seen. We beseech God to grant the capacity that they may perfect the art of calligraphy. Although for some, sufficient penmanship to meet their needs may suffice - and it would be better and more fitting to spend time in beneficial sciences - yet since God, exalted be His glory, hath loved every craft at its most perfect, therefore that which flowed from the Most Exalted Pen was revealed. However, attention to this direction is not permitted now; what he is occupied with is acceptable before God. He should thank his Lord morning and evening, at nightfall and at dawn.</p>
<p>O Samandar! Upon thee be My praise. Convey greetings and glory from the Wronged One to the friends of Alif and Shin. There hath befallen them what befell the Self of Truth. We enjoin upon them patience and forbearance and We beseech God to deliver them from the evil of the wicked ones who have violated God’s Covenant and His Testament - those servants who have adorned their heads with green and white turbans and have pronounced judgment against Him for Whose separation they lamented and whose presence they besought God night and day. By the life of God! Their words, deeds and beliefs have taken form and made them companions of the Fire. Say: O people of God! Be not grieved at what hath befallen you. Verily He is with you under all conditions. He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>Concerning the passing of Mulla Ja’far, upon him be the Glory of God, about which you wrote: We have turned toward him from this station and remember him with a remembrance whereby the righteous shall remember him. He believed in God and His signs, and testified to that which God had testified before the creation of earth and heaven. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to forgive him and expiate from him the hardships of this world and cause him to dwell in the highest Paradise. Verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful. And We make mention of his wife, the daughter of ’Azim. Verily thy Lord remembereth His servants and handmaidens as a grace from Him, and He is the Mighty, the All-Generous.</p>
<p>O Samandar! The mention you made of the Day of Separation passed over you like a dark night. Although this word has been the key to unlock the door of love for God, exalted be His glory, for there passed over you from separation from His loved ones and friends that which passed. Yet praise be to God, you are remembered and present in the gathering of the companions of reunion. By My life! Your mention is like unto a lamp shining in the Most Great Prison. Rejoice thou in the authoritative Word of God, which nothing among all things can equal, nor any mention among mentions, nor any book among books. Verily thy Lord is the Expositor, the All-Informed, and He is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning the handmaiden of God, the daughter of Jinab-i-’Abdu’l-Baqi, upon him be the Glory of God, it was mentioned before the Countenance and now she is engaged in service in the House. Blessed be her father and blessed be she, for she hath attained to the service of the House. Convey My greetings to her father that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones.</p>
<p>What thou hast done regarding the Huquq hath been accepted. Verily thy Lord is with thee and remembereth thy deed, and He is the Compassionate, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Each of the souls thou didst mention have attained unto the grace and mention of Our presence. Give them glad tidings from Me and convey My greetings unto them, as bidden by thy Lord, the Commander, the All-Wise. The Glory be upon them and upon those who have attained unto the mention of God, the Exalted, the Great.</p>
<p>O Samandar! We make mention of Javad and give him the glad tidings of My grace, My bounty and My mercy. Blessed is he and his son, and blessed are those women who have arisen to serve the Cause in the nights and days. Remember them from the Wronged One and give them the glad tidings of that which hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen in this station. Convey My greetings unto all who are with thee, whether men or women, young or old. Thus hath shone forth the light of My grace from the horizon of My remembrance, that joy and gladness may attract thee to a station wherein naught is seen save the Sun of My loving-kindness, shining upon all who are in the heavens and on earth. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O thou who hast turned thy face toward God! Upon thee be the Glory of God and His peace. Hearken unto the Voice of the Wronged One from the Most Great Prison. He hath desired naught in the realm save reformation, as doth testify the Lamp of the world, which hath taken neither glass, nor crystal, nor veil for its protection. By God! The Glory hath not spoken from desire, but rather that which draweth mankind unto a station wherein their hearts may find tranquility and their souls find rest. Thou knowest, and God knoweth beyond thee, that I have taken no helper for Myself, and have aided God’s Cause through a power before which the might of the world and the dominion of the nations who cast off righteousness and embraced lewdness without clear proof or evidence have proven impotent.</p>
<p>Say: O servants! Hearken unto the counsels of the Wronged One. The first of all things and of every mention hath been the knowledge of God. He is the Sustainer of all and the Educator of all. The first thing that proceedeth from knowledge is the love and unity of the servants, for through unity are the horizons of the world illumined and brightened. The purpose of unity is association, and the purpose of association is mutual assistance. The means that outwardly conduce to unity, fellowship, guidance and love are forbearance and beneficence. In one of the Tablets We have uttered this exalted word: Blessed is he who retireth to his bed at night with a heart purified from rancor and hatred. Glory is not for him who loveth his country, but for him who loveth the world. The fear of God hath ever been a sure fortress for the protection of the commanding self. It is the cause of the refinement and sanctification of one’s being, both outwardly and inwardly.</p>
<p>Time and again have We said that the victory mentioned in the Books, Scriptures and Tablets hath been through wisdom and utterance, as well as through deeds and character. By the life of God! The mightiest hosts of the world have been and are goodly character and pure deeds. The sword of virtue is keener than a blade of steel, were ye to understand. Without veil or concealment have We mentioned the Cause of God before the faces of the various peoples, and have enjoined upon all that which will draw them nigh, preserve them and exalt them. From the beginning of days until now, We have borne and shown patience toward whatsoever hath befallen Us in the path of the One True Friend. Through God’s grace and mercy, We have been and are sanctified from that which containeth even an atom’s weight of corruption.</p>
<p>Today, that which is worthy of mention is that which conduceth to the unity, harmony, elevation and exaltation of all. A goodly deed is like unto a tree, from which delicious and pleasing fruits immediately appear. This is the day of goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. Let not the counsels of the Wronged One pass from sight. We hope that the fragrance of love and friendship may be diffused amongst the loved ones, and that they may associate with one another in love and kindness. In one of the Tablets We have uttered this exalted word: The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with two luminaries: consultation and compassion. The tabernacle of world order is upheld upon two pillars: reward and punishment. Such matters pertain to the monarchs of the age. They are the manifestations of God’s power and the dawning-places of His divine majesty. After recognition of the Lord, exalted be His glory, it is incumbent to serve and obey the government and to hold fast to wisdom. These two cause the elevation and exaltation of existence and its progress. We beseech the True One that He may illumine His Majesty the Shah of Iran, may God strengthen him, with the effulgent lights of the Sun of Justice. If the divines of the Shi’ih party would permit, royal kindness and mercy would embrace all and he would rule with justice and fairness. This Wronged One has loved and continues to love fidelity, and that a king among the kings of the earth would assist the oppressed ones of the world. The path of truth and its balance has been justice and fairness. We implore God, exalted be His glory, not to deprive His servants from that which hath been mentioned. We counsel once again the friends of God to be trustworthy, to be religious, to be chaste, and to fear God, the Leader of the hosts of justice, the One Who commandeth, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Aid Thy servants to perform that which will diffuse the fragrance of Thy good pleasure and will be adorned with the glory of Thy acceptance. O Lord! Thou hearest their sighing, beholdest their tears, and knowest what hath befallen them without any evidence from Thee. Verily Thou knowest what is in the hearts of Thy servants and nothing whatsoever escapeth Thy knowledge. All created things have testified that Thou art the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>Blessed is the soul that hath held fast unto the cord of patience and resignation in whatsoever hath befallen it in the path of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. The Pen of the Wronged One hath, at all times, enjoined upon the servants that which will profit them, draw them nigh, and exalt them. We hope that God, exalted be His glory, will purify the ears of the world that they may hearken with the ear of acceptance to the counsels and exhortations of the Wronged One and act upon them.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Aid Thy heedless servants to return unto Thee, and the wrongdoers to turn toward the gate of Thy bounty. Verily Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful, the All-Giving, the All-Pardoning, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>He is the One Who gazeth from His Most Exalted Horizon</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar! Upon thee be My glory! This Day is the Day of God, and all the perceptions of the world and its peoples, and the wisdom and schemes of the people of knowledge and insight must needs be referred back to His Truth and His Cause. That is, all must observe that which leadeth to the exaltation of the Word and the upliftment of souls. From certain lands, lamentations and moaning have been raised, for some souls attribute themselves to the Truth yet commit that which causeth the Supreme Pen to wail. Glory be to God! Heedlessness hath so encompassed some that they occupy themselves at all times with the desires of self. Some have gone from this land to Kurdistan and have uttered that from which the Book of God is sanctified and remote, and have committed that which causeth the very eye of justice to weep. Likewise in the lands of Ha and Mim. Warn the people of God not to place their trust in every soul, nor to believe every speaker. If one beareth a Book but acteth contrary to the divine commandments, they should shun him. The loved ones of the Lord of all creation are distinguished from the worshippers of self and passion. We beseech God to enable all to attain unto that which beseemeth His Day. Today all must hold fast unto the fear of God and act with righteousness. Thou art witness, and God doth testify, that in the divine Tablets all are commanded to sanctification, detachment, goodly deeds, and praiseworthy character. Nevertheless, some have shown no mercy to themselves or to the Cause of God, and are consumed by the fire of self and passion. The Wronged One uttereth speech at a time when His heart, His Pen, and His limbs lament, and at His weeping do weep the company of them that are nigh, the sincere ones, and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise and the Supreme Heaven. These are words I uttered aforetime: The affliction is not My imprisonment and what hath befallen Me at the hands of Mine enemies, but rather from those who claim relationship with Me yet perpetrate what causeth Satan himself to flee, let alone man. Such utterances have repeatedly been revealed from the Pen of the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar! The servant who is present hath arrived and presented before the face of the Wronged One the letter thou didst write to him, and this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of Will that thy heart might rejoice thereby. Praise be to God, thou dost speak in remembrance and praise and art confirmed in service. This is a great bounty. We beseech God to aid thee every day, nay every hour, nay every moment. Verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful. Convey greetings to all the loved ones in that land on behalf of the Wronged One, and counsel them to trustworthiness, faithfulness, chastity, and that whereby the Cause of God is exalted. The petitions of some have attained the Most Holy Court and answers have been revealed. Let them convey them that hearts and minds may be attracted by the utterance of God, the Lord of the seen and unseen.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention Lutfu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God. We made mention of him before, and at this time with a mention whereby the hearts of them that are nigh have been attracted. Today the Sun calleth out saying: “Blessed is he that sitteth, yet hath arisen to serve the Cause, and he that is silent, yet hath spoken in praise of God, and he that is still, yet hath been stirred by the breezes of revelation, and the heart that hath turned unto God, the Lord of the worlds.” At every moment all things speak My praise and utter My glorification. Today the Mount is transported with joy, for it hath attained the presence of its Interlocutor. Blessed are they who, for the sake of God, occupy themselves with wisdom and utterance in the reformation of heedless souls.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! Behold, then call to mind when thou wert present before My face and didst hear My call. This is that call which the Daysprings of His Cause and the Fountainheads of His decree in ages and centuries past besought from the Self-Subsisting Lord to hear. Thou hast attained thereunto and wert present before His countenance. Rejoice thou and be of those who render thanks.</p>
<p>Thou didst make mention of His Honour ’Ali-A?ghar, upon him be My glory. Give him the glad-tidings from Me and remind him of My verses, then send unto him that which was sent unto thee from the presence of One Who is the All-Knowing Expositor. O A?ghar! Thy name was present at the Most Great Scene and thy mention descended from the Supreme Pen. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of all things, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou through the movement of Whose Pen all created things were set in motion. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy wisdom and utterance, and by the mysteries of Thy Book, to make me adorned with righteousness and piety, and crowned with supreme steadfastness. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O Rida! He who loved Me made mention of thee. We have remembered thee with a beauteous remembrance. Hearken unto the Call from the Divine Lote-Tree: Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Peerless, the All-Informed. He heareth the call and remembereth whom He willeth. He is verily the Omnipotent, the Almighty. Say: Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me and sent down unto me that which the treasuries of the seen and unseen cannot equal.</p>
<p>O Isma’il! That station for which pure spirits and holy souls sacrificed themselves with utmost detachment hath been sullied by some with the clay of idle fancies. Beseech thou the True One that He may aid His people to purification, sanctification and truthfulness. The confections of heedlessness and pride have captivated their desires. We beseech God that He may not withhold from them the waves of the ocean of His mercy and forgiveness, that they may perchance become aware and act as beseemeth them. Convey My greetings to all the loved ones in that land and set them ablaze with the fire of the Word. Verily thy Lord is the Commander, the Almighty.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory - the All-Bountiful, the All-Just, and verily He is the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting!</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou knowest that in my mention I have sought only Thy mention, and in my turning toward any direction I have turned only toward the direction of Thy grace and Thy gifts. I have desired naught but what Thou hast desired for Thy servants and Thy creation, and in what Thou hast commanded me I have sought only Thy praise and glory. I have willed naught but what Thou hast willed through Thy decree, and I have uttered only what Thou hast commanded me to speak amongst Thy servants and Thy creatures. I have sent no letter to anyone except that I intended thereby the protection of Thy creation and the safeguarding of Thy servants. Nay, by Thy Most Exalted Self! In no matter concerning myself have I sought to preserve my life in Thy dominion - rather have I spent it in Thy path and for the exaltation of Thy Word.</p>
<p>Thou knowest, O my God, what hath befallen Thy servants. Verily, I have desired in all matters naught but Thy manifestation amongst Thy servants and Thy power amongst Thy creatures. O Lord! Thou knowest that all paths have been cut off and calamities have encompassed from every direction. There hath befallen Thy loved ones that which hath befallen no one before. How many heads have been raised upon spears in Thy path, how many breasts have been pierced by arrows in Thy love, how much blood hath been shed upon Thy earth, how many sisters have lamented the loss of their brothers, how many fathers have cried out at the slaying of their sons, and how many sucklings have been cut off from their mothers’ breasts! All this hath come to pass upon these wronged ones after they had all acknowledged Thy unity and confessed Thy oneness.</p>
<p>O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Beautiful Names and Thy Most Exalted and Perfect Word to aid these oppressed ones. Then cause them to enter the fortress of Thy protection, that none may have the power to wrong them or seize them through tyranny. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the Help in Peril.</p>
<p>This servant submits that for twenty-five years a multitude of souls have not rested for a single night nor found repose for a moment. They have been continually afflicted by the fury of wrath and tormented by manifestations of anger. How many children have been left fatherless, and how many fathers rendered childless! How many mothers have wept in separation from their sons, and how many children have lamented and wailed at the loss of their mothers! How many sucklings have drunk the cup of martyrdom! They showed mercy neither to men nor to women. Many were the nights when all the beasts and birds found rest and repose in their lairs, while these servants, overcome with terror and trepidation, could find no safe refuge nor secure shelter. How many men who possessed wealth and affluence in the evening were beheld in utter poverty and abasement in the morning, their possessions plundered and their means of livelihood pillaged! No land remained that was not stained with the blood of these wronged ones, and no spot remained that had not become the scene of these helpless ones. How many women were taken captive and carried from land to land and city to city! How many men were sold for a price! How many souls fled to the wilderness, their whereabouts unknown! And how many remain imprisoned! The lamentations of these oppressed ones rise by night and day, and the cry of these captives is heard at all times. All these things have come to pass without any fault of theirs.</p>
<p>Two blessed utterances from the King of this age reached the ears of the oppressed ones - words that are truly royal, the like of which have never been heard from any sovereign. The first was in reply to the Russian government when it inquired about the cause and reason for war. He had said that the cry of those who were unjustly drowned in the Black Sea awakened Us from Our sleep at dawn, and thus We arose to wage war. Yet these oppressed ones are even more wronged and helpless, for the tribulations of those souls lasted but a day, while the afflictions of these servants have continued for twenty-five years, during which time we have been continually subjected to manifest trials. The second mighty utterance, which was truly a wondrous word that appeared in creation, was this: “It is incumbent upon Us to hearken to the plea of the oppressed and to answer the cry of those who are helpless.” The fame of the justice and fairness of the sovereign has given hope to many. Care for the condition of the oppressed ones is characteristic of the King of the world, and attention to the state of the weak is a trait of the Monarch of the age. Now, there have never been and are not now any oppressed ones on earth like unto these oppressed ones, nor are there any weak ones to be seen like unto these wanderers. For every living creature - be it human, animal, beast, or bird - all rest in the cradle of peace and security except these weak ones who are bound at every hour by the chains of wrath and afflicted with the fetters of anger and violence. No more patience remains in these servants, and forbearance has departed from their hearts and breasts. The plea of these servants is that they be shown a merciful glance, so that all may dwell secure and at rest under the protective shadow of the sovereign.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Glory and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who sent down the Book and sent forth Him Whom He chose before the creation of earth and heaven, and manifested Him with truth and guidance, and made Him a mercy to all worlds, and adorned Him with the crown of the Primal Word through His utterance “but He is the Apostle of God and the Seal of the Prophets.” And peace and blessings be upon His family and companions and followers who attained the recognition of God and drank from the Kawthar of certitude from the hands of assurance, and testified to that which God had testified that there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter of that honored brother arrived, and as it indicated health and well-being, a world of joy and delight was made manifest. This evanescent servant, in view of the lofty purpose and elevated nature of the deceased and elevated one, upon him be God’s peace, mercy and loving-kindness, and likewise due to this servant’s sincere service to them, has loved and continues to love all those associated with that pillar of certitude, and beseeches God to create means whereby all may pass their days in perfect comfort, tranquility, joy and delight. The One God is witness that whatsoever is expressed here has been and continues to be with truth and sincerity.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about the honored friend, his eminence Aqa Muhammad-Rida, upon him be God’s peace, this evanescent servant beseeches and hopes that God may bestow blessing upon his earnings. Let them not be disheartened. This condition has ever appeared in times of Manifestation. According to what is recorded, four hundred souls subsisted on dates for several days during the time of the Seal of the Prophets, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake. This poverty is the owner of wealth, for it is for God and in God’s path. Praise be to God, not one of the friends in this land has yet eaten barley bread; through divine bounty, blessing and favor they pass their days in utmost ease and contentment. The recession is throughout Iran. The One God is witness that what merchants and others have written in their letters would sadden every friend and grieve every loved one. This servant submits that at present divine bounty is manifest and His grace all-encompassing. Though they have brought a group to this land in the name of imprisonment, nevertheless all are free and at liberty, such that they are engaged in work and earning. A hundred thousand thanks are due for this blessing. We hope that the gates of favor will be opened before his eminence Aqa Muhammad-Rida and blessing will descend from the heaven of bounty - a blessing that decline shall not seize and change shall not find its way to. As for the sum that was mentioned concerning him, it was conveyed to his eminence Aqa Mirza Ayyub. At present they have no funds in hand, and in truth what they have said is with sincerity and truthfulness. However, it will be mentioned again, God willing, that they might receive and send it. There has been and will be no negligence. We beseech and hope from God that He may make manifest the means that are the cause of the joy of hearts and the light of eyes. He is powerful and mighty over all things.</p>
<p>[…] That esteemed brother wrote that comfort is for the enemies and hardship for the foes. The followers of Truth have ever been outwardly oppressed and destitute. Consider the Seal of the Prophets - may our souls be a sacrifice for His sake. He slept in a corner of the mosque. Abu Jahl sent men who placed a rope around His blessed neck and brought Him to the assembly. Abu Jahl - who was Abu’l-Hakam - and Abu Sufyan and Abdullah ibn Ubayy and Huyayy ibn Akhtab and Ka’b ibn al-Ashraf and other hypocrites were all wealthier and more prominent than His Holiness and His companions. This is not the first flask that has been broken in Islam. This matter is not new - it existed before, and that honored brother knows the details well. One of His Holiness’s companions, who was among the ten given glad tidings, was in need of daily sustenance in the early days, yet later divine blessings descended upon him to such an extent that a thousand horses were in his stable. Be not disheartened. This has been and remains evidence of the truth of the believers, and that brother, praise be to God, has attained that which in truth the pen is powerless to describe - and that is that esteemed brother’s connection to Him concerning Whom He says: “God hath adorned the earth with His form, His body, and His repose within its bosom.” This passage was written these past two days in response to a letter from one of this servant’s friends, as commanded. I hope the fragrance of these words will refresh the state of the friends. The Command is in God’s hands - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. This servant testifies with certainty that not a single atom of deeds performed for the sake of God will remain without fruit and effect. I beseech from God, exalted be His glory, confirmation, and I implore that esteemed brother to pray that perchance this servant may be enabled to achieve that which is befitting and worthy in this day. Without His grace all are halted and bewildered, how much more so this evanescent servant. In any case, he has always sought and continues to seek prayers, and sends greetings to the friends in that land. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings.</p>

<p>In His Name, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Wondrous, the Most High, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath shone forth with the lights of Beauty upon His Name, the Beloved. Thereupon appeared Paradise anew with all therein of trees and fruits and flowers and rivers and mansions and chambers, and all the countenances therein spoke that which the Tongue of the Revealer of Verses had spoken: verily there is no God but Him, and He Who speaketh is indeed the Wronged One in all regions amidst the people of dissension. And praise be to God Who hath shone forth with the lights of Glory upon His Name, the Dearly-Beloved. Thereupon appeared the Garden of Immortality and all other gardens beneath it, and therein was created that which the pens are powerless to describe. And everything therein testified to that which God hath testified: verily there is no God but Him, and He Who speaketh is indeed the Hidden Treasure and the Concealed Mystery. Whoso attaineth unto Him hath attained unto the presence of God, and whoso turneth away from Him hath turned away from God, the Lord of the Day of Mutual Divorce. And praise be to God Who hath uttered a Word whereby the world was attracted and the peoples were gathered together, and through another Word the names were separated and the greatest differentiation appeared among men. Exalted is God, the Lord of Destiny, through Whom appeared the Most Luminous, Most Pure Prospect, the station whereby the horizons were illumined. We testify that there is no God but Him. He hath ever been sanctified beyond all conjectures and imaginings, and He will ever continue to be what He hath always been. All things testify to His grandeur and His sovereignty, and every mention testifieth to His loftiness and His exaltation, except those who have clung to the frailest of houses and turned away from the House of God, the Manifest, the Speaking One amidst the world, through Whom hath appeared the Dawning-Place of Divine Unity and the Dayspring of this Effulgence.</p>
<p>And furthermore, your letter addressed to this servant arrived, but it caused sadness as it mentioned discord among the friends, even though these are days of fellowship and harmony. O my brother! The Supreme Pen has commanded all to love, affection, fellowship and unity, for unity has been the cause of the exaltation of the Cause while discord leads to its dissipation. I beseech Him, exalted and mighty be His glory, to enable all to inhale the fragrance of the revealed words, for if today all who are on earth were to discover the fragrance of the words of the Lord of Names which have flowed from the Supreme Pen, all would arise with their souls to serve Him, would move according to His will, and would breathe by His desire. In these days which are in truth the source of all days, and in this age which is the king of ages, the friends of the All-Merciful should strive with the utmost joy and fragrance to attain lofty stations and enduring ranks, for the world is seen to be as a shadow that exists one moment and is gone the next. The upright souls who have turned to God should hold fast to the cord of His grace and exert their utmost effort that perchance some service may be rendered by them for God’s sake, the effects of which will remain and endure in the world. If one would awaken even slightly and reflect upon the changes in the world, everything that exists therein, even while appearing to exist, testifies to its own transience and extinction. Blessed are they of insight who today have not been deprived by any veil from the Most Great Vision and who day and night are occupied with uniting hearts and bringing souls together. Man’s life passes like the winds, and this passing is hidden from sight and heart. Blessed is the soul who has burned away the veils of heedlessness with the fire of remembrance and has gazed upon things with the eye of insight. People are heedless and unaware of the radiant lights and diffused fragrances of these days. By the Educator of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and unseen! Were they to become aware and conscious, they would renounce themselves and all the worlds in the path of the Friend and would act according to that which God has willed. God willing, you will gird up the loins of service and occupy yourself according to your capacity with uniting hearts. Man is prone to error, for the Most Great Infallibility belongs exclusively to God Himself. We should pray for one another that the Truth, exalted be His grandeur, may preserve all and shelter them beneath the shadow of His grace. Say to the friends that today is the day of steadfastness, for the manifestations of doubt and uncertainty lie in wait at all times. Hold fast unto God and consider all else as non-existent and void, and be not troubled or saddened by certain matters, for no one has been or ever will be able to change the appointed time and determined hour. With the utmost joy and gladness drink from the cups of mystical knowledge in the name of the Beloved of all possibility. Verily He is with you under all conditions and aids you through the agencies of the heavens and the earth. He is indeed the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>We beseech God that He may strengthen you to engage in His praise and glorification and service to His Cause. Mention was made of you before the Divine Throne, and a most holy and exalted Tablet was revealed and sent down from the heaven of God’s will. God willing, you shall attain unto it. We supplicate God that He may enable all to love and please Him, and to remain steadfast in His Cause - the Cause whereby hearts have been perturbed and feet have slipped. And praise be to God, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath spoken through the sovereignty of His Will in the Kingdom of utterance, whereupon all contingent beings were thunderstruck and the pillars of all religions trembled, except for those who cast away vain imaginings and turned unto the All-Merciful. These are accounted as the people of Baha by the Pen of God, the Lord of all names. Upon them pray the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the cities of names, both morn and eventide. Praise be to God Who hath manifested His Hidden Name, whereby the horizon of Revelation hath shone forth and the Dove hath warbled upon the Divine Lote-Tree. By God! This is the Day wherein the earth hath been cleft asunder and the heaven hath been rent in twain, whereupon the mystics fled and the learned were thunderstruck - they who clung to the hem of vain desire and held fast to the cord of tyranny and transgression. These are indeed accounted among the wayward in the sight of God, the Cleaver of the heavens. Praise be to God Who hath sent down from His holy Kingdom His Most Holy Book and made it the Dayspring of guidance unto all creation. Blessed is he who hath taken hold of it with the power that proceedeth from Him, and woe betide him who hath turned away from that which hath been sent down therein from His Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>Thereafter, We have received your letter from which wafted the fragrance of your love for our Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and on earth. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist you ever in serving His Cause and to gladden you through His remembrance. In these days when the clamor of the people is raised high and the consuming flames of the might of those in authority are evident, the true station of the friends of God must needs be made manifest among men. Strange indeed that some of the people of that land have been observed to be fearful and disturbed, although all assuredly know that manifest death shall overtake all and none can escape it. This being the case, if one should be blessed with achieving the supreme martyrdom in the path of God, it is certainly better and more beloved than to surrender one’s soul on a sickbed afflicted with various loathsome ailments.</p>
<p>Today must every soul conduct himself in accordance with the divine verses revealed in the glorious Tablets, meaning that no act contrary to wisdom should proceed from him, and that he should remain mindful in all conditions of the divine wisdom wherewith he is commanded, letting no corruption or contention be manifested from him. Under such circumstances, should any wrong befall him, it hath been and shall be in the path of God. I swear by the Sun of Revelation that this station hath no equal. Should someone sacrifice a hundred thousand lives for this station, it would still not be worthy of it.</p>
<p>The purpose is that all the friends should remain steadfast through the power and might of God, and be adorned with goodly deeds and praiseworthy character, and not be disturbed by the clamor of the heedless. God willing, you should ever remind the friends of God that they may all be united in complete harmony and agreement upon the universal Word of the Lord.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning the friends from Eshtehard and Kaleh-Dareh, requesting me to convey their greetings to the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence - at a special time, I presented everyone’s greetings before the Divine Throne. The Sun of Favor rose from the horizon of grace regarding all. His words, exalted be His glory: “O friends! Praise be to God that through the grace of the Beloved of the worlds, you have drunk from the wine of divine knowledge and utterance, and have turned toward the supreme horizon, the dawning-place of the Lord of Names. Know ye the value of this bounty and be thankful in all conditions. Be not saddened by the events of this fleeting world, the opposition of heedless souls, and the clamor of those possessed of vain knowledge. By My life! Soon all shall perish and vanish, and the banners of divine victory shall be raised in all directions. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful. Walk with utmost wisdom and hold fast to the divine commandments. Drink consecutively and successively from the cups of the favors of the Lord of creation, and offer them to those who are ready, despite those who have denied the verses of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. You have always been and continue to be in Our sight. What is beloved today is steadfastness, unity, and acting in accordance with what hath been sent down in the Tablets of wisdom and all else. God willing, may all be immersed in the ocean of contentment and hold fast to the sure handle. Verily, He is with those who have fulfilled God’s Covenant and His pledge, and who have followed what was revealed in His mighty, powerful and wondrous Book.”</p>
<p>And regarding what was written that Mashadi Ali Akbar sends his greetings and mentions that the old love should not be forgotten - it has never been forgotten and never shall be. And concerning what was mentioned about the elimination of differences - this word truly brought joy to the heart, for discord is the cause and reason for the waste of God’s Cause among His servants. We implore God, exalted be His glory, with utmost humility and supplication, to adorn all with the ornament of unity and cause them to utter the blessed words “There is none other God but He.” I remember all the friends and masters of the land of A, Q, and K. All should be grateful with utmost joy, for they are mentioned in the Greatest Scene and are honored with divine favors. The petition that was submitted to the Divine Throne was presented, adorned with the sun of God’s verses, and sent. God willing, may they attain unto it. The Glory be upon you.</p>

<p>Praise be to God, the Sovereign of earth and heaven, the Lord of might and power. He hath revealed through the Pen of Destiny that which preserveth and guardeth His servants and causeth them to hold fast to the cord of pardon, bounty, grace and glory. He, verily, is the Lord of all mankind and the Master of the beginning and the end. Were it not for His grace, who would recognize His straight Path and His manifest and brilliant Way? We praise and thank Him until that Day whose end hath not appeared and whose bounties are limitless. And may the resplendent prayers that shine forth from the horizon of God’s Will rest upon His chosen ones, His loved ones, and the Hands of His Cause, whom He hath described in His Book with the words “No fear shall be upon them, nor shall they grieve.”</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice for your remembrance! Your noble letter arrived like the arrival of the Beloved to the lover, or like the descent of spring rains upon the luminous and receptive ground. God knoweth that the servant found in its words and letters that which transformed the most great sorrow into the greatest joy. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to preserve you, to assist you, and to cause you to speak that which will attract the heart of every seeker, every aspirant, and every one who hath turned unto Him. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer of prayers, the Compassionate, the All-Powerful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>When I had read and understood it, I approached the Most Great Spot and presented it before the Lord. He–may our souls be a sacrifice for Him–said: “O Muhammad Mustafa! Upon thee be the peace of God, the Lord of all beings. We have enjoined upon all wisdom and utterance, conciliation and harmony, religion and faithfulness. However, they who claim love and fellowship have cast behind their backs that which they were commanded and have chosen that which hath kindled the fire of corruption. We beseech God to aid His loved ones to that which will exalt their station in the earth. He, verily, is the Hearer, the Answerer of prayers.”</p>
<p>The Wronged One beareth witness that the Sultan who was named ’Abdu’l-Hamid–may God assist him–was holding fast to the cord of justice and equity and was detached from tyranny and oppression. All affairs return unto him, and he–may the All-Merciful assist him–was seated upon the throne of consultation, at all times consulting with the ministers and the learned ones regarding affairs, choosing what the people chose. He possessed sound judgment and penetrating and brilliant intelligence. It behooveth all to beseech God to assist him, preserve him, and aid him through His might, His sovereignty, His strength and His power. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Nothing hath appeared from him that would grieve Us, and We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to preserve him and assist him henceforth in protecting the oppressed and succouring the poor and needy. We counsel Our loved ones to observe religion and trustworthiness, and that which would gladden the heart of the Sultan. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Glorious, the Bestower.</p>
<p>We have read the letter of Mim–may God, exalted be He, assist him. He hath spoken with truth and justice and hath mentioned Muhammad Mahdi and the sons of the Deputy in a manner befitting them. We beseech God to assist them and enable them to act in accordance with that which they have been commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to protect them from the evil of enemies and to ordain for them that which will draw them near unto Him in all conditions. He, verily, is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. We send greetings from this Spot to My loved ones and My friends, and We counsel them with that which would gladden the hearts of the world. Blessed is he who hath heard and acted upon that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an, and woe unto every heedless doubter.</p>
<p>Verily the servant loveth to make mention of His Honor Mim, upon him be 90-60-6 [Baha’u’llah], the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Praise be to God that there hath appeared from His presence that which hath silenced the lying tongues. Verily our Lord is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. We beseech the Lord to manifest through his presence the standards of trustworthiness, guidance, chastity and fidelity, and to open before his face the door of His grace. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth through His All-Wise Name. And I send greetings upon the faces of the friends that were transformed for the sake of God from the buffetings of the oppressors and tyrants. I beseech Him, blessed and exalted be He, to assist His loved ones to spread the verses of wisdom, fellowship, love and unity, that the world may be illumined by the light of security and peace. Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>At the end of the Book, the tongue of the Lord spoke in remembrance of the fruit of the heart, the son of His Honor Mim - upon them both be the peace and loving-kindness of God - and said: Verily We desired to seal this remembrance with mention of him who was named ’Abdu’l-Husayn, that he may rejoice and be among the triumphant.</p>
<p>O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne and by that which hath appeared from Thy presence, and by this lamp which hath been beset by tempestuous winds from every direction, that Thou protect him and Thy loved ones there, and ordain for him and for them that which shall never cease to shed its fragrance throughout the eternity of Thy names and attributes. Verily Thou art the Revealer of verses and the Manifester of clear proofs. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>The servant greeteth him and maketh mention of him through the loving-kindness of the Lord, and remindeth him of verses that cannot be prevented by the might of those in the kingdom of creation.</p>
<p>O God, my God, my Lord and my Support! Ordain for him and for Thy loved ones there that which befitteth the ocean of Thy grace and the heaven of Thy bounty. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>And I send greetings upon the delight of eyes and the loved ones of God who are there, and I ask for them every good thing He hath ordained, and every glory He hath decreed, and every light He hath sent down, and every splendor and loftiness He hath raised up.</p>
<p>O God of the world and Beloved of the nations! Ordain for Thy loved ones that which shall protect them from the calumnies of every liar and the opposition of every opposer. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy, the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the robe to which have clung all in this world and in the world to come.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O my God, by the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and the murmur of the breezes of Thine utterance in the kingdom of Thy names, to remove me far from whatsoever Thy will abhorreth, and draw me nigh unto the station wherein He Who is the Day-Spring of Thy signs hath shone forth. Thou seest me, O my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy, the Most Luminous, the Most Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and clinging to the hem of the robe to which have clung all in this world and in the world to come.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O my God, by that Letter which, as soon as it proceeded out of the mouth of Thy will, hath caused the oceans to surge, and the winds to blow, and the fruits to be revealed, and the trees to spring forth, and all past traces to vanish, and all veils to be rent asunder, and them who are devoted to Thee to hasten unto the light of the countenance of their Lord, the Unconstrained, to make known unto me what lay hid in the treasuries of Thy knowledge and concealed within the repositories of Thy wisdom.

<p>O Ali-Naqi, who hath attained the presence of God! He is the Most Exalted, the Most High!</p>
<p>These are the verses of the Book sent down in truth from God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. It giveth glad tidings to them that believe in the unity of God of His good-pleasure and His presence, and warneth the idolaters of the chastisement of God, the Protector, the Almighty, the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>O concourse of light! Hear ye the call of God from this crimson Tree upraised upon this blessed white spot, that verily there is none other God but Him, and that this is His Manifestation and His sovereignty unto all who are in the heavens and on the earth. None knoweth this save him whom God hath aided in His Cause and made him to be among them that are endued with insight.</p>
<p>O Ali-Naqi! Purify thine ears from all that thou hast heard, that thou mayest hearken unto the melodies of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Compelling. By My life! If there remaineth in thine ear a single word of all that hath been mentioned in creation, the Word of thy Lord will not enter therein, for it cannot be joined with aught else. None comprehendeth this save Our chosen servants. And should it enter, thou wilt not find its sweetness, nor wilt thou attain unto the treasures of meaning and mysteries that lie concealed therein.</p>
<p>Likewise the heart - if it be not purified from the love of the world and all that is therein, the lights of thy Lord’s revelation will never be reflected therein, for they cannot be joined with aught else. None denieth this save every froward denier.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Compare not the words of God with aught else, for they shine forth in the heaven of meaning and utterance even as the sun shineth forth at noontide through the power of My Name, the Mighty, the Effulgent. If after the rising of the sun thou shouldst find any radiance or light in the stars, then after the revelation of God’s Word thou wouldst find traces in all else. Nay, by My Self, the Chosen One, if thou be of them that perceive!</p>
<p>Free thyself from the veils of fancy and desire, then turn with thy whole being unto God, thy Lord, the Protector, the All-Forgiving. Blessed art thou, O servant, for having entered the precincts of the Throne and attained the presence of God, thy Lord, at a time when the sun of the beauty of thy Lord was about to shine forth from behind the veils and coverings.</p>
<p>When the promise was fulfilled and the days were accomplished, the Beauty of the Youth appeared more times than can be reckoned. Thereupon every idolatrous unbeliever was thunderstruck. The matter reached such a pass that most of the servants dispersed from around thy Lord, and sovereignty remained with God, the King, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>Should thou ask them by what reason they believed in Ali [the Bab] before, yet by what cause they turned away from this Manifestation, there would issue from their mouths that which issued from the mouths of them that disbelieved in God on the day He came with the truth upon clouds of light.</p>
<p>Say: O heedless ones! Fie upon you and upon what ye have acquired in your vain life! Soon shall ye find yourselves and your deeds turned to dust. Thus hath the matter been ordained in a Tablet wherefrom escapeth not whatsoever the servants have wrought in secret and in public.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear ye God and dispute not with Him Who hath come to you from the Dayspring of the Spirit with sovereignty and power. Deny not God’s favor after its revelation, and draw not nigh unto the trees that have grown from the root of hell, whose fruits are naught but association with God on a day wherein most eyes were blinded and backs were broken, save those whose backs God strengthened for the triumph of His Cause and upon whom He sent down tranquility from His presence. Verily, there is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command. He aideth whom He willeth through His command and denieth whomsoever He pleases through His authority, and all things have their measure with Him. And you, O servant, sever yourself from those who have denied God after being encompassed by the verses from all directions, and who wander in the wilderness of evil to such extent that they have taken their vain imaginings as lord instead of God. Thus do We inform you that you may understand the matter and guard yourself against these evil ones. And if they are asked “Who is your God?” they will surely say “God,” yet when God’s verses are recited to them or His manifest power is related to them, their faces darken and they turn away. O servant, hold fast to the cord of God and His grace, for He will protect you from their assault and will send down to you that which will make you independent of all else. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Concealer. Beware lest you forget God’s favor to you when you entered the Garden of Paradise and heard the melody of God, your Lord, and attained to that for which the righteous died in grief. Hold fast to this Tree in such wise that neither the tempests of trials nor the storms of temptation shall move you, and you shall remain steadfast in the Cause of God, your Lord, remembering Him at eventide and dawn. Say: Those who plot against God’s Cause - God shall turn their plots back upon themselves, and the plotting of the idolaters leads only to ruin. Say: O concourse of idolaters, rejoice not within yourselves. Wait until the breezes of chastisement encompass you from all directions and the angels of wrath come upon you from every quarter. Then shall you find no helper or supporter for yourselves, and whenever you cry for help, you shall be helped only with further punishment. Thus has it been ordained by God, the Compeller, the All-Compelling. O servant, take the tablet of God with power from Him, and be a light and mercy unto His loved ones and a flame of fire unto His enemies. Thus have We commanded you. Act according to what you have been commanded and be not of those who mention God with their tongues while heedless of the Sovereign of remembrance. And glory be upon you and upon every discerning believer.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, majesty and grandeur!</p>
<p>The essence of praise befitteth Him Who is the Lord of Names, Who hath illumined the Most Great Horizon with one of His names and guided His servant ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar unto it. He is the One Who at one time made Baghdad the Most Glorious Horizon and at another time made Adrianople the Dawning-place of His verses. At times He made ’Akka the Source of Names and at other times adorned Mazra’ih with the lights of His most exalted attributes. Blessed is the eye that hath turned unto Him, the face that hath been set towards His seat, the ear that hath heard His call, and the tongue that hath uttered that which was commanded in His Book. The Servant beseecheth His Lord to aid His loved ones to do that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to write down for them from the Supreme Pen that which shall profit them in this world and in the world to come. He, verily, is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>I offer my prayers, my salutations and my glorification unto the Manifestations of His oneness, the Dawning-places of His singleness, the Sources of His laws, the Recipients of His revelation, and the Repositories of His grace and bounty - they who broke not His Covenant on His Day and acted according to what was commanded in His Book. These are the monarchs of the seen and unseen realms of existence. These are the servants in whose praise His Supreme Pen moved in the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms and the Qur’an. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou by Whose light the horizon of the world was illumined and by Whose Word the Most Great Ocean was stirred! I beseech Thee to protect Thy loved ones from the arrows of the polytheists and the deniers who have disbelieved in Thy signs, disputed Thy proof, warred against Thy Self, turned away from Thy manifestation, Thy appearance and Thy sovereignty. O my Lord! Write down for Thy chosen ones that which befitteth Thy generosity, then send down upon them from the heaven of Thy mercy that which beseemeth Thy days. Thou art He to Whose loftiness, sovereignty and power the tongues of all created things have testified. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Powerful, the Great.</p>
<p>And now, O my beloved! The lights of thy mention of my Beloved and thy Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and the earth have illumined me. When the breezes of utterance awakened me to the remembrance of our Lord, the Most Merciful, I arose and turned towards a station that cannot be indicated by my indication nor by the mention of any on earth. When I entered and attained His presence, after permission was granted, I presented what was contained therein. Then the face of the Beloved turned toward me and He spoke that which I am unable to mention except according to my weakness and poverty. By Him Who hath caused all things to speak forth His praise! Every possessor of utterance, every person of understanding, and every seeker hath fallen short of that which the Tongue of Grandeur spoke forth in that hour wherein the sun of utterance shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the favors of our Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And when hour upon hour had passed, He spoke - and His word is most sweet: “O ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar! The Wronged One, from the direction of His Most Great Horizon, maketh mention of thee, as a favor from His presence, and He is the Compassionate, the All-Knowing. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as We have found from thee the fragrance of steadfastness in this Most Great News at whose appearance the hearts of the mystics were sorely troubled. Let nothing grieve thee. Rejoice in the remembrance of thy Lord and say:</p>
<p>“Praise be unto Thee, O Creator of the heavens and Lord of Names, for having caused me to turn unto Thee and for having revealed unto me that which was inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Scroll and was mentioned in the Books which Thou didst send down unto the Prophets and Messengers. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Thy Self and by Thy Manifestation and by the sweetness of Thy utterance, to aid me in the service of Thy Cause and to grant me Thy presence even as Thou didst grant it unto me the first time. Verily, Thou art the Kind, the Forgiving, the Merciful. There is none other God but Thee, the King, the Just, the Manifest Truth.” Thus endeth the matter.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that thou hast been blessed with the most excellent remembrances from the presence of the Beloved of the worlds. In the former Holy Books, those near to God, the monotheists, the Prophets, and the Messengers beseeched God, exalted be His glory, for the encounter with His Day, which is referred to as the Day of God. How many souls have appeared and come into the world, yet remained heedless and veiled from that for which they were created! Their likeness is as bubbles upon the water, appearing and moving without consciousness, and enduring even less than that - they appear, they move, and they perish. Verily, God is the Everlasting, the Eternal, the Strengthener, the Manifest, the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant is exceedingly joyful and filled with delight and gladness through the favors of the Beloved concerning your honor. Blessed art thou, and I, and whosoever hath attained unto this cup which is circulated by the fingers of the grace of His Most Generous Name.</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst write about the dream, it was submitted, and He said: “We have confirmed him in his turning unto God and have mentioned him as befitteth. We beseech God, exalted be He, to ordain for him that which he loveth and with which he is well-pleased. It behooveth him to say: ‘O my Lord! Ordain for me that which shall profit me in Thy worlds. I know not what is within Thyself. Thou knowest what is with me, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.’”</p>
<p>I beseech thee to convey greetings on behalf of this evanescent one to those who drink from the cup of inner meanings. I implore God to strengthen them all and cause them to attain unto that which hath been ordained for them. Verily, He is the Answerer, the All-Bountiful. God willing, that which appeareth from them in God is preserved in the Divine Treasury until God shall make it manifest, as a grace from His presence, and He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. The Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon whosoever acteth in accordance with that which hath been commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. Praise be to God, the Desired One of all worlds.</p>

<p>The eye of justice weeps and equity laments. Glory be to God! In Iran, pride is taken in tyranny, oppression, cruelty and the behavior of savage beasts of field and prairie. The wolves of the isles of ignorance have torn the divine sheep. Great loss they count as mighty gain. Today the lamentation of all things is raised in the land of Ya, and the cry and moan of the Josephs of inner meaning ascends from the well of the oppressors’ station. A grievous wound has been inflicted upon the breast of justice and a mighty blow dealt to the temple of equity. The gazelles of the wilderness of love and purity are pursued by the hunters of malice, and shameless tyrants chase after the children in their cradles. The station of justice and its hosts are established through oppression and its armies. In Iran, mercy is like the phoenix - known by name but without trace - and equity is like the philosopher’s stone - mentioned but unseen.</p>
<p>On the twenty-third night of Ramadan, a great cloud of dust and smoke arose from the hatred and malice of the deniers and opposers, such that it veiled, nay obliterated, the effulgent rays of the Sun of Justice. Two helpless and unaided souls, Aqa ’Ali and Aqa ’Ali-Asghar - upon them be the glory of God and His favors - were seized without cause or reason in the mosque of Shaykh Hasan-i-Sabzivari. They were taken with utter humiliation by the deputy of the governor, Haji Na’ib, before His Excellency, where they were subjected to various punishments and then imprisoned. It is reported that they seized whatever worldly goods they could and then released them. Thereafter another smoke arose from the dawning-places of tyranny and vice, and that was the seizure of sacred souls for a second time. Seven souls were taken, among them the honored Mulla ’Ali-i-Sabzivari and likewise the honored Mulla Mahdi - upon them both be the glory of God and His favors. His Excellency said to one, “Recant and you will be freed.” That true seeker replied, “For forty years I have awaited this day, and praise be to God, today I have attained it.” And another, while being paraded through the markets with executioners, attendants and footmen, proclaimed: “O people! The Lord of the Martyrs said ‘Is there any who will help me?’ and I say, ‘Is there any who will behold me?’” In brief, the fire of hatred was so intensely kindled that the pen is powerless to describe it. These two blessed souls and the others sacrificed their lives with complete steadfastness.</p>
<p>The blood of these souls has caused the people of Iran to now hear certain utterances and remain silent, and even accept them. The people of Iran would not walk with any foreigner, for they regarded all, God forbid, as unclean and would never consider speaking with them. Now through the grace of this Most Great Revelation, the gates of knowledge have been opened. That excessive savagery, rejection and protest have been lifted, and He gave glad-tidings of His presence and meeting to all and enabled them to attain it. The blood of the lovers performed miracles throughout the horizons, dispelled the causes of remoteness with the whips of utterance, and established nearness in its rightful station and abode. Now most associate with all parties and truly love them - indeed, such love toward all has become manifest that its appearance was considered impossible by the servants. Blessed be the Generous One, the Lord of great bounty. Now all have become sight that they might see, and hearing that they might hear. The hosts of acceptance have removed denial. Reflect upon the penetrating power of the Supreme Pen and the potency of the Most Exalted Word - how He transformed and drew near.</p>
<p>In any case, they martyred these souls with the worst torments of the world. They put a rope around one and dragged him to the edge of town while beating and driving the rest behind him - some with stones, some with sticks, some with chains, and some with weapons. They cut those holy temples to pieces, then burned them and threw their bones into pits. It is reported that a thousand fled to the wilderness - it is not known where they went or what became of them. In those days, no one inquired about the families and children of those oppressed ones, nor approached them out of fear. Those wronged ones remained without sustenance. It is said that some from the community of Christ - may God strengthen them - secretly assisted them without anyone’s knowledge and sent them daily provisions.</p>
<p>O spiritual friend! Today the wailing of pebbles rises from the wilderness and the moaning of trees is loud. That night, by government order, the people celebrated and held a great festival as if they had conquered a territory. Glory be to God! Oppression and ignorance reached such a degree as to astound all in the heavens and earth. Soon shall they see the recompense of their deeds, for after every injustice the light of justice dawns, and after every tyranny the sun of equity shines forth. In all conditions, we beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid His servants to turn to Him and to make amends for what has escaped them in the nights and days. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>Praise be unto that Most Desired One, whom neither the doubts of the learned, nor the insinuations of the turbaned ones, nor the might of the world, nor the oppression of nations could prevent from His purpose or deter from His Will. At a time when the arrows of the enemies were flying like rain from all directions, the Tongue of Grandeur was speaking the blessed words “There is none other God but He, the One with power over what is and what has been.” How many were the transgressors and the deniers who arose to harm Him and issued decrees for the shedding of His most pure blood. Nevertheless, the ocean of grace surged with utmost waves, and the sun of loving-kindness shone with perfect radiance and brilliance. His mercy has preceded all, His favor encompasses all, His Cause prevails. Exalted be His Cause, glorified His grandeur, and mighty His sovereignty. There is none other God but Him.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose Name the heavenly table was sent down, the bounty was made manifest, mercy preceded all, and the rains of utterance poured forth from the heaven of knowledge upon all who dwell in the realm of possibility. I beseech Thee by the mysteries deposited within Thy Most Great Name, and by the lights of Thy countenance, O Lord of eternity and Sovereign of nations, to assist Thy loved ones to remember and praise Thee, and to act in accordance with what befits Thy days. Then protect them, O my God, from the influences of the oppressors and the might of the transgressors who cast aside Thy laws, clinging to their own desires when the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation appeared.</p>
<p>O Lord! Thou seest Thy servant Nabil, the traveler, in the hands of the tyrannical among Thy servants. I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, to assist him in all conditions to serve Thee, to make him a champion of Thy Cause, and steadfast in carrying out what Thou hast willed through Thy sovereignty. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Great.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letters of that spiritual beloved arrived one after another, each bearing witness to that beloved’s love, acceptance, steadfastness and service, and from every letter thereof wafted the fragrance of humility, such that the people of the realm of wisdom perceived it and received their portion. Verily, He does not allow the reward of the doers of good to be lost. By the life of our Beloved and your Beloved, every word that has flowed from the pen of that steadfast, firmly-rooted, and upright friend has testified and continues to testify. And one letter from that spiritual beloved arrived in these days; after its reading and review, it was taken to the presence of the Lord of Creation, and after permission was granted, it was presented before His face. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, exalted be His utterance and mighty His station:</p>
<p>He is the Helper, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O Nabil, O Traveller! That which hath befallen thee is witnessed by the Lord of the world, and that which hath proceeded from thee hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance, inasmuch as His mercy hath encompassed all things and the sun of His grace hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of His bounty, manifest and resplendent. For thee there is a station with thy Lord - be thou assured and be of them that render thanks. Be not grieved by any matter. Thou art under the gaze of the True One and art related unto Him. By My life! God hath created the earth and its treasures for thee and for them that are like thee. Grieve not for that which hath passed. The ornaments of the world have ever been, and shall continue to be, worthy only of heedless and ornate souls. By the Sun of grace which shineth from the most exalted horizon of the world, resplendent and manifest: there are treasures laid up for thee with God which no thief can reach and no oppressor can find. Verily thy Lord is He Who informeth, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God willing, thou shalt be assisted to accomplish that which We commanded thee after thy request in Our presence. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and upon them that love thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Praise and gratitude be unto Him for having mentioned you, and made you know Him, and taught you His straight and manifest path. This servant beseecheth God - exalted be His glory - to aid that beloved one in all conditions. He verily hath power over whatsoever He willeth. From the last two letters, immeasurable grief was perceived. After presenting them again, they said: O servant in attendance, write to his honor the Traveller, upon him be My glory: God’s bounty hath been and shall ever be with you. With the utmost joy and fragrance, and with trust and assurance, hold fast unto that which hath been commanded. Verily thy Lord loveth thee and is with thee in all conditions. Glory be upon thee and upon thy children and upon them that are with thee and have believed in God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Yet again when present in the Most Holy Court, mention of you was repeatedly made by the tongue of the Lord of Names, and the sun of bounty and favors rose resplendent and manifest. I beseech God to cause that beloved one to attain unto all that beseemeth His grace and generosity. Verily He is the Protector of whosoever loveth Him and the Helper of whosoever turneth unto Him, and He is the Concealer, the Forgiver, the All-Bountiful, the Compassionate, the Generous. Unto his honor the son, upon him be the glory of God and His bounty, I convey greetings and salutations. God willing, may he be assisted to serve his Lord and to remain steadfast in His Cause. The world shall soon perish and pass away, and that which endureth and lasteth is the bounty of God - exalted be His glory - towards His loved ones, which hath been and shall ever be. Blessed is he who hath attained unto His bounties in His days and hath drunk the choice wine of reunion from the hands of His bestowal. Glory and praise and exaltation be upon you and upon them that are with you and upon those who have heard and answered their Lord, the Speaking One, the Trustworthy. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Afnan, Mirza ’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God! The Most Great, the Most Ancient, the Most Exalted!</p>
<p>A mention from Us to him who was illumined by the lights of his Lord’s countenance, the Mighty, the Bestower. When he heard the Call, he turned unto it, and when he was summoned, he responded. Verily, they who have been faithful to God’s Covenant are accounted among the most exalted of beings in the sight of the Sublime Truth. They who were heedless are assuredly numbered with the people of the fire in the estimation of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>Say: The Most Great Balance hath appeared, whereby all deeds are weighed, and verily it is God’s Path for all who are in earth and heaven. Through it every seeker hath turned, and everything hath voiced the remembrance of God, the Cleaver of the Dawn. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou hast found the sweetness of utterance in that which hath been sent down from the All-Merciful, and hast recognized thy Lord in this Garment whereby all regions have been illumined.</p>
<p>We had previously sent thee a Tablet wherein wafted the sweet savors of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Mighty, the Ever-Forgiving. And before that, another Tablet through which the sun of grace shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord’s mercy upon all creation. Beware lest anything sadden thee or the tyranny of those who have rebelled against God when He came in the clouds of glory cause thee to grieve. When sorrow overtaketh thee, consider Mine affair and reflect upon that which hath befallen this Wronged One when He was made a captive in the hands of the two parties who had turned away from God after He had come unto them with the kingdom of verses.</p>
<p>Blessed is the strong one who hath arisen to serve his Lord’s Cause, and the herald who proclaimeth this Name with wisdom and clear exposition. Say: O people! Where are they who unjustly oppressed the earth, and where are the royal couches and crowns? And where are they who warred against God and His chosen ones? They have been consumed by their wrongful devouring of people’s wealth. Verily thy Lord is severe in punishment.</p>
<p>That which endureth is what He hath ordained for those near unto Him. Thus hath the matter been decreed in the Tablets. By My life! That which is with men shall perish, while glory and power shall remain for those who have turned to the Dayspring of Light. By God! Were they to hear the scratching of the Supreme Pen, the ecstasy of God would so seize them that they would cast away their kingdoms and turn to the Kingdom. Thus hath it been sent down from the heaven of might at this time when the tongue of grandeur proclaimeth: The Kingdom is God’s, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Effulgent.</p>
<p>My likeness is as one who hath embarked upon the sea while waves encompass him from every side. In such state he calleth out to creation and summoneth them unto God, the Lord of Lords. Say: Doth such a Beloved deserve praise or hatred? Be fair, O ye possessors of sight, and be not like those who witnessed God’s power yet denied it. These are assuredly companions of the fire. Do they imagine they follow God’s command? Nay, by the Lord of creation! They worshipped vain imaginings for a thousand years, and when the appointed time came and the Dayspring of verses appeared, they were terrified and cried out: “This is none other than a lying impostor!” Say: Fear God, and exchange not the pearl for the shell, nor the jewel for clay. Thus doth your Lord command you out of His love for His servants who were created by His all-compelling command that overshadoweth the horizons.</p>
<p>O servant who gazeth toward God! Praise be to the Best Beloved of the worlds, that thou art blessed with His love, engaged in His remembrance, and turned toward His direction. This hath been and ever shall be among the greatest bounties. God willing, thou shalt be watchful over His Cause in all conditions, for whatsoever is associated with Truth is abiding, eternal and steadfast, while all else is evanescent and as nothingness. The weak souls today are unaware - some are afflicted in the wilderness of heedlessness, while others are barred from the court of oneness by ancient, worn-out, man-made doctrines. For a thousand years or more, these deluded souls have fixed their gaze upon an imaginary person in an imaginary city, clinging to him; yet after the appearance of the Most Great Luminary, only a few rent asunder the veils of idle fancies, while the rest remained bound by the same vain imaginings. Blessed is he who, by the power of his Lord, the Mighty, the Omnipotent, hath torn away the veils. All that the followers of the Furqan (Qur’an) formerly possessed can be measured by this same standard. The deluded ones have ever been and continue to be thus, as is now witnessed. The one who associateth partners with God and his followers have, through mention of a fabricated successorship, barred people from the Lord of creation. They are in naught but error - thy Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, is witness. Although all know they have neither understood nor comprehend His Cause, still they wander in the wilderness of error, unaware. In any case, be not saddened by these matters, for God hath servants who burn away the veils of idle fancy and rend asunder the coverings of the people. These are they whom neither that which is in the hands of men, nor that which their lying tongues utter, can deter. They are the lights of unity in the lands and the stars of detachment among the servants. Soon will their station be made manifest to all on earth. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>If thou askest about conditions in this land, it is in evident turmoil. That which was foretold in previous Tablets is now manifest. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Would that none but myself had to endure tribulations in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. In all conditions we have been and are thankful, and are engaged in His praise and glorification. Nothing can prevent Him, even should all kings oppose Him and every bondsman turn away from Him. We beseech God to assist thee in His service and obedience, and to aid thee through His grace. He, verily, is the Most Merciful of the merciful.</p>
<p>Convey exalted and glorious greetings to the Afnan, and likewise to such of God’s sincere servants as are in thy vicinity. The glory from the All-Glorious be upon thee and upon those who love thy Lord, Who standeth at the Straight Path.</p>

<p>He is the Hearer, the Answerer!</p>
<p>A remembrance from the Wronged One unto him who hath attained unto the Most Great Ocean and drunk therefrom in the name of his Lord, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. Hearken unto the Call from the Divine Lote-Tree upon the luminous spot: Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Peerless, the All-Informed. We have sent down the verses and manifested the evidences and summoned all unto the Supreme Horizon. Among the people are those who denied, those who turned away, and those who pronounced judgment against Us without any proof or Book from God, the Lord of all worlds. We beseech God to sanctify thee and those with thee from vain imaginings and idle fancies, and to send down unto you that which will draw you nigh unto the Daystar of certitude.</p>
<p>Consider the Shi’ih sect and what ye possess. They awaited through nights and days the appearance of the Lord of all beings. Yet when the morn dawned and the light of Revelation shone forth, they advanced toward Him with swords of hatred and rancor. Some denied Him, some objected to Him, and some pronounced judgment to shed His pure and radiant blood. They perpetrated that which neither Jews nor Christians nor any other peoples of the world had perpetrated. This is attested by Him Who possesseth a perspicuous Book. Those who turned away in the earliest days before all people were the divines of Iran. They disputed the verses of God and cast His Book behind their backs, and by their turning away the servants turned away. To this testifieth every discerning scholar and every informed sage.</p>
<p>Say: Where are your tears and sighs at separation from your Lord? And where is your remembrance and your arising at the mention of the Qa’im? Fear God, O people, and be not of the wrongdoers. Say: O concourse of divines! Tell me truthfully what ye did unto Him. Did ye turn toward Him or away from Him? Did ye pronounce judgment against Him or were ye among the silent ones? By the life of God, I know what ye did and My Lord hath taught Me. The denizens of Paradise have lamented because of your cruelty, and the dwellers of the holy precincts because of your deeds. Ye have committed that which hath caused the eyes of grandeur to weep, the Supreme Pen to cry out, the Lote-Tree to wail, and the Maids of Heaven to take their seats upon black earth by reason of what your hands have wrought, O concourse of polytheists! Ye mounted pulpits to make mention of the Leaders of Religion, yet when the Promise came to pass, ye slew their Lord and Master and their Creator. Thus did your souls prompt you, and today ye are in manifest loss.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Verily the people of the Bayan have followed the Shi’ih sect in their vain imaginings and idle fancies, and have disbelieved in Him in Whom they had believed. Thy Lord is verily the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing. They desired to build the cities of idle fancy with the hands of tyranny, even as the people before them had built. They are indeed behind a mighty veil. Arise to serve the Cause of thy Lord, then preserve the servants from the chains of vain imaginings and idle fancies, in the name of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O Dhabih! A dark smoke has enveloped the world. For twelve hundred years they summoned the hapless people to the abode of vain imaginings and the cities of idle fancies. These falsehoods became the cause and reason for the martyrdom of the Primal Point. Reflect a while on the deeds of the Shi’ih party and the fruits of their actions on the Day of Resurrection, and make mention of them to the servants, that perchance they may not again be caught in the grip of former vain imaginings. Some of the polytheists of the Bayan are observed to be even more debased than that party. These matters appear exactly like children’s play, for they now make mention of perversion and speak of the Sacred Region. Have they not observed the fruits of the deeds of the souls that preceded them? Your honor is well aware that in the early years not a single divine learned one acknowledged Him, and they cast forth flames of opposition such that in all cities the fire of hidden rancor became manifest. In any case, beseech God to protect the people of God. Convey My greetings to the friends of that land on behalf of this Wronged One. By the life of God! All are mentioned in the presence. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to free and liberate His people and to sanctify the hem of all from the dust of the vain imaginings of the divines and the doubts of the doctors of law. He is, verily, powerful and mighty over all things.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! I love to make mention of him whom We have caused to ascend to the Supreme Companion and the highest summit, that his name may endure as long as the Most Beautiful Names of God and His most exalted attributes endure. Thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Knowing Rememberer.</p>
<p>O Nasru’llah! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee from the prison precincts with that which shall endure as long as God, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting, shall endure. I bear witness that thou didst turn to God and didst hear His call when it was raised in truth, and thou didst say: “Here am I, here am I, O Lord of the worlds! Here am I, here am I, O Revealer of verses!” Thou art he who didst drink the Choice Wine that was sealed when it was unsealed in the name of thy Lord, the Self-Subsisting, and didst turn to God when the divines and doctors of the earth turned away from Him, and didst drink the Kawthar of knowledge from the hands of the bounty of thy Lord, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning. Thou wert present on the day when the fragrances of revelation were wafted and the Luminary of inspiration shone forth from the horizon of the will of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Blessed is thy tongue for having uttered and acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur acknowledged before the creation of all things: that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto the Word of God in His days, and the heart that hath turned to Him with spirit and fragrance. We beseech God to send down upon thee at all times that which beseemeth the ocean of His generosity, the heaven of His grace, and the sun of His bounty, and to cause the rain of His mercy and grace to descend continually upon thy resting-place. Verily, He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>This is the Surah of the All-Powerful, which We have ordained in the dominion of eternity and revealed unto the servants, that it may be unto them a shining lamp.</p>
<p>He is the Resplendent, the All-Glorious, the Most Luminous!</p>
<p>Glorified be He Who hath ordained the measures of all things in the preserved tablets of might and created all things in such wise that, were they to purify themselves from the dust of fancy and desire, they would surely ascend to the most exalted stations and would speak that which the Holy Spirit spoke at the Ultimate Lote-Tree: that there is none other God but Him, and that the essence of the two words in these two names is the Self-Subsisting One of Names in the dominion of eternity. Thus hath the mercy of the days encompassed all beings, yet the people perceive not.</p>
<p>Indeed God hath manifested Himself in this Tablet through His Name, the All-Powerful, unto all contingent things, that through it all created things may derive power over whatsoever hath been created between earth and heaven, lest any soul be deprived of the sovereignty of His might. This is what hath now been sent down from the presence of the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O Sun of My Name, the All-Powerful! Shine forth upon all created things with the wondrous power of thy Lord, that all things may witness within themselves the might of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Beloved. Whosoever is deprived of the manifestation of this Name shall never succeed in truly acknowledging the power of his Lord, the Mighty, the Chosen One, and even should he profess belief, it would not be authentic, for how can one who lacketh a thing comprehend it? Glorified be He above their understanding!</p>
<p>Therefore, O people, make your hearts mirrors of this Sun, that its lights and its manifestation may be reflected therein. Thus doth your Lord command you, if ye be of those who know. And whomsoever this Name is reflected within, God shall make him powerful over all things, such that were he to say unto a thing “Be thou transformed,” all would be transformed, and were he to desire to prevail over contingent things by his will, he would be empowered by the might of his Lord. This indeed is a manifest bounty.</p>
<p>From this Tablet the breezes of power have wafted over all who possess power, and they blow as they please by His command, if ye would but understand. The likeness of this Name in this Tablet is as a spring of water flowing in diverse rivers; likewise from this Name flow the waters of power in the rivers of existence, and each receiveth according to a determined measure.</p>
<p>O thou Name! We have created thee by Our command and have exalted thy mention in the kingdom of names and have adorned thee with the raiment of immortality, that thou mayest be grateful to thy Lord and be of those who render thanks. Beware lest anything beguile thee or veil thee from the remembrance of thy Lord’s Name. Be not of those who, when they see themselves in glory and elevation, forget the remembrance of their Lord and then wax proud before God Who created them by His will. Such hath been their way.</p>
<p>O ye who are named by this Name and are its manifestations! Hearken unto the call of your Lord, the All-Merciful, in this Paradise, and turn not unto what hath been ordained in the worlds of creation, and be not of those who understand not. Beware lest names beguile you from the remembrance of your Creator, and when the Sun of your Lord’s remembrance shineth forth upon you, fall ye down prostrate before God, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Beware lest anything prevent you from showing humility before God, and be not like unto him whose cause We exalted among the servants and whose mention We spread throughout the lands. Yet when he saw himself in glory and elevation, he waxed proud before Him Who created and fashioned him, reaching such a state that he opposed the Countenance and was neglectful of God’s rights, and was of those who, when the Sun of Beauty shone forth from the horizon of grandeur, grew arrogant and were of those who are proud.</p>
<p>O My Name! We have made thee the Manifestation of this Name, that thou mayest summon all created things to turn away from what is behind thee, shatter the idols of vain imaginings in all things, and bring all into the shadow of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved, and that thou mayest aid thy Lord in every way within thy power, so that the standards of victory may be raised upon holy and exalted seats. Say: O people of the Bayan! If ye fail to help the Youth, God will assuredly help Him even as He helped Him in truth when He was in prison, and aided Him with hosts ye cannot see, and sent down that which preserved Him from His enemies. Verily, there is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all are preserved with Him in a guarded tablet. O My Name! Be steadfast in the Cause, then remind the people of that which the Spirit hath inspired thee. If thou findest one receptive, turn to him; if thou findest one who turneth away, turn from him. Fear not, but put thy trust in God, thy Lord. He will guard thee from those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, and who, when the verses of the All-Merciful are recited unto them, play about in their own idle fancies. Sanctify thyself from all that would hinder thee from the path of God, to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth. This is better for thee than all that hath been treasured in the kingdoms of creation and command, though most people comprehend not. Await thou the Day when God shall come with a sovereignty from the realm of His command, and around Him shall circle the angels of the Spirit. Then shalt thou find the people struck down, and trembling shall seize the dwellers of the heavens and earth, and all names shall be overturned and fall upon limited dust - save those who have detached themselves unto God and entered beneath the shadow of their Lord, the Most High, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Praised. Thus have We inspired thee with the wonders of thy Lord’s revelation, that thou mayest be steadfast in thyself and be of those who are firmly established. And glory be upon thee and upon those who have taken their station beneath the shadow of their Lord - a praiseworthy station. And praise be to God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Beloved.</p>

<p>Praised be He Who hath arisen by His own authority to establish His Cause and hath manifested whatsoever He desired through His sovereignty. Neither the might of the world can frustrate Him, nor the clamors of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of ancient days, weaken Him, nor can He be intimidated by that which hath appeared and shall appear. Verily, He occupieth the Most Sublime Vision, and through Him hath been revealed that which was recorded in the Scrolls and Books. There is none other God but He, the Single, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>How delightful were the melodies that reached mine ears from the birds of remembrance and praise, which warbled, trilled, sang, and cooed upon the branches of the Lote-Tree of thy heart. By the life of the Beloved! When I saw and read and heard, the joy of thy words seized me while I was immersed in oceans of sorrow. When my heart was gladdened and my breast was dilated and my being was stirred, I approached the Intended One and attained the presence before the Throne, and presented that which the Beloved had caused thee to speak in His days. When it concluded, I found traces of joy upon the countenance of my Lord and the Lord of all worlds. My spirit and my soul be a sacrifice for your service, your steadfastness, and your mention.</p>
<p>Indeed, thy mention became the cause of the joy of the Intended One. After this evanescent one’s presentation of thy passages, He smiled greatly, and from His abundant grace and favors at that moment, a Tablet was revealed from the heaven of bounty and sent forth. God willing, thou shalt be nourished from the heavenly food concealed in the treasuries of God’s words. Then the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these words:</p>
<p>Write to Khalil that slumber and the intoxication of error have so seized the people that if ninety-nine out of a hundred were to be taken, the remaining one would neither turn to the horizon of the Cause nor raise his head from the sleep of heedlessness. Consider the verses that were previously revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of the Day of Judgment concerning the seizure of certain transgressors. With utmost clarity, passage by passage, was revealed concerning seizure, plunder, earthquakes, lamentation, abasement, and the like. Nearly one crore perished, yet none became aware. Even those souls who had witnessed those verses before the appearance of the signs did not attain unto that which God desired.</p>
<p>The mention of two great kings appeared in the Tablets with utmost clarity concerning what would befall them, to such extent that some of the assured souls, upon hearing that kingdom would be taken from them and their dominion, sovereignty, glory, and power would be lost, were observed in utter amazement. For they had not imagined that a kingdom like that of Paris would be lost from its king’s grasp, and another king would pass in such abasement, and the lamentations of trees and stones would rise from the mountains. Those souls who had not heard these tidings before their occurrence remained in the sleep of heedlessness, and those who were informed beforehand and later witnessed with their outward eyes did not ascend to a station that would benefit their own affairs.</p>
<p>O Khalil! Observe to what degree the people’s veiling hath reached, that the Tongue of Grandeur speaketh these words. Although the purpose was initially to converse with thee, all these heedless acts have occurred due to the love of these fleeting two days and what appeareth therein, even though they witness its change, transformation, and variation at all times. Say: Glory be to my Lord, the All-Knowing, above what they understand! And glorified be my Lord, the All-Informed, above what they mention, and glorified be my Lord, the Lord of Might, above what they describe. A hundred thousand praises be unto the one beloved and single God, that He enabled that personage to utter words which became the cause of joy and gladness to the blessed heart. Details sent by his honor Aqa Mirza Isma’il, the honored Afnan, upon them be the glory of the All-Merciful, were presented. He said that one must be forbearing with him, but consideration for the family of the martyrs is incumbent and obligatory upon all. This servant also submitted a detailed letter to them, and a Tablet was also revealed from the heaven of divine Will specifically for his honor Aqa Mirza Isma’il and sent that the honored Afnan might forward it. At all times I beseech God, exalted be His glory and might, to assist all the friends and cause to appear from each one that which befitteth Him and His days. O my beloved one, repeatedly hath the tongue of grandeur uttered these words: O thou who art present, if the souls who have accepted the Faith were to act according to what God hath willed, and there appeared not from them matters from which the fragrance of divine displeasure could be detected, surely would God’s testimony be completed for all. And after the completion of testimony, either acceptance or something else, as appeared in previous ages. God willing, may all be confirmed through divine confirmations and attain His bounties. Verily He is the Generous Giver. The friends in the Prison Land offer countless expressions of sincerity and most glorious, most mighty, most elevated, most holy, most exalted greetings to your honor. May the glory which hath ever shone with the effulgences of the Sun of His Beauty and will ever shine with the light of the rays of His Countenance be upon your honor and upon those who have drunk and will drink from the cup of your love for God, our Beloved and your Beloved and the Beloved of all the worlds. And praise be to God, the Lord of the mystics.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most High, the Most Holy, transcendent above all likenesses and peers!</p>
<p>This evanescent servant makes known that the traces of the luminous Pen, adorned with the lights of love for the Lord of Power, illumined both heart and sight. Praise be to God that tidings of your outward well-being were heard from that radiant leaf which was in truth a spiritual messenger, bringing the utmost joy and delight. The original letter was written by your honor in the name of the Name of God M.H. - upon him be all the most glorious Glory. Therefore this evanescent servant, in reply to your august letter, has troubled your fragrant mind with these unworthy mentions. Regarding what you wrote that they have forgotten you, this servant testifies by God that in most gatherings when opportunity arose, they were occupied with your mention and you have not been erased from their view. Likewise in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court your mention has been and continues. Blessed are you for having attained to the source of good, its beginning and its end.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote regarding the upheaval in the Land of Purpose - by your life, no eye hath seen nor ear heard the like. This servant has submitted a brief account of these matters to the friends which is with the honored Name of God. God willing it will reach the luminous gaze and you will be informed of the details. How excellent is what flowed from your pen!</p>
<p>You wrote that no error has produced such merit in the visible world. Though outwardly it occurred without permission and was the cause of great harm, yet for those evil souls it was pure justice - their deeds were embodied and suddenly seized those wicked ones. Upon them be the curse of God and the curse of His chosen ones and the curse of the near angels.</p>
<p>As for the prisoners, praise be to God they have all been released, and those seven are free to move about except that they return to their quarters at night. Every grave matter with Him is simple and easy. Among the seven, one of them in those early days when severity was at its height composed and submitted an ode which has been sent to your radiant presence. You will observe it. Since your honor had inquired about the condition of the seven, therefore the ode was sent.</p>
<p>And regarding the friends of that land, His words, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>Say to My loved ones who have soared in My nights and have turned with their hearts to the Ultimate Goal in My love and remembrance: If ye differ in anything, refer it to God, your Lord. He will judge between you with pure justice. He is in truth the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. God willing, all must gather on one plane and soar in one atmosphere. If they differ in any matter they must inquire of the Source of the Cause, for through God’s infinite bounty the Dawning-Place of Revelation and the Dayspring of Command is manifest, evident and visible. Glorify them on My behalf, then gladden them with this noble Remembrance that they may gather as brothers upon the thrones of their Lord’s command, the All-Merciful, and be numbered among the successful ones.</p>
<p>Regarding your mention of the House of Justice, it is clear and evident to you that the upheavals of this earth, its tribulations and its afflictions have been revealed beforehand in the Tablets of God. Therefore, whenever a decree was revealed, this servant strove to have copies sent to all regions lest the upheaval and turmoil of this earth become a barrier between God’s ordinances and His servants. Indeed, during these upheavals there was fear that all that existed would be lost, but God preserved it through His sovereignty and power. For this reason, a copy of that Tablet was sent, and the intention was not for it to be implemented in these days, for it is known that the loved ones are few and the enemies many. Therefore, the disclosure of these matters has caused and would cause harm. For example, if those souls were to be designated in every city now, it would surely become known and the polytheists would rise up. In any case, the Tablet was sent so that it may be preserved with the loved ones of God until such time as circumstances permit. He is, verily, the Ordainer, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Convey on behalf of this evanescent servant greetings to all the friends, and God willing, may they gather in one meeting where you shall host them to tea and recite that which hath flowed from the Most Holy Tongue, that all may be adorned with the new raiment of unity. I mentioned this matter in the Most Holy Presence and He smiled, which indicates the pleasure of my Lord and the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Ismu’llah presenting himself at the threshold of the Throne on your behalf whenever he attains the presence - since he is not here, as was mentioned, this servant attended the presence before the Throne on your behalf: “I entered the Most Great Scene and presented myself before the Throne and visited the Desired One on your behalf.” Praise be to God Who enabled this evanescent servant and honored him with this supreme triumph. His is the praise and bounty in all conditions. I beseech God that the sweet fragrances of your correspondence may ever continue to waft, and that we may be gladdened and delighted by its wondrous and sublime words. The glory be upon you and upon those who are with you.</p>

<p>O Muhammad! Hear the Call that hath been raised betwixt earth and heaven, calling all unto the Path of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Muhammad! The hosts of sorrow have encompassed Us, and there hath befallen Us at the hands of the oppressors that which hath caused the Faithful Spirit to lament. We commanded all to be trustworthy and religious, sincere and pure, yet the people have denied God’s Cause through the promptings of self and desire. Thus hath the matter been decreed, and they are numbered this day among the most lost in My perspicuous Book. Grieve not for what hath befallen Us at the hands of those who have disbelieved in God and His signs, and who have perpetrated that which hath caused all things to cry out and the tears of them that know to flow. The servant present before Us hath laid before Us that which thou didst send unto him. We have heard it and answer thee with this Leaf, which hath been adorned with the verses of thy Lord, the Kind, the All-Bountiful. When bearing it, it cried out saying: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of the world! And thanks be unto Thee, O Beloved of the nations, for having made me adorned with Thy verses and illumined with the light of Thy utterance!” Blessed then is the servant who heareth and attaineth, and woe unto every heedless sinner. By the life of God! Should anyone at this moment hearken unto the voice of this Leaf, he would, in utmost joy and fragrance, detach himself from the world and all therein and repair unto the One Beloved.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. The enemies of the Truth, exalted be His glory, outwardly manifest complete submission and contentment, while inwardly they are engaged in mischief and denial. And the Wronged One, before the faces of all, both learned and rulers, speaketh and saith: “O people! Fear God and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who hath come unto you with a sovereignty that hath encompassed the world and with a Cause before which the hosts of the heavens and earth cannot stand.” O thou who hast turned thy face towards the Countenance! Thou shouldst at all times guide the wayward to the straight path through wisdom and utterance, and illumine the oppressors with the light of justice - meaning those who wrong their own souls and are deprived of the most holy and exalted Court of nearness. Make mention of those who are related to Us in the name of the Wronged One, and illumine them with the splendors of the Day-Star of grace. Praise be to God, they have been and continue to be remembered, and have attained unto His favor. Make mention of the friends and give them the glad-tidings of what God hath willed. We beseech God to make them the standards of His guidance amongst His servants. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>A question was asked concerning a person’s control over their own specific properties - whether if one desires during their lifetime to give or bestow all their property to one person, they have that authority, or whether what was revealed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas must be followed. What you mentioned was previously revealed from the Most Exalted Pen, and now is mentioned again as a grace from Us upon you that you may rejoice and be among those who give thanks. Every soul has had and has authority over their own property, for if authority were prevented, the glory of existence would be effaced. In one station, the glory of servants has been and is through properties and through the authority ordained for them. We beseech God to assist His servants to perform what they are commanded in His Mighty Book and to enable them to do what He loves and is pleased with, and to perform deeds from which the fragrance of His acceptance, His command and His wisdom may be diffused.</p>
<p>We desire at this time to mention My handmaiden and My leaf with a mention that will be with her in all the worlds of her Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Generous. The first fragrance that wafted from the garden of meanings and utterance, and the first light that shone and gleamed from the heaven of the Merciful’s loving-kindness be upon you, O you who have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon. I testify that you have believed in God and His signs and have been patient in what befell you in His path. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to send down upon you at all times mercy from His presence and sustenance from the heaven of His bounty and grace from the atmosphere of His favor and generosity. Blessed is he who mentions you and visits you according to what has been sent down from the heaven of the mercy of your Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Rejoice, O My handmaiden, in My mention of you. The luminary of forgiveness has shone forth and the ocean of pardon and beneficence has surged. Blessed is he who has attained to My mention before and after his ascension. He is indeed among those who are near to God, the Lord of the worlds. Praise be to Him, for He is the Most Generous of the generous ones and the Most Merciful of the merciful ones. Previously too, mention of her flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur. Blessed is she and joy be to her, for she has attained to that which the handmaidens of the world were prevented from, save whom God willed.</p>
<p>We have mentioned the Martyr - upon him be My glory and My loving-kindness and My mercy - in various Tablets. Blessed is he and the leaf who was with him and those whom God has related to him. He is indeed the Ordainer, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>We have commanded the Name of God, Jamal - upon him be My glory and My loving-kindness - to turn in that direction. Blessed is the servant who loved you and heard your words concerning the Great Announcement of God and His firm and mighty Command. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon you, O My friends and handmaidens, and upon those who have heard and turned and said: “Praise be to Thee, O God of the world, and the grace be Thine, O Thou the Goal of them that are near.”</p>

<p>Let the tongue, heart, limbs and members, the inner and outer being, the first and last, the veins and hairs - all bear witness to the oneness of God, exalted be His glory, and to His singleness, His might and power, His all-encompassing sovereignty and dominion - exalted be His station, exalted be His sovereignty, exalted be His command, and exalted be His word and His grandeur. And blessings and peace be upon Him with whom the Seal began and ended, who migrated from Batha towards Yathrib due to what befell Him from those who denied the All-Merciful and disputed the proofs, and upon His family and companions through whose lights the horizons were illumined and the servants and lands were brightened.</p>
<p>Thereafter, your letter arrived, and previously another letter as well, and both are two witnesses and two testimonies to your love and devotion. After they were read and reviewed, they were presented before the Countenance of the Intended One, who said: “We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect them and to send down upon them from the heaven of His loving-kindness a blessing from Him and a table spread from His presence, and to aid them in that which will draw them nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily, He is the Lord in the beginning and in the end. And I send greetings to My loved ones there who have testified to that which God hath testified, that there is none other God but Him.” Thus ends His words.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the glad tidings of your well-being, health and comfort were heard from both letters, causing complete joy. God willing, may this bounty remain perpetual and lasting. This evanescent one’s entreaty is that that honored brother not be saddened by the affairs of the world. Those souls who were above the world, nay through whose being the world was created, have ever been encompassed by tribulations. There befell the Prophets, may God’s blessings be upon them, that which befell no one else. Were one to ponder what descended upon the Seal of the Prophets, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, one would perish from grief. This Friend called the people to the word of unity, yet they visited upon Him that which caused all the atoms of Batha and all things therein, such as stones and trees, pebbles and date-stones, to lament the tribulations of that Manifestation of God’s command. No friend remained save a few numbered souls, until the decree of migration was revealed, the details of which that honored one has surely heard. By the Sun of the horizon of utterance, had there been any worth to this world, they would never have accepted these tribulations. Their gaze was fixed upon another station and their heart was turned to another realm. Divine love strengthened all to sacrifice what they possessed. Blessed are those souls who ponder upon what befell in former times. Such reflection causes awakening, and awakening is the cause of the soul’s repose. This evanescent servant has ever remembered and continues to remember that honored one. Convey greetings from this evanescent one to all the gentlemen of that land. I have besought and continue to beseech bounty, health and blessing for each one. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer prayers.</p>
<p>write that his honor Aqa Muhammad Ibrahim (upon him be 96 [Baha’u’llah]) has in these days fallen onto a bed of discomfort, meaning he has become ill.&nbsp;This servant is in Akka while he is in Bahji. Thus far a doctor has been brought twice. He has written repeatedly to this servant stating that he owes money to someone from Beirut from whom he previously obtained copper and work materials. Now a sum must be paid to him but funds are not available, and his honor Aqa Muhammad Rida (upon him be God’s peace) has delayed in sending funds for some time. He has requested that you send these funds so that perhaps he may be relieved from embarrassment before that person. He has written and mentioned this in such a way that truly saddened this servant’s heart - that is, he has appealed for mercy from you. It is obvious then that something must be done so that credibility is not suddenly lost, as after such upheaval many would be afflicted. I make mention of the light of my eyes and beseech from God, exalted be His glory, his well-being, and likewise I send greetings to the family.</p>
<p>As for their apology regarding the sewing of the cloak not being good - no apology is necessary. As per their instruction we will send another cloak. That which has a replacement merits no complaint. God willing, may they ever remain steadfast upon this pleasing way.</p>
<p>Indeed they have shown much love. The previous cloak was also very good, rather above all good things of the world, for it was sewn with friendship and love. In this case its like and equal are rare. May God, exalted be His glory, grant recompense and bestow its reward.</p>
<p>And as for the dried yogurt that you sent, it was very, very good. Thus far it has been consumed two or three times. Your place was empty. It was truly good - both sender and sent were both successful, you with the wine of mention and it with the wine of acceptance. Peace be upon you and God’s mercy and blessings.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the One</p>
<p>When your letter arrived, all that was mentioned therein was clear and evident to those endowed with vision. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One of the horizons. Beseech God to enable you to efface illusion and attain unto clear knowledge. You wrote that for years you have studied religion and are certain of it. Should someone ask you by what proof and by what evidence [you believe], what would you say? Place yourself in the presence of the All-Merciful, then speak with fairness. I am indeed a faithful counselor unto you. The matters you mentioned and established as signs of the truth of truth have ever been and shall forever be rejected in the sight of God. It would be better if you were to recite, purely for the sake of the All-Merciful, some verses of the Qur’an and ponder their meanings. Perchance on this Day, which is the King of Days, you may not remain deprived of the choice wine of recognition and bereft of the Kawthar of revelation and inspiration.</p>
<p>Among other things, reflect upon these blessed verses which were formerly revealed to the Beloved of the world and the Lord of nations. He saith: “And they say: ‘We shall not believe in thee till thou cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth; or thou have a garden of date palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth abundantly in their midst; or thou cause the heaven to fall down upon us, as thou hast claimed, in pieces; or thou bring God and the angels face to face with us; or thou have a house of gold; or thou ascend to heaven - yet we shall not believe in thine ascension until thou bring down for us a book that we can read.’ Say: ‘Glory be to my Lord! Am I aught but a mortal, a messenger?’”</p>
<p>These are verses which the idolaters spoke to the Seal of the Prophets - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake. That is to say, they made these verses the conditions of their belief, stating that if His Holiness would manifest these things, they would be convinced of the truth. Now consider those heedless souls who demanded that He cause a spring to gush forth in the land of Batha, or manifest for them a house of gold, or ascend to heaven before their eyes and bring a book they could read, or produce a garden with date palms and grapes, or come with God, exalted be His glory, and a company of angels. These were the things that the idolaters of the Hijaz demanded of the Lord of the world to manifest, that they might believe in what He had declared. A brief explanation of their meaning has been given.</p>
<p>Now observe with penetrating vision, with a pure heart, and with complete fairness, and reflect, that the truth may become clear to you and the path of God which hath appeared in truth may become manifest, and that you may find yourself possessed of clear certainty. And after these questions, observe what God, exalted be His glory, hath answered. He saith: Say: “Am I aught but a mortal, a messenger?” And if these requests had been accepted and God, exalted be His sovereignty, had manifested what they had asked for, then according to their assumption, no one on earth would have remained a denier or turned away, at least outwardly. And yet in another passage He saith that even if they were to witness all the signs, they would not believe and would not turn to the supreme horizon. Now that honored one should reflect upon what they have asked. I swear by the Revealer of the Books that if with fairness and free from selfish desires, ye ponder on what hath been mentioned, verily ye will return unto the truth, and, detached from all save God, leave your homes uttering “Here am I, O my God, here am I!” The Truth hath not desired, nor doth He desire, that every soul should manifest whatsoever it willeth. He hath raised the banner of “He doeth what He willeth” and hath spoken the blessed words “I ordain what I desire.” It is abundantly clear that the Truth, exalted be His grandeur, is the Sovereign Doer - whatsoever He uttereth and ordaineth hath been and shall ever be for the good of His servants. That which ye desired hath been manifested in even greater measure in the divine Books. Examine them, that ye may become acquainted with the knowledge, wisdom, sovereignty, might, power and all-encompassing authority of God - exalted be His power, His grandeur and His dominion. Please God, ye must become sanctified and detached from such arguments and utterances as were voiced by the objectors of former ages, and fix your gaze upon God’s enduring testimony and that which hath appeared from His presence. That which had never appeared before hath now been made manifest - to this every stone and clod of earth beareth witness, yet most of the people remain heedless. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O God of existence and Knower of the seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Hidden and Promised One, through which the ocean of Thy knowledge surged, the fragrance of Thy raiment wafted, and the gate of Thy presence was opened to all who are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth, to assist me to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation and the Dayspring of Thy signs. O my Lord! I am he whom vain imaginings have withheld from the horizon of Thy certitude and the doubts of men have barred from the ocean of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by Thy Self to enable me to turn unto Thee and to turn away from all else besides Thee. O my Lord! Thou art the Generous, the One endowed with great bounty. Drive not this poor one from the door of Thy bestowal, nor this deprived one from the depths of the ocean of Thy oneness. Forgive him through Thy grace and bounty. Verily Thou art the Munificent, the Generous, and verily Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful.</p>

<p>O Lion! Upon thee be the Glory of God! The letter of Husayn Ba’i, upon him be My Glory, was received, was graced with Our glance and honored by Our hearing, and was adorned with the ornament of acceptance. In this Most Exalted Station, mention of him hath been sent down from the Supreme Horizon. Were the songs of the birds of the Cause, which warble upon the branches of the Lote-Tree of utterance, to pass from the hidden to the manifest, the world would be struck with awe and wonderment. His honor Mahmud, upon him be the Glory of God, from among the people of Nur and Ra, We have made mention of. We beseech God to protect him and ordain for him what he desireth of the bounty of his Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O Mahmud! We have heard thy communion with God and have answered thee with this clear exposition. We make mention of Ata’u’llah and give him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and mercy, and remind him of My verses. I am verily the All-Knowing Rememberer. We make mention of Ibn-i-Kamal who attained My presence, circumambulated around Me, and held fast to the cord of My loving-kindness and clung to My robe. We beseech God to send down upon him from the heaven of His bounty that which befitteth His grace and generosity. He is verily the Generous, the Munificent.</p>
<p>O Mahmud! Upon thee be My Glory! We made mention of thee before and at this hour. Give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. Glory be upon thee and upon thy wife who turned towards God on a day whereon every perfidious unfortunate one and every doubting scholar turned away.</p>
<p>And give glad-tidings unto him who is named ’Abdu’llah of My remembrance. We beseech God to forgive him and his father as a bounty from His presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The people of Baku are seen to be ablaze with the fire of the love of God, exalted be His glory. O people of God! Strive that ye may attain unto that which shall never be erased from the ledger of the world. The Wronged One counseleth you to fear God and to observe wisdom. In the Most Holy Book, which hath been sent down from God’s holy kingdom, this blessed verse hath been recorded: “Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship.”</p>
<p>O Friend of God and His loved ones! Devote your efforts to teaching the Cause and associate with the people of the world in unity and concord, that the fragrance of virtuous character may be diffused throughout the world and others may be attracted by that fragrance and perchance attain unto what God hath willed and find it.</p>
<p>The people of Ba are all remembered before the Wronged One, both men and women. We give them glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds, and We give them glad-tidings of God’s grace, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>And as to what his honor Ibn-i-’Attar, upon him be My Glory and loving-kindness, wrote regarding the sum he wished to spend according to ancient custom for the Mother of the Near Ones, upon her be My Glory and loving-kindness: according to the wish of My Name Jamal, upon him be My Glory and mercy, it was given to one of the leaves of the Tree. Excellent is what Ibn-i-’Attar hath done. Blessed is he in that he hath hearkened unto what was commanded by My Name Jamal. We have made mention of the Mother of the Near Ones with such remembrance before which all mention boweth down, in recompense for what she did in the path of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>And as to thy mention of deputyship from his honor Shaykh, upon him be My peace and loving-kindness: We have accepted what thou hast desired as a mercy from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Kind, the Most Generous, the All-Bountiful, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>O Lion! Upon thee be My glory! The missive of Haydar, who before was named Ali, attained the presence and was honored to hear that which was uttered from the Mount. In truth he is steadfast in service to the Cause and speaks in praise and glorification of the Lord of Names. We give him glad tidings, strengthen him, aid him, make mention of him, and beseech God to assist him with the hosts of His wisdom and utterance and the legions of His grace and favor. Verily He is the Generous, the Munificent, the Ancient Bestower. The names mentioned in his letter have all been honored with the mention of the Supreme Pen and its verses. Previously, numerous Tablets were sent, and for some of the souls mentioned in this letter there was revealed that which giveth rise to noble character and quickeneth moldering bones. We beseech the Truth to aid His servants that they may drink from the ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance and arise to champion the divine religion. Such is the call of the Wronged One of the world, raised from the shore of the sea of utterance. Counsel and exhortation have reached such a degree that upon everything a pulpit hath been erected, and upon it a counselor engaged in refining souls. The bounty is God’s, Lord of all worlds. His is the grace, His the generosity. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Verily He maketh mention and guideth the way, and He is the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>Give thou the glad tidings to Haydar - upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of Destiny - of that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of utterance, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. O Lion! The letter of Muhammad-Hashim - upon him and his two brothers be My glory - was seen. Praise be to God, the fragrances of the love of the Truth, exalted be His glory, wafted therefrom. Blessed is he and joy be unto him. Beseech thou the Truth to aid him to serve the Cause and whatsoever beseemeth His manifest and luminous Day. His kinsmen who have quaffed the sealed wine are each mentioned before the Wronged One and have been blessed with the verses of the divine Pen. Likewise was another page observed. We heard and saw that the souls mentioned therein were each blessed with the utterance of the Goal of the world’s desire. Muhammad-Hashim was honored with My mention, and Husayn after Muhammad was graced with My attention toward him, and Muhammad was adorned with the ornament of My wondrous mention. In brief, all the names mentioned are remembered at the Divine Throne and blessed with special favors. The glory of God rest upon them from God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>O thou who bearest My Name in the Kingdom of My Cause, My trusted one among My creation, the sign of My remembrance amongst My servants, and who journeyeth through the lands to aid My Cause and promote My Faith! I testify that thou art of Me and hast diffused the fragrance of My raiment throughout the East and West of the earth. Thou art he who hath remained faithful to My Covenant and My Testament. Thou didst depart from the precincts of the Throne by My leave, and didst draw nigh and enter through My good-pleasure. Blessed art thou, and blessed is he who hath found solace in thee out of love for My Being, and hath heard from thee the gems of My laws and commandments.</p>
<p>Know thou that thy letter hath come before the Throne aforetime, and in these days We have answered thee in the Tablet and sent it unto thee by the hand of one of Our servants. This is yet another token of Our grace bestowed upon thee. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. He loveth him who loveth Him, desireth him who desireth Him, and answereth him who calleth upon Him. Within His grasp is the dominion of the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>Those whose names thou hast mentioned in thy letters, We have recorded them in the Tablet and have ordained for each one of them that which shall bring solace to their eyes. Verily, thy Lord is the Mighty, the Bountiful. And concerning that which was mentioned in thy letter - We have not fixed a specific time for it. Those who claimed that We commanded the sincere ones as We commanded them were mistaken, that their acceptance and detachment might be made manifest before all the worlds.</p>
<p>We praise God that He hath shown thee servants in this Revelation who have hastened to do good works before their appointed time. These, verily, are among the people of Baha. Upon them rest My mercy, My glory, My remembrance, and My praise at all times. These are they whom the world hath not prevented from treading the path of God, the Lord of all names, and who have spent that which they possessed in their quest for that which is with God. We have accepted from them as a bounty from Our presence. Verily, thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Hear in the most wondrous Persian tongue: During the sojourn of the Ancient Beauty in the Land of Mystery, when it was observed that the time of the great tribulation drew nigh - even as had been revealed in previous Tablets from the heaven of the Will of the All-Knowing, the All-Informed - therefore when Jamalu’d-Din, upon him be the glory of God, was present before Him, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke certain words concerning the known matter, that they might be mentioned among men and that confirmed souls might act upon them. The essence of these words was this: that after the arrival of the Most Holy Beauty in the great city, the sublime government had allocated a specific sum for designated expenses. Fie upon such bounty that is followed by obligation and injury! However, in view of the exigencies of the time and the consummate divine wisdom, it was not rejected. Although all that exists on earth belonged to the True One, in those days everything was contingent upon the permission and consent of the King of Oneness. Nevertheless, it would be most beloved if each of the Branches of the Divine Tree, the related Twigs, and the loved ones could, at any time or age, reject these funds and receive instead pages adorned with the seal of the Cause. Likewise was this utterance repeatedly spoken from the Tongue of Grandeur in the Most Great Prison in the presence of two souls. However, this was not intended for these days, for after arrival at this place, the sovereignty of God was openly proclaimed to the kings and other monarchs, and His Cause was publicly taught. Thus were all hearts set ablaze and engaged in schemes. Thus did We grant victory unto Our Cause with true victory. By My life! No doubt appeared in all the worlds in those days. Sufficient was the fire We kindled in their hearts. Thus doth God transform light into fire for those who waxed proud and were among the oppressors. In such circumstances, the disclosure of that matter is not now permitted. Consider the mercy, power and bounty of God: although the appointed time for that matter was to be later, yet by His guiding hand He raised up certain souls in the goodly land who, after His will and before the appointed time, hastened to this greatest good. These are the helpers of God; God hath accepted their deeds. These souls have attained unto that which God desired; therefore if they themselves dispose of it, no harm shall come to them, for in truth they have acted according to what their Lord, the All-Merciful, desired and decreed. Blessed are they and blessed is he whom thou didst mention in thy letter previously, for he preceded in this matter. Upon him be the glory of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Praise be unto Thee for having enabled Thy loved ones to carry out Thy command and manifest that which Thou didst desire through Thy sovereignty. O Lord! Thou knowest that I desired for no one save Thy remembrance and praise, and sought from no soul that which Thou hadst bestowed through Thy bounty and favor. I summoned them in all conditions purely for Thy sake to the court of Thy grace. Thou, O my God, beholdest these who aided Thy Cause with their wealth before Thy manifestation and Thy command, and with their own selves after the dawning of the Sun of Thy wisdom from the dayspring of Thy revelation and inspiration. And Thou seest their steadfastness in Thy love and their firmness in Thy Cause. O Lord! Ordain for them that which beseemeth Thee and is worthy of Thy presence. Then write down for them the reward of those who circle round Thee in all Thy worlds. Separate them not from Thee throughout the duration of Thy kingdom. This is the most excellent prayer; therefore answer it, O Creator of the heavens! Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.</p>

<p>O people of Baha! Hearken unto the Call from the luminous Tree, that verily there is none other God besides Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Mother Book speaks and says: The All-Bountiful has come in His retreat. Fear God and be not of the heedless ones. The Mother of the Bayan calls out: O people of creation! The All-Merciful has come with a host from the Supreme Concourse. Turn unto Him and be not of the losers. The Mother of Tablets speaks and says: O peoples of the earth! He Who conversed on Sinai is established upon the throne of Revelation. Withhold not yourselves from drawing nigh unto Him. This is what ye have been commanded in the Books of God and in this perspicuous Tablet.</p>
<p>O Kazim! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Thou art he who has turned unto My horizon, who has held fast unto the cord of My loving-kindness, and who has arisen to serve My Cause and to make mention of Me and to praise Me amongst My servants. We beseech God to assist thee and to aid thee with a host of the near angels. Blessed is the tongue that hath confessed that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken, and the eye that hath been honored with beholding His luminous direction. We have sent down for thee aforetime that which the riches of all the servants cannot equal. To this beareth witness the Lord of creation in His mighty prison. We have mentioned thee in numerous Tablets, drawn thee nigh unto the shore of the Most Great Ocean, and guided thee unto My straight path.</p>
<p>Blessed is the servant who hath cast away what he possessed and hath hearkened unto that which I have uttered in remembrance of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say: O people of the Furqan! Have ye not heard the call of your Lord, the All-Merciful, in His words “On the day when all men shall stand before the Lord of the worlds”? This is the day whereon the horizon of grace hath been illumined and the Self-Subsisting hath appeared with His sealed choice wine in His hand, saying: Come ye, come ye, and be not of them that tarry. This is the day which the Books of God, the Sovereign of the Day of Judgment, had promised. Say: O people of the Bayan! By the life of God, the Point of the Furqan and the Point of the Bayan bewail you in the most exalted Paradise. Fear ye God and be not of the oppressors. If ye deny this most great favor, by what proof can ye establish that which ye possess? Be fair, O people, and be not of them that are abased.</p>
<p>The gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of Names hath come with the standards of His signs. Give thanks unto your Lord for this most great favor which hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Say: The river of utterance hath flowed from the Pen of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Draw nigh and drink thereof in the name of your Lord, the Mighty, the Wondrous, Who hath stood before all faces and called all unto the One, the All-Informed. Thus hath the Most Great Ocean spoken amongst the nations, causing the limbs of them that have denied God, the Mighty, the Powerful, to quake.</p>
<p>O Kazim! Verily My Most Exalted Pen desireth to make mention of thy brother who hath ascended unto God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. At the time of his ascension, the Concourse on High perceived from him the fragrance of My love, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved, and the hand of grace admitted him to a station whereof the pens of the world are powerless to make mention. To this beareth witness He with Whom is the Preserved Tablet. The light that shone forth from the horizon of the grace of the Manifestation, and the first fragrance that wafted from the garment of thy Lord’s mercy, the Sovereign of existence, rest upon thee, O thou who didst turn unto the Most Exalted Horizon when they who are on earth turned away therefrom. We testify that thou didst hear the Call and didst turn unto it and believe in God, the Lord of the invisible and the visible, and remained steadfast in the Cause in such wise that the doubts of them who denied the decree of resurrection did not deter thee. Thou didst attain unto the recognition of God and His signs, and didst hear His most sweet call when it was raised betwixt earth and heaven, and didst drink His choice sealed wine sealed with His Self-Subsisting Name. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken in this praiseworthy station. Glorified art Thou, O God of existence and Sovereign over what hath been and what shall be! I beseech Thee by the mysteries of Thy knowledge and the breezes of Thy days and the waves of the ocean of utterance in the contingent world, to send down upon him who hath ascended unto Thee, at every moment, a mercy from Thee and a grace from Thy presence. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. All created things have testified to Thy generosity and all beings to Thy loving-kindness. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Kazim! Give thanks unto God for having revealed unto thee and unto thy brother that whose fragrance shall never cease to persist throughout the duration of the kingdom and the realm above. A letter hath come from Salman, upon him be My glory, wherein mention was made of him who ascended unto the Supreme Companion. By reason thereof, grief seized those who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn. We console thee and comfort thee with verses that have no equal in all the earth and heavens. Verily thy Lord is the All-Patient; He biddeth thee to manifest beautiful patience. He, verily, is the Almighty over what He willeth. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Bestower. Convey My greetings unto the faces of My loved ones. Say: O people of God! Take heed lest the power of the world frighten you, or the might of the nations weaken you, or the clamor of the contentious deter you, or the manifestations of glory sadden you. Be as mountains in the Cause of your Lord, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Chosen One. Thus have We sent down from the clouds of grace the rains of wisdom and utterance. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Revealer of verses, and glory be unto Thee, O Manifestation of clear evidences!” I testify that Thou hast appeared and made manifest that which was hidden from eternity of eternities. Whoso turneth unto Thee hath turned unto God from the beginning that hath no beginning, and whoso turneth away hath turned away from God in the beginning and the end. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon them who hearken unto thy word in this Cause whereby the limbs of men have quaked, and upon My loved ones there who have not broken the Covenant.</p>

<p>This is what I have called upon God, my Lord, in the language of symbols and mysteries, which shall be read by those who desire to drink the water of life from the hands of the All-Bountiful, whereby the beauty of reality is unveiled and the veils of metaphor are consumed.</p>
<p>He is the Mighty, the Beloved!</p>
<p>O Thou Who hast adorned the beauty of Thine eternal holiness with the ornament of the thread of Thy glorious grace, and hast manifested the dawning rays of the Sun of Thy countenance through the Point which appeared and shone forth from the essences of the mysteries of Thy hidden wisdom! Glorified, glorified art Thou! How perfect are the wonders of Thy creative Lordship in this most great ornament, and how consummate are the gems of Thy divine knowledge in this most glorious and noble treasure! Thou hast made it, O my God, as the seas of Thy knowledge and the ship of Thy wisdom, wherein Thou hast ordained whatsoever Thou hadst ordained in the worlds of Thy unity and the holy names of Thy detachment.</p>
<p>Glorified, glorified art Thou, O my heart’s Desire! Thou art He Who hath encompassed the meanings of Thy sovereign might within the garments of Thy names, and thereby made known to Thy servants the essences of Thy Cause and the mysteries of Thy wisdom. Then didst Thou manifest these hidden names upon the tablets through the Point which Thou didst detail by Thy power, making it to tell of him whom Thou didst create from the fire of Thy love and the air of Thy grace, and Thou didst conceal therein the earth of Thy will that it might be watered by the waters of tenderness from the hand of Thy bounty.</p>
<p>Glorified, glorified art Thou! How mighty is Thy Cause in this dark luminous thread, and this most pure and radiant cord! By Thy might! Were it not for it, the Point would not have appeared in the garment of darkness, nor would the spring of life have flowed in the depths of obscurity. By Thy might, O my Beloved! I am bewildered by what Thou hast created by Thy power in the mystery of this everlasting subtlety and this moving spirit. It is as though Thou hadst chosen it from among all created things and made it a mirror for all Thy names and attributes, and ordained for it the blessing of nearness and union - a matter Thou hast not vouchsafed to any other in the realms of Thy sovereignty and the cities of Thy mighty dominion save through clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy knowledge, and hast prevented the eyes of the near ones from beholding the lights of Thy beauty and visiting Thy countenance. Glorified, glorified art Thou, O my Best-Beloved, above the mention of all created things! Glorified, glorified art Thou, O my Heart’s Desire, above the description of all contingent beings! I testify at this moment that the mention of aught else but Thee can never reach Thee, and the description of all save Thyself can never attain unto Thee. For Thy knowledge soars above the kingdom of immortality, while the mention of all else but Thee is wingless, stationary in the realm of mortality. How then can mortality ascend unto the heaven of immortality? By Thy glory! It can never do so except through Thy power and strength, Thy grace and bounty. Despite this supreme restriction, I observe that Thou hast made this Spirit the embellishment of Thy countenance and the ornament of Thy face. Through it are revealed the subtle mysteries of Thy beauty, and by it is concealed the sun of the beauty of Thy holy oneness. By this have all who are in the heavens and on earth been bewildered. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Unveiler, the Concealer. Therefore, O my God, I beseech Thee by the wafting of the winds of Thy mercy upon the temples of the sinners, and the descent of the rains of Thy forgiveness upon the disobedient, and by that cord whereby Thou hast bound the hearts of the lovers and drawn unto Thee the hearts of them that know Thee, that Thou wilt not sever this cord which Thou hast made as a means between Thee and Thy creatures, and deprive them not of this thread which Thou hast made to serve Thy beauty and to companion Thy face. Then I beseech Thee, O my God, to purify the atmosphere of the hearts of Thy servants from the clouds of self and desire, then lift away all that hath come between them and the vision of the lights of eternity. Verily Thou art the Bountiful, the Munificent, the Generous, the Bestower, the Merciful, the Gracious.</p>

<p>In the name of the One dawning from the horizon of the Kingdom of Utterance! We found Ourselves in a palace which God had made the seat of His mighty Throne, and We proceeded to another destination. When We arrived there, We revealed verses and manifested clear proofs by the command of God, the Lord of the worlds. We beheld the place adorned with roses and anemones and flowers of truth, while water flowed beneath rows of willows, moved and swayed by the hands of the breezes morn and eve. Glory be to God! Its trees embraced one another, and the roses smiled with joy and delight. From the rustling of leaves was heard “The Chosen One hath come,” from the roses “God, the Lord of creation,” and from the fruits “The Desired One hath established Himself upon the throne of His name, the Compeller.” We heard them giving each other glad tidings of My arrival and appearance among them. When We turned to the right, We saw the great rose singing, and when We gave ear We heard it announcing to the trees and rivers and roses and flowers, saying: “Blessed art thou, O garden, for having been honored by the advent of the All-Merciful and for having won the privilege of His glance and the hearing of His sweet call and the witnessing of His most luminous horizon.” Then We proceeded in another direction, walking about and contemplating God’s handiwork and the manifestations of His signs and the dawning-places of His power. At that moment the servant in attendance presented a letter which he read before Us, and We found it to be written in the hand of one of My loved ones who was named in My perspicuous Book as Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin. We commanded one of My Branches, who was named Diya’u’llah by the tongue of grandeur and glory, to be present and record before Us that which was to be sent down from the heaven of My will and the clouds of My bounty from the horizon of My Most Exalted Pen in the Kingdom of Names. When he came and read the letter once again, We granted what he desired through My loving-kindness and fulfilled it through My grace, and We answered what was asked by one of My servants named Muhammad-i-Baqir from the ocean of My utterance and the heaven of My mercy which hath encompassed the kingdom of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-i-Baqir! Thy name was presented before the Wronged One, and He hath mentioned thee in such wise as to solace the eyes of creation. Give thanks unto thy Lord, for He remembereth whom He willeth and mentioneth whom remembereth Him and draweth nigh unto who draweth nigh unto Him. Rejoice thou in God’s mercy and bounty. By the life of God! At the moment when the Pen moved to record this most great remembrance, the ocean of forgiveness surged in all creation and the fragrance of pardon and bounty was wafted from the presence of the All-Merciful. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath attained unto that which thou hast attained in this luminous station.</p>
<p>At this moment We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Taqi as a bounty from God, the Lord of the heavens and earth. We counsel thee to be steadfast and God-fearing in the Cause of God, the Lord of all mankind. Beware lest anything whatsoever debar thee from the Lord of Names or cause thee to tremble at the might of those who have denied the Day of Judgment. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Desire, for having remembered me on a day when griefs assailed Thee from every direction through what was wrought by the transgressors against trustworthiness and religion. Thereby have hearts melted and tears flowed while the people remain in evident ignorance. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy tribulation and sorrow and imprisonment to ordain for me that which shall adorn me with the ornament of Thy love in all conditions. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O Ibrahim! The All-Knowing maketh mention of thee from this exalted station which God hath made the seat of His Throne on this manifest Day. When thou hast drunk the Kawthar of My remembrance and been illumined by the lights of My utterance, say: My God, my God! All praise be to Thee for having strengthened me to turn towards Thee on a day when fire was kindled among the wicked and tyranny was manifested by those who committed what caused the near ones to cry out in a glorious station. O Lord! Thou seest me awaiting the wonders of Thy bounty and watching for the manifestations of Thy generosity and grace. I beseech Thee by Thy greatness, which Thou hast made the garment of Thy Temple, to ordain for me that which shall be with me and aid me in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Forgiving, the Generous. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Mahdi and give him glad tidings through this wondrous Remembrance. O Mahdi! Magnify in My name the faces of My loved ones. We counseled them before and counsel them now concerning the trust wherewith God hath adorned the temples of those near unto Him and the sincere ones, and whereby God hath tested His servants in His earth. Blessed is he who is illumined by its light and adorned with its radiance, and woe unto the heedless. O people of God! Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, through the hosts of deeds and character, not by sword and spear. Thus have ye been commanded by the All-Merciful. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! All praise be to Thee for having remembered me through Thy grace and guided me through Thy generosity. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy love, firm in Thy Cause, and a helper of Thy Faith through the wisdom Thou hast sent down in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures, and Thy Tablets. Verily, Thou art the All-Knowing, the Possessor of great wisdom. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Baqir! We make mention on this day of the servants of God who are related to thee, that they may rejoice in the turning of the Wronged One towards them from the direction of His mighty prison. O My loved ones and My friends! Hear My call from this distant place. He remembereth you with that which buildeth, through the hands of loving-kindness and favor, lofty palaces and elevated dwellings. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, He is the Generous, the Merciful. There is none other God but He, the Almighty, the Commander, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, Glorified be His Majesty and Power!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who sent forth the Messengers and revealed the Books to guide mankind to the horizon of justice and to acquaint them with that which would exalt their stations and conditions, until the Divine Message culminated with the Seal of the Prophets and the Beloved of the Chosen Ones, unto whom the All-Merciful revealed His Book, the Furqan, and made it the decisive Word between the peoples. Therein was revealed that which draweth the servants nigh unto Him and acquainteth them with the mysteries of the Return. Peace and blessings be upon those who were set ablaze by the fire of His exalted Word and turned toward the Supreme Horizon in such wise that neither the veils of the oppressors nor the might of the pharaohs could deter them. They spoke in the name of the All-Merciful throughout creation - these are servants who are knowing, steadfast, honored, mindful, and detached. Through them the heavenly table was sent down, the Dove cooed, all things spoke forth, and that which was hidden in the Kingdom of Names was made manifest. Exalted, exalted be their station! Exalted, exalted be their glory, their submission, their humility, and their self-effacement! These are servants through whom the horizon of utterance was illumined and the sun of proof shone forth. The rapture of the Manifestation seized them in such wise that they sacrificed their souls and all they possessed in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant attained unto your letter, whereby the gate of joy was opened, adorned as it was with the remembrance and praise of God. By thy life, O beloved of my heart! The rapture of your love seized me upon reading it, such that I praised and thanked God for having aided and enabled you to remain steadfast in His Cause, to arise to serve Him, and to occupy yourselves with His remembrance and praise. When I discovered the musk-like fragrance of inner meanings in the words of your letter, I presented it before His countenance, and after it was favored with His hearing, the Tongue of the Beloved - may my spirit and all existence be offered up for His sake - spoke thus: “O thou who art present! We have heard their call, their remembrance, and their communing with God, the Lord of all worlds. The Wronged One maketh mention of them and commandeth them to that which is praiseworthy in all circumstances, and counseleth them with that which God hath revealed in the Book. We pray for them at all times and beseech God to send down upon them from the heaven of His grace that which beseemeth His glory, His grandeur, His bounty, His generosity, and His favors, and to ordain for them from His Most Exalted Pen a blessing from His presence and a mercy from His own Self. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.” Thus did His words end.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! The exalted letter arrived and the petitions and missives were received. God willing, replies to all shall gradually be sent. I beseech the Impregnable Truth that He may, at all times, cause that beloved one and those honored ones - upon them be 66+9 [Baha’u’llah] - to drink from the Euphrates of His mercy. Praise be to God! The lamp of loving-kindness is bright and luminous, the sun of grace is radiant, the door of hope is opened, and the carpet of generosity is spread wide. It is hoped that the friends of God will, at every moment, receive their portion from the outpourings of the True Bestower. Verily, He is the Giver, the Munificent, the Compassionate, the Generous. If they inquire about conditions in this land, praise be to God, outward bounties are present, for rain has fallen and the earth is ready to bring forth vegetation. However, this servant has no knowledge of inward bounties. Knowledge is with God, the Goal of all worlds. This much doth this servant beseech: may He bestow both outward and inward bounties upon all and cause them to attain unto His infinite outpourings.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Aqa Mirza Mihdi, upon him be [Baha’u’llah’s glory], it brought complete joy, for through God’s grace and favor he has attained to service safe and sound. When mention was made of him, it was stated: “God willing, may he be confirmed in that which is befitting, may he speak that which is worthy, and may he act in accordance with that which is acceptable.” All counsel is manifest in these words and concealed within these words. The Wronged One sends His greetings to him and counsels him in that which will profit him in this world and the next. From this evanescent servant convey greetings and praise. God willing, may he ever drink from the fountain of grace and be occupied with the mention of the One True God.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Haji Hasan from the people of Ya, they should certainly proceed towards Iran. This has been and is beloved. If they have not yet departed, permission is now granted. Placing their trust in God and holding fast to His cord, they should proceed directly towards Iran. This is better for them if they act upon what they have been commanded. The Glory be upon you and upon the beloved of the heart, Aqa Siyyid ’Abdu’l-Baha, and upon the spirit of the heart, His Holiness Muhammad, and upon the loved ones of God and His friends in that place.</p>
<p>The honored beloved, Aqa ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, also wrote a letter to this evanescent one. God willing, may he attain to the special favors of God, exalted be His glory. God is witness and testifier that he has been and is in view. If this servant had found opportunity, he would have sent numerous letters to Aqa ’Ali and Haji Siyyid [Taqi], upon them be [Baha’u’llah’s glory], and all the gentlemen who are present in that land. The purpose of these words is to express this servant’s yearning and [ardent love] in service to the friends of God, otherwise I have not considered and do not consider myself worthy of mention. The command is in God’s hand, the Lord of all worlds. Then the Glory and Peace and Praise be upon you and upon those who love you and give ear to your words.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath revealed the Hidden Treasure and the Concealed Secret. He is the One at Whose revelation the Kingdom of Utterance appeared amidst all creation, whereupon the Throne was established and the All-Merciful was seated thereon. He spoke the Primal Word, whereby all things between earth and heaven were transformed. Thereupon the near ones, the sincere ones, and the monotheists turned towards the highest heaven, which is the station of certitude and assurance, while the opposers and the polytheists turned towards the nethermost depths, which is the station of rejection and denial. Exalted is God Who distinguished between all created things through a word from His presence. He is the Almighty Whom the might of kings hath not weakened and Whom armies have not hindered. He hath spoken as He desired and revealed what He wished through His command and His sovereignty. He is the One to Whose sovereignty all created things have testified, and to Whose grandeur and power all existence hath borne witness. He hath subdued the world through a word from His presence and cast aside the nations for turning away from His countenance, save those who cast away vain imaginings and turned towards the horizon of certitude in the name of their Lord, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O God of Names, Creator of the heavens and Maker of all things! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the ocean of knowledge surged and the fragrance of Thy garment was diffused, O Thou in Whose hand is the Kingdom of Utterance, to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will enable Thy servants to arise for Thy remembrance and service. Then assist them in such wise that the clamor of the people shall not prevent them from turning unto Thee. Verily Thou art the Almighty Whom nothing can frustrate and no affair can hinder. Thou doest as Thou pleasest and ordainest as Thou willest. Thou art, in truth, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O My loved one! The servant hath attained unto thy letter and perceived from it the sweet fragrances of thy love for our Beloved and your Beloved, the Object of desire of all in the heavens and the earth. When it was read and its contents known, I approached the Sanctuary of the Supreme Concourse, attained the presence of the Throne, and presented what was therein. Thereupon the Tongue of the Beloved spoke that which attracteth hearts, saying:</p>
<p>God willing, may they be blessed by divine grace and illumined by the lights of His countenance. May they speak with perfect wisdom and utterance in praise of the Beloved of all possibility, and may they not be saddened that suitable means are not readily available. All power, might, bounty, mercy and grace are directed towards the friends of Truth, and shall be manifested as circumstances require. Should they reflect upon the Divine Manifestations, they would become aware of what hath been mentioned. The heedless and sleeping servants are observed - were but a single cry to be raised, all would suddenly perish. One must speak with moderation and act with wisdom, that the heedless may be adorned with the robe of understanding and the sleeping ones may be graced with the ornament of wakefulness. I swear by the ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance, were that which is concealed to be revealed, thou wouldst observe all to be seekers, aspirants, and those who turn towards God. Grieve not over anything. In all matters place thy trust in God, Who created thee, sustained thee, and gave thee to drink of the Kawthar of reunion. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Generous. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the letter M, it was mentioned in the Most Holy Presence. He said: “Today he must hold fast to that which will ensure his salvation and deliverance in this world and the next. If he acts upon what We have commanded, he will surely attain unto that which God has intended. We have made mention of him as a token of Our grace. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, Independent of the mention of all the worlds.” Beseech God that He may assist him to that which befits this blessed Day. Would that he had comprehended the Day of God! Should he attain unto this station, he would attain unto that which is intended. This much has been revealed in the Book of God through your intercession. Although comprehension of this station is difficult at present, as he does not reflect, yet this Word is greater than all that he has seen and heard of earthly ornaments and riches. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the Manifest. In any case, one must proceed and speak with wisdom, that perchance they may discover and hold fast unto that which is best for them.</p>
<p>In all circumstances it is best that that spiritual friend be mindful of wisdom and act with wisdom, for if there be lack of wisdom they will not draw near to hear the Word of Truth. Ere long the Hand of Divine Power shall reveal that which He has willed. Verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>His honor Aqa Siyyid ’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, brought your letter which you had sent to him, and it was seen. This evanescent servant beseeches the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted, that He may assist you to mention Him, to praise Him and to serve His Cause, and that He may sanctify the people of the world from the defilement of self and desire, and lead them to true tranquility, which is the station of certitude in God. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>The Branches of the Divine Lote-Tree - may my spirit and the spirits of all the worlds be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - remember you with wondrous praise and sublime glorification, and likewise those who circle round and stand before the Throne convey their sincere greetings. Glory be upon you and upon those who have cast away what they possessed and taken hold of that which was commanded by God, the Almighty, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who sent down the Torah, the Gospel, and the Furqan. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who through the Criterion distinguished between religions and made it the dawning-place of His commandments, the dayspring of His ordinances, the manifestation of His knowledge, and the source of His utterance among His servants and creation. Through it the oceans of knowledge and wisdom surged, and the rivers of the Law flowed, and through it every seated one arose and every sleeping one awakened. And blessings and peace be upon God’s lamp among His servants and His light throughout the lands, through whom every seeker recognized his goal, every searcher found his desire, and every wayfarer his straight path, and upon his family and companions whom God made the dawning-places of His power and the daysprings of His might, with abundant and great peace.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the distinguished letter addressed to this evanescent servant arrived and after being read and reviewed was presented before the face of the Lord. These exalted words were revealed in response from the Dawning-Place of knowledge and wisdom: “O Husayn! Thy letter hath arrived and was read by him who serveth Me. We found from it the fragrance of thy love and thy mention and thy utterance for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to send down upon thee from the heaven of His grace that which will draw thee nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Say:</p>
<p>“Glory be unto Thee, O God of the Throne and earth and Lord of all mankind! I beseech Thee by the Zamzam and the ?afa, and by Thy House around which circle they who dwell in the kingdom of creation and which the sincere ones seek by Thy command, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, to ordain for me through Thy grace and bounty that which Thou hast ordained for Thy sincere servants and Thy near ones. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward the court of Thy grace and directing myself to the lights of Thy countenance, and I desire naught but what Thou hast desired through Thy bounty and favor. I beseech Thee by the Seal of Thy Prophets and the Manifestations of Thy power among Thy creation to assist me to act according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book and to ordain for me the good of the Hereafter and of this world, O Thou in Whose grasp is the reins of all things. O my Lord! The tongue of my inner being and my outer being and my limbs testify to Thy oneness and singleness, and that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Thou hast created all beings through a word from Thee and brought forth all existence through a will from Thy presence. Thou art He Whom the manifestations of power and might cannot frustrate, nor can the objections of creation prevent Thee. Through Thy Name, O my God, the gate of relief was opened before the faces of Thy loved ones, and the rivers of Thy knowledge flowed among Thy creation. I beseech Thee to forgive me and my father and my mother and those who are with me. Verily, Thou art He through Whose Name the ocean of forgiveness surged and the fragrance of Thy name, the All-Merciful, wafted. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Help in Peril.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God, they have attained to the circumambulation of the House and performed the rites without doubt, and have been and are in the vicinity of the House of God. This evanescent one has sought and continues to seek prayers from that honored one. The prayers of the friends are answered. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>When remembrance occurs, forget not this servant. If but the faintest breath of the zephyr of mercy should pass, the transgressions of the world would vanish from sight. By the confession and acknowledgment of all the Prophets and the chosen ones, His mercy has preceded all else, and His grace has exceeded the power of pen and utterance to recount. His generosity has encompassed all who exist, and His bounty has enveloped the world. With such a Generous One, no matter is difficult or arduous. While the world and humankind exist, were we to give thanks, it would be as naught before His bestowal.</p>
<p>God willing, may your honor be ever engaged in the remembrance and praise of the One desired by all the worlds. At one time He said: “Write to Haji - upon him be greetings - that mention of this Wronged One is not permitted among the servants, for whatever is said in relation to this Wronged One, they interpret according to their own desires.” God is witness and testifier that there has been and is no thought save the good of the nations and the reformation of the world. We have ever bidden unto righteousness and forbidden wrongdoing. Nevertheless, at times We have been imprisoned, at times incarcerated, and at times exiled, and so We remain. Yet We would not exchange an atom of what We have endured in God’s path for all the treasures of kings and rulers. Abasement in the path of the Friend is an enduring glory, and hardship in His way has been and ever shall be a blessing. In all conditions We have committed Our affairs to Him and have placed Our trust in Him. The Command is in His hands; He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth. He is the Powerful, the Almighty, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>This evanescent one beseecheth God - exalted be His glory - to assist your honor to act according to what hath been mentioned. Praise be to God, your remembrance hath been and is in the prison. The mention of the fourteenth night which you made that evening is ever before Our eyes; the sweetness of that remembrance hath not left Our palate. God is sufficient as witness.</p>
<p>That which you sent arrived - it was indeed fresh and ripe, for it was taken by one who loved and sent with love. It was surely acceptable, as indeed it proved to be. And as for the Tablet that was requested, a prayer was specially bestowed for your honor. This servant has recorded it in the original letter. God willing, you will be blessed to read it. As commanded, it was also written separately and sent. Peace and mercy be upon your honor and upon God’s sincere, righteous, and active servants.</p>

And blessings and peace be upon Him through Whom was established the sovereignty of God, His grandeur, His commandments, His laws, the encompassing nature of His power and His might, and upon His family and companions whom neither the swords of the world nor the ranks of nations frightened. They arose with limited numbers before the hosts of the world, aided the Cause of God with true victory and strove in God’s path with true striving. Through them the idols were shattered and the manifestations of vain imaginings were struck down. These are the servants whom the All-Merciful described in the Furqan, whom no blame of any blamer could turn away from God. We bear witness that there is no God but Him, in acknowledgment of His oneness and singleness, and in recognition of His grace and bounty.</p>
<p>Your noble letter was received, and from it I sensed the fragrance of the exalted Gate. Blessed are they who circumambulate the House and visit Yathrib and Batha. By the life of our Beloved, the people of vision would not exchange a single pebble thereof for all the jewels of the world. Verily, whenever the spirit hears mention of those places, it thrills with joy and gladness. All this is from God’s grace, the Lord of lords.</p>
<p>The letter of that spiritual friend arrived, diffusing the fragrance of divine love. After reading and perusing it, I approached the sacred threshold and presented it before the Master. He said: “Praise be to God, you have attained and performed the circumambulation.” Say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! I testify to the sanctity of Thy Being above mention and utterance, and the exaltation of Thy Self above what is ordained in contingent existence. Thou hast created creation for the recognition of the Dawning-Place of Thy Cause, the Manifestation of Thy Self, and the Dayspring of Thy signs. Yet when He appeared, most of Thy creation turned away from Him - among them were those who denied Him, those who objected to Him, and those who arose to shed His blood. I beseech Thee, O Master of existence and Ruler of the seen and unseen, by Thy Command through which appeared the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the effulgences of the heaven of Thy grace, to ordain for this servant of Thine the good of the hereafter and of this world. O Lord! Thou seest me clinging to the cord of Thy oneness and holding fast to the hem of Thy generosity. I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which shall accompany me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. O Lord! The thirst of separation from Thee hath consumed me - where is the sweet water of Thy mercy? My transgressions have removed me far from the court of Thy nearness - where are the waves of the ocean of Thy forgiveness? I beseech Thee by Thy Book which Thou didst reveal unto Thy Beloved, whereby Thou didst separate truth from falsehood and light from darkness, to preserve me in all conditions from whatsoever might prevent me from turning to Thee, O Lord of mankind and Lord of the Sacred Place and Station! By Thy glory, O Desired One of the world and Worshipped One of the nations, I have desired naught from Thee except that which would make me, by night and day, speak Thy praise, utter Thy remembrance, and arise to serve Thy loved ones. Assist me, O my God, through Thy bounty and generosity; enable me, O my Beloved, through Thy power and loving-kindness. Verily, Thou art He Whom the wishes and desires of the nations cannot frustrate. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.” [End]</p>
<p>Praise be to God that your honor and those with you are successful in all conditions. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, on behalf of that spiritual beloved, whatsoever is worthy of His bounty. After mention of the distinguished lady upon whom be 966 [Baha’u’llah], the Master spoke:</p>
<p>O handmaiden of God! This Wronged One makes mention of thee and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, on thy behalf whatsoever is conducive to thy good in this world and the next. Thou hast ever been and art remembered before the Wronged One. Give thanks to the Peerless Beloved Who guided thee and taught thee the blessed Word of Unity. This is a great bounty and a mighty favor from God. Know thou its worth and recognize its station. Praise be to God Who caused thee to associate with one who possesses true unity and spiritual knowledge. Be thankful unto thy Lord for this supreme blessing and this greatest gift. The glory from Us be upon him and upon thee and upon him who was named Muhammad-’Ali and upon the leaf whom God hath given unto you both.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseeches the Eternal Truth to assist all to mention, meditation, and acceptance, as well as to deeds from which the fragrance of divine acceptance is inhaled. Now, praise be to God, your honor hath attained unto that which is the greatest cause for the mention and praise of God, exalted be His glory. We beseech Him to make His grace continuous. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. And likewise may He grant whatsoever is conducive to the exaltation of His Word. This evanescent one also conveys greetings to the distinguished lady and children, makes mention of them, and beseeches God for the good of this world and the next for each one. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those with you and those who love you and upon God’s sincere and righteous servants. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Exalted is God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting, Who hath adorned the world with the Most Great Name, whereby He hath distinguished between the nations, and revealed that which lay hidden in hearts and concealed in breasts, and through which the dwellers of the grave have arisen and the decree of resurrection hath been made manifest. Blessed is he who hath awakened on the Day of God, concerning which the All-Merciful hath given tidings in the Qur’an, saying–and His Word is the truth–“The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.” We bear witness that the Day hath truly appeared, wherein the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Secret do speak: “Verily, there is none other God besides Me, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.” They who have heeded the Call and turned to the Supreme Horizon are, before God, the Lord of Names, numbered among the people of Baha, while they who have turned away are but worthless creatures whose names the Pen of God, Creator of the heavens, hath refused to record. We testify that they are among the most lost in the mighty Book.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the Servant hath heard what befell you in the path of God, and how the fire of tyranny and hatred was kindled in those parts by the swine who have adorned themselves with turbans and robes. Woe unto them! And again, woe unto them! By God’s life, their commerce hath yielded no profit, and they have lost both in this world and in the next. Soon shall they behold themselves in the abyss and shall find no helper nor supporter. Do they imagine they can extinguish the fire kindled by the hand of Power and Might? Do they suppose they can put out the light which God hath caused to shine forth from the Supreme Horizon? Nay, by His very Self, the True One! They are impotent, they are the losers, they are the deniers, they are the transgressors. God shall, through His authority, soon cast them down and exalt those who have believed in God and His signs, who have acknowledged His oneness and confessed His singleness. Verily, there is none other God but Him. His is the creation and the command. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>God willing, drink ye and give others to drink, at all times, of the choice wine of divine knowledge. Consider ye the consummate wisdom of God, for as hath been witnessed and continues to be seen, whatsoever the enemies of God deemed would abase His loved ones hath become the very source of their glory. Thus did certain heedless souls, imagining they could conceal the Divine Light and extinguish the Fire of His Cause, consign the Ancient Beauty to the Most Great Prison. Observe ye now how many consummate wisdoms lay hidden in this matter: that which they deemed would abase the Truth became the source of glory, and what they considered hardship proved to be the essence of ease. This is why He saith that tribulations and trials are as water for the tree of His Cause. Blessed is he who pondereth that which hath appeared from the horizon of God’s Will, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>By the Sun of the horizon of utterance! Every death that hath occurred in the path of God hath been the cause of life to the world, and every destruction wrought in the way of the Friend shall be the cause of the world’s construction. God willing, ye should, through divine grace and heavenly favors, be joyous at all times and occupied with service to His Cause. Convey to all the beloved in that land the greetings of this evanescent servant. Had this servant found the opportunity, he would have written a detailed letter to each of those who are adorned with the ornament of recognition. However, owing to the profusion of divine verses that must be penned, no opportunity hath been found; therefore he seeketh pardon from all. And I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, that He may adorn all with the raiment of steadfastness and that they may be of those who reckon all save God as nonexistent and void, in such wise that neither the cawing of the crows nor the clamor of the prevaricators may deter them from the straight path, and that they may all attain to the lofty station of “Say: Allah; then leave them to plunge in vain discourse and trifling.” For it hath been observed and continues to be seen that some of the weak ones have been deprived of the True One, glorified be His grandeur, by reason of the golden calf. God protect us and you from the evil of every deceitful detractor. Certain letters of this servant were presented to the Land of ?a, and it was specifically written that copies thereof should be sent to that land, that perchance they might cause the souls who have accepted the Faith to remain steadfast. Today steadfastness is among the greatest of all things in the sight of God. Blessed is he who is adorned with this holy and luminous raiment. Whenever the fragrance of discord is detected, this servant findeth himself bewildered, for this is a day wherein the True One Himself hath appeared from the horizon of manifestation, resplendent and evident, and the effulgences of His revelation have illumined the whole world. Yet despite this, why should accepting souls occupy themselves with mention of this one and that? We beseech God to preserve His loved ones from the evil of every deceiver and the craftiness of every schemer, to enable them to speak His praise and to aid them to serve His Cause. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Responding One. Today all the friends must strive and endeavor that perchance some service may proceed from them that shall endure and persist. I convey greetings to his honor, thy father, upon him be the glory of God. Praise be to God, he hath attained unto divine favors, and thy letter was presented in detail before the Throne, and the Sun of grace hath risen from the horizon of utterance. God willing, may he ever be and continue to be the recipient of divine favors.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Majesty and Power!</p>
<p>Praise be befitting unto the Lord of existence Who brought creation into being for the sake of the Dawning-Place of His signs and the Dayspring of His evidences. The blessed word which shone forth from the Dayspring of utterance, the Desired One of all worlds, in the Dispensation of the Furqan bears witness to this, for He saith, glorified and exalted be He: “But for thee, I would not have created the heavens.” Absolute existence came into being through Him and was adorned with the ornament of names and attributes. The ocean of knowledge and the luminary of proof dawned and surged through Him. Were it not for Him, the pearls of inner meanings and utterance would not have appeared in the contingent world, nor would God’s pathway have been made manifest to His servants, nor would the decree of divine unity have spread throughout all lands. Exalted be His most mighty and glorious station and His most hidden and concealed mystery! And blessings and peace be upon Him and upon the Sources of revelation and the Dawning-Places of inspiration, through whom the throne of commands and laws was established, and through whom the gates of God’s mercy were opened unto all else besides Him. Glorified be the greatness of their Creator, their Fashioner, their Provider, their Purifier, their Strengthener, and their Supporter in aiding His Cause in the kingdom of creation.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou seest Thy loved ones turning unto Thee and holding fast unto Thy cord. These are Thy servants and Thy creation who have borne hardships in Thy path and who have been, through nights and days, among wolves who have denied Thy favor, turned away from Thy face, and disputed Thy signs. O Lord! Thou seest how this servant remembers them in all conditions and beseeches from the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy generosity that which will make them tablets of Thy remembrance among Thy creatures and scrolls of Thy names throughout Thy earth. Ordain for them, O my God, the recompense for their deeds as befitteth Thy might and grandeur, Thy bounty and grace, Thy bestowal and mercy, which have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>This servant beseeches and implores from God, exalted be His glory, that which will cause the exaltation of His Cause and the elevation of the station of His loved ones. Ye are remembered in all conditions and have attained the grace of His utterance. It is hoped that God, exalted be His glory, will assist the people of unity to accomplish that which will cause the harmony of hearts and the unity of souls. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to give you to drink, at every moment, from the Kawthar of His knowledge and the Salsabil of His love. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>I convey greetings to the loved ones of that land, and with utmost humility and supplication, I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for that which will increase the light of hearts and bestow from the chalice of bounty, at all times, that which is the cause of steadfastness and wondrous life. He is the All-Bountiful, Whose generosity is not prevented by the ingratitude of His servants. His gifts descend like rain, and His grace is like a surging ocean and is evident. Blessed are the people of unity whom nothing among all things, no name among all names, and no matter among all matters has prevented from turning to their Lord, the Kind, the Forgiving.</p>
<p>The loved ones mentioned in the letter of that honored servant were brought before Our presence, and each was blessed with the mention of the Beloved. The glances of mercy have ever been and continue to be directed towards them. May they gladden those mentioned souls through the grace of the Ever-Present Lord, so that all may gather in complete joy and delight upon the carpet of unity, and become occupied with the remembrance and praise of God, exalted be His glory. Verily, He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>That which was sent was received and accepted. Praise be to God Who assisted you to act according to His good-pleasure and enabled you to love Him, remember Him, and praise Him. Peace, glory, grace, and splendor be upon you and upon God’s loved ones, His friends, and His intimates.</p>

<p>Praise be unto that Supreme Being Who through His appearance caused all things to proclaim “The Promised One hath come!” and through His utterance made all the trees of the most exalted Paradise speak that which the Interlocutor heard. Great is His sovereignty and mighty His proof, and there is no God but Him. And blessing and peace be upon His Prophets and His chosen ones and His loved ones who cast away what they possessed in hope of that which is with Him, and who acted according to what they were commanded in His perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>Thereafter, may my spirit be a sacrifice for your service and for your steadfastness. Your esteemed letter appeared like the horizon, from which the light of detachment shone forth resplendent. It refreshed the soul as though the fabled water of life had become manifest and its existence verified. This is the time for gratitude for having given me to drink from the Kawthar of your favors and the choice wine of your mention. After attending to it, pondering over it, reading and studying it, it was presented before the Presence of the Desired One. This is what the Tongue of the Beloved uttered:</p>
<p>“O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory, My remembrance, and My favor. Praise be to God that thou art mentioned in the nights and days, and the favor of the Truth is directed toward thee. The Wronged One beareth witness that thou hast attained unto that which was revealed from time immemorial in the Books of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. Thou didst turn to Him in the early days when the people were in manifest denial. Thou didst turn to the lights of the Countenance and wert present and didst attain unto that which cannot be equaled by whatsoever the people possess. Thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, beareth witness unto this. The peace from Us be upon thee and upon the son who was mentioned before the Wronged One and who stood at the gate. Give him the glad-tidings of My Most Exalted Word and illumine him with the light of My wondrous utterance. And the peace that shineth forth from the Supreme Paradise and the Most Exalted Heaven be upon thee and upon him and upon whosoever loveth thee and hearkeneth unto thy word, and upon every steadfast and upright one.”</p>
<p>O Afnan! Upon thee be My glory! The wolf has seized My sheep, the oppressor has slain My she-camel, the serpent has opened wide its jaws and swallowed its Lord. The cause of that wronged One’s martyrdom was His resistance to corruption.</p>
<p>They know what they sought and what was the intention of the oppressors. When prohibition came and there was refusal to accept what they desired of corruption, it became the cause of the setting of that Star of the heaven of truth. Yet, by the life of our Beloved, this setting is the cause of [many] risings. Were the polytheists and the heedless to become aware of this station, they would never transgress. We beseech God to aid His loved ones to patience and forbearance, and His enemies to justice and fairness. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>To the honored Afnan, Aqa Siyyid Aqa, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, I convey greetings and nothingness, and I beseech God the Most High to manifest for his honor that which will gladden his heart and the hearts of His loved ones and friends. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>To the honored brother Aqa Nuru’llah and spiritual friend Aqa Muhammad, upon them be God’s loving-kindness and favor, I send greetings and seek success for each one. Verily our Lord is the Forgiving, the Generous. Peace, remembrance and glory be upon your honor and upon those who are with you and those who love you and hearken to your words in the remembrance of God, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>

<p>What was sent arrived and was given to those who sought it. They said it was done following the example of the Seal of the Prophets, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, meaning it was spent on winning hearts. For some it is considered valuable, and since it had not been used until now, it was therefore bestowed upon others.</p>

<p>Honored friend, your letter was received and it truly brought both great joy and much sorrow, as it mentioned the ill health of yourself and those upon whom be [Baha’u’llah’s blessings], and likewise your esteemed brother Aqa Mirza ’Ali-Akbar, upon whom be Baha’u’llah’s blessings, and also the dear friend Aqa Lutfu’llah, upon whom be [Baha’u’llah’s blessings]. Indeed, “tribulation is for those who are near” has shown its face, and “the world is a prison for the believer and a paradise for the unbeliever” has become manifest and evident. This year in this land too, numerous souls have been bereft of health and afflicted with illness. Yet praise be to God, all ended well. It is certain that the friends in that land too shall be adorned with the ornament of complete healing.</p>
<p>Some time ago, the spiritual friend Aqa Mirza ’Ali-Akbar submitted a petition to the Most Holy Court. A gracious reply was given and sent. Undoubtedly they have received it. The world has been seized by the dust of sorrows, and the darkness of rebellion has obscured it. People remain veiled and heedless, not having yet pondered what has been and is the cause of the triumph of the idolaters over the people of unity, why the clouds of oppression have prevented the light of the sun of justice from shining forth, where the fruits of the seeds of knowledge planted in the soil of hearts have gone, and what their yield has been. All Islamic lands are now surrounded while non-Islamic lands surround them. Indeed, how true are the words of the poet: “All this from the ill-fitted, disproportionate form.”</p>
<p>When Adam, the father of humankind, came, he said: “O people, fear God! I have come for your salvation and give you glad tidings of the meeting with the Beloved, and guide you to the land of security.” They said: “This is pure falsehood.” Then another Messenger came from the True Sender and said: “Fear God!” They replied: “We see you as a liar.” Thus did the Messengers come and show the way until it came to Moses. You have heard what the Pharaohs did and what the tyrants said. Despite the nine signs, they denied and strove with utmost opposition to extinguish the fire of the Blessed Tree.</p>
<p>Then Jesus came and said: “O people, I have come to give you glad tidings of He Who shall come after Me to complete for you what I have mentioned to you.” They seized Him and intended to kill Him, but God took Him by His power and raised Him to heaven. Although these holy, pure, and steadfast souls never saw a moment’s rest and were forever under the lash of enemies - consider Noah and the later Prophets such as Hud, Salih, Lot, and George - all were at all times subjected to such torments that none but God, exalted be His glory, knows of them. Yet none reflected on why these oppressed ones bore all these things.</p>
<p>At last the horizon of the world was illumined with the Greatest Light, the gate of grace was opened, the ocean of generosity appeared, the ornament of beginning was adorned with the name of the Seal, and the first Sun was manifested with the final Light. Blessed and exalted be His words: “But He is the Apostle of God and the Seal of the Prophets.” In the beginning of His Cause, He spoke nothing but the word of unity, saying: “O people, say ‘There is no god but God’ that you may prosper.” Nevertheless, you have heard the scholars of the Torah and the Gospel and what the divines of idols have wrought! Every possessor of sight hath wept, and every possessor of a heart hath lamented. Then did His Cause appear with the utmost power and might in the world, until hearts were transformed and faces turned away from their devotion, and there came to pass what came to pass, as ye see and hear. This evanescent one beseecheth the True One, exalted be His glory, that He may deliver all from their deep slumber and rend asunder the veils that blind their eyes. He is the Omnipotent, He is the All-Powerful. The Command is God’s, the Lord of all names.</p>
<p>May the honored Sabri Effendi, upon him be the glory of God and His loving-kindness, ever abide beneath the shadow of the care of the Eternal Beloved in tranquility and peace. Convey to him greetings and expressions of sincere devotion from this evanescent servant. The other loved ones have never been, nor shall ever be, effaced from memory; they have ever been and shall continue to be remembered. To them also do I send greetings and salutations. To the apple of our eye, Inayatu’llah, and his sister and mother, upon them be peace, do I send salutations and give them the glad-tidings of the bounties and favors of the True One, exalted be His glory.</p>
<p>The degrees of humility, submissiveness, self-effacement and nothingness of your honor and your household have been mentioned in the Most Exalted Station and before the dwellers of the pavilion of infallibility. Whenever the letter of that honored friend arrived, this servant was specifically present and made mention of it, and tokens of loving-kindness were manifested from each of the Daysprings of light. This is a glad-tiding from the servant to you, both now and hereafter. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings.</p>

<p>In My Name, the Stranger, the Wronged One</p>
<p>The days have been honored, O my God, by the days which Thou hast named Ha. Each day thereof Thou hast made a herald and messenger to announce unto men the days whereon Thou hast prescribed fasting for Thy creatures and Thy servants, that each soul may prepare for their arrival, designate a place for them in his heart, and purify it through Thy name, the Lord, for their descent upon him. O God of existence, and Sovereign over all that is seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Excellent Names and Thy Most Exalted Attributes, and by the Manifestations of Thy Cause in the Kingdom of Creation and the Daysprings of Thy Revelation in the Realm of Eternity, to rain down upon those who have fasted in Thy love the showers from the clouds of Thy mercy and the effusions from the heaven of Thy grace. O Lord! Withhold not from them the recompense of what they have wrought in Thy love and for Thy pleasure.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O Lord of Names, Creator of the heavens, Author of Names, Sovereign of Names, and Raiser and Preserver of the firmament, to open unto the faces of those who have bowed before Thy command the gates of Thy bounty, Thy mercy, and Thy loving-kindness. O Lord! They are the poor, and with Thee are the oceans of wealth; they are the weak, and Thou art the Powerful through Thy might and the Triumphant through Thy sovereignty. O Lord! Thou seest their eyes fixed upon the horizon of Thy bestowals and their hearts turned toward the direction of Thy gifts. Look, O my God, upon the hearts which Thou hast made the thrones of Thy sovereignty and the dawning-places for the manifestation of the lights of Thy love. Sprinkle upon them, O my God, from the ocean of Thy generosity that which shall make them the manifestations of this Name amongst Thy servants.</p>
<p>O Lord! Aid them in that whereby Thy Cause may be exalted in Thy realm. Then make manifest through them that which shall immortalize their names in Thy Kingdom and Thy dominion. O Lord! They are they who have been consumed by the fire of Thy love in Thy lands and have witnessed every hardship in Thy path and have tasted every bitterness, hoping for the honey of bounty from the heaven of Thy generosity. O Lord! They are they who have borne in Thy love what none among Thy servants and creatures have borne. O Lord! The sincere ones are consumed by the fire of separation from Thee - where is the fountain of Thy presence? The near ones have perished in the desert of remoteness from Thee - where then is the sweet water of reunion with Thee?</p>
<p>Hear, O my God, the sighing of Thy lovers, and dost Thou see, O my Beloved, what hath befallen them that long for Thee? By Thy Self! Thou hearest and seest, and Thou art the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Thou art He Who, O my God, didst announce unto all my days and my manifestation, and didst make every Book of Thy Books a herald of my Name between earth and heaven, giving glad tidings of the appearance of Thy Most Glorious Beauty. Yet when the world was illumined with the lights of the Most Great Name, each party clung to one of Thy names, and thereby remained heedless of the ocean of Thy knowledge, the sun of Thy wisdom, and the heaven of Thy recognition.</p>
<p>O my God and the God of all things, the Educator of all names! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Manifest, the Hidden, and by Thy Beauty, the Shining, the Treasured, to adorn Thy loved ones with the vesture of trustworthiness among all creatures, and deprive them not of this most exalted station and this most holy, most mighty, most glorious attribute. For Thou hast made it a sun in the heaven of Thy decree and an ornament in the book of Thy laws, and through it is manifested the sanctification of Thy Essence from all surmises and imaginings, and the exaltation of Thy Self above whatsoever hath occurred to the hearts of men. O Lord! Send down upon Thy loved ones from the heaven of Thy grace that which shall purify them from the mention of any one except Thee. Then grant them the chalice of steadfastness from the hands of Thy bounty and generosity, lest intimations debar them from the direction of Thy manifestation. O Lord! Through Thy name, the All-Bountiful, hath shone forth the luminary of my hope, and through Thy name, the Most Generous, hath been raised the hand of my supplication. By Thy glory, O Beloved of my heart and Goal of my desire! I acknowledge at this moment Thy generosity, even shouldst Thou deny me all that is in Thy earth and Thy heaven. My limbs and members, my blood and flesh, my skin and hair all testify to Thy bounty and favor, even shouldst Thou banish me from Thy realms and lands and render me in need of the meanest thing in Thy kingdom. By Thy might, O Fire of the world and Light of the nations! My tongue and heart cry out and confess Thy pardon and forgiveness, even shouldst Thou torment me throughout the duration of Thy sovereignty. How can one who acknowledgeth not this confess that Thou art the Praised One in Thy deeds and the Obeyed One in Thy command? O Lord! Thou seest how the fire of Thy love hath encompassed me and taken full possession of my heart and my being. O Lord! Have mercy on him who hath clung to the cord of Thy bounty and held fast to the hem of Thy generosity, who hath found solace in Thy remembrance and circled round Thy will, who hath fasted in Thy love and broken his fast at Thy bidding, and who hath fled from his own self, taking refuge in the stronghold of Thy protection. O my God, my Lord and my Support! Illumine the hearts of Thy servants with the light of Thy knowledge, aid them to act in accordance with Thy good-pleasure, and acquaint them, O my God, with the reward of their deeds which Thou hast ordained in Thy kingdom and dominion and in the worlds which none knoweth save Thyself and which none can reckon except Thy knowledge. O Lord! I am he who standeth before Thy gate and gazeth toward Thy most exalted horizon, hoping for Thy grace for Thy loved ones and anticipating Thy favors for Thy chosen ones. Ordain, O my God, for each of Thy servants that which shall make him well-pleased with Thee, turning unto Thee, steadfast in Thy Cause, drinking the choice wine of revelation from the hand of Thy bounty, and soaring in the atmosphere of Thy love and affection in such wise that he shall see all else as non-existent at the dawning of the Sun of Thy Revelation and as null before the manifestations of the lights of Thy countenance. O Lord! Write down for Thy loved ones, with Thy Most Exalted Pen which no obliteration can touch, the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, Thou art the Possessor of the Throne and the dust, the All-Manifest One Who gazeth from Thy most glorious horizon. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>The Dove of Utterance hath cooed upon the twigs of mystic knowledge: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all worlds. This is a word uttered by the tongue of the Lord of Names after the passing away of all things. He, verily, is the Omnipotent, the Almighty. This is a day wherein the powers have risen against the Islamic Faith, whereby the foundations have been shaken and the people are in manifest loss. They have reaped what they have sown in their vain life, to which every discerning sage doth testify.</p>
<p>Tribulation hath encompassed the world. If perchance some good be observed therein, a great calamity is seen to follow, the cause and reason for which none among the dwellers of earth hath comprehended. The Lord of the Messengers and the Seal of the Prophets - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - hath said: “A time shall come when no one’s faith shall remain secure except for those who flee from peak to peak and from stone to stone.” Likewise, Isaiah the Prophet hath spoken concerning the severity of these days: “Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty.” This blessed verse he hath mentioned thrice, and this is the greatest proof and mightiest evidence of the severity of these days and the greatness of God’s Cause. In another passage he saith: “And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty.” And further he saith: “To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty.”</p>
<p>Were this evanescent one to undertake mentioning the references from divine books and scriptures that have been sent down from the Kingdom of Will upon the Prophets and chosen ones, it would surely result in a book larger than all existing books. In truth, these are momentous days, for the fire of sedition is ablaze in the world, and cities and lands are besieged under the might of great cannons and in upheaval. Such means have been assembled in the world that the mighty ones of the age do whatever they are capable of doing. The intoxication of pride in these fleeting days hath so seized them that they hear not the cry of the oppressed. They show no mercy to young or old. God shall requite them for what they do.</p>
<p>O brother! All these matters have come to pass according to the desert of people and the deeds they were engaged in beforehand. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to bestow, through His grace and mercy, penetrating vision and attentive ears, that those on earth might become aware of what behooveth them and arise to redress what hath escaped them. Now that most are observed to be heedless and are seen to be sleeping - nay, dead - in the cradle of ignorance and unknowing, perchance Israfil, by the command of the Lord of Majesty, might render assistance, or the Holy Spirit might, out of pure grace, bestow an effusion.</p>
<p>However, praise be to God, through divine grace and favor these servants have grown accustomed to imprisonment and are grateful in all conditions. We beseech His aid that He may, in these fleeting days, preserve His servants from all that is repugnant to His good-pleasure. This is the hope of them that hope. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Your letter was received. Praise be to God, it was adorned with the ornament of love and brought glad tidings of the well-being of the friends of God. After it was reviewed, it was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and loving-kindness was expressed for each one. God willing, may they be occupied with the remembrance of Truth in all conditions and be steadfast in His service.</p>
<p>All items sent were received in full. Praise be to God, you were confirmed in service to the Cause in days when all are heedless and veiled from it, save whom God willeth. All the deeds of the world’s peoples shall one day be brought to light. Consider what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an - blessed and exalted be His words: “O my son! If it be but the weight of a mustard-seed and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth.”</p>
<p>Those who remained heedless of what profiteth them and occupied themselves with that which causeth the Concourse on High to lament have indeed suffered loss. Soon shall they behold the recompense of their deeds. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Just, the Wise.</p>
<p>To his parents, upon them be the Glory of God, I convey greetings and praise. Praise be to God, they have been and are confirmed. Likewise to those who have turned and attained, and other friends and relatives - all have been and remain in mind. The letter from Aqa Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, was received and a reply was sent. God willing, may he be confirmed in acting upon it.</p>
<p>As these regions are in turmoil these days, therefore travel to this direction is not advisable. Convey greetings on my behalf and say: “Patience is the key to relief.” God willing, after tranquility and assurance return to these parts, you shall attain. The Glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who have arisen and said: “God is our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and earths.”</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>2nd of the honored month of Shawwal 1299</p>
<p>This servant wrote and sent a letter in response to the missive of my master and beloved, the Name of God M.H., upon him be all 9 [Baha], His Most Glorious Glory. Please deliver it.</p>

<p>This is a Book from Us to all who dwell on earth: Worship none but God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Self-Subsisting. He hath created all things for the knowledge of His Self and hath sent unto them Messengers from His presence to guide them to the True Faith - this being His way, if ye but knew it. And unto each one He gave such proofs as rendered powerless all who are in the heavens and on earth. This was irrevocably decreed until the days culminated in the Spirit, Whom He made manifest in truth and sent unto His servants to guide them unto God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Through Him the Kawthar of life was bestowed upon those who turned unto God and detached themselves from such as ascribed partners unto Him. Then He sent forth Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and revealed unto Him the Book to distinguish between truth and falsehood, if ye be of them that are assured. Successive centuries passed until the clouds were cleft asunder and God came with His kingdom of might, and the matter was decided by the decree of the Powerful, the Praiseworthy. He made him the Herald of Him Who was to come after, as revealed in the Bayan, if ye be of them that know. By His life! He breathed naught save mention of this Most Great Remembrance, giving unto the people glad tidings of this Hidden Pearl, and the Dove of the Bayan warbled not save in My praise and glorification, as witnessed by such servants as are endowed with insight. Each day He took from all on earth a covenant concerning My presence and gave them glad tidings of meeting Me, until His days were fulfilled and the appointed time came. Then was revealed God’s hidden treasure and His concealed Command. The people of the Bayan waxed proud against Him - some denied and turned away, some arose in hypocrisy, and some pronounced their verdict against Him. Thus was it with the Beauty of God, the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O people! I know not by what proof ye have turned away from this Cause, by what evidence ye have hesitated concerning it, and by what testimony ye have grown proud and become of them that deny - after that every matter was made dependent upon His leave, as was revealed by the Primal Point in the Tablet of Divine Decree, wherein moved the Most Exalted Pen by the will of God, the Mighty, the Beloved, the All-Loving. Naught was revealed in the Bayan but reached its consummation in this Most Great Remembrance, would ye but judge fairly. All were commanded not to be veiled at the time of His manifestation by the Bayan and what was revealed therein, inasmuch as not a single letter was revealed therein except concerning this transcendent, mighty, and beloved Cause. His purpose was none other than that ye should not cling to it in His days, nor adduce such proofs as were adduced by the people of the Furqan, and before them the people of the Gospel and the Psalms. For at the time of each Manifestation, every people clung to the words revealed aforetime, and thereby opposed God unknowingly. Reflect upon the books of old and what was revealed therein concerning the signs of the Manifestation. By God! Thou shalt find naught save symbols and allusions, if ye would but understand. In this there lieth a wisdom known to none save God, Who created all things according to a fixed decree. However, He Who came with the name of ’Ali rent asunder the veils, dispelled the clouds of glory, and cried out with the loudest voice between earth and heaven. He spoke, and His word was most sweet, saying: “Verily, I am alive in the Most Glorious Horizon!” Then His spirit ascended to the Most Exalted Companion, the station of glorious might, having remembered Me in His days and spoken in My praise, moved by My eagerness, gazing toward the horizon of My good-pleasure, turning unto the sanctuary of My nearness and the Kaaba of My reunion, even as ye read in the Bayan. And if He decreed in the Bayan a decree, He desired naught by it save My decree, and if He revealed therein stories, He intended naught from them save My manifestation and the establishment of My Cause. Yet when I came from the dawning-place of authority, those servants who claimed belief in Him and in God’s Messengers of old denied Me. Thus doth God reveal what is hidden in the breasts. Whoso gazeth into the Bayan and pondereth upon it will weep and lament over this Wronged One, the Imprisoned. Say: O people! Reflect upon what hath been revealed in this Revelation from God, the Almighty, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Beloved. Then ponder upon what was revealed in the Books of old which were sent down unto God’s Messengers and the Manifestations of His Cause, that ye may perchance recognize the purpose of God and that ye may find it. And thou, O servant, forget not the Cause of God and His favors which have descended from the heaven of mighty exaltation. Remember within thyself, then remind the people, that through thee perchance dead souls may be quickened. Drink thou the Kawthar of grace from the hands of the youths in the days of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and be thou of them that are filled with joy. Thus have We commanded thee in truth as a favor from Us unto thee and unto them that are sincere. Glorify on God’s behalf thy brother’s countenance, that his spirit may be renewed through God’s glorification, the Mighty, the Praised. Say: O servant! We love that thou shouldst spend thy days in the remembrance of God and in praise of Him. This is better for thee than that which is witnessed. Speak forth My mention amongst My creatures, that perchance they may walk in the paths of justice. Grieve not over anything, but put thy trust in God, thy Lord, in all matters. Verily, He will be with thee at all times if thou art with Him. Thus hath it been inscribed in the preserved tablets of glory. And the Glory rest upon thee and upon thy brother and upon those whom the might of every oppressor hath not hindered from this purified, sanctified, and extended path.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Grief-Stricken Stranger!</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O Sovereign of Fidelity! Alas, alas, O King of Justice in all creation! Do we see Thee imprisoned in the hands of the most wicked of men, or do we see Thee martyred in the path of God, Lord of all beings? By Thy glory, O Most Exalted Letter ?a, grievous is it to the people of Baha to hear what hath befallen Thee in Thy love for God, Lord of the throne on high and of the earth below. Grievous is it to the Most Great Name to behold the world yet not behold Thee, to hear the clamor of the nations yet not hear Thy cry nor Thy whispered prayer. By God’s life! All things lament Thy tribulations, and the Supreme Pen weepeth between the fingers of the Lord of Names. We testify that he who hath risen to harm Thee is among those who have disbelieved in God throughout all ages, the Lord of the Hereafter and of the former times. Thou art He through whom the brocade of the Book of Fidelity was adorned in the kingdom of creation, and through whom the temple of servitude was embellished among the Manifestations of Names. Perdition unto the people who wronged Thee after the balance of justice was established through Thee in the days of Thy Lord, the Most Glorious. Thus have We mentioned Thee before, and at this hour from My Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>He is the Wronged One!</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O God of Mercy! Thou hast ever consoled Thy servants whom afflictions have touched in Thy days, but today who shall console Thee in this calamity before which all calamities bow down, this sorrow that hath stunned all sorrows? I would see Thee, O Wronged One of the horizons, consoling Thy chosen ones in hardship and tribulation, but from this day who shall console Thee in this anguish that hath transformed the lands and melted hearts? Alas beyond all alas - an alas that hath shaken the world and melted the hearts of nations - to see Thee in such grief that Thou desirest not to hear mention of Paradise, much less to behold what hath been recorded therein of Thy bounties and favors. O Lord! The fire of injustice hath been kindled in the world; where is the light of Thy justice, O Lord of eternity? By Thy glory, O Thou Wronged and Imprisoned One, grievous is it to me to see the temple of justice beneath the talons of tyranny, and grievous is it to me to see the Dayspring of Fidelity in the hands of the wicked. I know not, O my God and God of earth and heaven, whether He hath drunk the cup of martyrdom or remaineth yet subject to the will of those through whom the standards of oppression were raised among all creatures. By Thy sovereignty, O Beloved of existence and Goal of the seen and unseen! Were the eyes of the world to weep and the hearts of nations to burn, it would not suffice for this catastrophe wherein all things hear the outcry of Thy heart and the lamentation of Thy soul. I testify that this is a calamity that can neither be recorded by the pen nor described by the tongue. The matter is in God’s hands, the Lord of all possibility.</p>
<p>He is the Faithful Herald!</p>
<p>O Land of Sad! Where is he who loved God and His chosen ones? Where is he who stood firm in His service in every circumstance? Where is he who shone forth from the horizon of fidelity like the sun rising from the celestial horizon? Where is my trust in thee? Didst thou deliver him into the hands of enemies, or did he sacrifice his soul in the path of God, the Lord of Names? Tell me what the people have done to him through whom God’s Cause was made manifest among the servants and the horizon of loving-kindness dawned in all lands. Tell me truly: Where is the Most Great Trust? Where is he who circled round God, the Lord of the throne on high and of the earth below? Where is that spirit who appeared in human form to serve God, the Lord of destiny?</p>
<p>O Land of Sad! This Tree of Love with its twigs, branches, leaves and fruits crieth out and saith: By Thy beauty, O Lord of Baha and Beloved of Ha, I am powerless to recount what I have witnessed from the enemies. By Thy glory, I am ashamed to relate what the people have done to their Master, their Lord, their Helper and their Strengthener. How can I speak of that which grieveth Thy heart, O Thou Desire of earth and heaven? Whenever I attempt to speak, weeping preventeth me, and Thou art the Knower of secrets and whispered confidences. By Thy glory, O my Sovereign! Were I to be commanded to perish, it would be dearer to me than to mention and recount before Thee that which causeth sorrow in days which Thou hadst made dawning-places of joy for Thy loved ones and daysprings of gladness for the people of Thy realm. This, despite my certitude in the ocean of Thy knowledge, the heaven of Thy will, the penetration of Thy purpose and the all-encompassing nature of Thy power. Would that I had never existed and had not seen Thee grieved, O Lord of nations and Sovereign of eternity!</p>
<p>O Region of Sad! Why do I behold and hear its beauty and roaring, yet see not my she-camel nor hear her moaning? Is she in the garden above the earth or beneath it? O gardens of that city, where is the breeze of God that wafteth over thee, and where is the fruit of God within thee? Hath it been cut off, or hath it fallen? By God, the people are in manifest error. They have slain her after she had given them to drink of the purest milk from the breast of God’s wisdom, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O My Name Ha! We concealed thy station while thou wert in the world due to the weakness of the servants. But when thou didst ascend, We unveiled thee and revealed what thou wert and what God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, had bestowed upon thee. Blessed is he who loved thee, found solace in thee, heard thy call, thy mention and thy praise, and sought thy resting-place and turned toward thy countenance for the sake of God, thy Beloved, thy Purpose and thy Manifestation. Blessed is every seeker who seeketh thy most exalted station and thy most glorious abode, who standeth before thy sepulchre and visiteth thee with what hath been revealed by the Supreme Pen and uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur in the prison of Akka. Joy be to him who remembereth thy days and what appeared from thee in the love of God, thy Lord, and who relateth to the people what befell thee in thy Lord’s Cause. By the life of God, he is of the people of Baha, inscribed in a noble Tablet. O My Name Ha! Thou wert a stranger in thy homeland, a captive in thy place, and oppressed and lonely among the servants. Blessed is the land which God hath made the resting-place of thy body, and the city from whose horizon thou didst shine forth in the days of thy Lord. It behooveth every lover to remember thee with what God hath remembered thee in His Tablets. We beseech Him by thee to send down upon His loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Kind.</p>
<p>He is the Consoler, the Comforter, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>The glory be unto Thee, O Lord of Names, for having transformed joy into grief and pitched the tents of sorrow on Thy Day of Ridvan. By Thy glory, I complain not of what hath befallen me in Thy path. By Thy name, O Lord of Names, tribulation in Thy love is my beloved, my purpose and the companion of my heart. Yet I desire to inform the world of how the Supreme Fruit hath fallen from the Tree of Faithfulness, when it was encompassed by tempestuous winds from the right hand of Thy decree and seized by the power of destiny from Thy pen of execution. O Lord! The ocean of sorrows hath surged in Thy days of joy, and the fragrance of grief hath wafted forth on Thy day of gladness. Hath the star of Thy name Ha set from the horizon of Sad, or is it in the clutches of the enemies who have cast behind their backs Thy Covenant, O Lord of Names?</p>
<p>O Land of Sad! Doth My Name walk upon thy surface, or hath anything of Mine abode within thy bosom? O Earth! How canst thou be at rest when the sea surgeth in thy depths, and how canst thou be radiant when the star hath set from thy horizon? O Land of Sad! Where is thy lamp, and where thy path, and where the spring of God that flowed within thee, and where the Tree beneath whose shade God made a refuge for them that came, for them that sought, and for the wayfaring?</p>
<p>By God, O My Name Ha! At thy calamity the Most Exalted Pen hath halted, and the dwellers of the cities of names have lamented, and the hearts of the near ones have been consumed. Thou art the one who accepted no ransom in thy love for God, the Lord of the hereafter and of the first beginning. Time and again didst thou implore God concerning that which befell thee, and thou art recorded as the supreme sacrifice in the Crimson Book. Do the people imagine they have profited by what they have done? Nay, by the Lord of Names! By God’s life, they have lost with a loss the like of which hath never been witnessed in the knowledge of God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust.</p>
<p>The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness that thou hast gained in thy commerce, and by My life, all gain is thine, for thou hast forsaken the world whose atoms testify to its transience, and hast turned toward the Dayspring of eternity, and hast spent thy spirit in thy longing for the love of God, Creator of the heavens and Lord of Names. By thy life, O My Name! Through thy calamity have the calamities of the near ones been effaced, and through it have wept the eyes of the chosen ones and the Concourse on High, reaching such a state that the Ancient Beauty hath been saddened among the nations. Hadst thou been present before the Wronged One in thy outward temple and witnessed in what state the Most Exalted Pen commemorateth thy tribulations, thou wouldst have wailed as waileth the bereaved in the kingdom of creation. Alas, alas, O My Name Ha! Alas, alas, O My Name that hath dawned from the horizon of faithfulness! Alas, that hath caused oceans to flow from eyes and hath consumed hearts and souls! Thou art the one through whom the tale of sacrifice was renewed and that which was hidden in God’s knowledge and inscribed in His mighty Book was made manifest.</p>
<p>O Land of Sad! Be truthful with Me and tell Me: Where is God’s She-Camel that walked upon thy slopes and grazed in thy meadows? Doth she graze today, or have the enemies of God and of His chosen ones and servants hamstrung her? Then tell Me, did she drink and ascend, or did she ascend to the Most Glorious Horizon and the Supreme Companion while yet thirsting? Then tell Me, was there anyone after her to guard her house and gather her people and calm their agitation and strengthen their hearts and console them in their affliction and comfort them in their sorrow and distress? At this point and at this hour, we must say: The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of all worlds. Verily, we are God’s, and verily, unto Him do we return.</p>
<p>He is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou knowest and seest what hath befallen Thy chosen ones in the days of Thy Manifestation, and beholdest what they have endured in their love for Thee and for Thy good-pleasure. O Lord! The annals of the world proclaim the abasement of Thy loved ones and the glory of Thine enemies, and the books of all nations testify to the weakness of Thy chosen ones and the might of those who have denied Thy signs. Thou hearest, O my God, at this hour, my lamentation and my communion with Thee, my remembrance and my supplication, voiced by them that are nigh unto Thee among Thy creation and them that have recognized Thy unity among Thy creatures. By Thy glory, O Sovereign of the Kingdom of might and Dominion of heaven! I am assured that abasement in Thy path is a glory that cannot be compared with the glory of those that dwell on earth, and that the fire of Thy love is a light that cannot be obscured by the veils of the nations. Even should I quaff, O my God, at every moment the cup of tribulation from the hands of the enemies, the thirst of my longing and the ardor of my desire would not be quenched. Verily, he who hath drunk the choice wine of Thy love and been seized with the intoxication of the wine of Thy knowledge, nothing on earth can dismay him, nor can any affair divert his gaze from the horizon of Thy manifestation, Thy Most Glorious Beauty, and Thy most exalted and sublime station. Verily, My Most Exalted Pen desireth to raise at all times its cry, its call, and its lament in this calamity which hath caused the denizens of Paradise and the dwellers of the highest Paradise to weep, and it hath reached such a state that the tongue of the Manifestation of Thy Cause, the Ocean of Thy knowledge, and the Dayspring of Thy Revelation lamenteth over it in manifestation of His grace, His mercy and His faithfulness.</p>
<p>O thou who bearest the name of ?a! Thou art in the highest Paradise, thy head adorned with the crown of thy Lord’s favor, the Lord of all names, while Thy loved ones are in such grief that the clouds weep for them night and day. Wilt thou unveil the face of Thy Cause, or conceal it as thy Lord hath concealed it in His wisdom? Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing. Through thee was manifested the Most Great Sacrifice, and its decree was established among the nations. O thou who bearest the name of ?a! By God! Through thee hath shone forth the horizon of faithfulness and appeared that whereby God’s Cause, the Creator of the heavens, hath been spread abroad. Blessed is the eye that hath wept for thy tribulations, and the ear that hath heard thy praise, and the face that hath turned toward thee, and the soul that hath hastened until it reached thy resting-place - that station which hath been honored by thy noble body and thy sacred and glorious temple. By God’s life! Hearts have melted at thy calamity and livers have been rent asunder at thy affliction.</p>
<p>O Land of Sad! I adjure thee by the Beloved to tell Me: Hath the fragrance of the Beloved been cut off from thee - that fragrance whereby the scent of the garment was diffused among the people of holiness? And doth He lie prostrate beneath the claws of every ungodly one who hath denied God and His signs, and turned away from His countenance and His sovereignty? O Breeze of Sad! Hast thou come from the presence of the Beloved to the loved ones with tidings whereat spirits would rejoice, or with news that would cause hearts to melt? O breeze of My land and My soul! I perceive not from thee the fragrance of him who loved Me, as though he had taken flight from the branch of this world to the Most Exalted Companion and the Most Glorious Horizon. O thou who bearest My name! Blessed is the eye that hath wept for thy tribulations, whereby he who beareth the name of ?a crieth out in the land of ?aff, saying: “O bearer of the name of ?a! By thy life! Through thy calamity have my calamities, my sorrows, my grief and my affliction been renewed.”</p>
<p>O land of the City! Remember what befell Him and His brother when they appeared before the assembly of the tyrannical ones who found not the fragrance of justice and arose in oppression. By God! Through them was established the Word of God which issued from the mouth of the Divine Will upon the throne of manifestation. He spoke, and His word is the truth: “I and those in Paradise, by the Most Great Truth, yearn for a soul that hath been martyred in His path.” Thus did the Truth speak and that which was hidden in God’s knowledge was revealed. My tongue beareth witness in the kingdom of Mine utterance that they were martyred in My path, and for them did My heart and My pen lament, as did those who circle round My throne and soar in the atmosphere of My nearness and drink the choice wine of My favors from the hand of My bounty. O My Name and My loved ones! Though the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Glorious Pavilion have bewailed your tragedy, yet doth the Wronged One praise and thank God for having enabled you to recognize the Dawning-Place of His Cause and for having raised your station to such a degree that the Most Exalted Pen grieveth for you in this most sublime station. Blessed is the soul that hath turned unto you, and the heart that hath won your love, and the seeker that hath sought your abode, and the wayfarer that hath entered your land and held fast unto your cord and visited your resting-place. By the life of God! They are accounted among the triumphant and are reckoned with them that draw nigh unto God in His Book, the Mighty, the Most High, the Most Great. Praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. To God do we belong, and to Him shall we return.</p>
<p>In My Name, the Glorious, the Bountiful</p>
<p>O Land of Sad! Where is that Greatest Sacrifice for which no ransom was accepted in the path of God, the Lord of all beings? And where are they who were martyred for love of this Youth, at Whose appearance the idols were shattered - they who pronounced judgment against the trusted ones of God, the Lord of the worlds? O Branch of My Tree! Where is My Dove that warbled and cooed and sang? Hath it soared to the Supreme Companion or have the wrongdoers seized it with the talons of hatred between earth and heaven? Tell Me, and be not of them that remain silent. Where are the brilliant stars and the luminous planets and the known months and manifest days and radiating lights? By God! They have set and disappeared and been veiled and returned, yet the people are in manifest dissension. O My Ridvan! Why do I not see thy birds and hear their songs, and why do I not see My dove and hear its melodies? Is it in this vain life or hath it flown to the eternal Paradise? Tell Me and be not of the patient ones. O Great Master! Long have been Thy sorrows, which have bewildered the hearts of Thy chosen ones, and the people of Thy pavilion have lamented. By Thy glory! Thy call hath not ceased, nor Thy remembrance at dawn. I hear Thy yearning in the morning and Thy moaning at sunrise and Thy cry and lamentation at eventide. Have mercy upon Thy servants and loved ones. I bear witness, O My Beloved, that martyrdom in Thy path was the hope of Thy Prophets and trusted ones. The Point of the Bayan, Who was martyred in Thy path, hath testified to this, saying: “O Remnant of God! I have sacrificed my all for Thee and have accepted revilement in Thy path, and have desired naught save martyrdom in Thy love.” Verily, he who attaineth unto this most exalted, most exalted station hath attained unto all good in the world to come and in this world, and Thou art the True Witness, and verily Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O thou who speakest! Hold thy tongue, for thou hast transgressed thy bounds. Repent unto God and be of them that return. Dost thou question the doings of Him Who should not be questioned about what He doeth? Seek refuge in God Who created and fashioned thee, and be not of the heedless. Thou hast not reached even the shore of one of the oceans of thy Lord’s wisdom, how much less its depths and billows and what lieth concealed in His knowledge, the Protector of all worlds. He is the One by Whom was raised the banner of ‘He doeth what He willeth’ and unfurled the standard of ‘He shall not be asked of His doings’ above every lofty flag.</p>
<p>O thou who seeketh the Spirit! Leave off His mention and what is mentioned in the kingdom of creation, then set thy face toward the Ultimate Goal and the Most Exalted Habitation, the Station which is adorned with the lights of the Celestial Realm and honored by the glances of God’s favor, the Sovereign of the kingdom of earth and heaven. We desired thee to be the first seeker and the first visitor. Go forth with the fragrances of the garment from before the Dawning-Place of Sanctity to the land wherein appeared the Most Great Martyrdom and the supreme sacrifices. We counsel thee to be vigilant, for the wolf howleth and the serpent hisseth. When thou approachest the city and beholdest its traces, pause and say:</p>
<p>O City of the Beloved! Where is the ocean of God’s love and the ships that sailed upon it? Where are thy flowing springs and thy radiant, rising stars? Where are thy lofty, luminous crowns and thy brilliant, shining moons? Tell of what the oppressors did to them. Can the pen flow or are all pens powerless to recount it? The matter is in the hands of God, the Lord of all beings. O City of the Beloved! By God’s life, what they endured from the oppressors shall not go unrequited. To this beareth witness the Knower of the seen and unseen, Who grieveth for His loved ones and chosen ones, manifesting His grace, His faithfulness, His care and His favors. By His very truth, they are in magnificent gain, though the people be in evident doubt.</p>
<p>Then turn toward the sacred shrines and exalted stations, and when thou hast recognized and found and attained their presence, pause and say:</p>
<p>May the first light that shone from the horizon of the face of your Lord, the Creator of heaven, be upon you, O manifestations of faithfulness and dawning-places of the names in the kingdom of creation! I testify that through you were raised the banners of victory and the standards of guidance, the horizon of steadfastness was illumined and the breeze of God wafted among all creatures. Through you was renewed the garment of martyrdom and there appeared that which bewildered minds and hearts. You are they who sacrificed what you possessed, your souls, every member of your bodies, and every vein in your flesh in the path of God, your Beloved and your Goal. You are they whom no oppressor’s tyranny, no censurer’s blame, nor the power of any who turned away from God deterred, when He came with sovereignty encompassing all in the heavens and earth. I testify that by your tribulation the Concourse on High lamented, and the dwellers of the Most Glorious Pavilion, and the tongue of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, spoke forth. Before all believers: “We are God’s, and to Him shall we return.” And in all conditions, praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>Thereafter, ask of God whatsoever thou desirest of His bounty. He is indeed the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great.</p>
<p>O Friend! By the life of God, the episode of the sacrifice has recurred, and what lies hidden in God’s knowledge, the Lord of all worlds. The bird of fidelity has winged its flight from the branch of the world to the Divine Lote-Tree by reason of what the hands of the oppressors have wrought. We testify that he dwells in a joy unequaled by the joy of all creation, while his loved ones are in such grief that all things lament their condition. Thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing. By God! They have profited in their transaction while the oppressors are in manifest loss. Did Husayn lose when he offered up his spirit in the path of God, or did those who wronged him by following every remote transgressor? Oppression has reached such a point that the tongue is powerless to describe it, and beyond it lies all reckoning by any knowing one. They have kindled a fire whose flames shall not be quenched in the world. Thus does He inform thee, from Whose presence is the knowledge of all things in a Clear Book.</p>
<p>O Friend! Observe how manifest have become the truth of Truth and the misguidance of falsehood. All bear witness that from that Wronged One was manifested the utmost love, kindness and care toward all peoples, and no act that might cause mischief or corruption ever proceeded from Him. How many were the destitute strangers whom He assisted in times of hardship. To this testifies every truthful one, and beyond him thy Lord, the All-Informed. Should anyone reflect upon him and what appeared from him of the favors of his Lord, he would observe with the eye of certainty that in what transpired there was and shall be a great wisdom. The Most Great Sacrifice and Supreme Offering have been manifested in this Mighty Cause. When they appeared in Iraq before the Presence, the utmost favor was shown them from the Source of Command, to such an extent that certain souls spoke in the wilderness of idle fancies. Then God, through His pervading might, exalted that Lote-Tree to a station none knows save His All-Knowing Self, and sent down upon him blessings and mercy from His presence. He is, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful. Various writings from him were presented before the Throne, and he beseeched God, his Lord, the Master of the last and the first, to ordain for him the Most Great Martyrdom. By thy life, O Friend! Through his calamity all calamities were erased. To this thy Lord, the Wronged, the Stranger, bears witness. We have sent down for him from the heaven of grace that which equals not the kingdom of earth and heaven, and God shall soon cause to grow what He has planted in the soil of the Bayan. He is, verily, the Almighty Whom the hosts of the world and the ranks of the oppressors cannot withstand.</p>
<p>O Khalil! The divine Lote-Tree, which hath been planted by the hand of the Sovereign Will in the blessed and goodly soil, hath been watered by the blood of them that are sincere and monotheistic. Soon shall there become manifest in the earth, through the deeds of the oppressors, that which was destined. Doth the oppressor imagine that God is heedless of that which he hath wrought? Nay, by His Self, the One Who overshadoweth the worlds! By His truth, He shall assuredly manifest in the earth that which He hath revealed in the Book, as is clearly witnessed by him who possesseth insight from God, the Lord of the worlds. Observe the Suriy-i-Ra’is and other Tablets. By God’s life, thy heart and the hearts of them that are endued with understanding shall rejoice at that which hath been sent down therein. Were He to desire, He could seize all who are on earth through a single word from Him, yet He manifesteth His Cause through the wisdom that was hidden in His all-encompassing knowledge. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of power that were the world to possess any worth, the Ancient Beauty would not have dwelt for numbered years in the Most Great Prison. Man, so long as he is in this world, is in truth and ever shall be in the throes of death, save for those detached hearts that behold all things with the eye of God. God willing, your honor should, according to your capacity, instill tranquility and assurance in illumined hearts, that serenity might possess them after agitation, and joy after sorrow. Thus doth command thee He Who remembereth thee in this exalted station. O Khalil! A momentous affair hath occurred in the world, though greater than this hath been made manifest, as thou thyself dost witness and attest. However, as the Hand of Power had preserved it for a long time and then suddenly this irrevocable matter was revealed, it hath caused lamentation, weeping and trembling. Yet with thy Lord is that which shall gladden hearts after this great sorrow. Say: This is a testimony whose traces have penetrated the world; God shall soon reveal it in truth. He, verily, hath power over whatsoever He willeth. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have hearkened unto thy word concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>He is the One Who gazeth before His Face</p>
<p>O people of the cities and villages! Hearken unto that which the Tongue uttereth in the Kingdom of Utterance from One Who hath caused all things to speak that there is none other God but He, the Single, the All-Informed. He it is Who hath sent down the Books and dispatched the Messengers, that there is none other God but He, the All-Watching, the All-Wise. Every thing hath succeeded in hearkening to the Call save every aggressive sinner, and every eye hath beheld the horizon of God, the Most Glorious, save every heedless and remote one. By God! The Supreme Horizon hath appeared and the Sovereign of Destiny proclaimeth and saith:</p>
<p>O concourse of men! The Day is come and the moon is cleft asunder, and all are gathered to a new resurrection. The hidden is made manifest and the treasured is revealed, and the Promised One hath come from the heaven of destiny closer than the twinkling of an eye, yet the people are in evident delusion. They behold the sun, yet ask “Is this the sun?” They witness the signs, yet say “This is naught but mighty sorcery.” Thus hath the matter been decreed in the Book, while the people of the veil remain in strange doubt.</p>
<p>O loved ones of the All-Merciful in all lands! The Wronged One adjureth you by the Beloved of all possibility, Who speaketh in the kingdom of utterance, that ye be not unfaithful regarding people’s possessions. Be ye the trustees of God in His lands and the daysprings of truthfulness in His domains. Blessed is he who hath heeded God’s counsel and is of them that act.</p>
<p>Such treachery hath appeared in exile as hath melted My liver, caused Mine eyes to overflow, made My inner being lament, and constricted My breast. By God’s life! Sleep hath fled from the eyes of Baha by reason of what hath befallen Him in this white land. To this all things bear witness, yet the people are heedless. The rock hath cried out at My tribulation and the Divine Lote-Tree hath lamented My distress. By God! My sorrow is not for Myself but for the Cause of God, Lord of all worlds. All sorrows are for him who cannot recount what hath touched him of misfortunes and tribulations in this noble station.</p>
<p>We hear falsehood yet remain silent, while the liar supposeth the matter is confused, though We find him in manifest untruth. O My loved ones! Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God and array your temples in the raiment of trustworthiness, uprightness and truthfulness. Thus doth the Lord of creation command you in a preserved tablet.</p>
<p>Sorrows have increased at this time as We behold the embodiment of love and those with him under the claws of hatred from the hosts of the oppressors. Say: O God of Names and Creator of earth and heaven! We beseech Thee by this martyr who sacrificed himself in these days to manifest Thy Cause and exalt Thy Word, to send down upon Thy loved ones and chosen ones that which will preserve them from the claws of heedlessness and doubt. Then give them to drink, from the hand of Thy bounty, the Kawthar of certitude. Verily Thou art the Giver, the Bestower. There is no God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>He is the One Who remembereth in sorrow</p>
<p>O Land of Sad (Isfahan)! Remember what the people did to the family of the Messenger, and what befell the children of the Maiden from thy people. O Land of Sad! The Sun of Hijaz asketh thee about its family, and the Virgin Maiden about her sons and daughter. Did the oppressors cast her grave into the well of darkness, or did they drag her forth with ropes of hatred to another calamity? By the life of the Beloved! The powers of heaven were shaken by this calamitous catastrophe. Alas, alas! The Luminary of Batha lamenteth in the Most Exalted Concourse for what befell His family from the manifestations of hatred.</p>
<p>O people of Sad! By God, ye have committed that which hath bewildered the sources of vainglory and the daysprings of tyranny throughout all possibility. Judge fairly: by what proof did ye slay those through whom the Cause of the All-Merciful was spread in the East and West of the earth? Alas, alas! Through you was the Ark of the Messenger broken and the progeny of the Maiden drowned. Through you was joy transformed to sorrow, and darkness encompassed all in existence, save whom the All-Merciful willed.</p>
<p>O people of Sad! Hearken unto that which Muhammad, the Apostle of God, calleth out to you from the Most Sublime Horizon. O people of tyranny and wickedness! Where is Hasani, who was aflame with the fire of the love of God in the Kingdom of Creation, and was adorned with the ornament of faithfulness between earth and heaven? And where is Husayni, who accepted not ransom in the path of God, the Lord of all men? By My life, O company of evil ones, no excuse remaineth for you, nor room for any justification by saying “The righteous are God’s and the wicked are mine.” Do ye imagine yourselves to be believers, and do ye reckon yourselves among the people of the Furqan? Nay, by the Self of the All-Merciful! Every learned one who was adorned with the mantle of grace hath bewailed your deeds, and every man of wisdom who was invested with justice hath cried out because of your actions. The lamentation of the Concourse on High hath been raised by reason of your tyranny, and the cry of all things hath been lifted up because of that which your hands have wrought. Ye read the Qur’an, yet deny its Source and Him Who revealed it; ye acknowledge My Message, yet slay My sons and turn away from Him Who sent Me. O company of hatred, ye have bewildered Me, nay, all things created by the Word of God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting! O Mariner of the Sea! Where are thy ships? Have they been shattered by the rocks of unbelief and dissension, or have they been drowned by the tempests of tyranny and hypocrisy? Have they sailed from the cities of bodies to the gardens of spirits, or have they migrated from the wilderness of separation and remoteness to the station of nearness and holiness and reunion? O Lord of the world! By Thy might and sovereignty, I am unable to mention that which hath befallen them from the winds of oppression. I myself am ashamed to recount what I have seen and known. Thou knowest what I know, and I know not what Thou knowest. Thou art, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Yet I shall utter a word to manifest my submission to Thy binding Command and my obedience to Thy firm Decree: The Nightingale hath taken flight because the croaking of the raven hath been raised. The Command is God’s, the One, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>O My Name! Upon thee be My Glory! The letter from My Name Jamal, upon him be My Glory, was received and likewise heard. In truth, this world is not worthy nor capable of being the arena for the steed of the endeavors of God’s chosen ones. O Jamal! Consider thou the afflictions that have befallen this Wronged One, that what hath come upon thee may seem trivial in comparison. Look from what hath befallen thee to what hath befallen God. The carpet of this world is truly not worthy of joy and delight. Today, remembrance of God and attachment to Him was and is all that matters. Turn thy gaze from the deeds of men and fix it upon the deeds of God and what hath appeared from Him. These two days, the world of possibility was not and is not worthy of such mention and utterance.</p>
<p>In the prison of ?a, as all have heard and know, We were in fetters and chains for four months, and Our companions were mostly thieves and highwaymen. And as for food - bread that resembled that of the Sudanese people. By the life of God, in the early days, even that was not to be had! This Wronged One was brought bareheaded and barefoot in chains from Niyavaran to the prison of Tihran. That which is beyond human endurance was inflicted. Yet despite these afflictions which ye have seen, heard and know of, the tongue remained engaged in praise, the heart illumined with the greatest joy, and in prison this blessed verse was uttered: “He is sufficient unto me and sufficient unto all things. God sufficeth as protector.” All assured and tranquil souls uttered the same, and when their voices were raised, the prisoners would become bewildered and perplexed.</p>
<p>This Wronged One was repeatedly imprisoned, and all have heard of the afflictions that befell Us in the land of Mim. They paraded Us through the streets, and one day they delivered this Wronged One into the hands of the tyrannical divines. God alone knoweth what they did and said and what befell Us. For months they applied ointments and treated the wounds inflicted. Beyond all this, consider the oppression and tyranny of My brother and his followers. Wherever We went, before many days had passed, he would come and dwell in perfect comfort and honor with his known women companions - as all have heard and know - protected beneath the pavilions of protection. Yet they call him the wronged one and attribute injustice to God, exalted be His glory!</p>
<p>In brief, throughout all days We stood before the faces of the people and raised up the Cause of God to such a degree that both East and West of the earth heard and understood according to their capacity. Yet when the Sun of Glory dawned from the heaven of divine Will, they arose against its abasement and spoke such calumnies as had no like or equal, and not one soul among those heedless ones spoke with justice. Glory be to God! By order of the Sultan and the officials of the sublime state and Russia, We proceeded to Zawra. If this Wronged One was an oppressor, why did My brother proceed to that land and enter Our house? Furthermore, during the journey toward the Great City, he arrived in Mosul before Us and awaited Our arrival. Say: O people! Judge with fairness that which hath come to pass, that ye may distinguish the oppressor. I swear by the Sun of Proof which in this moment riseth from the horizon of the heaven of utterance! Mashriqu’l-Akhavi did not deem himself worthy of this station, but through the instigation of Siyyid Muhammad Isfahani and another soul, he chose this abasement for himself and for the Cause. The earth of God is vast and there are many other cities and regions - why this turning to the shadow of the Wronged One, and for what reason? Reflect, O people, and be of the fair-minded! A Tablet was sent in his name to the Most Holy and Exalted Presence of the Herald. By the life of God, that Holy One became so enkindled that mention of it transcends the realm of existence. Likewise were other Tablets sent, both to the Herald and to various regions. The utterance of this Wronged One stands forth among the words of the peoples like the sun, clear and manifest. Say: Return, that ye may know, and be not of the oppressors. In days when all were hidden in fear, this Wronged One appeared with utmost power and spoke with most eloquent utterance. Neither the arrows of destiny nor the swords of tribulation prevented Him. When the light of the Cause was raised up, there occurred what all have heard and seen. Through all conditions We have been thankful and content. O Jamal, upon thee be My glory! Erase the book of sorrows and with fresh clarity reflect on what hath been mentioned. He will open before thy face the gates of joy and gladness, of glory and delight. Verily thy Lord is powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is. Repeatedly hast thou mentioned the name of God, and He and all who circle round Him bear witness to God’s grace, bounty and kindness towards thee. Take the cup of joy from the hand of the bounty of My Most Glorious Name, then drink therefrom in spite of every caviling liar and every heedless doubter. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon those who love thee and hearken to thy word concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of Lords.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who is unique in His might, singular in His grandeur, and sanctified above the intimations of creation and the conditions of humanity - He through Whom one hears from the waves of the ocean of utterance that the All-Merciful hath come with power and sovereignty, and from the rushing of the winds of explanation that the Proof hath appeared and the Intended One hath come with a Cause that hath conquered all in the realm of possibilities. Exalted be His greatness and exalted be His dominion! The very essence of power hath confessed its powerlessness before the manifestations of His power, and the very essence of strength hath acknowledged its weakness before the evidences of His strength. He is the One of Whom all the books of the world have spoken, declaring that none can be described save through Him, and all the Messengers whom God hath sent unto the peoples have testified that none can be mentioned except by Him. He is the Single One Who cannot be known through singleness, and the Unique One Who cannot be described through uniqueness. He is a surging, wave-filled ocean wherein neither the ships of mystic knowledge, nor the vessels of utterance, nor the boats of remembrance can sail. Its waves arise not from winds but from a motion which none hath understood save Him. Verily He is the All-Knowing, verily He is the All-Informed. This is the motion that appeared from the stirring of the Primal Word - glorified be its Originator, its Speaker and its Manifestor. The servant testifieth in this station that the very essence of knowledge was ignorant of this atmosphere wherein no sound of the wings of the birds of utterance hath ever been heard. Verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful, the Bestower.</p>
<p>God willing, may they shine as the morning star from the horizon of divine love, brilliant and manifest. We have mentioned him in terms that nothing can equal, and through which his remembrance shall endure throughout the perpetuity of My mighty, exalted Kingdom. O servant, they have praised the Truth in most excellent utterance. God willing, may they ever be the recipients of God’s special favors.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant praises the Goal of all the world for that which the tongue of his nature hath spoken, which was acceptable before the Throne. Praise be unto Him, again praise be unto Him. All who circle round the Throne convey their greetings to his honor.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about the quorum, whether permission is granted to the poor or not, when this was submitted, He said: We give you permission, but it is not generally permissible. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I presented mention of your honor to the most pure and luminous presence of the Divine Branches - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - and all of them, with utmost grace and kindness, conveyed their most glorious and resplendent greetings. Praise be to God, mention of your honor has been and continues to be made in the Most Holy Court and among others who circle round in this land. This evanescent servant requests that you convey expressions of his utter nothingness and evanescence to the Afnan who are present in that land, especially to those gentlemen who have returned from the Desired Land. In truth, whatever may be submitted, even if it were to fill numerous volumes, would be insufficient in view of this servant’s burning love. However, your honor knows that there is much work, especially in these days. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that He may assist this evanescent one, despite his inability, weakness and nothingness, to accomplish this momentous task. Without God’s grace and His mercy and compassion, this servant has been and is as one non-existent, and has been and is as nothing.</p>

<p>Praise be to God that thou hast attained, and continuest to attain, to that which beseemeth His near and sincere servants, for thou art possessed of a noble character and an exalted station, and art nourished by food that hath not altered its taste. Blessed be ye and those who have attained to what ye have attained and are sustained as ye are sustained. And praise be to Him Who hath bestowed upon you and us the blessing of unity and guided us to His straight path.</p>
<p>Furthermore, should that beloved one send anything to the region of Syria, convey on behalf of this servant greetings, praise, remembrance and glory to my true brother and spiritual beloved, Aqa Muhammad-Rida, upon him be 966 [the Glory of God], and give him the glad-tidings of the Lord’s grace and favors. Praise be to God, mention is made of them, and their place and station in the Pillar and Station are evident and manifest. They have not been and are not absent for a moment, for from the right side of the heart, a firm place hath been assigned and established for them, and before the eye is their manifest station. How then could they vanish from sight?</p>
<p>In any case, the grape vines and trees they sent before and after arrived, and due to the abundance of rain and severity of winds, were placed in the soil. During these two or three days they were taken out and planting began in their name, as the true Planter and Cultivator. This year the intensity of rain disrupted the order and work of tree planting. Such is the decree of our Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. For instance, the olive trees were cut two months from their location and it was not possible to place them in the ground due to the mud. In any case, now engaged in planting, we shall see what the grace of the true Cultivator and Director will bring to pass. As He, the Beloved One, hath said: He may cause it to grow or burn it. The command is in His hand and within His mighty grasp. He has expressed the desire for [fruit from] Qamsar. If those varieties can be found, there is no harm in the bitterness of their pits. The kind and variety should be good, delicious, fragrant and juicy. If with these qualities the pit is also sweet, that would be excellence upon excellence and light upon light. This servant was greatly saddened by the sent trees, for the giver had given whatever was in his garden out of love and affection, but the long duration [of the journey] and the strong eastern winds completely dried them on the way, to the extent that moisture was drawn from the very wood itself. Their restoration now lies with God, glorified be His majesty. He has given and gives life to decayed bones, but if at grafting time it becomes possible, let them send cuttings. It may be possible to graft them here onto apricot trees or others. Likewise, if the superior almond apricot becomes available - all matters depend upon the will and desire of the true Director and Creator. Whatever He ordains, the means for it have been and will be provided. Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Rida himself has written that when fruits appear and ripen, they will send whatever fruit is good, desirable and considered among the pure things, in whatever way possible. This too depends on God’s will. In any case, write these matters to them or send this very paper to them. Perhaps this servant too will later be enabled to write a response. Verily God is the Confirmer, the Helper, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Peace be upon you and upon him and upon God’s righteous servants.</p>

The tongues of all those present, of the pilgrims and travelers, are engaged in offering praise and thanksgiving to that luminous point of the heart. This is a great bounty, a mighty feast and a momentous glad-tiding. This servant, clinging to the hem of His mercy and holding fast to the cord of His grace, beseecheth his Lord to open before your face the gates of all good things. Verily He is the Fulfiller of needs, the Revealer of verses and the Manifestor of clear proofs. There is no God but Him, the Lord of all names and attributes. I beseech Him, exalted be He, by His Prophets and Messengers, and by Him through Whom God united the hearts of His servants, revealed His sovereignty, made Himself known to all and taught them the word of His oneness, whereby the foundation of religion and God’s mighty Cause were made firm - and by His family and companions, the lions of warfare among mankind and the daysprings of His power and sovereignty in the realm of creation, through whom His straight path was made manifest and the gate of grace and bounty was opened to all in the heavens and on earth - to assist His Afnan in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to aid him with the hosts of the seen and the unseen. Verily He is the Lord of creation, there is no God but Him, the One Who through His exalted Word hath power over all things, and He is the Commander of whatsoever He willeth and the Ruler in the beginning and in the end.</p>
<p>The blessed Tablet which in truth was a crown upon the brow of the receptive and fair-minded ones arrived and opened the gates of joy, delight and gladness before the face of this evanescent servant - an opening that shall know no closing nor reach an end. After its reading and perusal, I approached the Presence and attained the honor of His hearing. He said: “Praise be to God that in these days when grief over the deeds and words of the claimants to love hath encompassed all, mention of the Afnan, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, is the cause of joy, delight and gladness. We beseech God, exalted be He, to guide His servants thereby and to give to drink therefrom the Living Waters to all in His lands, and through it to spread abroad His traces.” O Afnan! Upon thee be the peace of God, His mercy and His loving-kindness. The smoke mentioned in the Book of God hath seemingly appeared in these days. The fire of greed, lust, passion and calumny hath so seized the oppressive and slanderous souls that its smoke hath darkened the realm of justice and truthfulness. God shall soon seize them through His sovereignty. He, verily, is the severest of avengers. Convey My remembrances to the son who hath ever been and still is remembered. God willing, may they engage with joy and fragrance in that which is accounted as worship. May not the tribulations of exile sadden him, for he dwelleth nearby and thus the ruling of homeland applieth to him. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the loved ones in that land. Each one is mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. We beseech God to ordain for them that which will draw them nigh unto Him in all conditions. He, verily, is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>Thus endeth what was revealed. His is the praise, the bounty, the grace and the glory. In all conditions the honored Afnan, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, is mentioned in the Presence and is the recipient of special favors. If the false claimants would not cause distress and would not commit that which grieveth him - I beseech Him to protect your honor from their evil and their schemes. Verily He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. His Will hath prevailed over the wills of His creation, and His Purpose hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>As for the matter of the tea, it arrived in accordance with the blessed letter and truly it was good and desirable and attained the honor of acceptance. For some time tea of such excellence had not been seen. At the time of its use, they mentioned concerning the honored Afnan of China, upon him be 966 [the Glory of God], that which the treasures of the world cannot equal. In truth, it is the Most Great Favor and the Supreme Grace - the confirmation of the Purpose of all worlds - that He hath aided him in a service whose reward and fruit are lasting and eternal, having no end. For from such matters as these the fragrance of love and devotion is diffused, and thus it was and is worthy of mention and fitting to be declared. His honor had also from the early days of the Cause turned towards it and attained the honor of the presence and meeting. They have acknowledged and confessed that which hath shone forth and risen from the horizon of God’s Will, the Lord of the worlds. This servant beseecheth his Lord to preserve his honor and aid them. Verily He is the Helper, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>I convey greetings to those present, especially to the honored Afnan and the son - upon them be the peace of God and His loving-kindness. For each one I seek the waters of the All-Merciful’s mercy and heavenly sustenance. Verily He fulfilleth the needs of all who ask. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon the son and upon those who love you and upon God’s unified servants. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O My name Mahdi! Upon thee be My glory, My remembrance and My praise! Blessed art thou for having fulfilled My Covenant, spread My remembrance, arisen to extol Me and serve Me amongst My servants. We created all to attain Our presence, call upon Our Name and turn to Our Countenance. Yet some were deprived of My mercy, strayed from My path and failed to answer My call. Blessed is the distant one who remembers Me. By God, he is among those who stand upon My carpet and attain My presence. And among them is one who mentioned Me, whom We made one of the twigs of My Lote-Tree and leaves of My Tree.</p>
<p>Know then, O My servant who gazeth upon My face, that the servant hath attained the presence of his Sovereign and his letter was presented. When it was presented, the winds of My mercy were stirred and the ocean of My bounty surged. Thus did We cast upon the people of possibility the pearls of utterance through the grace of the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who attaineth unto them, recognizeth their value and preserveth them from those who are unworthy.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Thy mention hath been made before the Countenance. We beseech God to assist thee in all conditions and to aid thee in the beginning and the end. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>Although restraint of the Pen is necessary due to the heedlessness of the nations, for the protection of God’s loved ones, yet through His grace, from the Fountainhead of His Will, the pure Water floweth according to measure. Blessed is he who drinketh, detached from all the worlds.</p>
<p>Among the letters received was one from one of the Afnan, upon him be the Glory of God, to whom all things testify of his love for his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We have sent through the Trustworthy One to him and those around him that which will gladden the eyes of the mystics and cause the hearts of those who have turned to God to soar.</p>
<p>Thus doth the Supreme Pen address him from the direction of the white dome of the Ultimate Tree: “O thou who bearest My Name! Blessed art thou for having inhaled the fragrance of My raiment, turned to My face, spoken My praise, sought My presence, taken refuge in My sovereignty, heard My call from My Kingdom, answered Me amongst My servants, and soared in the atmosphere of My love, circling round My will. All this is from My confirmations, My care, My grace, My generosity and My mercy.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who turneth unto thee, heareth from thee the mention of thy Lord, and boweth before thee purely for My sake, hoping for My loving-kindness which We have sent down in the scrolls of My power and the tablets of My favor.</p>
<p>We have learned of the calamity that befell you, whereat tears flowed and sighs ascended to God, the Lord of Names and Attributes. By My life! In this ye have followed your Lord. We sacrificed one of the Branches for the exaltation of the Cause of your Lord, the All-Merciful. At the time they were washing him, My tongue was speaking between earth and heaven in remembrance of your Lord, the Most High, and My pen was flowing with that which caused the breezes of the All-Merciful to waft among all possibility. We have sent it to you. Blessed is he who considereth it and reflecteth upon that which hath appeared from the Command of his Lord, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>Say to his relatives: Grieve not for him. He is with Us and will continue soaring in the atmosphere of the mercy of his Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Through his mention We have adorned the Tablets, for We found in his heart what We found only in a few numbered souls. Blessed is he, and his father, and those who are with him from among My Afnan. Soon We shall send down for each one that which is better for them than all that hath been created in the heavens and earth. Verily, he is alive in My horizon, for We recognized in him what none knoweth save your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>God willing, those related to the Blessed Tree should not be saddened by this new calamity. In truth, they have followed the example of the Truth, for in all days calamities descended like rain upon the Beauty of Divine Unity. Were the exalted stations specially reserved for that Bird of the heaven of divine love to be mentioned, all would raise their hands in supplication toward the Most Exalted Horizon. We beseech God to aid all to that which He loveth.</p>
<p>Verily, He is living in My horizon, for We have known from Him what none has discovered save your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. God willing, the kindred of the Blessed Tree should not be sorrowful at this new tribulation. In truth, they have followed the path of God, for in all days tribulations have rained down like torrential showers upon the Countenance of the Divine Unity. Were mention to be made of the sublime stations reserved for that Bird of the heaven of divine love, all hands of supplication would be raised toward the Most Exalted Horizon. We beseech God to aid all to achieve that which He loves and with which He is well-pleased.</p>
<p>The mention of his honor Aqa Shaykh ?adiq, upon him be the Glory of God, which was in your letter, was made before the Divine Presence. Previously a wondrous and glorious Tablet was sent especially for him. Say: O ?adiq! Blessed art thou for having drunk the choice wine sealed from the hand of the mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Nothing hath prevented thee from the remembrance of thy Lord. By My life! This is a praiseworthy station. It behooveth thee today to arise and say: O people! Follow Him by Whose praise all things speak, and Whose proof hath encompassed both the unseen and the visible. Pass by with the fragrance of thy Lord’s raiment, the All-Merciful, amongst all who dwell within the realm of possibility, that hearts and minds may be set ablaze through thee. We have made mention of thee in numerous Tablets. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Loving. Say: O people! Forsake the world, for your Lord, the Lord of all names, hath come. Do ye imagine it will profit you in aught? Nay, by My Name, through which all who have entered the garment of existence were stirred! It will profit you only for a limited number of days. Cast it behind you, turning to that which your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath desired on this Day wherein the Sun of Revelation hath shone forth and the stars have fallen. O ?adiq! We have sprinkled upon thee from the ocean of My mercy, lest sorrow overtake thee in the remembrance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and that thou mayest speak forth His Name with wisdom and utterance, that perchance the peoples of the worlds may abandon what they possess and hold fast to the cord of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Beloved. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee yet again, then inhale therefrom the fragrances of thy Lord’s raiment, the Knower of the unseen.</p>

<p>He is God, the King, the All-Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Holy!</p>
<p>I call upon Thee now, O my God, at this time when the lamp of oneness is kindled in the niche of white light, and this eternal candle melts in the crimson lamp, and the heart is consumed by the fire of grief in the liver of Baha, and the cock of the Cause cries out in the most exalted Kingdom, and crimson tears flow upon sallow cheeks. For though he writes before Thee with the pen of ink upon the green tablet, yet in the secret of his heart he writes with the pen of blood upon pieces of his liver that which none can hear in the nearest dominion. Therefore have the breezes of the Spirit been cut off from the city of eternity, and the fruits have fallen from the Tree of Paradise, and the branches of the Lote-Tree of the uttermost boundary have been broken, and the melodies of the Dove have been stilled in the most exalted company, and the joy of the pure ones in the most glorious chambers has been transformed, inasmuch as I am surrounded by mountain scorpions and sea-dogs, such that were I to turn to the right, their venom would touch me, and were I to turn to the left, their dogs would wound me, and were I to raise my head, the millstone would descend upon it.</p>
<p>And matters have reached such a state that I am cut off from all the delights of earthly blessings, and if I desire to drink water, I drink from my heart’s blood, and if I wish to take food, I eat from a piece of my liver. All this, O my God, is from those things which have befallen me in Thy love and descended upon me in Thy service. Thou art now able to preserve me, so preserve me; and if Thou wilt not do this, then build for me a house near Thy mighty throne above the heavens of Thy eternal glory. Then raise me unto Thee that I may dwell therein through Thy grace and find rest in the vicinity of Thy mercy, for I find no place for myself in Thy earth whereon to set my foot or wherein to abide, for Thy servants hate me and banish me, and every day they conspire to slay me and say concerning me what they please and judge me as they desire, such that I have become bewildered in my affairs and find neither refuge to flee to, nor place to settle in, nor sanctuary wherein to dwell to serve those who love Thee and to be a helper to Thy Cause and a guardian of Thy decree, until I may attain martyrdom in Thy path before Thee, for in Thy hands is the kingdom of all things and Thou art powerful over all things. Then I beseech Thee, O my God, by the sorrow that hath afflicted me in Thy path and which hath never left me for a moment, that Thou mayest cause me to ascend unto the paradise of Thine eternity and raise me up unto it through Thy bounty, and deprive me not of that which hath been ordained therein of the wondrous gifts of Thy oneness and the gems of the favors of Thy divine unity, that I may be of them that dwell therein and journey in the precincts of its mercy, lest the whisperings of Satan prevent me from my love for Thee, my yearning toward Thee, my passion for Thee and my ardor for Thee. For verily it is a paradise created from the essence of Thy power and fashioned from the subtleties of Thy might, wherein the sun shineth unclouded, and its moon is radiant without eclipse, and its stars never fall, and its mansions never crumble, and its trees never change, and its fruits never alter, and its mysteries are never veiled, and its breezes never cease, and its treasures never perish, and its light is never extinguished, and its garment never wears out, and its verses are never abrogated, and its clusters are near at hand, and its fruits endure, and its leaves are evergreen, and its blessings are perfect. Its sun hath ever been at its zenith and its moon at the height of beauty. Glorified art Thou, glorified art Thou, O my God! By Thy might, were I to attempt to describe, throughout the duration of Thy sovereign might and the continuance of Thy pure power, even a drop of what Thou hast created therein of the manifestations of Thy creative act and the holy expressions of Thy divinity, I would be utterly powerless, enfeebled and at a loss, ere I could utter a single letter of the essence of that which Thou hast created therein by Thy power and brought into being by Thy will. Glorified art Thou, glorified art Thou! Unto One like Thee befitteth the mantle of grandeur and glory and the gems of might and power, for verily Thou art the True Powerful One, and we are all Thy servants and unto Thee do we return.</p>

<p>Sanctified and holy has been and shall ever be the Sovereign Who illumined the horizon of the world with the lights of the Most Great Luminary and adorned all things with the ornament of His names. He is the true Sovereign Whose Word has dominated all things and Whose Will encompasses the heavens and earth. By His soul-stirring call He manifested absolute nothingness in the garment of being, and through the revelations of the Most Exalted Pen He adorned the kingdom of creation. He is the Quickener of the world, the Illuminator of the world, the Renewer of the world, and the Speaker of the world. Every exalted one has been and shall be lowly before the manifestations of His exaltation, and every lofty one has been and shall be abased before the evidences of His transcendence. The tongue, which is the seat of His mention, is His creation, and by the Word of that Sovereign of the unseen and the seen have all things come from utter nothingness into the realm of being. And the heart, which is the dwelling-place of His knowledge, has come into existence through His Will. Glorified is the Creator above the mention of the created, and glorified is the Lord above the mention of all created things, and glorified is the Beloved above the descriptions of hearts. All the mystics, divines, chosen ones and holy ones are powerless and incapable of comprehending a single word of the Most Exalted Word which has been revealed through the Will of the Sovereign of Names from the Most Exalted Pen–how much less can they comprehend the Manifestation of the Word, the Sovereign of the Word, the Source of the Word, the Promoter of the Word, the Quickener of the Word, and the Mover of the Word. This blessed Word, in one station, is known and mentioned by all names and attributes, and when it appeared, it bowed down and prostrated itself and spoke, saying: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast revealed Thy countenance from the horizon of the heaven of Thy Will! I testify that Thou art the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.” All the signs of the Hour and the Resurrection are manifested through Him and established in Him. He is the Breath of God through Whose wafting and fragrances prepared souls have awakened from the sleep of heedlessness and perceived the Day of God. He is the Water of Life through Whose bounty dead bodies have attained unto eternal life. Should this evanescent servant attempt to expound this station, he would surely find himself powerless; nay, he would behold all existence bewildered in this most exalted station. And were a drop from the ocean of the knowledge of this station to be granted, in view of the supreme wisdom that has been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen and which all have been commanded to observe, there would be no power to make mention thereof save by the command of Him Who is with Him. Verily, He is the Commander, the All-Knowing, the All-Compelling, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the All-Informed. How excellent is the state of the soul that hath inhaled the fragrance of the days of God and stood firm and steadfast in His love. This station is indeed most great, and its greatness is such that the Pen of the world is powerless and incapable of describing it, for this is the Day concerning which all divine Books bear witness and of which all the Prophets have given tidings. By God, the Truth! This is a Day wherein souls have trembled and eyes have been blinded, a Day wherein God hath come in the shadows of light, a Day wherein mankind hath stood before God, the Lord of the visible and the invisible. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto the heedless. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God, Lord of the Kingdom and the angelic realm, Creator of the celestial dominion! Thou knowest that this humble one desired that his call be honored by the hearing of my beloved among Thy chosen ones, whom Thou hast chosen for Thy love, established for Thy service, created to hearken unto Thy call, aided to turn toward the horizon of Thy grace, honored with the living waters from the cup of Thy bounty, and made to recognize Thy Day which most of Thy creation hath neglected. Then Thou didst cause him to utter the testimony which Thou hast placed above the kingdom of utterance and of which the understanding of Thy creatures fell short. All this is from Thy grace, Thy generosity, Thy bounty and Thy benevolence. I thank Thee for this through the perpetuity of Thy names and attributes and through the permanence of Thy Most Exalted Word amongst Thy creation. I beseech Thee to protect him in all conditions through Thy power and sovereignty. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>My heart, my joy and my soul be a sacrifice for your love! The servant hath attained to hearing the melodies of the nightingales of your praise upon the branches of the Lote-Tree of utterance, and hath been honored by that which flowed from your pen whereby your mention appeared and the sun of your love shone forth from the horizon of certitude. We beseech God to grant me success in hearkening unto your sweetest mention at all times. Verily, He is the Powerful, the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>If you inquire about the conditions of this land, praise be to God, all are safe and speaking in remembrance of God. However, due to the war that has occurred, the people of these regions are in distress and afflicted with utmost hardship. All ears are heedless of the call of the muezzin, and hearts are empty of the knowledge and love of Truth. In brief, a great calamity hath encompassed the people. This is what the All-Merciful promised in the Tablets.</p>
<p>To his honor Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’l-?amid, upon him be the Glory of God, I convey most sublime, most impregnable, most exalted greetings. God willing, may he ever remain and continue to be enkindled with the fire of the love of God and speaking in His remembrance. The circumambulators of the Throne all convey their pure devotion to his honor.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise be befitting and worthy of the Beloved of the world and the Goal of all peoples, Who hath adorned the realm of existence with the ornament of knowledge. He is the Omnipotent One Who bestowed existence upon utter nothingness and commanded the worship of His peerless Being. He is the Sovereign Who hath ever loved and will ever love His knowledge; therefore He brought creation from non-existence into being. And His knowledge is not realized except through knowledge of the Dayspring of Revelation, the Dawning-Place of His Manifestation, the Source of His Cause, and the Manifestation of His Self, through Whom appeared His power, His might, His grace, His sovereignty, His greatness, His loftiness and His authority. Exalted be His station and His glory! Through Him He revealed His signs and His evidences, and made Him the Lord of His Messengers and the Seal of His Prophets. Upon Him and upon His family and His companions be His blessings, His peace, His glory, His mercy and His favors. We beseech God through them to assist through them the people of divine unity to return unto Him, to turn in repentance at the gate of His grace, and to hold fast to His cord, that there may be revealed that which was concealed and raised up that which was cast down.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God of kings and Master of all who are owned! I beseech Thee to enable the people of the white path to return unto Thee, then open before their faces the gates of Thy glory, Thy mercy and Thy favors. O my Lord! Thou seest them in the hands of the idolaters among Thy servants, where the people of hatred have surrounded them from all sides and have seized their cities and homes through oppression, for which those who acknowledge Thy unity and confess Thy oneness have lamented. O Lord! Do Thou absolve us of our transgressions which have stripped us of the garments of glory and honor. Verily Thou art the Lord of all creation. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy distinguished letter shone forth like the morning star and brought joy. Praise be to God, each letter thereof was a gate of gladness, for from it wafted the fragrance of the love of the Beloved of the worlds. Blessed art thou and those with thee. After its presentation before Him, the Lord–may our spirits be a sacrifice for Him–said: “O thou who gazest toward the horizon! Thy letter hath come and he who was present before the Wronged One read it. We heard and have answered thee with that which will gladden thy heart and solace thine eyes. We beseech God, exalted be He, to grant thee every good that hath been sent down in His Book and to ordain for thee from His Most Exalted Pen the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, He is powerful over all things.” Thou hast ever been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. Thou art among those souls whom God hath assisted and granted that which is the cause and source of the joy of the hearts of those near unto Him. The fragrance of thy sincerity is diffused throughout the world, and from all regions have come noble and wondrous accounts of thy character and deeds. Every soul who hath visited that land hath mentioned and continueth to mention thy good name. In truth, service to the Cause consisteth in such deeds and character as cause the spread of the traces of the friends of God. Blessed are ye and joy be unto you! Praise be to God that ye have attained unto that which shall endure and persist. We send greetings to all the friends in that land and we beseech for each one that which is the cause and source of exaltation, ascendancy and elevation. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer, and He is the Compassionate, the Generous.” End.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The generosity, compassion and mercy of the True One, glorified be His majesty, has encompassed and continues to encompass all. We were non-existent and He brought us into being; we were silent and He bestowed upon us the power of utterance; and He taught and made us aware of the ultimate purpose through words and meanings. Exalted be His power and His sovereignty! This servant testifies with both outer and inner tongue that had the people of the resplendent Faith acted according to the radiant Law and held fast to the divine Book, none would have prevailed over them and no cities or lands would have been plundered. Until now they are observed to be sleeping, for they have not arisen to redress what has been lost. In any case, we beseech God for His confirmation, that perchance the dispirited may become enkindled and the wayward may find the path. The command is in His hands; He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He desireth. He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>As to what was written concerning the House, after submission they stated that whatever belongs to you should revert to the Truth. At present in that land there is no one who can attend to affairs and act as is befitting. Therefore if someone is found who can repair it and dwell therein, this would be acceptable; otherwise, it would be preferable to sell it.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the intention of Aqa Muhammad-Kazim, upon him be God’s favor, according to His command if it can be accomplished with wisdom–that is, if the non-believers of that land do not become aware of his coming–there is no objection to his proceeding. I convey greetings and praise to each of the friends in that land, and I beseech the True One, glorified be His majesty, that they may ascend to greater heights and loftiness each day, nay each moment. Indeed, the mention of Alexandria has become the cause and source of joy to the friends in all regions. The servant beseeches confirmation and aid for them. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Peace and praise be upon you and upon God’s righteous and sincere servants.</p>

<p>This is a Book for him who should glory among the worlds, for God hath related him unto Himself and named him ’Abdu’l-Husayn. He is the Mighty, the Most Wondrous, the Most Glorious.</p>
<p>The remembrance of God from the Lote-Tree of Eternity in the Paradise of the Command hath been raised in the most wondrous melodies. Hearken, O people, unto that which is revealed unto you from the direction of the Spirit, and follow not every rejected idolater. Say: The Ancient Beauty hath appeared with the Most Great Glory, and the Spirit of Holiness hath warbled in the chambers of intimacy, “Blessed be God for this bounty that hath encompassed the worlds.” Say: The Ultimate Lote-Tree hath borne wondrous holy fruits. Deprive not yourselves thereof, O people, and follow not every sinful deceiver. Say: O concourse of the heavens and earth, await ye the Day wherein the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give its light, and the stars shall fall, and clamor shall arise from every ignorant one and learned one, and God shall come with hosts of angels, with the dominion of Command on His right hand and the Kingdom of Power mightily on His left.</p>
<p>Say: We have indeed raised that Day even now, and the Ancient Beauty hath come upon clouds of glory with a sovereignty that hath encompassed the worlds, with the dominion of grace on His right hand and the Kingdom of Names on His left. Thus have We raised that Day with mighty sovereignty. Say: O people, abandon what ye possess, then take what hath been sent down from One mighty and all-knowing. Say: When the days were the days of tyranny, We deposited a handful of clay behind the veil, and We made allusion to it as a wisdom from Us, and thus was the matter truly decreed. And We returned all names unto it through Our power and might, in glorification of My Self, Who hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Place it upon thy head, then inhale its fragrance that thou mayest discover therein the sweet savors of thy Lord and be drawn to His holy and faithful seat. O servant! Stand firm in the Cause, then open thy tongue in remembrance of thy Lord and fear no one, for verily He will guard thee in truth, even as He hath protected thee in many situations. Rejoice in thy soul and be gladdened in thy being, for God hath aided thee to recognize the Manifestation of His Self and hath given thee to drink from the fingers of grace a pure draught. Be united with Our Most Great Name in the Cause, for verily We have made it a shining lamp for you. Be unified in God’s Cause and His religion in such wise that no differences may arise among you - this is a matter We have loved from all eternity and have inscribed in preserved tablets of glory. Soon will Satan come unto you with that which will prevent you from the love of God and His Cause. Leave him then and what he hath behind you, and turn your faces toward the holy seat of the Beloved. Stand so firmly in the Cause that even should all who are in the heavens and earth contend with thee, and should there remain on earth no believer but thee, thou wouldst yet arise by thyself in the Cause. This is God’s command upon thee, and verily His command hath ever encompassed all worlds. Board the crimson ark in My Most Great and Most Exalted Name, then sail upon the ocean of grandeur that thou mayest be recorded among the people of Baha in the Mother Book. Leave the idolaters and what they possess, and take the Book of God with power from Us and strength from Our presence, then read it morn and eve. And glory be upon the people of Baha from One mighty and beautiful.</p>

<p>God testifieth that there is none other God besides Him. His is the power and the might, the grandeur and the dominion. He it is through Whom was hoisted the Standard of Guidance amidst all peoples, and the Banner of Bounty amongst all who dwell on earth and in heaven. Through Him the ocean of beneficence surged in the world, and the fragrance of His presence wafted among the servants of God, both men and women. God testifieth that there is none other God besides Him, and that He Who hath come in the clouds of glory is the Promised One extolled in the Books and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Sacred Scrolls and Tablets. Through Him the mysteries were unveiled, the signs were spread abroad, and the Cause of God, firm and impregnable, was made manifest, and His sovereign decree was established over all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of one among the handmaidens who took up her abode in her Lord’s house and attained His presence at morn and eventide, at night and at dawn. We bear witness that she succeeded in serving Me and the Branches, through the grace of God, her Lord, the All-Merciful. We testify that she migrated from the Land of Mystery with her Lord until she arrived at the Fortress of ’Akka through an injustice at which the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise lamented, and the celestial maidens in the highest heaven were grieved. Blessed is she, and joy be unto her, for having answered her Lord when the Call was raised betwixt earth and heaven, and for having turned unto Him and attained that which flowed from the Most Exalted Pen in the Sacred Scrolls and Tablets. We bear witness that she partook of the choice wine of utterance from the hand of the bounty of her Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, and drank thereof time and again, to the shame of every people that turned away from their Lord and were deceived by the ornaments of the world, its embellishments and its colors, to such extent that they cast the Book of God behind their backs and committed that which caused every just and fair-minded soul to weep and made the tears of them that have recognized Him to flow.</p>
<p>By the life of God! The fire of hatred was kindled in her heart to such degree that she rent asunder the veil of the sanctity of God and of His chosen ones and His loved ones, and violated His Covenant and Testament. In her tyranny she reached such a state that she betrayed the trust of God and sent it to a house adorned with the ornaments of the world and the possessions of the nations. Thereby was raised the lamentation of all things, despite that the Wronged One loved her and revealed numerous Tablets for her. But greed held her back and love of leadership encompassed her until she committed that which caused the Pen to lament at her mention and the Tablet at her deeds and actions. And she committed this for naught but to seize worldly goods and to exalt her station in the eyes of one whom God had raised up and in whose hand and grasp He had placed the reins of affairs. Thereby was the joy of the loved ones turned to sorrow, and their dignity to supreme terror, and their tranquility to weeping. To this beareth witness the Lord of all beings from this most exalted station and most glorious horizon. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth through His binding and wondrous command.</p>
<p>O Tongue of Grandeur! It behoveth thee to make mention of thine handmaiden who was present before thy face at morn and eventide, that from the horizon of the Supreme Pen might shine forth the luminary of faithfulness. Say: The first splendor that hath shone forth from the horizon of bounty, and the first fragrance that hath wafted from the utterance of the Lord of eternity, and the first perfume that hath been diffused by the will of God, the Lord of all worlds, be upon thee, O handmaiden of Baha, leaf of the Tree of Faithfulness. I testify that thou didst turn unto thy Lord when most of His servants turned away from Him, and didst hear His sweetest call when it was denied to all save whom God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Names, did please. Thou didst acknowledge that which God had revealed on a Day whereon the servants denied it, save whom God, the Lord of creation, did please. Thou art she who circled round the Throne of thy Lord and voiced His praise amongst the handmaidens. We beseech God, exalted be He, to send down upon thee, at all times, mercy from His presence and grace from His own Self. Blessed art thou, O handmaiden of God, and joy be unto thee, O handmaiden of God, in that the Lord of all creation maketh mention of thee in the world of creation. By My life! The ocean of forgiveness hath surged at My mention of thee, and the fragrance of the All-Merciful’s loving-kindness hath been stirred when I turned towards thee. I testify that thou didst believe in God and His Manifestation, His might, His grandeur and His majesty, and didst act in thy final days in such wise as God hath adorned with the ornament of His acceptance and illumined with the light of His good-pleasure. Thus hath the Supreme Pen spoken on this day whereon We have arisen to make mention of thee, O My handmaiden, and to recall that which thou didst perform in My days. We testify that thou hast attained unto that which most of the servants and handmaidens have failed to attain. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who remembereth thee and visiteth thee, by virtue of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. The glory of God rest upon thee, upon thy beginning and thine end, thine outer and thine inner being, and the mercy of God and His blessings.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by this leaf who held fast to the Tree of Thy Revelation, and by the blood that was shed in the land of Ya in Thy path, and by their patience and fortitude, their humility and submissiveness, and by the tears that were shed in separation from Thee, and by the sighs that were raised in remoteness from Thee, that Thou forgive whosoever hath visited her and drawn nigh unto her resting-place and spoken that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered in Thy prison. O Lord! Illumine the hearts of Thy servants, then open before their faces the doors of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful and the Fulfiller of the needs of them that seek Thee. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Loving, the Bountiful.</p>

Sorrows have seized Me upon learning of thy grief in the Cause of thy Lord, and I have been moved by the stirring of the Lote-Tree of thy love, which the winds of thy Lord’s loving-kindness have set in motion.

<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God, my God! Thou Who art the Throb within my heart knowest and seest that the shame of Thy loved ones leadeth back to the Manifestation of Thyself and the Dayspring of Thy Cause. Nay, He seeth Himself more ashamed than they when they confess what hath escaped them in Thy days. O my Lord! These are Thy servants who have migrated in Thy love and borne tribulations in Thy path. By Thy glory, O my God! Whenever any one of them confesseth his transgressions before Thee, shame covereth the face of Baha, for they are Thy servants who have tasted the cup of tribulation in Thy Cause and drunk the chalices of hardship at the appearance of the lights of Thy countenance, and trials have so seized them that they found no rest in Thy presence. By Thy glory! Baha hath melted in love for Thy loved ones and is perturbed by the sorrows that have befallen them at the manifestation of Thy Cause and the surging of the seas of Thy grace and favor. O Lord! From the sighs of their hearts hath my sighing risen, and from the burning of their hearts hath my heart been set aflame. I beseech Thee, O Lord of all being and Educator of the seen and unseen, to make each one of them a standard of Thy guidance among Thy servants and a dawning-place of the lights of the sun of Thy loving care among Thy creatures. Thou hast singled them out, O my God, for Thy love and for attendance before the throne of Thy grandeur. This is a station wherein none hath preceded them. How many nights, O my God, they slept not in remembrance of Thee, and how many days they lamented for what was wrought against Thee by Thine enemies. I beseech Thee, O King of Kings and Exalter of the lowly, to assist them in the triumph of Thy Cause and the exaltation of Thy Word in such wise that through them Thy remembrance may be spread among Thy creation and Thy praise throughout Thy realm. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Lord my God! This is Thy servant whom Thou hast named with Thine own name in the kingdom of Thy names and reared beneath the wing of Thy grace and favor. Now Thou seest him hastening toward the region of Thy bounties and running unto Thee in quest of Thy bestowals. Adorn him, O my God, with the mantle of Thy generosity and the robe of Thy bounty and grace, that all things may perceive from him the sweet savors of the garment of Thy love. Then crown his head with the diadem of Thy remembrance that he may be known among the servants for his love for Thee and his steadfastness in Thy Cause. Then aid him in all conditions to help Thy Cause and to extol Thee and sing Thy praise amidst Thy creatures. By Thy glory, O my God! Whenever I contemplate Thy greatness and sovereignty, I find myself the most rebellious of all them that have rebelled in Thy realm, and whenever I behold the stations which Thou hast reserved for Thyself, I perceive my being more sinful than any that dwell upon Thy earth. Were it not for the concealment of Thy Name, the Concealer, and the forgiveness of Thy Name, the All-Forgiving, and the fragrance of Thy Name, the All-Merciful, Thou wouldst behold the chosen ones in the positions of sin and rebellion. Praise be unto Thee for having preceded them with Thy mercy and encompassed them with Thy grace and favor. After my confession of what hath flowed from my pen, I beseech Thee by Thy Name which Thou hast made the Sovereign over all names and the Supreme Ruler over all who are in earth and heaven, that Thou wilt not turn away him who hath turned toward Thee, nor withhold from him the wonders of Thy grace and the hidden tokens of Thy mercy. Kindle within his heart, by the hands of Thy power, a lamp that will burn in Thy days and cry out in Thy Name in such wise that shyness will not prevent him from soaring in the atmosphere of Thy love and ascending to the horizon of Thy rapture and yearning, nor will the affairs of the people hinder him from exalting Thy Word, that Thou mayest behold him sanctified as Thou desirest and as beseemeth Thy majesty and glory. Though this, O my God, be a mighty station and a great position, for how can any besides Thee bring forth that which would be worthy of Thy presence and befitting of Thy majesty? Thou art the Generous One, and Thou art the Merciful. All atoms testify that Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Kind, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Wise. O my God, look upon him with the eye of Thy loving-kindness and the glance of Thy bounty. Then attract him through the melodies of the Source of Thy Revelation to such a station wherein he may become wholly annihilated in Thy good-pleasure and hopeful of what Thou hast ordained in Thy tablets. Then strengthen his heart through Thy name, the Strong, the Faithful, that he may stretch forth the hand of power and thereby aid Thy Cause at the appearance of the light of Thy Beauty and the dawning of the Sun of Thy Glory. O Lord! Since Thou hast named him with Thy name, single him out among Thy servants for Thy service. O Lord! Thou knowest that I have desired naught for myself but rather for Thy Cause, and have turned to no one except for Thy Command and the manifestation of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by Thy Hidden Name which now speaketh, that Thou send down upon him and upon Thy loved ones that which is treasured in the heaven of Thy bestowal and gifts, that yearning and attraction may seize them in Thy Covenant, O Lord of Lords! Then ordain for him and for them what befitteth Thy Name, the All-Bountiful. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Strong, the Mighty, the Great.</p>

<p>This is a Book sent down by the Wronged One from the presence of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, to him who desires to drink from the Kawthar of utterance from the cup of his Lord’s bounty, the All-Merciful, that the fragrances of revelation might draw him nigh unto this praiseworthy station. The Most Exalted Pen hath been moved and the Sadratu’l-Muntaha hath rustled when the Lord of all beings came from the heaven of bounty with manifest sovereignty. Say: O concourse of divines! Cast aside what ye possess and take hold of that which hath come to you from the kingdom of proof. Thus doth the Book of God command you, which speaketh before the faces of all the world. Verily, there is no God but Him, the One, the Single, the Supreme Ruler of the kingdom of earth and heaven. Say: Your sciences and your arts profit you not. Cast them behind you, turning unto God, the Lord of existence. Beware lest the world and its ornaments and favors prevent you from the path of God, the Mighty, the Loving. Purify your hearts, then turn with radiant faces toward the Supreme Horizon, the station which hath shone forth from the Day-Star of the manifestation of your Lord, the Possessor of the seen and unseen. When thou hast attained unto My verses and found the fragrance of My utterance, arise and say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I have turned toward Thy Self when I was heedless of the wonders of Thy grace, and Thou didst call me when I was sleeping upon my couch in Thy days, and Thou didst remember me when I was silent in Thy remembrance, and Thou didst guide me when I was halting in Thy Cause. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue the world and the hearts of the nations, and by the Daysprings of Thy revelation and the Dawning-Places of Thy inspiration and the Manifestations of Thy Self and the Sources of Thy commandments and power, to make me in all conditions one who speaketh Thy praise and standeth firm in Thy love. O my Lord! Make me not of those who beheld the lights of Thy countenance and turned away from them, and who heard Thy most sweet call and Thy most great verses and denied them. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the splendors of the lights of the sun of Thy grace not to disappoint me of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones who were not deterred by the might of the oppressors nor by the tyranny of the pharaohs from turning unto Thee and holding fast unto Thy cord and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy mercy. O my Lord! Withhold not mine eye from beholding Thy Supreme Horizon, nor mine ear from hearkening unto that which hath flowed from Thy Most Exalted Pen, nor my tongue from Thy remembrance, O Lord of all being and Sovereign of the throne on high and of the dust below. I know not, O my God, what deed hath kept me back from turning toward Thee in Thy days, and what thing hath intervened between me and the Dayspring of Thy verses and the Manifestation of Thy clear tokens. Thou seest, O my God, my state and hearest my lamentation. By Thy might! Thy separation hath destroyed me and melted me away. I beseech Thee by the Manifestations of Thy power and the Dawning-Places of Thy might to aid me to propagate Thy Cause among Thy servants and to spread Thy signs throughout Thy lands. Then forgive me and those who have sought Thee. Verily Thou art He to Whose grace and pardon all created things have testified, and to Whose gifts and bestowals all beings have borne witness. I testify unto that whereunto the Tongue of Thy grandeur hath testified when it was established upon the throne by Thy command and will, that verily Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Thou hast ever been sanctified from the mention of aught else but Thee and exalted above the description of any besides Thee. Thou hast appeared and hast made manifest that which was hidden in Thy knowledge and treasured within the repositories of Thy protection and the treasuries of Thy preservation. O my Lord! Thou seest me hoping for the wonders of Thy bounty and beseeching that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and trusted ones, and awaiting the table of Thy heaven and the enduring blessing from Thy presence. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>It is uttered in the Persian tongue, that perchance the fragrance of both eloquent Arabic and sweet Persian may be diffused. From the first days this Call hath been raised without veil or concealment, and this Wronged One hath stood forth and spoken before all faces. Nevertheless, until now they remain deprived of the ocean of knowledge and forbidden from the dawning rays of the Sun of Truth. It is incumbent and binding upon you to arise to serve the Cause and to summon the ignorant people to the divine Law of knowledge. The world and its might and wrath, its bounty and mercy, its ornaments and colors - all these are transient and shall return to nothingness. Blessed is the soul that endeavoreth and engageth in service to the Cause, that perchance it may find the Guide of the Way and not be deprived of that for which it was created. Unceasingly have the pearls of wisdom and utterance appeared and shone forth from the treasuries of the Most Exalted Pen, yet until now no seeker or knower hath been found, save whom God willeth. Strive that perchance the soreness of eyes may be removed through the Name of God, exalted be His glory, and attain to the lights of the horizon of Revelation. May they turn from the world of fancy to the world of certitude, and from the abyss of conjecture to the horizon of the true world. Praise be to God that you have attained and turned toward the horizon from which most of the people of the world are seen to turn away. You must arise in the Name of Truth and, placing your trust in Him, with wisdom and utterance bestow upon the people of possibility their portion from the Kawthar of divine knowledge. Thus doth command thee the Most Exalted Pen from the presence of God, the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who hearken to thy words concerning this Most Great News and this Wise Command.</p>

<p>O Lion! Upon thee rest My glory! The letter thou didst send hath been presented before the face of this Wronged One, and hath been honoured with His hearing. Praised be God Who hath caused His loved ones to drink from the same cup from which the Dayspring of verses and the Manifestation of clear proofs did drink. In the land of ?a, this Wronged One was imprisoned with chains and fetters in four cities. These afflictions occurred repeatedly, yet as they were in the path of God, they strengthened the spirit and renewed the body. Though outwardly weakness was apparent, inwardly the Light of Power shone forth, radiant and resplendent from the horizon of the heaven of the heart. Thou and the Khan have drunk from this cup - blessed are ye both!</p>
<p>The oppressors are as children playing with mud. Soon will the hand of power seize them and spread wide the carpet of joy and delight. His might is not weakened by the power and sovereignty of kings, nor is His utterance prevented by the clamor of the heedless and the deniers. His Will is effective and His Purpose all-pervading, despite those who have denied God and His signs. What became of the serpent? Where went the wolf? Soon shall the oppressors pass from their palaces to their graves, and their earthly glory, wealth and exaltation shall come to an end.</p>
<p>O Ba’i! If the servants would act according to that which hath been recorded in God’s Book by the Most Exalted Pen, they would soon attain unto that which befitteth the mercy of the All-Merciful. Convey My greetings to the people of that land. In the days of their distress, God was with them, bestowed tranquility upon them, and delivered this Wronged One. Give them glad-tidings from this Wronged One, that all may attain to joy and gladness. By the Sun of the horizon of proof which shineth from the most exalted horizon of possibility, the true profit is with you, and the reward for what hath befallen you is a treasure with God, preserved in the pavilion of infallibility. Were it to be revealed even to the extent of a needle’s eye, mortal vision would be unable to behold it. He Who possesseth the Clear Book beareth witness to this.</p>
<p>Rejoice in God’s loving-kindness and His mercy! Be gladdened by God’s bounty and His generosity! Soon shall ye be illumined by the effulgences of the light of God’s Sun of grace. Reflect upon the heedlessness of souls: love of ornaments hath deprived them of eternal bounty and everlasting sustenance. God’s Will is bent upon the reformation of the world. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this great favour. The primary cause and origin of the world’s corruption hath been and continues to be, in the first rank and station, the divines. Throughout the ages they said “yea” to the Truth, yet in the end martyred Him. Inform the friends of this utterance that the greatest joy may take possession of their hearts and souls, and that this world and all that is therein may not hold them back from the Straight Path. Say: O my God, my Adored One, my Goal! Unto Thee do we turn, to Thee do we cleave, and from Thee do we seek that which conduceth to life eternal and everlasting glory. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance, the power of Thy Will, and the potency of Thy purpose, to protect me and Thy loved ones from the evil of Thine enemies who have been so deluded by the world that they have violated Thy Covenant and Testament, denied Thy right, and disputed Thy signs. O Lord! Illumine our hearts with the lights of Thy utterance, then assist us with the hosts of the seen and the unseen through Thy might and power, then forgive our trespasses and our sins through Thy grace and bounty, then send down upon us from the heaven of bounty mercy from Thy presence and blessings from Thy side. O Lord! Transform our sorrow into joy, our poverty into wealth, our abasement into glory, our weakness into strength, and our agitation into tranquility. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon everyone who is steadfast and firm.</p>
<p>O my father! Know thou with clear certainty that thou art and hast been under the glance of grace. Associate with all the peoples of the world with utmost love and kindness, especially with the friends of God. He hath been and is with thee. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. His grace reacheth thee, He bestoweth strength. He is the One powerful and mighty over all things. Look not at the heedlessness and ignorance of some, but rather hold fast unto that which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning kindliness, forbearance and compassion. Verily, He will exalt thee in truth. How beloved it is in the sight of God when a person, for His sake, seeketh not to retaliate but rather looketh to pardon and forgiveness. Praise be to the Lord of the invisible and the visible, that this Manifest Book hath been revealed bearing thy name and that of His friends.</p>
<p>Another glad-tiding is that at this moment the Sun of Permission hath dawned from the horizon of God’s Will. However, thou must be mindful of wisdom. Turn to it whenever wisdom requireth. In most Tablets the decree of wisdom hath been sent down from the heaven of God’s Will. All must observe it and act accordingly. That which was mentioned regarding hospitality hath been accepted in the Most Holy Court, illumined by the splendors of the Sun of acceptance. Blessed art thou, O Husayn. We testify that thou hast attained unto the mention of God and the service of His Cause, and We testify that thou art among the triumphant ones. Soon will come to you servants who have denied God and His signs. Say: O friends of God! Leave them behind you, remaining steadfast in the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. The glory be upon you. This is once again a bounty from His presence, and He is the Bountiful, the Generous.</p>

<p>O friends of God in the two villages, upon them be the Glory of God! Every soul who today desires to drink from the chalice of divine knowledge and attain the light of certitude must first purify their heart with the water of the utterance of Him Who is the Aim of all worlds. Likewise must they purify their hearing and sight to such degree that names will not prevent them from turning towards Him, nor will the veils of beauty and the clouds of majesty hold them back from the Self-Subsisting Lord. In brief, they must sanctify their thoughts from the mention of all else but God, that they may become worthy to turn towards Him and capable of drawing near. Today the ocean of utterance is surging and the luminary of grace is shining forth. The previous people - namely the Shi’ites - were prevented by their vain imaginings from the Dayspring of Certitude. They occupied themselves with names while remaining heedless and veiled from their Lord. The divines, with utmost tyranny and injustice, uttered unseemly words from their pulpits - all have heard and know this. What was the cause of this turning away, the reason for this blindness? And whence arose this enmity against the Truth?</p>
<p>O servants! Ponder, that perchance ye may discover the purpose and not be deprived of the Most Great Ocean through clinging to the gulf of names. The One Whose presence they sought throughout ages and centuries - they issued the decree for His death and martyred Him. Hearken unto the call of the trusted Counselor! Cleanse your hearts wholly from the doubts and allusions of the past, for all the words and deeds of that party were rejected on the Day of His Manifestation. Today the trees cry out “The Truth is come!” and the fruits proclaim “The Kingdom is God’s!” Deprive not your hearing and sight from witnessing and hearkening to the divine call. Leave the idolaters to their vain disputations. This Day is the Day of God - names have no station therein save for those souls who are the cupbearers of the choice-sealed wine and the Hands of the Cause of the Self-Subsisting Lord. These are they who have arisen with complete detachment to serve the Cause of the Lord of all beings. The ornaments of these fleeting days did not prevent them from the everlasting bounties and the eternal, perpetual feast. These are servants whom the ornaments and adornments of the world did not hinder. They have turned with illumined hearts and radiant faces to the Supreme Horizon, and answered their Lord, the Lord of all beings, when the call was raised between earth and heaven. These are honored servants, these are they who are brought nigh. The sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful so transported them that they sacrificed their lives. All else besides God did not prevent them from turning unto Him.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in the two villages! Know ye, then recognize that the Revealer of verses hath turned toward you from the direction of the Prison, and the Manifestor of clear evidences hath sent down for you that which will solace your eyes. And He Who conversed on Sinai calleth you from the horizon of Revelation, even as griefs encompass Him from the wickedness of the evil ones. Rejoice ye in My remembrance, then thank your Lord, for He hath sent down for you that which will draw you nigh unto Him - from which every possessor of smell perceiveth the fragrance of His bounty, His grace and His mercy that have preceded all that was and that shall be.</p>
<p>Hear ye the call of the Wronged One! By the Sun of Truth, whosoever hath attained unto the hearing of the Word findeth himself free and detached from the world and all that dwell therein. We beseech God not to deprive His servants of the lights of the Sun of true unity. By God’s life! The Shi’ih sect hath been recorded in the Crimson Book by the Most Exalted Pen as being among the idolaters. Strive ye, that ye may attain unto that for which ye were created from nothingness. The objectors of the Bayan are seen to be veiled anew from God, exalted be His glory, through their attachment to imaginary names. They have forsaken the Self-Subsisting and cling to vain imaginings. They are indeed among the most lost in God’s Book, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O My loved ones! I counsel you, after recognition of God, to steadfastness supreme, and to trustworthiness and godliness. The hosts of triumph and victory have ever been pure and acceptable deeds and character. We beseech God to make His loved ones the emblems of His remembrance in His lands and the standards of His guidance throughout His realms. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. We have repeatedly made mention of the loved ones in the land of Kha and those regions, and there hath been sent down from the heaven of divine Will that which containeth in every word a treasury of utterance and concealed waters of life. Ask thou God to grant the power of hearing and sight, and likewise the strength of steadfastness, that they may arise with legs of iron to support this new Cause and may speak the words “We are God’s” with such utterance that silence shall not overcome it, nor shall the insinuations of the doubtful prevent it. Glory be to God! Despite all that hath been witnessed and is now being witnessed, the barking ones lie in wait for the unitarians. Convey to all the greetings of the Wronged One and counsel them to observe the manners and character of the Concourse on High. Verily thy Lord is the Generous, the Bountiful. He loveth His loved ones and maketh mention of them ere they make mention of Him. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>The Light shining from My most exalted horizon be upon you, O My loved ones and friends, and upon those who will be attracted by the call of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath sent down the verses and revealed the clear proofs and sent forth the Messengers, making them the Manifestations of His Revelation, the Dawning-Places of His inspiration, and the Harbingers of what He hath sent down in His Books, His Psalms and His Tablets. He is verily the Single, the One, the Unique, like unto Whom there is nothing. He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but He, the Single, the All-Informed. The Wronged One beareth witness to His unity and oneness, and to His greatness and sovereignty. He it is Who hath spoken with the tongue of will concerning the unity of His Being and the unity of His attributes, and hath caused all things to speak that there is no God but He. He hath ever been sanctified beyond mention and utterance, and exalted above the understanding of all created things. Through Him the ocean of bounty hath surged in the world and the banner of unity hath been raised amidst the nations. And blessings and peace be upon the Dawning-Place of the Word of God, the Manifestation of His Cause, the Dayspring of His Revelation and the Source of His laws - He through Whom the countenance of the Hijaz smiled and the horizons were illumined with the light of concord. He it is Who gave glad tidings to all of the hidden Mystery and the treasured Symbol, and informed the people of the Hour and its signs, and the Resurrection and its mysteries. And upon His family and companions who strove in the path of God with true striving and sacrificed their souls and their possessions for the exaltation of His Word and the manifestation of His Cause, and upon those who acted according to what they were commanded in His Book, which God made to be supreme over all books and through which He separated truth from falsehood, from that Day until the Day when the trumpet shall be blown and all who are in the heavens and earth shall swoon away, save those whom God willeth.</p>
<p>And now, O thou who hast turned towards Him! The Wronged One mentioneth thee for the sake of God with that which shall profit thee in the hereafter and in this world, and counseleth thee in all circumstances to perform deeds and to show forth character, and that whereby the Cause of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, shall be exalted.</p>
<p>In the Persian tongue it is mentioned: Spiritual virtues and goodly deeds are as wings for the human temple and as hosts for the triumph of the Divine Cause. A single pure word, free from the dust of vain imaginings, delivered and granted salvation to an entire city. The details thereof have been mentioned before. Blessed is he who hath arisen to serve the Cause with spirit and fragrance and hath acted according to what was commanded in the Book of his Lord, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that thou hast turned thy face and directed thyself to the horizon of the Prison, and hast drunk from the cup of contentment. How many souls in the nights and days sought divine confirmation from the Lord of all beings but attained it not, while thou didst arrive and hear that which its hearing is the cause of salvation and the source of prosperity. Today all the believers must, with the utmost humility and supplication, beseech assistance from the Lord of the Worlds, for all find themselves confronting the assaults of the polytheists. Each day they seize one pillar and destroy another, and this is naught but the recompense of deeds. All must today utter this most exalted word:</p>
<p>O God of the worlds and Creator of the nations! We beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name to protect Thy lands from Thine enemies and Thy countries from the oppressors among Thy servants. O Lord! We have returned unto Thee and repented of our transgressions and errors, and have turned with our hearts and faces toward Thee, O Kaaba of the yearning ones, Answerer of the prayers of the distressed, and God of all in the heavens and earths. We beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue the cities and souls to blot out our evil deeds and to pass over what our hands have wrought. Verily Thou art He to Whose mercy all atoms bear witness and to Whose generosity all beings testify. There is no God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabil-i-Karim! Make mention of the friends of God on behalf of the Wronged One. Ever hath the tongue been occupied with the praise of His loved ones and the Pen moved by that which exalteth them. Blessed art thou, for thou hast endured hardships and tribulations in the path of God and hast traversed both land and sea until thou didst attain thy goal and didst convey the remembrances of the friends of God. Praise be to God that each one hath been made the recipient of mention and adorned with the grace of the Friend. We beseech God to ordain for them what He hath ordained for His chosen ones, and to decree for them the reward of this world and of the world to come. Verily, He is the Lord of all beings and the King of the throne above and the earth below. There is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>If thou shouldst meet Muhammad-Qabil-i-Hasan, convey Our greetings and say: Thou hast not been forgotten. Verily thy Lord loveth faithfulness and He prayeth God to assist thee in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to aid thee in His remembrance and praise amongst all peoples. We beseech confirmation for all, that perchance the clamor of the aggressive ones, the tyranny of the oppressors, and the might of the deniers may not prevent the people of unity from the Most Exalted Word. We hope that God, exalted be His glory, may guide all the world and direct them to the straight path. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer.</p>
<p>And at the conclusion of this epistle, may the mercy sent down from the heaven of the grace of our Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful, be upon His Prophets and His Messengers and His chosen ones who have sacrificed their souls and have not broken the Covenant, and upon every one who hath turned toward His most exalted horizon and whom nothing hath deterred therefrom. And praise be to God, the Lord of all beings.</p>

He, verily, is the Great Announcement which the All-Merciful hath sent down in the Qur’an. Blessed is he who hath turned towards Him and attained, and woe unto the heedless who have cast God behind their backs, turning unto every ignorant remote one. The Spirit, the glory and the splendor rest upon those who have hearkened unto the call of their Creator and answered Him on a Day wherein the dwellers of earth were overcome with drunkenness, save whom God willed, the Lord of all worlds. These are servants whose loftiness is attested by the Supreme Pen, through Whose movement all things have appeared. Exalted is the Lord of creation and the Master of the Beginning and the End, Who hath come with manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter arrived at the beginning of the sacred month of Muharram, and likewise another letter a few days prior. What thou hadst written concerning the tribulations that had befallen caused infinite sorrow. However, O My beloved, the deeds of the servants themselves become embodied. Observe how many successive afflictions and oppression and tyranny have been visited upon the assured and tranquil souls by heedless and wayward people. If it would end with this much, it would still be well, but the Servant seeth in the land of Ta what is hidden from eyes and sight. Beseech God to guide the people, that the sun of justice may shine forth from behind the clouds and deliver the world from the darkness of oppression. Grieve not for what hath befallen thee and what hath befallen the loved ones of God. By the life of God! Whosoever hath ascended is recorded among the martyrs in God’s Book. Blessed are they and joy be unto them for having turned unto Him and attained martyrdom in the days of the appearance of the Dayspring of their Lord’s verses, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Should one become aware of the truth, he would feel a hundred thousand regrets for his continued existence and would exclaim with a hundred thousand tongues, “Would that I had been among the martyrs!” Regret is for those souls who were afflicted by the swords of vengeance and returned to the lowest of the low. Be not sorrowful in any matter, but with utmost joy and fragrance speak in remembrance of the Beloved of all possibility. Praise be to God that you and the friends of God have attained to that which hath been the purpose of all worlds, before and after. This is a matter whose mention and station shall not perish with the apparent revolutions of earthly dominion. Blessed are the souls who have ascended with divine love and hastened to the Supreme Companion. Joy be unto them, happiness be unto them, and blessed be they.</p>
<p>In these days two packets arrived from Varqa, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of Names. He had mentioned the gatherings and meetings of the friends, and especially the details of that assembly and the names of those gathered were submitted before the Presence. Loving-kindness was shown to each one, one after another. We beseech the Exalted One to assist them and confirm them in what beseemeth His glorious and wondrous Day. God willing, this servant shall submit a response to his letter. Convey on behalf of this evanescent one greetings to him and all other friends, and give them all the glad-tidings of the effulgences of the sun of divine favor. Nothing escapeth His knowledge, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote requesting permission to bring someone with you, this was presented and permission was granted. You may bring whomever you wish. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, heareth and answereth, and He is the Near, the Watchful. The Glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who have attained to the recognition of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>His exalted Word in the Kitab-i-Aqdas states: “O Land of Kaf and Ra! We, verily, see thee in a state which pleaseth not God, and We see from thee that which none knoweth except God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And We perceive that which secretly and stealthily proceedeth from thee. With Us is the knowledge of all things in a Tablet that is manifest.”</p>
<p>In these days, Mirza Ahmad-i-Kirmani, despite having sent several petitions to the Most Holy Court expressing repentance and contrition and seeking forgiveness from the Ocean of Generosity, has arrived in the great city and obtained from the satans certain infernal papers which he has distributed. Outwardly he shows agreement and unity with the people of concord, while inwardly he is united with the people of discord - though even in this he speaks falsely. The servant sees him like a chameleon, changing color at every moment. O my beloved! This hypocrite is observed to be like wax, taking any form. Inform the friends of God about this rebellious infidel that they may be aware. Eight or nine years ago, a word was spoken to Jenab-i-Amin - upon him be the Glory of God - in person regarding the Land of Kaf and Ra. His honor must have heard it.</p>
<p>The servant beseeches the Lord of the worlds and the Sovereign of nations to protect His loved ones from the schemes of every schemer and the artifices of every deceiver, and to strengthen them in the supreme steadfastness in this most mighty, most holy, most powerful and impregnable Cause.</p>

<p>O ye beloved of God! May ye ever be and continue to be blessed and joyful through the grace shining from the horizon of the Cause of the immortal King. At all times be ye engaged in the triumph of the Cause of the All-Merciful. O thou servant who gazeth unto God, gird up firmly the loins of service, in such wise that thou mayest be known and renowned for thy service to God amongst all else. The world and whatsoever is witnessed therein shall ere long perish, and that which shall endure is what hath been ordained by the Truth for His loved ones, and ever shall be. Today must such a breeze of steadfastness waft from the loved ones of God that none can prevent those enkindled souls from the divine Unity. Say: O servants, guard yourselves and take refuge in God, exalted be His mention, lest the croak of the raven prevent you from the Lord of Lords. For in most lands the call of false pretenders shall be raised - tidings We gave at the time of Our migration from Iraq, and which hath been detailed in numerous Tablets from the Pen of the Lord of creation. Say: Take ye the chalice of steadfastness in the name of your Lord, then drink therefrom with this wise Remembrance. Today all must manifest spiritual qualities among mankind, that all people may inhale the sweet fragrances of sanctity and detachment from those who are related to the Truth. Praise God that thou art mentioned before the Divine Presence and the Pen of God’s Cause hath flowed in thy remembrance. Most great is this station - blessed is he who recognizeth its worth and is of them that preserve it.</p>
<p>O thou bird soaring in the heaven of divine love! Hearken unto the call of this Prisoner. Convey to all the beloved ones the greetings from God. Blessed are they in that they have believed, turned unto Him, heard and responded on a Day wherein the mountains were scattered and flesh did quiver. God willing, all must act according to the loving counsels that have shone forth from the horizon of the Will of the Lord of creation. We have enjoined wisdom upon all, for corruption, conflict, contention and unauthorized seizure of others’ property have all been forbidden in this Most Great Revelation. Say: O servants, hear ye the call of the Most Exalted Pen which crieth out betwixt earth and heaven. Strive ye, that perchance through divine grace and heavenly favors there may appear from you that which befitteth this Most Great Revelation. All must be united, and through deeds, character and conduct must attract and draw people from the gloomy wilderness to the pleasant spiritual realm. The essence of man is his humanity. Blessed is he from whom it is manifested - he is indeed of them that have attained. Man must not expend all his energy on his own imaginings, but must strive with utmost endeavor to attend to one another’s affairs. This is the binding command of the Lord of nations that hath flowed from the Pen of the Ancient of Days. A Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of Will concerning the education of all, but in these days it hath not been dispatched, as the time was not propitious. When the hour cometh, We shall send it unto you. By My life, it is a perspicuous Book sent down from your Lord, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O friends of the Truth! Let your endeavors be directed towards serving the loved ones of God. To care for the weak is essential and to assist the poor is among those things most necessary before the All-Forgiving, and shall ever be so. I swear by the Sun of sanctified glory that has risen from the horizon of the prison, that the cry of those who are oppressed among the loved ones of God and the poor among His friends has been and shall ever be effective. Had people perceived the station of the Truth and turned towards God’s direction, there would have surely appeared a matter that would have caused the enrichment of all. What they have withheld from themselves of that which their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, desired has been concealed. Hearken unto that which the Lord of Destiny reveals unto thee from the direction of His Most Great Scene. Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Powerful. Arise to serve the Cause and be steadfast through God’s might and power, then convey that which thou hast been commanded by the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say: O people! The Sun of Beauty hath risen from the horizon of your Lord’s Command, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, and all things have proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the Peerless, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: Are ye among the dead? Yea, by my Lord! Were there in you a breath of life, ye would have heard the call of your Lord and would have turned to Him and said: “My spirit be a sacrifice for Thy tribulations, O Beloved of the worlds! Thou art He Who hath borne hardships in God’s path for the quickening of all beings, until Thou wert imprisoned in a mighty prison.” Were ye to find the sweetness of that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen and hear that which the Tongue of Grandeur and Glory proclaimeth, ye would surely abandon what ye possess and hasten to the seat of the Throne with evident submission. Fear ye God and deprive not yourselves of the breezes of these days. Turn ye with illumined hearts and radiant faces. Thus doth your Lord, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Beauteous, command you.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest! Rejoice in God’s remembrance of thee and turn not unto those who speak what they comprehend not. The glory rest upon thee and upon thy son and upon those who have turned to the Countenance. They are indeed the triumphant ones. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who is the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Exalted is He Who sendeth down verses from the Kingdom which was illumined with the lights of the Throne, and Who speaketh in the Lote Tree of Revelation that perchance men may find a way unto Him.</p>
<p>Say: O servants, fear ye the Lord of the Day of Mutual Calling, and await the grace that was made manifest from the horizon of the All-Merciful. Say: The Sun of Utterance hath dawned from the horizon of the revelation of the King of Names and Attributes. Prostrate yourselves before God, your Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, Who was remembered in the heaven of eternity by the name of Glory, and in the kingdom of names as the Most High.</p>
<p>O people! Deny not the verses of the All-Merciful after their revelation. Follow that which ye have been commanded in the Book. Verily His grace draweth nigh unto the doers of good. Say: The names were shaken and the heaven was cleft asunder when the Glory came with the kingdom of eternity, save him who took Him as his protector. Cast away that which veils you from God, then soar on the wings of sanctity unto this atmosphere which was raised through this Name.</p>
<p>The breezes of grace have wafted, and by them were all things borne, and God is witness to what I say. Soon shall there appear from all things that which shall gladden the hearts of the monotheists. Then shall the idolaters flee to the right and to the left, and shall find for themselves no secure refuge.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Take ye the chalice of eternity from the hands of Glory, then turn ye unto God, the Lord of Names. And if ye are able within yourselves, then sail upon the crimson ark in My Most Exalted Name and traverse the sea of grandeur that ye may find yourselves beneath a shade illumined by the lights of His countenance.</p>
<p>The Tongue of Grandeur speaketh from this Most Great Prison and summoneth the peoples unto their Lord, the Most Merciful. Thus have We apprised thee and informed thee, that both thine eyes and the eyes of the Concourse of eternity might be solaced thereby, and that perchance the people may behold the power of God and choose Him as their Helper. Say: O people! If ye deny this power and this proof, by what evidence can ye establish your faith in your Lord, the Most Merciful? Nay, by Him through Whom the earth and heaven were illumined with the light of Baha, they shall find for themselves no path unto the truth. Say: O people! When the Messenger of God approacheth you with His Tablet, rise from your seats, then go forth to meet Him and take it with the fingers of certitude and assurance. Then inhale from it, when ye perceive therefrom the fragrance of utterance and the sweet perfume from the garment of the mercy of your Lord, the Most Merciful. Then deny it not. Thus have We sent down the command from the heaven of eternity, a revelation from One Who is mighty and powerful over all the worlds. O people! Follow the religion of God and His command, and commit not that which causeth the faithful ones to lament in the Most Exalted Companion. This is what We have counseled you in the Tablets, and God is witness to what I say. If one of the idolaters should bring thee the book of hell, cast it behind thee. Say: I have abandoned the religion of a people who believe not in God; these are the companions of the fire. Thus hath the command been inscribed by the Pen of the Chosen One upon the Tablet. O people! Fear God and follow not those against whom the word of punishment hath been fulfilled, and whose faces are covered with the dust of fire. They are assuredly among the people of the coffin. Thus hath the matter been decreed by the Lord of Lords and the Sovereign of the Kingdom, Who hath come from the heaven of Command with a name that was known in truth. Know thou the value of these days, then gird up thy loins therein for the triumph of My Cause. Let not the world and what occurreth therein sadden thee. Soon shall all thou beholdest perish, while glory and power shall endure unto God, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Chosen One.</p>

<p>All praise be unto the Most Praiseworthy One, Who through His name Ahmad conquered the world and purified it from the dust and stench of polytheism, Who through “No” rolled up the carpet of idols and through “but” raised high the banner of unity. He is the Omnipotent One Whom the opposition and denial of the polytheists did not deter from His purpose. Holy, sanctified is our Lord and the Lord of the angels and the Spirit. Prayers and peace be upon the Seal of His chosen ones and upon His family and companions, through whom the horizon of might dawned and the decree of free will was established.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter arrived and news was received, its contents understood and lamentations heard. Now is the time for joy and gladness, for thy beloved’s letter was presented before His face. He said: “O physician, upon thee be the peace of God, His grace, His bounty and His favors. This Wronged One has ever been afflicted in the hands of the heedless. From the earliest days until now He has repeatedly been imprisoned. This Wronged One was created for tribulations, yet as they are in the path of the Beloved of the worlds, they have been and are beloved. We beseech God to bestow upon all penetrating vision and attentive ears that they may see and bear witness, hear and testify. Before obstinacy, the waves of the ocean of utterance appear lower than a drop, and the harvests of inner meanings and knowledge less than a grain. One Who has desired naught save the exaltation and elevation of the people of unity has been deemed a mischief-maker and barred from that for which He was created.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! They have not pondered for a moment, nor do they ponder, what has been the cause of the abasement of the people of unity and what the reason for the ascendancy of the people of polytheism. Until now the abominable sect has not awakened from the slumber of heedlessness nor tasted of the ocean of awareness. They revile the Truth and perceive it not; they judge contrary to what God hath revealed and are unaware. Thus hath their recompense overtaken them for their deeds, yet they understand not and are unconscious. They deny the Truth while affirming vicegerency for His servant, and have wasted their lives in this matter. From the fruits of their deeds their stations have become clear and evident. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! This Thy servant testifieth that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Thou hast ever been sanctified above the mention of all created things and the description of all possible beings. All things have testified to Thy unity and oneness, to Thy power which hath conquered the horizons, and to the light of Thy unity whereby the lands have been illumined. O Lord! Thou seest me clinging to Thee and to Thy most great signs, whereby the necks of all humanity have been humbled. I beseech Thee by the splendors of the lights of Thy most exalted Word and by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance, O Lord of all names and Ruler of the throne on high and of earth below, to make me in all conditions one who acknowledgeth Thy grandeur and Thy power, and who is assured of that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. O Lord! Aid me and Thy servants to make good what hath escaped us, through Thy bounty which encompasseth all created things and through Thy mercy which hath preceded all who dwell on earth and in the heavens. Then inspire Thy servants, O my God, with that which will remove them from remoteness from Thee and enable them to cling to the hem of the robe of Thy grace. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Strong, the All-Subduing, the Almighty.”</p>
<p>Praised be God, divine favor be unto God, and mercy be unto God! This servant has ever been beseeching and hoping from the Ocean of bounty and the Sea of generosity that He may not deprive His servants of the adornment of justice. It was previously mentioned that in this land a person occupied a position of authority and committed that which caused the eyes of equity to weep, the sighs of the monotheists to rise, and tears to flow. He regarded these oppressed ones as mere beasts, and due to his hatred and enmity, affairs became difficult from every direction. However, by God’s grace and favor, his tyranny returned upon himself, and he departed this land humiliated and defeated. Yet some traces of his evil deeds still remain. That spiritual beloved should not be grieved. These oppressions and transgressions do not prevent the monotheists and sincere ones. They regard the world as non-existent and all save God as nothing. They are the repositories of God’s Will and the manifestations of His names and the mirrors of His attributes, exalted be His grandeur. This servant was saddened by the expression of grief from that beloved one. Praise be to God, after appearing before the Master, He spoke that which closed the gates of sorrow and despair and opened the gates of joy and delight. His is the praise and thanksgiving in all conditions. Convey greetings to the friends on behalf of this servant. I beseech and hope from God, exalted be His glory, that He may aid each one in that which will cause the exaltation of His Cause and the elevation of the station of His servants. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Peace, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those who are with you and who hearken to your words concerning the Cause of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>

<p>Praise be to the Most Holy and Supreme Sanctuary of the Beloved who favored the Afnan of His Tree with this great bounty and supreme honor. God willing, in all conditions, days, centuries, ages, and worlds they shall hold fast unto the Tree and move with the winds of His will. Blessed are they! Happy be they! This servant confesses his powerlessness and shortcoming to mention this station, and beseeches his Lord to grant them success, draw them nigh, and assist them in that which He loves and is pleased with. Verily He doeth whatsoever He willeth and in His grasp is the Kingdom of Creation. My spirit be a sacrifice unto your mention and unto your steadfastness.</p>
<p>A detailed petition was submitted by this servant to your presence several months ago (15 Safar) along with numerous exalted and glorious Tablets specifically for you and for her eminence your mother - upon her be all the Glory of God - and three other Tablets, as well as a Tablet of Visitation specifically for the Most Exalted Leaf - upon her be all the Glory of God and His most exalted Splendor. Every letter thereof testifies to God’s favor and grace towards His Most Exalted Leaf. No acknowledgment of receipt has reached this servant, which is most strange. I beseech you to provide details. For this reason, this servant has submitted this most brief petition. The letter from the honored and beloved Aqa Mirza Ashraf - upon him be the glory of God and His favor - arrived last week, and likewise this time what you sent, the blessed handwriting which was presented before His presence. These exalted words descended from the heaven of grace, His word, exalted and mighty be He:</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>Whatever the friends of God submit to you verbally or in writing should be presented to the Most Holy Court. Rest assured that all will receive a response. He is the Answerer before, during and after the question. O My Afnan! Be steadfast in service to the Cause and speak in praise of God, the Lord of the worlds. In nights and days the Supreme Pen, despite the hardships endured in prison from the beginning of arrival until now, has not ceased from movement nor halted in utterance, save for limited occasions as a wisdom from Us. Be as thy Lord has been. Verily thy Lord knoweth and judgeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. One must with complete might and power hold fast unto the cord of wisdom and bestow new life upon the dead of the earth through the commanding Word. The power of speech and utterance was created for the mention of this station. Hold fast unto it and be of the thankful ones. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto hearing the Word of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>His honor Nazir, upon him be the Glory of God, previously sent a letter to this servant and wrote that they had sent a petition from Abadeh which his honor Afnan, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, was to forward to the Most Holy Court. Due to lack of time they gave it to this servant to forward to the Most Holy Court, and they themselves would later provide details. After these matters were presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and mention was made of his honor Khan and the petition of his honor Aqa Mirza Ashraf, upon them both be the Most Glorious Glory of God, several firm and blessed verses were revealed from the heaven of divine will especially for them. God willing, may they be refreshed and revived by the fragrances of the verses of the True One, glorified be His majesty, and from the Kawthar of the utterance of the All-Merciful, and may they bestow that which they have attained. Likewise, the promise of bounty was given in response to the petition of his honor Aqa Mirza Ashraf. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Generous Giver. Those aforementioned blessed verses have been recorded in the letter which this servant wrote to his honor Nazir, upon him be the Glory of God. Your honor and the honored Afnans, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God, should peruse the letter and then forward it to his honor Nazir wherever he may be. His honor Nazir sent a petition from someone (named Ali Effendi) and likewise made mention through someone (Haji Muhammad Ali). A response to both was graciously given - God willing it will reach them and they will attain. The true submission of this servant is that I present greetings, nothingness, humility and submissiveness to his honor the illustrious Khalil, the promoter of the Cause of God, and likewise to their honors the Afnans, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God. Praise be to God, they have attained the special heavenly table. This is the essence, and whatever else is said is secondary. The Glory shining and manifest from the horizon of the heaven of the grace of our Lord and our Beloved be upon you and upon those who hear your words and love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds. The Servant. On 27 Rabi’al-Thani 1300. The petitions that were received this time with your honor’s signature - however there was no opportunity to present the petitions. God willing, after they are presented and gain the honor of being heard, whatever shines forth from the horizon of grace will be sent. The command is in His hand - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>

<p>In His Name, exalted be His glory, the most Glorious and the most Powerful!</p>
<p>Praise be unto that one true Goal, unto Whom all the peoples of the world, whether learned or mystic, noble or mighty, have confessed and acknowledged His oneness, and have likewise admitted their powerlessness to truly know His sacred Being as He is. He is the One, the Unique, the Powerful, the Mighty. When the waves of the ocean of bounty appeared, He brought forth creation from sheer nothingness through His most exalted Word, that all might be adorned, according to their capacity, with the knowledge of His sacred Being. He hath ever been a hidden and treasured Mystery, and will forever remain as He hath been - the One, the Unique, the Mighty, the Bestower. Every tongue hath been rendered mute before the waves of His ocean of utterance, and all hearts and minds have been bewildered before the dawning-lights of the Sun of His knowledge. He hath ever been sanctified beyond all praise and mention, and beyond all that the denizens of the kingdom of creation have uttered.</p>
<p>When the path was blocked and the quest proved futile, out of pure grace and as a manifestation of His greatest favor to humanity, He sent forth Books and Messengers that they might guide all creation to the highest horizon. These are the Manifestations of His Cause, the Dawning-places of His revelation, the Day-springs of His inspiration, and the Recipients of divine knowledge. Whoso hath followed them hath been reckoned among the companions of the right hand in the perspicuous Book, and whoso hath remained heedless hath been recorded among the companions of the left. All Books and Messengers reached their culmination in the Seal of the Prophets and the Lord of the chosen ones, unto whom was revealed the Book named the Furqan in the kingdom of utterance, through which He manifested His will and every wise command, and by which the Beloved lamented and the back of every remote polytheist was broken.</p>
<p>And now, O my beloved, thy letter was received and became the cause of joy and gladness. And as it was adorned and embellished with mention of the chosen ones and faithful ones of God - exalted be His glory - it brought forth a world of expansion and delight. May you ever drink from the choice wine of the love of the Beloved of all possibility, and remain occupied in remembrance and mention of God’s chosen ones.</p>
<p>And as for what you wrote concerning the honored and forgiven departed father - upon him be the ocean of God’s care and mercy - in truth this servant is powerless to describe his station and offer fitting praise, for whatever might be said would not be worthy, as he was among those souls who were illumined and adorned by the lights of the sun of steadfastness. Such expressions of favor have been shown regarding him that every pen is incapable and falls short of their mention. A house has been built for him by the hands of grace that the passing of ages and centuries cannot alter. God willing, that honored beloved one is engaged with utmost joy and delight. The glance of favor has been and will continue to be upon you. As you mentioned that his honored presence - upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory - gave you tidings of the aforementioned word, the matter is as he spoke it. Every person of insight has testified and will testify to his awareness, and every hearing ear has borne and will bear witness to his station. Due to the veils of the people, this ephemeral one has made and makes brief mention. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist you in that which He loves and is pleased with, and to confirm you in what is befitting. And regarding what you wrote about acting on your behalf, that which was beloved - this servant succeeded in carrying it out. Blessed are you and blessed is this poor and lowly servant. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Convey greetings and glorification to the friends. God willing, may all act according to what God has willed in all days and nights, and hold fast to what God loves. Verily He is the Protector of those who have turned to Him and believed in His clear Book. The mercy and peace be upon you all.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Mighty!</p>
<p>This is submitted: Your esteemed letter indicating the good health of your blessed person arrived like the Egyptian Bashir as a herald of glad tidings, reaching the spiritual Canaan which is the city of the heart. The fragrance of faithfulness was inhaled from this garment; it brought joy and increased comfort. The realms of sorrow were rolled up and the carpet of delight was spread forth. The banner of love was raised high while anguish bowed its head.</p>
<p>However, there was complaint about the brevity of the correspondence. Indeed, the friends in the true garden who are intoxicated in the spiritual rose garden by the divine wine, who are stirred to ecstasy by the spiritual melody, who are unconscious of their own existence and are effervescent from the wine of mercy, are not content with little and do not become hung over from much. Before them, the books of contingent existence are as a mere letter, and the ocean of utterance as but a single cup, for they have withdrawn from contingent existence and chosen seclusion in the realm beyond space. The vat cannot satisfy love’s hangover, nor can the ocean cool the heat of longing. These two verses were spoken in this regard:</p>
<p>Whatever wine you have in the wine-house will not cure love’s fever</p>
<p>O cup-bearer, bring forth an ocean of that spiritual wine</p>
<p>So that this concealed, love-maddened one may cry out in ecstasy</p>
<p>So that this divine-intoxicated one may rise above this hangover</p>
<p>The fish is never sated with water, nor the lover satisfied with the beloved. Should the loved one gaze upon the beauty of the beloved for a thousand years, it would seem but an hour, and should he drink for ages the pure wine from the honey of union, it would seem but a moment. Their joy is in sacrificing heart and soul, and their sorrow in being occupied with this and that. Rumi says:</p>
<p>Lovers drain the cup of joy only when</p>
<p>Their beloveds slay them with their own hands</p>
<p>Furthermore, how can one speak of these ungrateful people whom you know, who harbor such envy in their hearts and conceal such malice in their breasts? They breathe not except in accordance with their own desires and seek naught but their own passions, even as He saith: “Seest thou him who taketh his own passion for his god?” With all these conditions which are manifest and evident unto you, and hidden from others, how can the divine Nightingale warble upon the mystic branch, or the Hoopoe of Sheba speak of the Abode of Eternity? Silence is better than utterance. The mystics of beauty have strung these pearls of utterance: two things are more pleasing and delightful than all else - a receptive heart and appealing words. But now, which heart among this people shall I seek, and from which flower shall I inhale this fragrance? “God hath sealed their hearts and their hearing, and over their eyes is a veil.” It is known that none but the ear of truth can hear the divine melody, and none but the eye of the spirit can behold the countenance of the Beloved. “They have eyes with which they see not, and ears with which they hear not.” Although truth is in itself distinct from falsehood as the sun from its own non-existent shadow, yet some non-entities have claimed existence and raised the standard of oppression, though they have not tasted a single letter from the ocean of knowledge nor a drop from the boundless sea of wisdom. They attribute to these recluses in the sanctuary of unity that which befits only themselves. “The envious one is wroth with him who hath no fault.” But by divine grace their hands are short while the tree of celestial power is exceedingly tall. “God will not consent save that He perfect His light, though the unbelievers abhor it.” How well saith the Mathnavi in this regard:</p>
<p>O Ziya’u’l-Haqq, Husamu’d-Din, both heart and soul,</p>
<p>Before whose presence heart and soul stand abashed;</p>
<p>These pieces of clay, in their envy,</p>
<p>Seek to veil thy sun from sight.</p>
<p>What can I say? The song of the nightingale is discerned from that of the raven, and the cooing of the dove from the cawing of the crow. Though I have no ensign but silence, and seek no token but obscurity, all these meaningless utterances have arisen. Alas! Should this Bird of Iraq warble melodies of the Hijaz, and this divine Falcon adorn the gathering with holy celestial tunes, and bring the intoxicated ones to their senses through the song of the immortal birds, then would it become evident how far these lost ones have strayed from the lofty stations of divine knowledge. It seems they have no share of the ocean of certitude, and have not reached the goal of reunion which is the purpose of creation. O ears bereft of hearing! O hearts devoid of understanding! God willing, through divine grace and Muhammadan virtue, may we gather at the shore of the sea of unity and partake of the wine of detachment, that we may sever our hearts from all else and bind them to the Friend.</p>

<p>O my God, praise be to Thee! I testify at this moment to Thy unity and Thy singleness, and that Thou art He Who hath ever been without any mention of aught else beside Thee and shalt ever continue to be as Thou hast been in the glory of Thy majesty and grandeur. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Conquering, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! How can I mention before Thee what hath befallen me in these days - that which hath not befallen anyone before me - and verily Thou art All-Knowing, All-Informed. Thou art He Who, O my God, cast the love of me into the hearts of Thy chosen ones and loved ones before they knew me or became aware of Thy Cause in my person. Then afterwards Thou didst try them with separation when the decree of separation after union dawned from the horizon of severance. And thereby my heart and their hearts were consumed to such a degree that they left their homes out of longing to meet Thee and in quest of reunion with Thee. Some died in exile without attaining the spring of Thy reunion and the Kawthar of Thy grace. Some were scattered throughout the lands, and none knoweth what befell them or what they endured. The breezes of reunion from the direction of meeting Thee never wafted upon them, and the sun of grace never shone upon them from the horizon of Thy beauty.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O my God, for their lamentation in their separation from Thee and their cry of anguish at their remoteness from union with Thee! Though they disobeyed Thy command, O my Beloved, by departing from Thy city, yet by Thy glory, naught made them leave except the rapture of yearning for Thee and the ecstasy of Thy love, one drop of which draws all created things to the seat of the sanctity of the Sovereign of Thy unity and transforms all existence to the summit of glory of the King of Thy singleness.</p>
<p>By Thy glory, O my Lord and my Hope! Even if the eyes of all who are in the heavens and on earth were to shed tears from the beginning that hath no beginning to the end that hath no end for their grief at being far from Thee and their agitation at separation from Thee, it would still be too little, too little. By Thy glory, Thou hast indeed been witness and aware of this.</p>
<p>Among them, O my God, are those who did not leave Thy city, as Thou hadst forbidden them by Thy binding command, yet the fire of separation seized them to such a degree that they sacrificed their souls for Thy name and their spirits ascended unto Thee in the Most Exalted Horizon and the Most Glorious Companion. Therefore, O my God, raise up their spirits through Thy sovereignty in such wise that there may appear from them the lights of the glory of Thy unity and the manifestations of the sanctity of Thy singleness.</p>
<p>Then spread abroad, O my God, their traces in the realms of the glory of Thy Self-Sufficiency and the worlds of the sanctity of Thy singleness. Then make them, O my God, to endure through Thy permanence, to gaze upon Thy beauty, to stand fast in Thy mysteries, and to have dominion over Thy creation and Thy creatures. Then make them, O my God, to be ever joined to the sovereignty of Thy reunion and the King of Thy presence in such wise that their faces shall never turn away from Thy face throughout the eternity of eternities. Verily Thou art the Lord of Glory and Majesty, and verily Thou art the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! By Thy glory, my tribulations have reached such a point that all encompassing knowledge and mention have been cut off therefrom, such that I am unable to enumerate them in Thy kingdom or mention them in the court of the glory of Thy unity. Shall I mention, O my God, my exile and estrangement, or my distress and desperation, or my trials at the hands of enemies, or my poverty in the midst of the wretched, or my arrival in this Most Great Prison, or shall I mention what hath befallen Thy loved ones in Thy path and Thy creatures in the ways of Thy good-pleasure? Or shall I mention, O my God, what befell me after my departure from thy city and unto my house wherein were raised thy remembrance and the standards of thy guidance and the lights of the glory of thy oneness, and which thou didst make a symbol in thy kingdom for the people of thy love and a treasure for thy creation among the people of thy chosen ones, and which thou didst distinguish among all places on earth for the exaltation of thy remembrance and the promotion of thy Cause, wherein entered the transgressors among thy creation and the rebellious among thy servants, and they plundered whatsoever was therein, and thereby did they show arrogance against thee and violate thy sanctity and dishonour thy glory before thine enemies. By thy glory, O my God! They have reached in their rebellion the summit of transgression, and heedlessness hath seized them to such degree that they imagined thee to be unaware of them and their deeds, though thou wert ever cognizant of them and their actions. By thy glory, O my God! Nothing made them heedless of thy knowledge save the manifestations of thy glorious concealment and the evidences of thy holy bountifulness. Therefore, O my God, forgive their misdeeds and their transgressions if they return unto thee and turn in repentance unto thee, for they know not and perceive not. Although their transgression, O my God, is greater than the creation of the heavens and the earth, yet thy forgiveness is greater than all things. Then send down upon them, O my God, that which will purify their hearts and their souls. Then remind them, O my God, of the days of meeting thee. Then inspire them with that which will keep them from all that beseemeth not thy presence and befitteth not thy sovereignty. Verily thou art the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Sovereign, the All-Knowing, the Powerful, the Exalted, the All-Perceiving, the All-Compelling, the Victorious, the All-Demanding, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Then I beseech thee, O my God, by Him Whom thou didst manifest aforetime and Whom thou wilt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, that thou transform this night by the lights of the morn of thy meeting and this darkness by the radiance of the dawn of thy beauty. Then aid, O my God, him who aideth thee through himself and followeth thee in thy Cause, though all who are in the heavens and on earth oppose him. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted Lord</p>
<p>The servant testifies that there is no God but Him, acknowledging His power and oneness, and confessing His sovereignty and singleness. He hath ever been sanctified beyond my comprehension and the comprehension of all created things, and beyond what my tongue and the tongues of all contingent beings can express. Whoso testifieth to the sanctity of His Being above all likeness and comparison, and confesseth his powerlessness to know Him, is among the believers in His Book and the near ones among His servants. Exalted is this most glorious station and this most high rank. Blessings and peace be upon Him through Whom the carpet of beginning was spread out and the decree of ending was made manifest, through Whom the Sun of knowledge dawned and the horizon of certitude was illumined, through Whom the idols wailed and the false deities were struck down, and through Whom all graven images were shattered. And upon His family and companions who heard the call from the Tongue of Grandeur and Glory, who responded and arose to serve the Cause in the realm of creation, and through whom the standards of unity and the banners of divine oneness were raised. These are the servants whom God hath described, both before and after, in His Books, His Scriptures, His Psalms and His Tablets. Blessed is he who followeth in their footsteps, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice for your honor. Your letter dated the 22nd of blessed Ramadan, numbered 2, brought the utmost joy and gladness. It was as the supreme antidote for the poison of separation and remoteness, and as the water of life for those thirsting in the desert of love and faithfulness. After its perusal and review, I turned toward the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence and presented a detailed account. He said: “God willing, the fire of separation shall be transformed for them through the blessed word ‘coolness and safety’, and the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree shall so possess them that every still thing shall be moved, every extinguished thing shall be ignited, and every solid thing shall melt and flow. Verily, He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Remembering, the Compassionate, the Generous.” At times when the location was the palace and you were observed from afar, and likewise in the prison when standing before the gate, your state remains the same, observed by the Eye that slumbereth not. We send greetings and glorification upon you and upon those who hold fast to the Sure Handle and cling to the hem of God’s grace, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Indeed, if correspondence is not entirely illumined by the light of reunion, at least half of it, as they say, is illumined, for it is observed that it soothes the grieving heart and removes the sorrow of separation. The servant praises and thanks his Lord for enabling him to behold your traces and for assisting him to present this response. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Generous, in both beginning and return. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. Regarding what you wrote about a previous envelope numbered 1 that you sent via Ottoman post, it has not yet arrived. Despite searching and inquiry, nothing has come of it. It remains delayed, but perhaps God will cause it to appear later. Verily, He has power over all things.</p>
<p>I am aware of your attention and of the day of that eminence’s departure from Beirut. God willing, wherever they arrive, may the guardians of that place give voice and utterance to the blessed word “My Lord, cause me to land at a blessed landing-place.” I beseech the Most High to place divine grace before you, the hosts of protection behind you, the banner of guidance to your right, the seas of utterance to your left, the sun of bounty above you, and the carpet of certitude beneath your feet, and may all good things encompass you. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Forgiving, the Generous, the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning the Tree, in truth during the time of journey and mental turmoil and affairs, that eminence’s attention is not on these matters. This is but from the perfection of grace and love, unless God, exalted be His glory, bestows a bounty and delivers this evanescent one somewhat from embarrassment. Praise be to God that mention of that true Beloved has been and continues to be especially before the Most Holy Court and in the presence of the Branches of the Blessed Tree and the people of the pavilion of virtue and chastity. O my Lord and my Beloved! In these days sorrow hath encompassed all, for the Cause of God and the Faith of God have been weakened. The enemies lie in ambush from every direction while this small band is without helper or assistant. What can I say about what has befallen Islam? The divine religion and divine cause that were the reason and means of unity and concord have now become the source of discord. In any case, now this evanescent one and that beloved and all the loved ones of God must beseech God, exalted be His glory, with utmost humility and supplication for victory and relief, for until the time of hardship and difficulty for God’s servants is not followed by ease and comfort… The Command is in His hands - He doeth and judgeth as He pleaseth, and He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. May the glory shining from the horizon of our Lord the All-Merciful’s grace be upon your eminence and upon those with you and upon those who love you and who hearken to your words for God and in God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>Hearken unto the call from the direction of the Most Great Prison, wherein speaketh the Ancient King: “Verily, there is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” He hath come Who walketh upon the horizons of the earth and speaketh before all faces that which draweth the servants nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The Euphrates of utterance hath flowed from My Pen, and God hath quickened thereby every mouldering bone. We were seated upon the throne when thy letter arrived. We read it and answered thee with verses whereby the hearts of them that are brought near have been drawn.</p>
<p>The armies of the world have not prevented Us from the remembrance of God, the Founder of nations. Verily, He hath come from the horizon of power with a sovereignty that hath conquered all who are in the heavens and on earth. Blessed art thou for having heard and turned toward this luminous horizon on a day wherein most of the people of the earth have turned away, as every assured soul doth testify. The fragrance of verses hath been diffused, the clear proofs have appeared, and the scratching of the Pen hath been raised, yet the peoples are in thick veils. Their vain imaginings have barred them from God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou for having acknowledged that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. We have found in thy letter the fragrance of steadfastness in this Cause whereby have slipped the feet of the divines who broke God’s covenant and His testament, and pronounced judgment against Him with manifest injustice. Let not the utterances of the doubtful ones, who have disbelieved in God’s verses when they were sent down in truth and who have spoken that which hath caused the denizens of the most exalted Paradise to lament at morn and eve, grieve thee.</p>
<p>Give thanks unto God for having remembered thee in the Most Great Prison time and again, and at this moment wherein His Most Great Branch speaketh thy praise and writeth before His face. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Be thou a speaker of His remembrance, a bearer of His Book, and a helper of His Cause, the wondrous, through wisdom and utterance. Verily, He is the Helper, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Hearken in the Persian tongue! Time and again hast thou attained unto the divine verses and quaffed from the sealed wine, and in the days when darkness encompassed the world thou wert illumined by the effulgent rays of the Luminary of Revelation which shone forth in this radiant morn. His is the praise, His the thanksgiving, His the bounty, His the majesty and glory. There hath been and is no doubt that the Truth, exalted be His glory, hath ever been and is the All-Knowing, the All-Protecting, the All-Encompassing, and the All-Powerful. All affairs are in the grasp of His might. Not a thing escapeth His knowledge. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Yet in these days this Wronged One hath donned the garment of camel’s hair, and though the lights of Revelation have encompassed the world, He hath veiled Himself. Whatsoever hath been announced in the divine Books of the past and future - these are the most exalted of days, and in this station naught but the mention of Divinity hath been made, even as the Seal of the Prophets hath said: “The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.” The Primal Point, at the beginning of the Persian Bayan, declareth: “He verily speaketh in every condition, saying: ‘I am God’” to the end of the verse. And likewise in another station, in speaking of this Revelation, He saith: “I am the first to worship Him.” Today the verses have encompassed the world and the evidences have embraced all things. The ocean of utterance surgeth in the midmost heart of contingent being, and the Sun of Revelation casteth its effulgences from all horizons. Yet vision and hearing are rare. Beseech the Lord that He deprive not His servants of the splendors of the Most Great Luminary. Most of the people of Iran know and are aware that this Wronged One arose with perfect steadfastness before the faces of all the world and summoned all to the Dayspring of divine knowledge and the Dawning-Place of His celestial revelation. With a single pen He struck upon the swords of the world. Blessed are they who have attained unto His grace and recognized that for which they were created from the void of non-existence. O thou who gazest upon His countenance! The Cause of this Wronged One is clear and evident as the sun, yet the heedless servants are occupied with names and remain oblivious of their Lord, as thou dost witness. In most matters We pass judgment according to outward appearances and hold fast to visible means, for this is required by God’s consummate wisdom, as is the manifestation in human form. When thou art enraptured by the wine of My utterance and art raised to the kingdom of My knowledge, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me to the ocean of Thy grace and enabled me to turn toward the horizon of Thy Revelation, whereby the horizons of the cities of Thy knowledge and wisdom were illumined. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Signs and the manifestations of Thy grandeur in the kingdom of creation to ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will enable me to associate with Thy chosen ones in every world of Thy worlds. O my Lord! Thou seest the thirsty one hastening to the ocean of Thy mercy, the seeker advancing toward Thy grace, and the silent one drawn to the kingdom of Thy utterance. I implore Thee not to withhold from me that which is with Thee. Write down for me, O my God, the good of this world and the next. Then forgive me and my parents and those for whom Thou hast desired the wondrous tokens of Thy bounty and favor. Thou art He through Whose Name the ocean of forgiveness surged and the fragrance of Thy name, the All-Merciful, was wafted. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

Verily there is none other God but Him. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and all are recorded with Him in a preserving tablet.</p>
<p>O Mir-Qabl-Muhammad! Hearken unto that which the Nightingale of Separation warbleth unto thee at this hour when leg was wrapped around leg, when every covenant was broken save the Covenant of God thy Lord, the Creator, and when every book and page was rendered void save the Tablets of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful. O Mir! Detach thyself from the world and all that is therein, all that lieth between, and all that is upon it. Follow not the steps of the idolaters, but put thy trust in God thy Lord and be of them that are steadfast in the Faith of this Youth, the Divine, the Iraqi, the Manifest One. Through Him have all religions been established since the time when Adam was created from water and clay, and shall continue to be established unto the end that hath no end.</p>
<p>O Mir! Cleanse the mirror of thy heart from all defilement that thou mayest find therein the image of this Wronged One, the Captive, Who hath fallen beneath the swords of hatred through that which the hands of these idolaters have wrought - they who say with their tongues “By God, we believed in ’Ali-Qabl-Nabil,” yet when the sovereign Manifestation of His Cause appeared, they denied Him and pronounced Him false, until they issued the decree for His death just as previous peoples decreed death for the Prophets and Messengers. The tongue of their innermost hearts beareth witness that they are they who lie at every moment and every hour.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Beauty and by the splendors of the Sun of Thy grace and bounty to detach me from whatsoever is in the heavens and earth, and to render me wholly devoted to Thy resplendent and most glorious Countenance and sincerely dedicated to Thy most exalted Faith, O Thou Who art sanctified above all that can be known or uttered and all that can be witnessed through speech. Then I beseech Thee, O my God, by the clouds of Thy generosity and benevolence, and by the rain-clouds of Thy tender mercy and compassion, to cause the showers of Thy glorious loving-kindness to descend upon the soil of my heart, that there may spring forth from it the vegetation of Thy knowledge and wisdom, making me wholly trusting in Thy most luminous Countenance. O Lord! The polytheists failed to recognize the essence of Thy Being and covered their eyes with the veils of associating partners with Thee, to the point where they ruled to put to death the Manifestation of Thy most glorious Self, and arose to that end that people might rise in support of this deed, and caused some to stray from Thy path through the false words that issued from their mouths. Therefore, O my Beloved, seize them with Thy severe chastisement for what their hands have wrought. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. Thou doest what Thou pleasest and ordainest what Thou desirest. Verily, Thou art the Originator and the Restorer, and Thou art the All-Hearing, the Answerer of prayers. Then forgive my sins, O my Beloved, and conceal my faults, O my Adored One, and let me not be heedless for less than a moment of the remembrance of Thy beauty. Verily, Thou art the Truth, there is no God but Thee. Unto Thee is the beginning and the return. No possessor of pure reason can ever know Thy essence. And verily, O Mir-Muhammad, hear Thou my call and be not of the heedless. Detach thyself from all that hath been created in dust, for it shall perish while the words of thy Lord shall endure for all eternity. And upon thee and upon those who hearken to my words be the Spirit, glory and majesty.</p>

<p>Your letter was received, bringing joy and gladness. We beseech the Truth to confirm you in that which He loveth and is pleased with. After presenting the letter before Him, He spoke: “O Husayn, upon thee be My peace! Give thanks to the Intended One of the world and the Lord of nations Who confirmed thee in His recognition. We testify that there is none other God but Him, acknowledging His oneness and confessing His singleness, submitting to His Cause and all that appeareth from Him. Verily, He is the Protector of whosoever loveth Him and the Answerer of whosoever calleth upon Him.”</p>
<p>We beseech Him to ordain for thee that which is conducive to the good of this world and the next. Be not saddened by the diverse affairs of this world. Verily, joy cometh after sorrow, ease after hardship, comfort after distress, tranquility after agitation, and glory after abasement. Thus doth the Wronged One make mention of thee that thou mayest rejoice and be of those who are thankful.</p>
<p>Today all the sincere ones and they that are detached must beseech the Self-Sufficing Lord for that which will safeguard and protect the Cause of God. The enemies have encompassed it and each day they demolish one of its pillars. Alexandria is on the brink of drowning, and likewise other lands. Each day they seek to destroy one of its members, and all these things are the punishment for their deeds. All must turn to the Truth, glorified be His majesty, with the utmost lowliness and supplication, and seek forgiveness, that perchance the ocean of divine mercy might surge and wash away the dust of disobedience.</p>
<p>The pure Faith, for numbered years, was occupied with itself and heedless of others. They disputed and quarreled with each other over words whose meaning they knew not, and their enmity became so firmly rooted that it caused the very foundation to tremble. We beseech the True Architect to protect it and save it from ruin. He is, verily, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>In all conditions, hold fast to the firm cord and cling to the luminous hem of divine favor. You have not been forgotten, nor shall you ever be - you and all those souls who are truly adorned with the ornament of detachment and illumined with the light of divine knowledge. We send Our greetings. Verily, the Wronged One remembers those whose names thou didst mention before in the letter that was presented. We beseech God, exalted be He, to grant them success and to ordain for them from His Most Exalted Pen that which befitteth His generosity, bounty, grace, and bestowal. Verily, He is the Generous, the Bountiful. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! In these days the heat of fasting hath increased the fire of love in the hearts of the lovers and the obedient ones, and this is among the greatest bounties of the Lord. We beseech the Truth to assist His servants that they may act in utmost joy and fragrance according to that which they have been commanded. One deed performed in the path of God hath ever been and shall ever be the cause of salvation, and is like unto a lamp before all faces in all the worlds. The explanation of this station cannot be completed nor concluded through the utterance of one such as this evanescent one. In all conditions we hold fast to the cord of His grace. We have committed all affairs unto Him and have placed our trust in Him. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Haji Ibrahim, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah], it was submitted. He commanded that they should engage in trade and business with the utmost joy and fragrance, and if they should afterwards return to Iran, this too would be well-pleasing. We beseech God to aid all, that there may be manifested from the servants that which befitteth their servitude unto Him. The bounties of the world are in the grasp of His power. Assuredly He hath not deprived and will not deprive His loved ones, and if for a few days hardship should occur, this hath been and is due to the requirements of consummate wisdom. By My life! Soon shall the doors of ease be opened before the faces of the unitarians, and rivers of wealth and affluence shall flow in the cities and lands. Verily He is the Almighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant conveyeth greetings to them and beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to preserve them beneath the shade of the Tree of His providence. Verily He hath power over all things. In all circumstances they should be mindful of wisdom and hold fast to the divine law. Goodly deeds are as lights. We beseech God not to deprive His servants of these brilliant, shining lights. We are all His servants, turning unto Him and beseeching Him. In the prayer of Kumayl ibn Ziyad al-Nakha’i it is said: “Until all my deeds and devotions become one continuous devotion, and my state in Thy service eternal.” We beseech Him to give His servants to drink from the Kawthar of this exalted word. He is the Generous, He is the Merciful, and He is the Kind. Peace be upon you and upon the sincere servants of God, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O servant who hath gazed upon the Countenance! There hath come before Us thy letter which thou didst send to the servant who standeth before the Throne, and from it were inhaled the sweet savors of love, as did the denizens of the Supreme Paradise and they who dwell within the pavilion of glory beside the crimson sea of eternity upon whose shore the very atoms of dust proclaim that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who hath appeared with the truth is indeed His sovereignty, His command, His remembrance and His glory amongst all created things. Blessed art thou for having been attracted by the divine fragrances and for having inhaled the musk-like scents from that Paradise which from time immemorial had been hidden within God’s knowledge. When We found thy soul enkindled with the warmth of the love of God, thy spirit turned toward the quarter of His mercy, and thy tongue speaking His praise, We sent unto thee this Tablet, which in the Kingdom of eternity hath been named the Scroll of Command, in the Heaven of glory the Holy Tablet, in the cities on high the Leaf of Glory, and in the Concourse of grandeur the Preserved Book. Thus was the matter inscribed by the ruby pen upon the Tablet. Blessed be thy soul for having been stirred by God’s remembrance and praise, and blessed be thy heart for having borne that Trust which the dwellers of earth and heaven refused to bear. Thus hath the matter been recorded in the Mother Book by the Pen of God. Rejoice thou within thyself and be a bearer of glad-tidings between earth and heaven regarding this Sun which hath shone forth from the horizon of holiness with such radiance as hath illumined the inmates of the all-highest Paradise and those who have held fast to the cord of justice in these days wherein the Beauty of the All-Glorious hath been established upon the throne of His name, the All-Merciful, and hath uttered a Word whereat all who are in the heavens and on earth swooned away, save a limited number. Thus hath God distinguished between truth and falsehood and decreed the matter from His presence - verily He is wise over all things. Know thou moreover that the idolaters have surrounded Us from every side. Then he whom We had taught in these days and who was wont to stand before the Throne morning and eventide, when he felt secure in himself, arose in opposition in such wise as hath left all in the realm unable to describe. Say: O people! Fear God and deny not Him Who was promised you in all the Tablets, for Whose love the Primal Point sacrificed His exalted self and wept for Him throughout all days, as attesteth the Tablets which were in truth sent down from the heaven of the Command.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Would ye slay His Beloved, and yet recite His words? Woe unto you, O company of idolaters! What difference is there between you and the people of the Furqan? Judge ye fairly, and be not of the oppressors in the land. Say: Deaf are the ears that hear not the rustling of the Most Exalted Pen, and dumb are the tongues that move not in celebration of their Lord, the Most High, the All-Glorious, and non-existent are the beings that stir not at the fragrant breaths wafting from the divine paradise unto all creation. Say: O people! Fear ye God, and be not content with this world and all that hath been created therein, for soon shall ye find yourselves beneath layers of dust, and shall be questioned concerning this Youth Who hath appeared with the standards of victory in the kingdom of creation with a sovereignty that encompasseth all worlds. Say: Were God’s worlds confined to this world alone, by God, We would not have surrendered Ourself to the swords of Our enemies, as every possessor of keen sight doth testify. Say: O people! Were We to lift the veil of concealment from the face of mysteries by a finger’s breadth, ye would surely detach yourselves from your possessions and wealth, and would sacrifice your souls in the path of God, your Creator. Yet We have not lifted it, by reason of a wisdom that remaineth hidden from the eyes of the idolaters. Say: O people! Purify your hearts from all allusions, then rend asunder the veils of glory through the power of might and majesty, then raise up the pavilion of detachment around this canopy from whose horizon the lights of beauty are gloriously visible. Know thou, moreover, that there have emerged from the thicket of doubt a band of wolves, as We had foretold in previous Tablets. With Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and the knowledge of what is seen and unseen, preserved in scrolls hidden from the eyes of the idolaters. Blessed art thou, O servant who hath drunk from the cup of everlasting life in the name of thy Lord, the Most High, the All-Glorious, for thou hast held fast to the protection of thy Lord, and from the horizon of thy heart have shone forth the lights of thy Master’s love. Thus doth God single out whom He pleaseth through His grace, and verily He hath power over all things. Say: Praise be to God Who hath caused me to return unto Him, and hath made me know the Manifestation of His Self, and hath caused me to hear His wondrous melodies, and hath inspired within me that which hath stirred my soul and heart, and hath made me detached unto Him and observant of His good-pleasure and speaking in praise of His Self in days wherein the dwellers of the kingdom of creation were shaken, and all the tribes of the earth lamented, and the feet of every man of wisdom did slip. Thus have We conveyed unto thee the word of truth, and expounded for thee the verses that thine eyes might be solaced thereby, and that there might flow from thy heart springs of wisdom and utterance in remembrance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Bountiful, and that thou mightest ascend at all times unto the heaven that hath been raised up through this Announcement which was promised in the Tablets.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Most Glorious, the Most Resplendent</p>
<p>This letter is dispatched from this sorrowful, grief-stricken servant to that compassionate, trustworthy quarter: O friend, veil thy face from strangers and unveil it before the countenance of the Beloved. Abandon thy life and raise thy voice in remembrance of the Well-Beloved between earth and heaven, without concealment or restraint. Rend asunder the veil of silence and tear away the clouds of stillness. The Tongue of the All-Glorious hath spoken from the direction of the Throne, saying: Write! O Muhammad, the lover of the Beauty of the Friend findeth no rest and showeth no patience in His remembrance. Like unto the salamander, he casteth the fire of passion throughout all lands, in such wise that he consumeth and destroyeth all veils and allusions from all beings. O Muhammad, step forth from behind the veil of stillness in such manner that all the peoples of the world may be stirred and moved by thy movement, to such extent that all the maidens concealed in silken robes and the essence of all veiled hearts may emerge from their retreats of stillness and seclusion, unveiled and uncovered, giving voice to the praise of the Lord of Lords. O Muhammad! I swear by the Most Great Name that such power hath been manifested that were the hands of supplication of all created things to be raised toward the right hand of His bounty, all would return with radiant palms from the Sinai of divine grace and favor. Therefore, draw forth the illumined hand from the bosom of the Cause by the leave of the Creator of all beings, and guide the wayward in the valley of self and desire unto the most holy Ridvan and the most exalted Paradise of Glory. Be not grieved by the loss of the steadfast ones or the turning away of the deniers, for through prayer a people shall be raised up who will place the foot of detachment upon all who are in the heavens and the earth, who will shake the sleeve of sanctification over all that hath been created of water and clay, and who will hasten toward the Friend, heedless of self. Observe how in the year sixty so many people were veiled by those allusions concerning the appearance of the Qa’im which were held by the leaders of the people. Yet when the Light of the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Manifestation dawned from the horizon of transcendent glory, a people were raised up who effaced all these well-known allusions from their breasts and, with perfect dignity, submission and tranquility, set foot upon the straight path of glory, were hindered by no veil, and deterred by no prohibition or restriction. Thus doth He create beings through the sovereignty of His command, but the people understand not. Indeed, they became so detached from all things that even the mention of the Seal [of the Prophets], which was an explicit text of the Book, did not prevent them from attaining the exalted court and the praiseworthy station in the presence of the Sovereign Lord. And now they testify, both secretly and openly, that prophethood hath been from the beginning that hath no beginning and will continue unto the end that hath no end. Observe now what power hath been manifested, that removed their vision from all these words and guided them to the greatest perspective. In brief, the spring of the Sun and the rays of the Orb of divine unity and detachment cannot be sullied by the clay of envy, nor can it be deprived of its own outpouring. Soon shall appear servants who will not be veiled by any utterance, nor be deprived of the pristine reality by any words.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! After the dawning of the Countenance of the Glorious One at high noon, nothing shall profit anything else, even though it may appear most great in the eyes [of men] and weightier than all that hath been created openly. Let them account all save the Friend as non-existent and turn unto the known Sovereign. Several Surahs have been sent down from the heaven of eternity for that honored one - one was dispatched to Iraq and the Surah of [Dam] to the land of Ta, and likewise another sublime Tablet. God willing, they have reached and will reach [their destination]. In any case, this evanescent servant submitteth that: O thou who art my very life and the Physician of my grieving heart! Raise such a cry from thy soul as would awaken all the world from the slumber of heedlessness. What else can the power of thy tongue and the fire of thy luminous heart accomplish? And in this mail wherein there was no letter from that honored one, great sadness was occasioned. God willing, henceforth they will act contrary to this instance. And that Tablet which was sent to Iraq is that same promised Most Great Tablet that was previously mentioned. And then thy recognition that He is unto Himself a proof thereof, and His attributes are what He possesseth, and all else is powerless to describe Him, even were it the tongues of both worlds. A Tablet from the master of masters, Aqa Mirza Muhammad-’Ali, was sent; may you attain unto its perusal.</p>

The world is powerless to describe Him, for He, exalted be His glory, is known through naught else but Himself and is not described by the mention of aught besides Him. Exalted be His station, His sovereignty, and His remembrance!</p>
<p>After reading and becoming informed, attention was directed to the station and details were presented. The sun of grace is rising and the waves of the sea of bounty are manifest. My tongue falls short of mentioning this station and my pen is powerless to write what hath appeared from the decisive discourse. I beseech and hope from God, exalted be His glory, that He may unite the scattered words and adorn their letters with the ornament of unity. He is indeed the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>In all circumstances we seek divine confirmation and make supplication. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. I convey greetings to His Eminence, the honored one, and the other gentlemen. Likewise to the beloved of heart and soul, Aqa Muhammad Mu??afa, upon him be the peace of God, and the other friends who are illumined by the light of piety and engaged in the remembrance of the Lord of all beings. And likewise to the leaf of the family, upon her be the glory of God, and to the delight of eyes Badi’ Effendi and the Ridvaniyyih leaf, upon them both be the glory of God. I remember them with goodly remembrance and beseech God, exalted be His glory, for their well-being, might and exaltation. Peace be upon you and upon the sincere servants of God, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Again praise be to God, again praise be to God, again praise be to God for the wondrous bounty and the table sent down from the heaven of kindness and unity, upon which was inscribed the royal signature of the name of the All-Bountiful, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of creation. When it was opened, another fragrance was found indicating the first. We praised God for this and thanked Him for its arrival and advent, and its glad tidings of your health, your acceptance, your mention and your thoughts, your humility and your submissiveness, and all your deeds for God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The letters of that true loved one have truly been and continue to be a source of physical exhilaration and spiritual joy. Yesterday I troubled you with some worthless words, and now I venture this brief note. Indeed, brevity is most fitting and appropriate in all circumstances. I have beseeched and continue to beseech the Self-Sufficient Lord for confirmation and success for that beloved one, for verily He is the Answerer.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the Friend, this is most clear and evident. Whatever this servant submits, that beloved one accepts with utmost grace, especially if it pertains to the station that has no station. At present, expediency requires it here, and in delay there is no harm, rather in delay there is prosperity and clear signs. As commanded, it was delayed. I beseech God to make that beloved one the center of all services, and in truth they have been and are.</p>
<p>At this moment, as this letter was nearing completion, the letter of his honor Muhammad Mustafa (upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of Names), which had been written previously by the beloved of the heart, his honor Qasim (upon him be the peace of God), arrived bearing news of their health and well-being. This is glad tidings that gives the cup of joy to the friends and the chalice of tribulation to the enemies. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to replenish these two cups, for verily He has power over all things.</p>
<p>I convey greetings to them - greetings which God, exalted be His glory, renders free from tests. Likewise to his honor Jasim. God willing, may they remain under the shade of the divine Lote-Tree, safe, at rest, with gladdened eyes, refreshed in body, and light in spirit. I convey greetings to his honor Husayn Effendi and to all those of insight, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for protection. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise, glory, thanksgiving and splendor belong unto Him Who, blessed and exalted be He, through earthly and heavenly means, has enabled those thirsting after true love to attain the waters of reunion, and guided those seeking the presence of Him Who conversed on Sinai to the most exalted station and the loftiest summit. Glorious is His bounty, mighty is His grace, pre-existent is His mercy, and there is no God but Him.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice for your remembrance, your utterance, and your steadfastness! Your letter, which is the dawning-place of the inscriptions of the world of love, illumined like a lamp the city of heart and soul with its light. In truth it was a helpful assistant and trustworthy messenger, for it brought glad tidings of your blessed self’s well-being, as well as the arrival of the leaves of the Tree of Mercy. Perfect joy was attained, and after its perusal and observation, it was presented before His presence and achieved the honor of His attention, whereupon these exalted words issued forth from the Source of utterance and the Dawning-place of wisdom. His words, may our spirits be a sacrifice for Him:</p>
<p>He is the Kind, the All-Bountiful!</p>
<p>O My Afnan! Upon thee be the peace of God and His loving-kindness. Thou hast ever been and art still mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. The glances of love and bounty have been directed toward thee, and the numerous Tablets that have shone forth from the Dayspring of love and faithfulness bear witness to that which hath flowed from the tongue of utterance. We testify to that which thou hast mentioned, and thou thyself hast borne and dost bear witness to the stations and degrees of special favors. This grace and bounty shall be made manifest both in the realm of creation and in the kingdom of divine bestowal. Soon shall they who are nigh unto God witness that which they were promised in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. Be thou not grieved at anything. Put thy trust in Him Who hath strengthened thee, caused thee to know Him, brought thee into His presence, and enabled thee to hear the call of the Wronged One in His Most Great Prison. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having shown me the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance and caused me to hear Thy most sweet call through the tongues of Thy Messengers and Thy chosen ones. I beseech Thee by the fragrance of Thy garment in Yathrib and Batha, and by the breezes of Thy Revelation amongst mankind, to number me among such as have aided Thy Cause, raised the standards of Thy guidance and the banners of Thy utterance. Then open before my face, through the key of Thy Most Great Name, the doors of bounty, munificence and grace. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, clinging to Thy cord, and hoping for Thy grace and bounty. I beseech Thee not to deny me the pearls within the shells of the ocean of Thy generosity, O Thou Who art the Possessor of all existence and the Lord of the seen and unseen.</p>
<p>We send Our greetings to those who are in thy presence, and We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect them by His sovereignty and to ordain for them that which befitteth His grace and generosity. Verily, He is the Munificent, the All-Bountiful. There is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Mention thou, on behalf of the Wronged One, the honored Ibn and the leaves, each one of them, and illumine them with the splendors of the Day-Star of the Cause. They have had and continue to have permission to turn toward Him. Whenever wisdom and timing require it, let them turn toward Him. We beseech God to manifest that which is the cause of joy and the source of gladness. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! Loving-kindness, compassion and mercy are manifest and evident from every word. That honored master has ever been remembered in the heart and concealed in the human reality. I hope that this love may neither change nor be altered - though it entered with mother’s milk, it shall not depart with the soul. God willing, its departure has not been ordained and never shall be. That which I have beseeched and continue to beseech from God, exalted be His glory, through nights and days and at every hour, has been and remains protection, bounty, wealth, and service to the Cause - which is the greatest of divine bounties. I hope that through your presence in those regions there may be manifested that which will lead the servants to the stream of divine will and enable them to attain that for which they were created. Verily our Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayer. To each of the kinsmen and visitors I convey greetings, praise, glory and splendor, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, for eternal remembrance and everlasting favor for each one. Verily He is the Fulfiller of needs, the Revealer of verses, and the Lord of all names and attributes. Regarding what was written about Aqa Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God [Baha’u’llah], after it was presented, He wrote: “His turning and devotion have attained the glory of acceptance, as a favor from Us to My Afnan, upon him be My peace and loving-kindness.” End quote. I convey greetings to the friends of that land and beseech for them that which bears the renown of the Beloved. Verily supplication is from the servant and its answer from God, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Peace, praise, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those with you and those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>

<p>He is God - exalted be His station, the Most Great, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>Praise and glory befitteth the Lord of Names, Who hath bestowed from the ocean of truth the pearls of inner meanings, and caused the waters of utterance to flow from the mountains of grandeur, and hath granted to every created thing a measure of His bounty and generosity. He hath guided the lovers of His beauty to the most exalted Paradise, and bestowed upon those who seek His nearness and reunion a portion from the garden of His presence. He is the All-Knowing One Whom the ignorance of the world could not deter, and the All-Powerful One Whom the might of nations could not withhold. The faith of all created things added naught to His station, nor did the rebellion of beings diminish aught from His grace and generosity. The cloud of His bestowal hath ever rained down, and the sun of His bounty hath ever shone upon all existence. Exalted be His grandeur, sublime be His loftiness, and mighty be His dominion! There is none other God but Him.</p>
<p>The letter of that honored master arrived, and like the morning breeze it gave freshness to the withered heart and revived the lifeless body, for it was adorned with mention of the Desired One, the Sovereign of the unseen and the seen. From the glad tidings of the well-being of that spiritual friend, a new world appeared and boundless joy was attained. They have said that the world was created through the command “Be” (Kun), and in the realm of truth, this “K” is the “K” of remembrance of friends, and the “N” is the endless bounty of love. What you wrote was the essence of truth and a matter beyond dispute. After it was presented before His presence, He said - upon him be God’s care and mercy: “He hath spoken the truth and uttered what is right. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid him and make him successful, and to ordain for him that which shall benefit him outwardly and inwardly, and to open before his face the gate of glory and the gate of bounty and the gate of care and exaltation. Verily He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.” End.</p>
<p>His honor Haji Ghulamali (upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah]) arrived and recounted the details of that servant’s tribulations, as well as the transgressions of the treacherous souls. Glory be to God! What has become of the world’s understanding? Where has justice gone? What has become of fairness, that people fail to distinguish between the causes of honor and abasement, between light and darkness? Trustworthiness has been and remains the cause of the world’s prosperity, while treachery is the cause of ruin. We beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, not to deprive countries and regions of the lights of the sun of trustworthiness. What benefit has the treacherous one gained, and what harm has befallen the trustworthy? In any case, people are observed to be like children - education is needed, and an educator is needed.</p>
<p>Today among the peoples of the world, mention of love of country, patriotism and the like is heard to such an extent that there is not a single newspaper, gathering, or tongue that does not speak of this word and claim superiority therein. However, when put to the test, self-worship becomes clear and evident. Where are those souls of whom He says “and give them preference over themselves, even though poverty be their own lot”? And where are those souls who act for God’s sake and turn to God? The point is that they should speak with truthfulness and hold fast to deeds that are the cause of the glory of existence. The world of knowledge is illumined and radiant through the lights of the sun of truthfulness, and the world of vision is adorned and embellished through the effulgences of the light of trustworthiness. In short, now the clay pieces of the world praise themselves with the attributes of pearls, heedless that among creation there are and have been possessors of penetrating vision and attentive ears who can distinguish. To say more risks causing that honored one weariness.</p>
<p>I beseech God to adorn all with the ornament of truthfulness and uprightness. He is powerful and mighty over all things. They mentioned the influence, steadfastness and justice of those regions. These matters have been and are the cause of hope for many, and we beseech God to assist their manifestation, dawning-place and source at all times with the means of earth and heaven, that the orb of justice may rise from the horizon of Iran’s heaven with perfect light and radiance, without cloud or veil, and cast its rays upon all, in such wise that not a single atom remains deprived. Every deed has had and has its own effect. God willing, the effect of justice will reveal its fruit. Mention of justice and its influence brought boundless joy. Detached souls are educated under the shadow of the sun of justice, and through those souls the world is renewed and the orb of fairness appears. In this case, all will observe themselves in the cradle of peace and security with perfect joy and delight. We have been and are supplicating, and it is certain that God, exalted be His glory, will grant the response. Verily, He has power over all things. Peace and praise and glory be upon you and upon those with you.</p>

<p>He is the One through Whom the ocean of utterance has surged before the faces of all religions.</p>
<p>Glorified be He Who has made manifest the Path, sent down the Proof, and caused all things to speak forth with the most exalted call that there is none other God but He, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: O people of the Kingdom of Names! By God, the Creator of heaven has come before the faces of the learned and the princes. On His right is the banner of Utterance and on His left the standard of Proof. Blessed is the soul that hath witnessed what God hath witnessed and hath attained unto that which hath been manifested in truth from this luminous horizon. Through Him the Kawthar of eternity hath flowed from the Supreme Pen, the Trump hath been sounded, and all who are in earth and heaven were thunderstruck, save them whom God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, pleased to exempt.</p>
<p>Say: O peoples of the earth! Hearken unto the Call which hath been raised from the Most Exalted Horizon, and be not of the heedless ones. O people! That which ye possess will profit you not this day. Cast away the things of the world and its ornaments, and take hold of that which ye have been commanded by God, the Lord of all worlds. Beware lest the ornaments of earth prevent you from attaining the precincts of the near ones. Hasten unto the good-pleasure of God, then with the eye of justice and fairness look upon Him Who hath come from the horizon of power with a Cause before which the hosts of vain imaginings cannot stand. Unto this the Mother Book beareth witness in this exalted station.</p>
<p>That which thou didst send before in the name of bounty hath come before Our presence. We have answered thee with this Tablet which speaketh in the realm of divine knowledge that He is God, there is none other God but He, the Single, the All-Informed. This is a day wherein the Possessor and the kingdom and the realm belong to God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Say: O peoples of the earth! Answer the call of God that is raised amongst you, then behold what hath appeared from Him. He remembereth you and draweth you nigh unto Him. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>When thou beholdest the waves of the ocean of the Most Merciful’s utterance, say: O Lord of Religions! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me in Thy days, shown me the traces of Thy Pen, made me to know Thy path, the Dawning-Place of Thy mighty signs, and the Dayspring of Thy Revelation and Thy mysteries. O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven! I testify that Thou hast appeared and manifested that which every living being hath proclaimed concerning Thy oneness, Thy singleness, Thy might, Thy greatness and Thy sovereignty. I beseech Thee, O Light of the world, by Thy Most Great Name whereby the hearts of nations were stirred, and by the lands which were honored by Thy footsteps, and by the air wherein Thy call was raised, and by the spot which Thou didst adorn with Thy presence and didst make the Greatest Panorama among mankind, to assist me to serve Thy Cause among Thy servants with wisdom and utterance. Thou art the Mighty, the Helper. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance to manifest through me that which will attract the hearts of Thy creation and draw them nigh unto the horizon of Thy manifestation and cause them to drink the cup of steadfastness from the hands of Thy grace and bounty. O Lord! Thou seest the distant one who hath sought Thy nearness, and the weary one who hath intended the kingdom of Thy remembrance and desired from Thee the wondrous tokens of Thy bounty and generosity. O Lord! Deprive him not of Thy door and withhold him not from that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O thou who speaketh My remembrance! Darkness hath encompassed the world, the calumnies of old have come forth anew, and the vain imaginings of the opposers have taken hold of the Bayan. The Book of Certitude, whose questioner was the Afnan who asked in Our presence and received a written answer, they have attributed to another, though therein is mentioned the journey of this Wronged One and all the Afnan bear witness to this. Yet they have ascribed it to one who, by the life of God, is powerless to comprehend its meaning. Likewise, all that hath been sent down from the heaven of God’s Will in every season they have attributed to the Bab. Say: O company of opposers! Present yourselves before your Lord, the Lord of all worlds, that ye may hear that for which the world of ears was specifically created, and witness that for which the world of eyes was brought into being. By the life of God! More than the equivalent of all the heavenly Books hath been sent down, yet they speak that which they know not. Him Who in God’s presence was unable to speak, they have taken as lord besides God and have done that which caused the rock to cry out and all things to weep. It is incumbent, nay obligatory, upon the loved ones of Truth to protect the people of God from the vain imaginings of old, lest they be again afflicted thereby. He counseleth His servants and acquainteth them with His straight path and His mighty Message. Convey My greetings to all the loved ones in that land. Blessed is the house wherein is raised the remembrance and praise of God, blessed the tongue that hath acknowledged His oneness, blessed the ear that hath heard His most sweet call, and blessed the eye that hath beheld the traces of His most mighty and wondrous Pen. Each of these souls is illumined by the revelations of the Sun of Truth and mentioned and recorded by the Pen of the Ancient of Days in the Most Great Book. Gladden them with the tidings of My acceptance, My attention, My favor and My mercy, which have preceded existence both seen and unseen. The Glory which proceedeth from Us rest upon thee and upon those who are with thee, who have quaffed the wine of certitude from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the All-Merciful, and who are among those firmly established in this mighty Cause.</p>

<p>He is the Warbler</p>
<p>The servant has appeared with pen and tablet, desiring verses to be sent down to him. We said: “They have filled the earth and the heavens.” He says: “The ocean cannot quell my thirst for knowledge. I desire that from the fountainhead of Thy Most Exalted Pen there should flow forth oceans in remembrance of Thy Most Glorious Name.” We say: “The lands would be laid waste thereby and the people would drown therein.” He says: “This would be better for them and for the lands, by Thy dominion that overshadows the worlds.” We said: “Can fire benefit the fish, or water the salamander?” He says: “Whatsoever appears from Thee, shouldst Thou so desire, is the most great antidote for the nations and a healing for all ills.” We said: “Bring forth thy witnesses in proof.” He says: “Thou, Thou art the Dayspring of verses! Thou seest among the people those who flee from the Most Great Name, and among them are those whom God hath made the Kawthar of eternity. Thus doth the Pen testify from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise.” Would that the people knew of the waves of this ocean and what lieth concealed therein of the pearls of the knowledge of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing! O Pen! Days have passed while thou wert silent, uttering neither remembrance nor exposition. Because of this the realities and divine explanations have lamented. Revive all things once again through thy sweet melody, that perchance thou mayest behold one who will arise to serve thy Lord and aid Him, detached from all else save Him. We testify that through thee the fountains of wisdom have flowed in the hearts of creation, and the Kawthar of life hath streamed forth for the people of understanding, and through thee the breaths of inspiration have wafted among mankind and the fragrances of revelation among the followers of all religions. With this conquering, prevailing power, and this all-encompassing, penetrating sovereignty, canst thou speak that whereby the gate of My Paradise might be opened - that Paradise which lay hidden in the knowledge of thy Lord, the Illuminator of lights - and whereby thou mightest behold shining from its horizon the Sun of the beauty of thy Lord, Who caused thee to speak a word from His presence to all who are in the heavens and the earth? It is a Paradise wherein are enumerated the bounties of divine knowledge, and around which the Garden circleth at eventide and at dawn. Come, O My Pen, that I may recount unto thee and thou mayest recount unto Me. Nay, thou art powerless to do this and findest thyself unable to describe that station and what hath been ordained therein. Canst thou speak that whereby the heart of thy Lord would be gladdened, or whereby the thirst of him who hath stood at the gate might be quenched? This, despite My knowledge that wert thou to send down verses to the number of the drops of rain and fill therewith the tablets of earth and heaven, he would still say: “Where is Thine other favor, O Thou Who sendest down bounty from the heaven of bestowals to all who are in creation?”</p>
<p>O Pen! This is thy Day. Move between the fingers of the Beloved at His bidding, and captivate the dwellers of the Kingdom with thy melodies and the denizens of the Realm of Might through the mention of this Beauty that hath shone forth from the horizon of grace, and this Countenance that hath appeared from the horizon of glory. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having honored me with Thy presence and caused me to speak forth Thy praise. I testify that this proceedeth not from me, nor do I deserve it, but rather from Thy grace, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all created things. This is a paradise wherein the sun is seen rising from its dayspring, and it is the face of thy Lord, the Most Glorious, and the light of its moon is from the brow of God, the Lord of all return. From the murmur of its waters is heard: “There is no God but I, the Wondrous,” and from the rustling of its trees: “There is no God but I, the Beauteous,” and from the whistling of its winds: “There is no God but I, the Almighty, the All-Knowing.” Every creature therein is a spirit from God’s Spirit, declaring: “I belong to God, the Lord of Lords.” Whoso tasteth of its fruits findeth the sweetness of Paradise and all its gardens. Glory be to God! All this is at the level of description, while it existeth at a station beyond all mention. Say: It is a station where the glance of vision cannot penetrate, nor can the birds of fancy reach its heights. God hath made it sanctified beyond the mention of creation and exalted above the understanding of all on earth. To this testifieth every discerning mystic. A Lote-Tree therein proclaimeth: “God hath testified concerning Him Who hath appeared that there is no God but He, and He is the Hidden Treasure, the Concealed Mystery, the Living Ocean, and the Dayspring of the All-Merciful. Through Him hath appeared the oneness of My Being and the sanctification of My Self from all similitudes, and through Him have appeared the names and attributes, and all things have proclaimed: The Kingdom and the Realm, then Power and Divinity, then Might and Dominion belong to God, the Dayspring of signs.” And another proclaimeth: “God hath testified concerning Him Who hath appeared that there is no God but He. Through Him hath shone forth the Sun of generosity and the world hath been adorned with the lights of antiquity. Through Him hath every heaven been raised up, every fragrance wafted abroad, and the ocean of knowledge and wisdom hath surged.” The Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken in chambers built of the essence of wisdom, bearing witness unto His own Self that there is no God but He. Blessed be this dawn for having been honored by a Day wherein the Lord of destiny hath turned toward the Most Great Scene and the Throne of the All-Merciful hath been established in the garden named Ridvan. Thereupon the trees swayed, the flowers smiled, the fruits stirred, the birds sang, the branches were attracted, the boughs reached forth, and the garden and all within it moved in yearning for the call of God, the Sovereign, the Almighty, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who is the Ordainer of Sorrows</p>
<p>O thou who gazeth upon My countenance, who drinketh from the cup of My loving-kindness and the chalice of My mercy and bounty, who dwelleth beneath the shade of My majesty, who inhaleth the fragrance of My raiment, who immerseth himself in the ocean of My remembrance, who ascendeth unto the heights of My Cause, and who celebrateth My praise amidst My servants! Hearken unto My call from the right hand of the Garden of Paradise upon the holy hill from the Divine Lote-Tree: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Gracious. Beware lest thou allow the fire of thy love to be extinguished. Preserve that which We have kindled within thy breast and be thou of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>Know thou that We have raised up one of Our servants, strengthened his heart, and adorned him with the ornament of certitude amidst all creation, and sent him unto the Sovereign with thy Lord the All-Merciful’s Book, wherein We conveyed unto him the messages of the All-Glorious, without veil or concealment. Thus hath the matter been decreed by thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, that perchance he may awaken unto himself, arise from the slumber of passion, turn towards the Most Glorious Vision, and become assured that the might of kings hath not deterred Us from making mention of the King of Kings, nor have tribulations prevented Us from remembering the Lord of Names. Verily thy Lord is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>In these darknesses that have encompassed Us, We have shone forth from its horizon with the sovereignty of grandeur and power, and We deliver what We will, and those who have wronged Us do not frighten Us, and thy Lord is witness unto all things. By Him Who hath sent down the verses and rent asunder the veils! Should all who are on earth gather together against him who speaketh the truth, with whatsoever of strength and power they possess, thou wouldst witness thy Chosen Lord proclaiming openly amongst them: “O people! Verily, I am your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised!”</p>
<p>Though We found not from him any fragrance of acceptance, yet did We deliver it unto him for the exaltation of thy Lord’s Word between the heavens and the earth, and that he might know that were We to will it, matters would not be as they are. We have breathed into the heart of one of Our servants the spirit of might and power and sent him unto him. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Wise. Aforetime had God’s proof not been perfected unto him, nor had anyone conveyed it to him as it ought to have been conveyed. When the appointed time came and the promise was fulfilled, We sent down unto him clear verses and completed thy Lord’s proof upon him–the Supreme, the Transcendent, the Mighty, the Beauteous.</p>
<p>Consider those who conceal themselves behind veils and who have clung to them that denied God from time immemorial to harm him who summons mankind unto God without regard to himself. These are assuredly the companions of the fire. Woe unto them who have followed them and taken them as protectors for themselves instead of God. These are the friends of the Evil One, but they understand not. The wonder is not of those who have claimed what was not ordained for them, but rather the wonder is of those who behold the signs of their Lord and deny them, and who pursue him who is, in the sight of God, inferior to them, all the while imagining they are among the doers of good. Among their leaders is he who was named Ali-Muhammad. He allied himself in Iraq with the oppressors against Our Cause, and when trials came he was seized and declared, “I have denied God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.” He disavowed his leader, and when he felt secure he called the people to the first one who denied God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. Behold those who follow him even after knowing what was manifested through him. God’s curse be upon the wrongdoing people. Likewise did his leader cling to Nimrod, and when judgment came he was seized the first time and found no escape for himself. They deny God openly before those possessed of might, but when alone with their like they summon people to themselves and say “We are among the guides of the Bayan.” We testify that the All-Merciful is clear of them, and the angels brought nigh curse them. Beware lest change prevent thee from the remembrance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Deliver unto the people that which thou wast commanded before, and summon the people of thy land and all others unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Hold fast unto wisdom. Beware lest thou exceed its bounds, lest there occur that which would distress the servants, as thou hast witnessed with thine own eyes. Thus have ye been commanded in most of the Tablets. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Witnessing, the All-Knowing. Gather together the captives there and remind them at all times, lest there occur among them that which would divide their hearts. Thus hath thy Lord, the Mighty, the Peerless, commanded. Remember what was revealed in the Land of Mystery in the first year to Our servant the Mahdi, wherein We informed him of what would befall the House thereafter, lest he be grieved by what had previously occurred from him who transgressed and stole. With thy Lord is the knowledge of the heavens and the earths. We have spoken, and Our word is the truth. Then know that this is not the first weakness that hath befallen My House. Before this it was afflicted by what the hands of the oppressors had wrought, and there shall descend upon it such humiliation as will cause tears to flow from every seeing eye. Thus have We imparted unto thee that which was hidden behind the veils of the Unseen, which none hath discovered save God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Then shall pass days wherein God will raise it up in truth and make it a standard in the kingdom, around which shall circle a company of them that know. This is the word of thy Lord from before the day of terror cometh. We have informed thee of it in this Tablet lest thou be saddened by what hath befallen the House through what the hands of the transgressors have wrought. And praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

Whenever the effulgences of the Sun of Revelation shone forth from the horizon of the Will of Him Who conversed upon Sinai, all arose in opposition and clung to objection. Through the tyranny of heedless hosts, there befell the gems of existence that which caused the Lote-Tree of the utmost boundary to weep and raised the lamentation of the Supreme Paradise. This Wronged One turned to the reformation of the world by God’s command, and was a mighty fortress for nation and state and a manifest power, and had and hath no purpose save the glory of the latter and the exaltation of the former. All bear witness that this Wronged One had no intention save to extinguish the fire of hatred, and this extinguishing is praiseworthy when accomplished through the divine Kawthar of counsel and the Salsabil of heavenly wisdom. Today the purpose of the Wronged One is clear and evident as the sun - all have known and do know, and the denial by some of this most exalted station and sublime rank stems from enmity and hypocrisy, as every fair-minded and insightful one and every knowing and informed one doth testify.</p>
<p>O Khalil! The honored Amin mentioned thee, thus hast thou attained unto this supreme remembrance. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this great favor and this mighty grace. O Amin! Some time ago the Most Holy, Most Great, Most Glorious, Most Exalted Tablet - which in one place is referred to as the Call, in another as the Spirit of Life, and in yet another station as the Glad-Tidings - was sent that you, together with him who standeth in service, might peruse it and deliver it to the noble embassy. O Amin! Those glad-tidings are luminous, spiritual, holy and radiant ordinances - in one respect they are the mightiest fortress for the servants, and in another they are the water of life for all who dwell in the land. The light of these glad-tidings hath shone forth from the Supreme Horizon and the Most Glorious Horizon and hath encompassed the world, yet their manifestations are not yet known - they shall become known later. We gathered them from the Books, Psalms and Tablets and compiled them in one Tablet that all might attain unto God’s special favors and be freed and delivered from all else.</p>
<p>He mentioned all that by which the Sheikh of the land of Sad was satisfied with him, having rushed to Mashhad, traveled around, spoken words in every place, and cast doubts in every house he entered. Glory be to God! Did he content himself with these affairs and similar fabrications? By what proof did he believe in the Point of the Bayan, and by what evidence did he acknowledge the Prophets of the past? Say: Produce it, if thou be of the truthful ones! In any case, now he hath clung to his brother, although he hath never had any knowledge of this Cause, for he was not with Us from the beginning and is unable to read even a single Tablet. Yet he hath claimed fame as a master of sciences and arts. He hath taken possession of Mirza Hadi, his brother’s son, and hath attributed previous Tablets to him and given them to the people. We beseech God to assist him and her in being purely truthful, in returning unto Him, and in turning penitently to the gate of His forgiveness. Verily, He is powerful over all things. God is witness and testifier that his brother is incapable of comprehending that which hath been sent down from God, let alone that such exalted words should proceed from him. Thus hath spoken the Tongue of Grandeur as He walketh in the palace which God hath made the seat of His mighty throne and His exalted chair. Glory be from Us upon Khalil and upon his son. Praise be to God, encompassing grace was vouchsafed and bounty did surround them, such that they were enabled to serve His loved ones. Happy is he, and well is it with him and with those who have drunk the wine of utterance from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Most Generous, the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>He is the One speaking from His Most Exalted Horizon!</p>
<p>O ’Ali, upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness! We have heard thy call and have turned toward thee from the Most Great Prison. The effulgence of the lights of the Day-Star of Truth hath shone upon His loved ones. Today mercy hath preceded all else and grace hath encompassed all things. Praise be to God that on the Day of Recompense thou hast attained unto the hearing of the call of the Lord of all beings and hast drunk from the Kawthar of utterance. The fruit and result of this deed shall never be effaced from the divine ledger. We beseech God to aid thee in preserving that which He hath bestowed. The glance of His loving-kindness hath been and continueth to be directed toward thee. Nothing escapeth His knowledge; He witnesseth and seeth all things, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention Muhammad. We have verily forgiven him, purified him, and appointed for him a station. The grace of thy Lord hath indeed encompassed him from all directions. He is, in truth, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. We have mentioned him before in such wise that nothing which thou beholdest can equal it, as this Great Announcement doth testify.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the handmaiden of God. Blessed is the servant who is engaged in serving the friends of God, and blessed are those handmaidens who act for the sake of God alone. Say: O My handmaiden, O Tu?i! These are the days of the Most Great Manifestation; His light hath encompassed the world. In the Most Great Prison, while surrounded by encompassing sorrows, We are occupied with thy remembrance and make mention of thee. The deeds of no soul have ever been, nor shall ever be, lost in the sight of God. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord for this manifest grace.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Mashhadi Allah-Virdi. Praise be to God that he hath turned toward the Most Great Ocean in days when the darkness of repudiation hath encompassed the world. God hath verily aided him to turn toward Him and attain His presence. He is, in truth, the Protector of those who turn unto Him. Convey My greetings unto him and give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance, that he may rejoice and give thanks unto his Lord, the Compassionate, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Hasan! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and hold fast unto the cord of His Cause with such tenacity that all the peoples of the world shall be powerless to separate thee from it. This is the binding command that hath in this moment been sent down from the Pen of the Most Great Name.</p>
<p>O ?adiq! Thy mention hath been made before the Countenance, and thou hast attained unto these verses which have shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of mercy. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having remembered me while Thou wert wronged at the hands of the heedless ones.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! The Book Manifest speaketh before the faces of all who dwell in the heavens and the earth, and giveth glad-tidings unto all. However, the veils of glory have deprived the heedless people from beholding the lights of the Manifestation of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Praise be to the Lord of Eternity Who hath enabled thee to attain this most great bounty, which is the recognition of the Dawning-Place of His verses.</p>
<p>O ’Abbas-’Ali! Hear thou the call of the Wronged One of the horizons and say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me and made me to know Thee. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy grace to make me steadfast in Thy love and holding fast unto the wisdom which Thou hast sent down in Thy Book. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-’Ali! Hear My call from the direction of My prison. He hath verily aided thee to serve the Cause of God and to make mention of Him amongst His servants. That which thou beholdest today shall pass away, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of My verses and drinkest the choice wine of My utterance from the cup of My bounty, say: My God, my God! Thou seest my poverty and Thy wealth, my weakness and Thy strength, my powerlessness and Thy might, my ignorance and Thy knowledge. The poor one knocketh at this moment at the door of Thy generosity, and the unlettered one turneth toward the ocean of Thy knowledge and wisdom. I beseech Thee by that treasure which Thou hast deposited in the hearts of them that are sincere amongst Thy servants to make me steadfast in Thy Cause, firm in Thy love and standing ready to serve Thee. Praise be unto Thee, O my God and my Lord, for having shown me the billows of the ocean of Thy utterance and the lights of the orb of Thy bounty. I implore Thee, O Lord of existence and King of the seen and unseen, to assist me and Thy loved ones in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Thou art in truth the Lord of all men. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Ali! Praise be to the Lord of the world. Each of the souls mentioned in thy letter hath attained unto that which every discerning one hath inhaled and continueth to inhale therefrom the fragrance of divine favors. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for thee the reward of meeting Him and to decree for thee and His loved ones that which shall profit you in His days. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>We conclude Our utterance by making mention of him who hath turned unto his Lord, the All-Merciful, and hath drunk the choice wine of certitude from the hands of the bounty of his Lord, the Gracious, the Bountiful - he who heard My call and turned in the first days toward My horizon, and whom the rapture of My remembrance so seized that he soared in My atmosphere, cast away all else beside Me, and arose to extol My praise amidst My creatures and to serve Me amongst My servants. We beseech God to strengthen him under all conditions and to make him a standard for the triumph of My wondrous and glorious Cause, through which the limbs of the world have quaked, and the hearts of all nations have been convulsed, and all the tribes of the earth have lamented, except such as God, the Lord of the worlds, hath willed. Blessed is his eye for what it hath beheld, and his ear for what it hath heard, and his face for having turned toward God, and his heart for having been drawn unto God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Verily we are God’s, and verily unto Him shall we return.</p>

<p>In the Name of the One God</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Qabli-’Askar! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Destiny. Praise be to God that thou didst leave thy earthly home, aspiring to reach the most exalted homeland. The hosts of divine grace, mercy, favor, bounty and generosity did aid thee until thou didst attain the supreme horizon and attain the presence of the Lord of all beings, dwelling for a time beneath the pavilions of grandeur. Should every drop of the ocean and every grain of sand be counted in the divine ledger as an age, and shouldst thou spend all that time in praise and thanksgiving to God, exalted be His glory, thou wouldst still not fulfill the obligation of gratitude for this supreme bounty and most great favor. Say: Praise be to Thee, O Desire of the worlds! Thanks be to Thee, O Beloved of the hearts of them that are nigh! Glory be to Thee, O Light of those in the heavens and on earth!</p>
<p>His favor hath taken and continueth to take the hands of them that turn unto Him. His protection accompanieth and His blessed Name is a shield to all who are aware. This Wronged One offereth thanks on thy behalf, for thou hast attained unto that which hath no peer or likeness.</p>
<p>We make mention of thy son who was named Nad-’Ali and thy wife and daughters, and We give them the glad-tidings of God’s favor, the Lord of all worlds. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to draw them nigh unto Him and ordain for them that which He hath ordained for His devout male and female servants. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>We make mention of Abu-Basir, who was named Muhammad, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of the Wronged One and be of the thankful. O Muhammad! The Wronged One remembereth thee from the prison. Praise be to God that thou hast attained the honor of faith and recognition and hast borne hardships and tribulations in the path of the One True Friend. Remember this supreme bounty and preserve it in thy heart with the seal of love. Verily, He is with His near servants. There is no God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>We make mention of thy sons with a remembrance before which all mention boweth down, and We beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for them every good thing that He hath revealed in His Book, and to decree for them the blessings of the Hereafter and of this world, and the bounties of every world of His worlds. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Glorify them on My behalf and remind them of that which hath been revealed for them from the presence of the Ancient Ordainer.</p>
<p>O Burj-’Ali! All the ears of the world were created to hear the Call of this Day which hath been raised from the Most Great Prison, yet most are deprived save a few souls. Thou hast attained unto it, hearkened unto the Call, and turned toward its horizon. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having caused me to hear, to recognize, to learn, and for having guided me to the News that hath caused hearts to tremble, faces to darken, and the feet of the mystics and learned to slip, save those whom Thou didst deliver through Thy grace and didst purify from the defilement of self and desire, and didst mention in Thy perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>We make mention of thy son who was named ’Abid in the Book of Names, then thy other son who was named ’Ali-Qabli-Rida, and We remind them of the signs of God and give them the glad-tidings of My grace and My mercy which have preceded existence in both the unseen and visible worlds.</p>
<p>O My Pen! Make mention of him who hath hearkened to My call and turned to My horizon, who hath been named Siyyid-i-Mirza, that the fragrance of Mine utterance may draw him nigh unto My glorious and wondrous Kingdom. O Siyyid-i-Mirza! Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee, then render thanks unto thy Lord, for He hath made mention of thee at the close of the Tablet in such wise that thy name and remembrance shall endure throughout the eternity of God’s names and attributes. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Say: All praise be unto Thee for having delivered me from the well of idle fancies and vain imaginings, and for having given me to drink, through the hands of grace and bounty, from the cup of certitude. I testify that Thou art the One Who hath power to do what He willeth, and in Whose grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Lord of the Manifestation.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-’Askar! Praise be to God that all the names mentioned have attained unto the remembrance of the Wronged One and been adorned with His grace. In the earliest days We made a covenant, as a token of God’s grace, bounty and generosity, that whosoever should come before Our presence, whether living or dead, We would make mention of them. Thy Lord, verily, is the Forgiving, the Merciful. The glory which proceedeth from Us rest upon thee and upon them who have believed in God and His signs, and who have acknowledged that which hath been sent down from the heaven of His Will and uttered by the tongue of His grandeur from His exalted station.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou seest Thy loved ones in the clutches of Thine enemies, and Thy chosen ones in the hands of those who have denied Thee and Thy signs. I beseech Thee by the heaven of Thy bounty, and the ocean of Thy generosity, and by the lights of Thy Most Great Name whereby Thou hast illumined the hearts of all nations, that Thou protect them through Thy power that hath transcended all things, and guard them by Thy sovereignty that encompasseth all created things. Then send down upon them from the heaven of Thy pardon and generosity that which shall gladden their eyes and bring joy to their hearts. O Lord! Thou beholdest the believers among the idolaters, and there hath befallen them that which hath caused the dwellers of Thy Paradise and celestial garden to lament. I beseech Thee to preserve them from the evil of the aggressors and the oppression of the oppressors. Thou art, verily, the Almighty Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate. Thou doest what Thou willest by Thy sovereignty, and ordainest what Thou pleasest by Thy power. Thou art, in truth, the All-Glorious, the All-Beauteous.</p>

<p>His Highness Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God. On the 3rd of Rabi’u’l-Avval 1303.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, majesty and power!</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Your letter sent from the great city arrived, and likewise your previous letter from Cyprus. Praise be to God, it brought what was befitting - that is, praise of the One Beloved - and bestowed what was worthy - that is, joy and delight. His is all praise and glory in every condition.</p>
<p>First, I beseech that beloved one to accept my apologies for brevity, as the rains from the heaven of writing have left no time, and you yourself are witness to this. After presentation in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, these supreme words flowed from the tongue of the Lord of all beings: “O Asad! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. What thou didst write regarding Aqa Muhammad-Javad, upon him be My glory - mention of him hath ever been before the Wronged One. From the time he attained the presence in Iraq until now, he hath not departed from Our sight. Verily, faithfulness hath stood before My face and We have preserved his station and will preserve it. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous. In these days a Tablet hath been specifically revealed for him. God willing, he will attain unto it. We send greetings unto him and unto those in his household, and We have mentioned in the Tablet the leaf who hath ascended unto God, the Lord of all worlds.”</p>
<p>In truth, he hath ever been the recipient of divine favors, and this servant conveys greetings and salutations to him, beseeching from God, exalted be His glory, whatsoever He Himself desireth. Regarding what was written about Haji Muhammad-Rida, upon him be the Glory of God - that from Faran he awaits permission to turn toward the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court - after presentation, these blessed words were revealed in response. His exalted Word: “He hath attained unto the luminary of permission to turn toward the Supreme Horizon with such turning as will cause all created things to turn. This beseemeth him who hath turned unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. We have mentioned him before and after. We beseech God to strengthen him to preserve what We have given him, for the Cause is mighty beyond all that is mighty. O Asad! The smoke of hypocrisy hath encompassed the horizons. The cawing of the ravens hath been raised in Jadhba and its surroundings. The time of its rising, before and after, is known and evident with God. Beseech God to grant such confirmation that they may distinguish the effulgences of the Sun of true unity from aught else. Verily, He is the Confirmer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>And regarding what was written about Aqa Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God - that too was honored to reach the ears of the Goal of all worlds. His blessed and exalted Word: “O Asad! Upon thee be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness. The affairs of this land and its stability are uncertain, and God hath never wished and doth not wish to deprive anyone in any condition. He hath never regarded and doth not regard the preservation of His own Self. He hath ever gazed with joy and delight toward the direction of loving-kindness to the beloved ones. Therefore permission is granted - turn as thou pleaseth. If he attaineth, he hath attained unto the Goal; if not, the matter is in His hands. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. And He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” And mention has been made of the travelers and emigrants - all have attained to hearing, and each one hath been remembered before the Wronged One. God willing, they will act in accordance with that which is befitting and conducive to the exaltation of the Cause. At all times the Pen hath been occupied with the mention of the friends of the Desired One of the worlds. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid them through the means of the unseen and the visible, and to make them of those whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from turning toward God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the Pen of Response is in motion and each question hath been granted an explicit answer. Verily our Lord and your Lord, and our Beloved and your Beloved, is powerful over all things and worthy to respond. In whatever land they reside, convey to the friends of that land and other regions greetings and salutations from this evanescent servant. For each one I beseech steadfastness that may cause the limbs of the people of the Bayan who have denied our Lord, the Most Merciful, to quake, and who have uttered that which none of the ancients had uttered.</p>
<p>And concerning that which was written about his honor, my brother, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, it was again presented before His presence. His blessed and exalted Word: “O Lion! Convey My greetings unto thy brother. We beseech God to ordain for him that which shall profit him in all the worlds of His worlds, to record for him the reward of attaining His presence, and to grant him the best of what is in His wondrous revealed Book.”</p>
<p>The response to this matter was previously presented in His presence and was honored with an answer. This evanescent one beseeches the True One to assist him in that which He loveth and pleaseth, and to ordain for him the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Peace and praise and glory be upon you and upon those who are with you and upon those whom nothing hath prevented from God, the Most High, the Most Great. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Again, in the letter of his honor Amin, upon him be [Baha’u’llah’s Glory], dated 6 […] should be written […]</p>

<p>In the Name of God, Who is Exalted in His Wisdom and Utterance!</p>
<p>Hearken to the call of the Wronged One from the precincts of the prison. Verily, He standeth before the faces of the world, summoning all to the supreme horizon - that station wherein is heard the rustling of the Sadratu’l-Muntaha. Yet most of the people remain behind a thick veil. The Light hath dawned from the horizon of Manifestation. Verily, He is the Interlocutor of Sinai, Who was promised in the Books of God, Lord of the worlds. He hath come from the heaven of proof with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, and with the finger of power hath rent asunder the veils of glory - a bounty from Him, and He is the Ancient Bestower.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of divines! The Creator of the heavens and the Sovereign of the Kingdom of Names hath come. Fear ye God and be not of the heedless. This is the Day wherein the Herald proclaimeth: “The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Almighty, the All-Praised.”</p>
<p>O Abraham! Hear once again the call from the Sadratu’l-Muntaha, raised up on the blessed white land, the shore of Oman - the mercy of thy Lord, the Most Merciful. Verily, there is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Great. Say: O people of the Furqan! Cast away what ye possess and take what ye have been given from One All-Knowing, All-Wise. By God! Your books and what ye possess will profit you not except through this Book which speaketh the truth and calleth all to the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear the Most Merciful and oppose not Him but for Whom the Point would not have appeared and the Books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, would not have been revealed. This is the Day wherein the Sun proclaimeth and the Sea announceth: “The Lord of Destiny hath come and every hidden secret hath been revealed.” Say: Behold the Supreme Scene! By God! The Hour hath come, the Resurrection hath appeared, and the moon hath been cleft asunder, if ye be of those who know.</p>
<p>O people of the earth! Your sciences and your arts will not save you except through this Cause, before which all things have bowed down. Thus hath spoken the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens, while seated upon His mighty throne. The Trumpet hath been blown - and it is My Most Exalted Pen - and all who are in earth and heaven were thunderstruck, save those who have inhaled the fragrance of Revelation and turned toward My luminous horizon.</p>
<p>O Abraham! Say: O party of God! Take the chalice of steadfastness from the hands of bounty and bestowal, then drink therefrom despite those who have denied this Momentous Announcement, which was heralded by Moses, and after Him the Spirit (Christ), then Muhammad the Messenger of God when He came with the standards of signs from One Mighty, Ancient.</p>
<p>This is the Day wherein the Mother Book speaketh and the Mother of the Bayan calleth out, and those nigh unto God circle round the Throne morning and evening. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the greatest steadfastness, whom neither the might of princes, nor the doubts of divines, nor the violence of those swine who have broken God’s covenant and His testament and have led their people to the fire, could deter.</p>
<p>O party of God! Fear God and follow not your desires. Follow what hath been sent down from the heaven of Command in My perspicuous Book. We have counseled you, and do counsel you, with that which will exalt the Cause of God and your stations. Verily, your Lord, the Most Merciful, [is the Faithful Counsellor. Through deeds] and character is revealed the station of men. Blessed is he who hath done what he hath been commanded in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praised.</p>
<p>Thus have the breezes of Revelation wafted, and the Sea hath manifested its waves, and the Sun its radiance. Blessed is he who hath found and known, and woe unto the heedless. O Abraham! The names of My loved ones have been presented before the Wronged One. We have mentioned them with a mention that shall endure as long as the Kingdom endureth. The Kingdom and the Glory and the Power bear witness to this, as doth He Who speaketh in every station that there is none other God but I, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. From this station We send Our greetings to their faces and remind them of that which hath been revealed from My Most Exalted Pen, and I am the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Whoso hath clung to My robe, verily he is of the people of the Crimson Ark, the mention of which hath been revealed in My Preserved Tablet. O My loved ones in all lands! We counsel you once again to perform deeds from which the fragrance of holiness may be wafted, and to be faithful to that which God hath made as a sun in the heaven of His justice and a light unto His lands. He, verily, is the All-Compelling over what hath been and what shall be.</p>
<p>In the Persian tongue it is mentioned that ye may drink from the Salsabil of divine meanings and turn unto the most exalted horizon. O Abraham! The veil of heedlessness hath prevented the people from beholding the most exalted horizon. All things at all times are speaking, yet ears are deprived of hearing them. Convey My greetings from this Wronged One to the party of God. We beseech God to aid them in that which befitteth this Great Announcement and to set them ablaze with the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree in such wise that its heat may influence the world, that all may thereby find their way to the True Lote-Tree. The hosts of God have ever been and shall ever be goodly deeds and character, and the commander of these hosts is righteousness. We counsel all to wisdom; all must hold fast unto it. Verily, He speaketh the truth and guideth all to His straight path. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon My loved ones who have not been kept back by anything from God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who sent forth the Messengers and revealed the Books for the guidance of His servants and His creation, and made known to them His path, and taught them His knowledge, and caused them to hear His call which is realized only through the call of His chosen ones, and showed them the horizon of His Manifestation, and made them speak His praise among His creatures, until Prophethood and Messengership were sealed by Him through Whom the heaven was cleft asunder and the moon was split and every hidden secret was revealed - He Who was named Muhammad in the Kingdom of utterance and by God’s most beautiful names in the hearts of the Daysprings of divine knowledge. The blessings and peace of God, the Lord of all beings, be upon Him and upon His family and companions through whom were established the decree of the beginning and the return, and the mystery of going and coming back, and what was inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Scriptures and the Book. These are servants whom the tempests of hatred did not move and the storms of hardship did not prevent. They arose to promote the Cause with such steadfastness as made the feet of the polytheists slip and the hearts of the deniers quake and the foundation of every heedless doubter shake.</p>
<p>And then, your letter arrived conveying news of the well-being of that spiritual friend and family with perfect eloquence and complete fluency. Praise be to God! Verily He preserveth whom He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth for whom He willeth.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the dervishes of the venerable Shaykh, the matter is exactly as you have written. You too should in all circumstances show forth love, for between the venerable Shaykh and our Master, His Holiness the Most Great Branch - may my spirit be a sacrifice for the dust of His footsteps - there exists friendship and love. The metaphorical is a bridge to the real. God willing, they shall be illumined by the light of reality and attain the station of “extinguish the lamp for the morn has dawned.” When a person of insight enters the path of spiritual wayfaring, after purifying and sanctifying the soul from all that God loveth not, multiple paths appear and he traverses them. This is why they have said “The paths to God are as numerous as the breaths of created things.” However, if through God’s grace the eye is blessed with the light of truth, it will be observed that the Truth is one, the Path is one, and the Cause is one. This is the station of unity that makes the limbs of the polytheists tremble and the root of heedlessness quake.</p>
<p>This servant and you must beseech God, exalted be His glory, not to deprive any soul of the ocean of His mercy and to illumine the eyes of all hearts with the light of recognition. He is the All-Powerful and in His grasp are grandeur and authority.</p>
<p>As for the properties of the honorable Nawwab, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], he and a group of acquaintances are exerting their utmost efforts, as they have done before, and God willing they shall triumph and prevail according to the meaning of “the party of God shall be victorious.” That is, they shall obtain and deliver your rights. At present, according to the writing of the honorable Nawwab, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], the power of attorney has not reached them. The honored master, the venerable Sabri Efendi, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], is present there. Whatever manner they deem advisable, let them write a power of attorney with the seal of the religious authorities and send it. Here too we shall add several seals to it and send it. Indeed, the honorable Nawwab is most diligent in service. The inheritance of the wife of the venerable Khalil, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], was with one of the divines; he went and made his claim. We beseech God to bless those souls who exert as much effort in accomplishing others’ affairs as their own with His special favors and with that which will profit them in the next world and in this. Verily, He has power over all things.</p>
<p>Convey my greetings to the gentlemen and friends. Furthermore, a needle case from Khurasan has been sent specifically for the honored friend, the venerable ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah]. Yesterday, which was the 13th of Dhi’l-Qa’dih the Sacred, it arrived here from the great city and is now being sent so that it may reach him. Some saffron has also been sent from here specifically for the venerable ’Ali-Akbar. Since he and his venerable and blessed late father, upon him be from all 9 [Baha] the Most Glorious, had a liking for it, therefore ten dirhams have been sent specifically for him; let it be delivered. Your gift, namely the dried curd, arrived and was well received. God willing, may you be blessed with its reward. I send greetings to the light of my eyes, ’Inayatu’llah, may God preserve him, together with his mother and sister. God willing, may they remain safe and protected under the shadow of God’s favor, exalted be His glory. Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>On the 13th of the month of Dhi’l-Qa’dih the Sacred, year 1300</p>
<p>May the honored brother, Aqa Lutfu’llah, God willing, be preserved and gladdened by the wondrous infinite favors. The trouble which this servant has imposed upon him - God willing, he will exert effort and strive to accomplish and complete it with the utmost joy and delight. The reward and recompense for this rests with God, exalted be His glory. Peace and glory be upon him.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Impregnable, the Most Great, the Most Glorious, the Most Splendid!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath manifested Him Who was manifested, at the time He was manifested, through that which was manifested, in that which was manifested. He hath ever been sanctified beyond the ascent to His holy court of the mention of the most sagacious, or the rising unto Him from nonexistence and nothingness of that which hath been uttered by the adherents of the two parties. When He desired to give glad-tidings unto the world of the Most Great Mystery, He manifested Him Who was established upon the throne of the Trinity, that He might convey unto mankind the Hidden Secret and the Treasured Mystery, Who appeared in the form of the Quaternary. Verily, by His sanctifying sovereignty, He hath been sanctified above the mention of all created things. He is indeed the Quaternary Who deriveth not, whether outwardly or inwardly, from aught except His Own Self, the One Who dominateth the world. And were He to be mentioned as the Great One, no names would be mentioned with Him in the first degree. Through Him was manifested the Alif standing between the two letters, and that which appeared through the first letter was fulfilled, and the second letter was realized. Thereupon another heaven was spread forth after the rolling up of the first heaven. Blessed be God Who speaketh at the heart of creation and calleth unto all created things at all times that there is none other God but Him, the Omnipotent, the Exalted, the Most High, the Most Great. I pray and I send greetings upon the first ocean from which appeared the pearls of wisdom and utterance and the gems of knowledge and exposition, and upon the first light that shone from a horizon that was sanctified above all horizons, and whom none hath known save him who hath detached himself from all else and remained faithful to the Covenant on the Day of Separation.</p>
<p>[…] and subsequently, this evanescent servant was honored by receiving your letter, adorned with the praise and remembrance of God, from which I detected the sweet fragrance of your love and the redolence of your affection. I read it until I reached the passage wherein you communed with God, our Lord, the Master of all beings. Through it I ascended to the ultimate goal, the seat of the throne of our Most Glorious Lord, and presented its contents before the Throne. Thereupon the Beloved smiled and spoke that which all existence, both seen and unseen, cannot enumerate, and He bestowed upon you some of what I retained so that you might rejoice in the favors of our Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Be it known that such verses as were revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of Names and Attributes following the presentation of your supplication, and which this servant succeeded in transcribing, have been recorded and sent in a separate document. From these decisive verses, the wondrous divine favors and the manifestation of heavenly bestowals in your behalf are as clear as the sun, nay clearer. This much is submitted: that you have ever been mentioned before the Throne, and the suns of grace and favor have so brilliantly shone forth that this servant was and is incapable of describing and recording them. To this, his honor the Trustee, upon him be the Glory of God, and others from that land, upon them be the Glory of God, can bear witness, for He would specifically inquire about you and show His favors, and throughout the years, Tablets were specifically revealed and sent to you. Those which did not reach you, the messengers failed to deliver.</p>
<p>All things testify to your service and your standing firm in the Cause of God. We beseech God to grant you success and to aid you as He has aided you before, and to bestow upon you the good of this world and the next. Verily, He is the Protector of those who have voiced His praise throughout the worlds.</p>
<p>What more can this servant mention that would be worthy of you? God the Exalted is my witness that upon beholding your letter, such joy and delight overtook me that I was and am unable to properly describe it. God willing, may we ever be blessed and gladdened by the trace of your pen. The remembrance of loved ones is auspicious to the Beloved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in these days a letter arrived from his honor Makhdum-Zadih, upon him be the Glory of God, wherein he had inscribed several names. These were presented to the Most Holy Court, and wondrous, exalted Tablets were revealed and sent from the heaven of divine favor specifically for him and all the other names. Blessed is he for having attained unto a goodly end.</p>
<p>Regarding the query about the expression of his honor the Siyyid, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, it was presented at the Most Holy Court. He said: “O Mahdi! Verily, My Most Exalted Pen does not wish to move upon what was written before. If thou ponderest, thou wilt understand his intent, what allusions and metaphors it contains. He intended naught but the mention of this Most Great Revelation, whose effulgence hath encompassed the worlds.”</p>
<p>God willing, may you be ever occupied with the remembrance of God and be blessed by His grace. The dispersion of outward means will, God willing, be transformed into unity through divine grace. Verily, He is the Giver, the Munificent, the Generous. The Glory be upon you and upon all who are with you, young and old.</p>
<p>The Servant [of God] 66</p>
<p>One more submission: The mention, praise, and expression of servitude that you had offered to the Branches of the Divine Lote-Tree were presented, and all conveyed exalted greetings to you.</p>

<p>Praise be unto God Who hath revealed Himself to all created things through the Point manifest from His Most Exalted Pen, whereupon all atoms spoke in praise of their Creator and acknowledged the power of their Fashioner. His is the creation and the command; He doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty and ordaineth what He pleaseth through His power. He is the One through Whose Name the ocean of divine knowledge surged amidst all contingent beings and the fragrance of utterance wafted through all lands. Exalted, exalted is He Who appeared with the truth, whereby the greatest terror seized all mankind save those who forsook the world and turned with humility unto the Lord of eternity and repented. The glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon those who have acknowledged that which God hath acknowledged and who have arisen to aid the Cause with wisdom and utterance in such wise that neither hosts could weaken them nor boundaries could change them. They arose and spoke as they were bidden by God, the Lord of the Final End.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who answereth them that are in distress and Who art the Refuge of them that flee! I beseech Thee by the heaven of Thy Will and the ocean of Thy Purpose and the sun of Thy Wisdom to make Thy loved ones among those whom Thou hast described in Thy Books and Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. Then protect them, O my God, from the evil of Thy creatures who have broken Thy Covenant and disbelieved in Thy proof and disputed Thy signs and denied Thy clear tokens after they had encompassed Thy heaven and Thy earth. Then inspire them, O God of the world and Lord of eternity, with that whereby Thy Cause may be exalted in Thy dominion. Verily Thou art the Almighty Whom the veils of the servants and the glory of them that dwell in all lands have not hindered. O Lord! Thou art the Omnipotent and Thou art the All-Conquering and Thou art the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>And then this servant submitteth that thy letter dated the 19th of Rajab was received and the cooing of the dove of love was heard from the trees of its words. God willing, mayest thou ever dwell with utmost joy and delight beneath the shade of the Tree of Manifestation through the grace of the eternal King. After perusal it was presented at the Most Holy and Exalted Court. Thus did the Beloved speak: O ’Abdu’llah! The servant present before the Countenance hath presented what thou didst write and send unto him. We have heard it and have answered thee with this Remembrance which proclaimeth throughout the world that He is the All-Knowing Rememberer. We beseech the Most High to assist thee and aid thee in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to draw thee nigh unto a station wherein thou shalt hear from the rushing of His winds that there is none other God but Him. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Munificent. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord’s favoring grace and say:</p>
<p>O my God and the God of all created things, my Sovereign and the Sovereign of all contingent beings, my Creator and the Creator of all in the heavens and the earth! I beseech Thee by Thy signs whereby all things were seized with trembling, to aid me to serve Thy Cause in such wise that the means of earth and heaven shall not hinder me. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>O Abdullah! With utmost joy and fragrance, speak in remembrance of the Beloved of all possibility, in such wise that its influence may become manifest in all created things and they may turn unto the Truth. The station of the captives of God who dwell in that land is great in the sight of God. Let none consider that today some appear weak or ignorant. Look ye to the essence of the Cause - were the veil to be lifted, things would be seen and heard unlike what hath been seen and heard. Beseech ye God that He may enable all to preserve that which hath been bestowed. By the life of God! The Wronged One speaketh the truth, and He is the All-Knowing Counsellor. The Day shall come when the deeds that have appeared from assured souls in the path of God shall be gathered and spread abroad on that Day of Assembly and Resurrection. We beseech God, exalted be He, to show you in all times the light of His Cause and to make you hear, in every moment, His call. He, verily, is the Near, the Answering.</p>
<p>Further expressions of God’s bounties are manifest and evident from these exalted words, requiring no elaboration, interpretation or investigation. Free from all veils and limitations, they are clear and manifest.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the distribution of funds, this servant hath submitted the details thereof to Jinab-i-Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin, upon him be the glory of God, and they shall reach your notice. The names of God’s captives that were in your book were submitted; for each one the Sun of Providence hath dawned specifically. He is before mine eyes - verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. From this spot we send our greetings upon them and beseech God, exalted be He, to protect them and grant them the good of this world and the next, and to strengthen them to preserve that wherewith He hath honored them. He, verily, is the Protector of those who turn unto Him.</p>
<p>This evanescent one requesteth that you convey expressions of nothingness and evanescence on his behalf to all the friends of God, both men and steadfast women, who are present in that land. The circling inmates of the Prison convey their most sublime, wondrous and exalted greetings and expressions of pure love to you and all the captives of God in that land. Glory be upon you and upon them for the duration of the earthly kingdom and the heavenly realm. Praise be to God, the Sovereign of sovereigns and subjects.</p>

<p>He is God - exalted be His glory, His grandeur and His majesty!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath made known unto us His straight path and His mighty command, and taught us the testimony whereby the Sun of unity hath shone forth and the decree of oneness been established. This indeed is the testimony uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur before the creation of the heavens and earth, and before the appearance of promise and threat: that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been sanctified beyond mention and utterance, and exalted above whatsoever hath appeared in the realm of possibility. He hath manifested Himself and revealed His sovereignty, whereupon the Nightingale of Eternity warbled upon the branches and the Bird of Remembrance sang in the Kingdom of utterance. By God! The promise hath come to pass, and that which was hidden and treasured hath been revealed - that whereby all that was and will be hath been confounded. Praise be to God Who hath caused the branches upon the Tree of Proof to speak forth in praise of His Self and in glorification of His Essence, and hath sent down for them that which brings solace to their eyes.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice unto your presence! The servant hath been honoured to receive your noble letter time and again, and found in every letter thereof that which brought joy to my breast, gladdened my heart, and increased my attachment and sincerity. We beseech God, exalted be He, to honor me at all times with that which diffuses the fragrance of your love, O Thou Who art our Beloved and the Beloved of all the worlds!</p>
<p>I submit that your letters have arrived continuously and successively, and I have been blessed to read them. After their arrival, they were presented with other petitions to the Most Holy Court and were submitted into His presence. Then the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, saying - and His Word is the truth: “He hath spoken that which befitteth the days of his Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We made mention of him before, and before that before, with praise whose fragrance hath been wafted to all regions and shall endure as long as God, the King, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, endureth. And We make mention of him at this hour that it may be a treasure for him and an honor for those who have believed in God, the Almighty, the Powerful. As for what he sought of forgiveness from the ocean of his Lord’s generosity, verily He hath responded as a bounty from His presence. He is, in truth, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. O My Afnan! We have answered thy prayer before thy request. Be thou assured through the grace of thy Lord, the Bestower, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>Beyond these clear verses, the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was also revealed from the heaven of will and was sent forth. Likewise, the petition that was submitted in the tongue of Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’l-?amid (upon him be the Glory of God) was presented, and exalted verses were revealed from the heaven of divine favors and were sent forth. God willing, they will be honored to receive it. Another reason for the delay in submitting my petitions was that several months passed during which no verses were revealed from the heaven of divine favor, and this servant was greatly perplexed. When I observed that the Supreme Pen had paused, I did not dare to submit a petition. I hope for your forgiveness. In these days, from the heaven of divine will, exalted Tablets have been revealed, the first of which was a mention revealed concerning the Father of the Community who ascended unto God. God willing, you will be honored to peruse it. Though revealed briefly, verily it is the speech of all things, the expounder of utterance, and the manifestation of proof to all in the realm of possibility. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who doeth what He willeth and decreeth what He pleaseth. Furthermore, if this servant were to attempt to describe the manifestations of the favors and bounties of the Ancient Beauty towards your honor, these petitions would surely never end. This servant hopes that there will appear from your honor that which you have expressed in your supplications, and may all your deeds be such as will cause God’s Cause to spread throughout all lands and His mention among all servants.</p>
<p>Moreover, all that was sent to the Most Holy Court–the silk chest, the preserves sent before and after, likewise the tea sent before and after, the cinnamon, the vessels, the broadcloth, and the flower seeds–all were received. In brief, everything mentioned in the blessed letters, both earlier and later, has all arrived. The last four boxes of tea arrived on the day of the New Fast, and were specially prepared in the blessed presence and found acceptable. The flower seeds were planted in a small plot in the name of the True Planter, but in truth, the spiritual seeds of flowers and fragrant herbs were your honor’s supplications that were presented in the Most Holy Court, and assuredly their blossoms will appear and their fragrance will be inhaled by those possessed of true spiritual sense. We beseech God to inspire your honor at all times with that which brings joy to the hearts of those near unto Him. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>To Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’l-?amid, upon him be the Glory of God, convey the Most Glorious greeting. All the inhabitants of the Prison Land, one and all, offer their utter effacement and nothingness, and greetings too sacred to be mentioned or expressed, to your honor. Upon you be the Glory of God and the glory of those in the heavens, then the glory of all worlds. At all times, sovereignty belongs to God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. The Branches of the Divine Lote-Tree–may my spirit and the spirits of all the worlds be sacrificed for them–convey the essence of praise and glorification to your honor.</p>

<p>He is the Most Manifest, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath graciously accepted the remembrance of His servants and commanded them to praise His Self, that He might exalt them to a station ordained for them through His bounty and generosity. Verily, He is the Sanctified One Whom the praise of the world cannot exalt, and the Self-Subsisting One Whom the remembrance of the nations cannot alter. He hath ever been sanctified beyond the remembrance of aught else but Him and the utterance of aught besides Him. He is verily the Self-Subsisting One foretold by the Qa’im Who arose to proclaim the Cause and raised the most great call betwixt earth and heaven. By God! I have come unto you, O peoples of the earth, to bring you glad tidings of Him Who shall come with the standards of signs and the banners of proofs, Who hath named Himself the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Secret. I bear witness that He was concealed behind the veil of grandeur throughout all eternity, and when He willed to manifest His Cause, He appeared with a sovereignty that encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth, and uttered that which caused every treacherous one to be shaken and every faithful one to be assured, every fearful and false one to lament and every sincere seeker to rejoice. He is the Peerless One before Whose knowledge every mystic hath confessed his powerlessness and every learned one hath acknowledged his failure to attain the heaven of His knowledge. There is none other God but He, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant hath been honored to receive your missive, which was adorned with the remembrance of God, our Lord and your Lord, our Beloved and the Beloved of all worlds. When I read it, I ascended to the station of revelation and manifestation, and it was presented before the countenance of our Lord, the Master of the Day of Resurrection. Then did the Face of the Everlasting turn toward this evanescent one, and there was sent down for you and your sons from the Kingdom of Utterance that which cannot be expressed by the tongue. To this doth our Lord, the All-Merciful, bear witness. Verily, He is the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>It is submitted that after this evanescent one became aware of the letter addressed to your honor, he turned toward the Most Holy Court. The matters were presented before the Throne, and three Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets were revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will specifically for your honor and your two noble sons, and were dispatched. From the fragrance of the utterances of the All-Merciful, the degrees of His favor and grace are evident and manifest. God willing, they shall attain unto them.</p>
<p>You that had written that you had been erased from this evanescent servant’s view due to the length of time - God forbid! God forbid! The One God is witness and testament that you have been and will continue to be in view, and in the Most Holy Court your mention has been made from time to time. If according to outward appearance there has been or will be delay in sending letters, this has not been and will not be due to neglect or forgetfulness. The occupation of this evanescent one has reached such a state that truly there is no opportunity and no chance. Night and day engaged in the writing of verses - you yourself can testify how great this matter is. On one side the revealed verses, on another side replies to the petitions of people arriving from all directions, and from yet another side the handwritten letters of friends addressed to this evanescent one - all must be seen, read, and answered. In such case if there be delay in sending replies, one should not be disheartened. The essential thing is divine favor, and this servant testifies that you are possessed of it. This suffices you, by the Lord of all worlds. And the elegies you had composed in remembrance of the two brilliant Lights were presented at the Most Holy Court and were accepted, and likewise the people of the Household observed them and praised them. The station of the Name of God “?a” is most great. Once the Tongue of Grandeur uttered these words: “He attained martyrdom in his life, for he had no wishes, will or desire of his own. All his affairs ended in God. His spirit had been sacrificed while his body walked among men and spoke, and then he attained outward martyrdom as well.” This evanescent servant utters a hundred thousand times the words “Would that I had been with him!” Furthermore, the oppression of the second ?a is clear and evident, though verily the first ?a preceded him. What remains for this servant is abundant sorrow and endless regret, for he did not attain to what was befitting and proper. Yet whatever the Beloved has willed is truly beloved. Were it not for these words, the heaven of the heart would be seen to split and the earth of being to cleave asunder, for he did not attain to that most exalted station and did not reach that most sublime rank. The sincere ones freely gave their lives while the servant preserves his through eating and drinking. Those souls in spending, this soul in withholding. The Command is in the hand of God, the Single, the All-Informed. Convey sublime greetings on behalf of this evanescent servant to the children of the master - this depends on your grace. I give them the glad tidings that their deed was accepted at the threshold of the Throne. God willing, may you always be engaged in work with perfect comfort and utter remembrance, for verily He is the All-Wise Teacher. 1297</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath spoken the Most Exalted Word whereby the veils of names were rent asunder. Thereupon arose the clamor of the divines who opposed God, the Creator of heaven. We testify that they were thunderstruck when the Greatest Trump was sounded from the presence of God, the Lord of destiny. We testify that they were as dead when the Greatest Manifestation appeared, the sun was darkened and the moon was eclipsed. We testify that they were abased when the most luminous horizon dawned and the Hidden Countenance shone forth. We testify that they were bewildered when the Sovereign of Names came and was made manifest to all created things through His most beautiful names and most exalted attributes. Glorified be the Lord of nations Who hath appeared with the Greatest Name. He is indeed the Ever-Living Who dieth not and the All-Powerful from Whom nothing escapeth. Within His grasp is the dominion of the kingdom of the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the Servant received your letter from which wafted the fragrance of love and affection. We beseech God to assist you, to strengthen you, and to ordain for you the reward of those who attained His presence. He is verily the Powerful, the All-Giving, the Generous.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about hardship having overtaken the friends of God and that communication between them has been cut off - this servant’s expectation of the friends of Truth is that in such times they should occupy themselves with the remembrance of the Lord of Names and Attributes. This is a day wherein all must associate with utmost eagerness and longing, and speak in remembrance of God. However, they must observe wisdom and conduct themselves such that no matter might arise to cause sedition, for in most of the divine Tablets the commandment of wisdom hath been revealed and all have been bidden to observe it. Blessed are they that act accordingly.</p>
<p>Say: Be not grieved by hardship and what hath befallen you. Soon shall ye behold ease from God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God willing, divine invisible assistance hath encompassed and will continue to encompass the friends.</p>
<p>As to your question regarding those souls who have harmed the people of truth or caused their death - whether such souls shall have any portion in God’s infinite worlds or shall be deprived: These souls are of two kinds. If they witnessed reprehensible deeds from the friends of God while being unaware of the Manifestation of God’s Cause, there is hope for their salvation. However, if someone commits such reprehensible acts against the friends of God purely out of passion and rejection of truth, such a one was never and will never be worthy of divine favors, and shall remain deprived and tormented in all the divine worlds.</p>
<p>Regarding your request for the Hidden Words in Arabic and Persian - consider the manifold occupations of this servant. The land of Qaf is but one province; observe how many divine Tablets and letters from this servant reach that land yearly, all of which this servant must write. Likewise for the lands of Ta, Ya, Za, Sad, Kaf, Ta, the lands of Kha, India, and other regions too numerous to mention. Divine verses are sent to all these realms in like manner. In such circumstances, you yourself can testify that I have had and have no time, and were it not for divine assistance, this servant could never have fulfilled this service. I praise Him for enabling me to serve Him despite my unworthiness.</p>
<p>Some friends should not be saddened by delays in correspondence, for nothing has been neglected within my capacity. However, divine verses and heavenly rains are descending in such measure that pen, ink and tablet are powerless to describe. Nevertheless, if any shortcoming occurs it is due to lack of time, and I hope for forgiveness from all.</p>
<p>Your petition was presented to the Most Holy Court, and its beginning was honored with divine verses. God willing, it shall reach you. All that was written on the back of the letter from the handmaiden of God was presented in its entirety before His presence. He said that God, glorified and exalted be He, hath mentioned and continueth to mention His friends among His male and female servants, and His glance of favor is directed toward them. Whatever divine wisdom requireth shall surely come to pass. They should not be grieved by separation. He ordaineth what He willeth for whom He willeth and recordeth for such a one the reward of attaining His presence. He is verily the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Today all must observe the divine ordinances and act according to what hath been revealed therein. They must avoid any matter that causeth corruption and discord among the loved ones. All are commanded to wisdom and unity. Blessed are they who attain and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Verily, glory and radiance be upon you and upon the loved ones of God in that land.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath spoken of the oneness of His Being and caused all things to speak forth His remembrance and praise. Though He hath been described by every tongue, characterized by every utterance, and mentioned by every heart, we testify that He is the Hidden Mystery Who hath never been described throughout all eternity past nor shall ever be mentioned throughout all eternity to come. Exalted be His might and power, exalted be His station and knowledge. The Supreme Pen hath spoken forth in the kingdom of creation, whereupon the dwellers of the cities of names were thunderstruck - some were awakened by the breeze of revelation while others returned to the abyss of divine wrath. I pray and glorify those who have inhaled the fragrance of His days and have attained unto His good-pleasure. They are among the people of Baha. Upon them be the glory of God, the Lord of Names and Creator of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Furthermore, your two missives, adorned with the mention of God, were the cause of the heart’s rejoicing. God willing, may you ever remain occupied with the remembrance of the Desired One of the world, and be mentioned in His presence. Regarding what you wrote about the souls in that land who have been set ablaze by the divine fire and have turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon - we beseech God to make them firm and steadfast, for steadfastness is among the most mighty of matters. It hath often been observed that certain souls have turned toward the Cause through one word, yet become veiled through another. Verily He guideth whom He willeth unto the straight path. God willing, your efforts have not been and shall not be in vain. Every soul must arise to serve the Cause for the sake of God and speak with wisdom for His sake. The effect thereof resteth with God, exalted be His glory. He giveth to whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He pleaseth, and ordaineth for whomsoever He desireth whatsoever He desireth.</p>
<p>The letter from Nawwab Muhammad ’Azimu’d-Din Khan addressed to this evanescent servant was received. That same letter was presented in the Most Holy Court, and magnificent and wondrous Tablets were revealed and sent specifically for him and the souls mentioned therein. God willing, may they attain unto them and be enkindled by the divine fire. This evanescent servant hath also, according to his poverty and lowliness, addressed a letter to them. We beseech God to aid them, draw them nigh, and give them to drink of the sealed wine through His Name, the Mighty, the Manifest, the Hidden.</p>
<p>Every seed that is sown for the sake of God and falls upon good soil will assuredly, by God’s leave, the Revealer of verses, yield boundless good. We beseech God to make your endeavors and efforts yield universal fruits, that all may attain unto the Source and be illumined by the lights of His countenance.</p>
<p>If you inquire about conditions in this land, praise be to God, it is peaceful. In these days, a number of travelers have, in accordance with the command, set out for their homelands. This servant hath been occupied with writing day and night, and therefore had not the opportunity to send the great mystical circle that was requested. However, two small circles were written and sent. In any case, the shortcomings of this servant must be overlooked and forgiven. Several people have recently arrived at the Most Great Scene from Iran, but there was no news worthy of mention. However, divergent views have not yet attained unto the blessing of unity and concord. The princes are at variance and the divines are in open conflict. They have lost, those who have turned away from God and His authority and followed their own idle fancies and vain imaginings.</p>
<p>The honored Aqa Jamal, upon him be the glory of God, is in prison, and his petitions have repeatedly reached the Most Holy Court. God will soon deliver him through truth. He is verily the Mighty, the Powerful. According to reports, he is respected in prison. When his messenger came to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence and requested Aqa Jamal’s release from prison, He said: “If he leaves, does he have a house to dwell in?” The messenger replied: “No.” He said: “Indeed, his place is in prison.” In truth, whatever occurs for the sake of God is beloved to the soul and the heart’s desire. What blessing is greater than tribulations that occur in the path of the Beloved? People are asleep; when they die they awaken. Which house hath not been seized by ruin? Which garden hath not lost its splendor to autumn winds? Blessed is the structure not followed by a destroyer. The house that is not seized by extinction and remains protected from the vicissitudes of time is a deed performed for God’s sake. We beseech God to aid us in that which He loveth and approveth.</p>
<p>The very events of the world and its changes are a tablet whereon its extinction hath been inscribed by a manifest pen. Blessed is he who hath cast it aside, blessed is he who hath forsaken it to serve God and manifest His decisive and wise Cause. The world is that which preventeth men from turning toward God, not what heedless servants have understood it to be. Thus hath it been sent down from the Pen of our Most Glorious Lord in a preserved tablet.</p>

<p>For the son [Ali] Qabl-i-Nabil 110</p>
<p>O My Name! Hearken unto My call, for by My call are spirits and minds made alive. Say: O people! This is He in Whose praise and glorification the Bayan was revealed. Beware lest ye be veiled by aught from the remembrance of God, the All-Protecting, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O people! He hath come unto you with all the signs, would ye but perceive. ’Ali hath come unto you with the truth, would ye but know it. He took the covenant of My Self from you in the atoms of the Bayan, yet most people remained veiled and are now as dead. Say: Those from whom the spirit of life hath been taken shall not arise from the graves of heedlessness, thus hath the matter been ordained, would ye but know it.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear God and associate not aught with Him, for verily association is a grievous wrong, would ye but understand. This Youth of God is among you, calling you unto Him at all times, and to this do His near servants testify. He desireth from you no recompense, nor doth He seek from you any thanks. Verily your Beloved, the Most Exalted One, hath been sent for this Most Holy and Most Glorious Manifestation, as attested by that which was revealed from His presence. Look ye therefore in the Bayan, that ye may find how He counseled you not to hesitate in this Manifestation, nor to be veiled by what was revealed in the Bayan from the Countenance of the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>By God! He is this One, and this is the Promised One. Every atom beareth witness unto Him, would ye but testify. All things weep at His grief, would ye but weep. The denizens of the highest Paradise lament for Him, yet ye rejoice. He is in this prison while ye rest upon your seats. He drinketh of His own blood while ye drink from every cup. He is imprisoned in a strange land while ye abide secure in your homelands. By God! Husayn weepeth at My sorrow, and all that hath been created between the Kaf and the Nun lamenteth for Me. Then doth ’Ali weep for My tribulation in the Most Glorious Horizon, would ye but know.</p>
<p>Fear ye God, then have mercy upon My Soul, and transgress not beyond what hath been ordained in the preserved Tablets of glory. Say: Were it not for My remembrance, the Bayan would not have been revealed unto ’Ali, nor would the sun of the Furqan have shone forth from the horizon of Hijaz, nor would the Spirit have appeared with the signs of God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Fear ye God and oppose not Him Whom all on earth have opposed. Sufficient unto Him is what hath befallen Him and what continueth to befall Him from those who have denied God, the Mighty, the Beloved. And thou, O thou who gazest upon thy Lord’s Most Glorious Horizon, hearken unto the melodies of the Dove, then detach thyself from all that hath been created between earth and heaven. Then remind the people of this hidden News, and drink at every moment from the cup of life, though thou didst drink therefrom in the days of thy Lord, to which all things bear witness, yet people hear not.</p>
<p>Drink thou therefrom, draft after draft. Thus have We ordained for thee in a preserved Tablet of glory. Be thou steadfast in the love of God and His Cause, then aid Him with what thou art able, and this is better for thee than what hath been and what shall be. Then remind from Us him who hath been named Hasan, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of God, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
<p>O Hasan! Blessed art thou for having drunk from the cup of love for Husayn in those days when He was afflicted among these oppressors. O Hasan! Know thou that this Husayn at every moment beholdeth Shimr on His right, then Sinan on His left, then Khawli behind Him, and God is witness to what I say. His only crime was that He called all unto God, the King, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed art thou for having found solace in the company of the loved ones of God and for having associated with them, and this is the way of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>The Spirit be upon thee and upon thy sister and upon those who have stood firm in this mighty and irrevocable Cause. Then convey God’s greetings to the face of him who serveth you out of love for God, your Lord and the Lord of your ancient forebears. Say: O servant! Hold fast unto the loved ones of God and separate not thyself from them. Thus did We command thee before and now command thee again from the presence of the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>Be patient in adversities, for verily thy Lord hath been in grievous tribulation, such that the gates of joy were closed before His face, yet He was content with what God was content with for Him and what was decreed for Him in the preserved Tablet of glory. O My Name! Deliver the messages of thy Lord unto those who have been mentioned in this Tablet and unto those who have believed in God, the Most High, the Most Great. Beware lest thou be silent in mentioning thy Lord or grow cold in the warmth of thy love. Thus doth this brilliant and luminous Pen counsel thee. And the light that hath shone forth from the horizon of Glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon those among His assured servants who love you.</p>

<p>O Muhammad! Be content with thy Lord and become independent of all that hath been created in dust, for dust and whatsoever proceedeth therefrom befitteth it and those who are devoted thereto and are among the devoted ones. Know thou that the dust which is condemned in the sight of God is the love of Mine enemies and attachment to them. But the dust which existeth in the kingdom is the manifestation of My Name, the All-Wise, the All-Knowing Director, and through it We have revealed the mysteries of the Cause and the subtleties of power, as ye have witnessed and are among the witnesses. Lift up thine eyes above all else, that My Beauty may be manifested unto thee - a Beauty which the eyes of the world have not attained. By God, O Muhammad! There hath befallen Me that which hath befallen no one among all created things. Were I to utter but one word thereof, the pillars of the Throne would quake and the supports of the exalted Seat would crumble. Alas! Alas for that which the servants who were created by His command raise against the Ancient Beauty, at a time when the Temple of Pre-existence was established upon the throne of a mighty Name. Know thou the value of these days and emerge from the shirt of fancy, that perchance through thee the musk of divine knowledge may be diffused by thy Lord’s permission, the All-Merciful, and may perfume all the world.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Soon shalt thou turn thy gaze toward the horizons but shall not find the Day-Star of the horizons, even shouldst thou circle throughout the heavens and the earth. Thus do We inform thee with truth that thou mayest be of them that know. Then shall all existence place the fingers of remorse and regret between their teeth, and all created things shall weep with manifest tears of sorrow. We have informed thee of this that thou mayest become aware of that which is veiled from the eyes of them that are shut out as by a veil. Beware lest thou conceal the Cause of God, for thou hast witnessed His power and His sovereignty, His greatness and His might. Remind the people of what God hath shown thee and be of them that remember. And if one who turneth away should object, grieve not but be patient with beautiful patience. And if thou findest thyself alone in My love, rejoice within thyself and be of them that rejoice, for My love is of the wine of everlasting life which God hath specially ordained for them that are nigh unto Him, and no heedless soul shall ever partake thereof though he should search in the wilderness of desire unto all eternity.</p>
<p>Say: By God! The Holy Spirit attained but a drop thereof, and thereby did God quicken His sincere servants. This is a word which God hath made a fire unto them that deny and are proud, and a light unto them that have discerned the seat of the Cause in this Beauty Who hath been afflicted among these polytheists. Taste thou from the divine Tree and its fruits, then take shelter beneath its shade and fear no one, but trust in God, the Mighty, the Wise. And if thou seest him whose name thou didst mention in the Tablet, say: O servant! Thou wert present before the Manifestation of thy Lord’s Self, yet thou knew Him not and wert among the heedless. This was not unique to thee, for even those who were around Him at all times knew Him not, for We veiled the Face behind a thousand veils lest anyone discover what was ordained in the Tablets from the Pen of a holy, protecting One. Read thou these words, that perchance God may thereby give peace to thy soul and may reveal unto thee, in sleep or wakefulness, that which may bring rest to thy heart. There is no God but He. His are the creation and the command. He guideth whom He willeth and misleadeth whom He willeth. He is indeed the One, the Single, the All-Informed. Therefore call upon God, thy Lord, in all days with this prayer:</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy most exalted Beauty, and by the manifestations of the might of Thy sovereignty between earth and heaven, and by the splendor of Thy countenance whereby the dwellers of the realms of eternity were illumined, that Thou withhold me not from the wondrous revelations of the Sun of Thy knowledge, nor deprive me from entering the sanctuary of Thy glorious presence. Thou, verily, art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and Thou, truly, art the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O my God! I am he who hath turned his face away from the faces of all created things and hath set his face toward the face of Thy sanctified oneness, who hath fled from his own self and from all else but Thee, and who hath sought shelter beneath the shadow of the tree of Thy unity. Therefore, O my God, leave me not to myself, nor to anything that hath been created between the earths and the heavens. Then cause me to enter, O my God, within the pavilions of Thy nearness and the tabernacle of Thy love. Then unveil unto me, O my God, that which is hidden from the eyes of Thy servants and concealed from the knowledge of Thy creatures. Then make me, O my God, to be of them that have entered the stronghold of Thy Cause and dwelt within the precincts of Thy mercy. Verily, Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. Then preserve me, O my God, from mine enemies and from all that Thy good-pleasure abhorreth. Then send down upon me from the heaven of Thy bounty that which shall detach me from the world and enable me to attain unto Thy most exalted Self in this most pure and luminous Garment.</p>
<p>And thou, O Muhammad, if thou art not in his presence, send this Tablet to him from Me that he may read it and be of them that remember. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon such of the servants as are not hindered by the insinuations of Satan nor by the multitude of the idolaters from this resplendent and gracious Beauty.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the most great!</p>
<p>Praise be unto the Desired One, Who befitteth distinction through His most exalted Word between the loved ones and the enemies, and Who hath made manifest both the treachery of wandering eyes and the secrets concealed in hearts. This is the Day of this blessed verse, blessed and exalted be His Word: “O my son! If there be the weight of a mustard-seed and it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth.” Praise be unto Him, then praise be unto Him, Who hath distinguished the holy and sanctified garments from the garments of treacherous and lying souls, that the possessors of vision, justice and fairness might witness the deeds and actions of those endowed with trustworthiness and godliness, and those who are lost and immoral. Truth and righteousness remain not concealed but shine forth like unto the sun. How great is the loss of those souls who, for the baubles of this world, have forsaken trustworthiness, truth and sincerity, and have clung to falsehood and calumny.</p>
<p>Prayers and peace be upon the Lord of Messengers and Guide of Ways, through Whom God’s signs and ordinances were spread among His creation, and upon His family and companions, through whom the mysteries of the Book were made manifest and that which was hidden from those possessed of understanding was brought forth.</p>
<p>The letters of that beloved of the heart arrived. Praise be to God, whatsoever was recorded therein was illumined and adorned with the light of truth and sincerity. Divine power hath made manifest the wickedness of treacherous souls. Though they imagined they had concealed it, yet those very assembled souls themselves and others bear witness to the lies and treachery of those repositories of rancor, hatred and calumny. The servant beseecheth his Lord to reveal unto all their deeds and actions. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Concerning the presence of my beloved, his honor the Overseer, upon him be God’s peace and loving-kindness, as soon as they wrote, they were summoned by telegraph to proceed in that direction. Regarding what was written about Aqa Muhammad-Javad of the people of ?ad, upon him be God’s peace, who sent a letter to Siyyid Mu??afa about the actions of certain known individuals - the aforementioned Siyyid wrote a letter to Aqa Muhammad-Javad, and according to reports, they too have written him a reply. What they mentioned in their reply consisted of things they had heard from the companions and related, for whoever arrives becomes aware of those souls’ misdeeds before meeting this servant. However, these matters need not cause distress. The falsehood of those souls is clear and evident to your honor. They have committed that which hath no likeness or parallel.</p>
<p>The servant beseecheth his Lord to assist you with the hosts of the seen and unseen, and to protect you from the evil of the liars and calumniators. Praise be to God that just as the lies and calumnies of those souls were exposed, so too was made manifest and evident the truth of the honored master, his honor the Afnan, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah] the Most Glorious, and that beloved one. The purpose of the honored Afnan’s visit to that land was to engage in commerce. At present, prudence in affairs is necessary until the government is assured. After presenting these matters, they said: “You have been and are with the truth. With complete confidence and joy, and trusting in God, hold fast to that which will set things aright. This decree is manifest, and in His grasp is the Kingdom of all things. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth.”</p>
<p>O Trustee! Be not disturbed, fear not. God willing, you shall attain to that which is good. Move forward with perfect joy, delight and strength. We beseech Him to assist you with His means, power and sovereignty. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>God willing, truth shall be made manifest and shall not remain concealed. Yet one is astonished at souls who, without cause and merely out of greed, avarice and passion, cling to all manner of evil and emerge thus. Glory be to God! Love of transient ornaments hath so seized them that they have become utterly deprived of human qualities. We seek refuge in God! O my Lord! Protect us and Thy servants through Thy generosity and bounty. Verily, Thou art the most powerful of the powerful and the most generous of the generous.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about staying or returning to Iran or proceeding to the intended destination, they said: “At present you must remain in that land. Movement is not permitted. This is better for thee and a treasure for thee with God, the Lord of the mighty throne.”</p>
<p>All the friends are occupied day and night in remembrance of that beloved one. News of the treachery and turning away of the unfaithful hath reached various regions. Some have become greatly enkindled. It is hoped that the final outcome of matters will end in the greatest joy. Verily, God is the Strong, the Triumphant, the Powerful.</p>
<p>The Branches of the Blessed Tree, each one of them, make mention of your honor, as do the people of the pavilion of chastity and the loved ones of the prison land. Praise be to God, you have been and are mentioned by all. Peace, remembrance and glory be upon you, upon those who love you, and upon God’s sincere servants.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise be to the peerless Lord who, despite the convulsions of the world, the hatred of certain peoples, the calumnies of the slanderers, and the clamor of the deceivers, guided and led His loved ones to the Most Great Prison. Glory be to God! Despite a thousand intrigues and evil whisperings, through His absolute, prevailing, and penetrating Will, He gathered an assembly beneath the Blessed Tree, bringing together the sincere ones and the monotheists. During the nights and days, He favored each one with a mention and adorned each with a gift. His is the greatness and the power, His is the glory and the might and the will. He ordaineth as He pleaseth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>For a time no outward news or trace had come from that beloved of hearts, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of creation, and this caused distress among many, as from every quarter they were inquiring and seeking news, O Trusted One, until news arrived of arrival in the land of H and M. The servant beseecheth his Lord to protect His loved ones from harm and tribulation, and from rancor and hatred. Verily He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>And when news of arrival was presented before the Throne, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these exalted words - exalted be His utterance and His proof: “O Amin, upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness! Ever hast thou been and art remembered in the Most Holy Court. In these days, consummate wisdom hath required that thou shouldst proceed to the region of Kha and visit Ibn-i-Asdaq, upon him be the glory of God. Then shall appear what We have purposed. Verily thy Lord is the Ancient Commander.” After receiving the letter and becoming informed, proceed at once to the destination. Thus hath the matter been decreed by the All-Commanding, the All-Wise. Patience is forbidden after the manifestation of the divine will from the presence of the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having enabled me to turn to Thee and for revealing to me what was hidden and concealed from the eyes of Thy creatures. I beseech Thee, O Fulfiller of the needs of all seekers, to assist Thy Cause through wisdom and utterance. Strengthen, O my God, Thy loved ones to remain steadfast in Thy love and service. O Lord! Thou seest Thy trusted servant traversing the lands to manifest Thy Cause and exalt Thy Word. Aid him, O my God, with the hosts of revelation and inspiration, and with the angels on high. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the loved ones in every land and set them ablaze with the fire of utterance of the Lord of religions. In these days certain blessed Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of oneness, specifically for one who ascended in the land of Sh. We were with him at the time of his ascension. Verily thy Lord is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Goal of them that know. Beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant steadfastness to His loved ones, lest the names prevent them from their Owner, their Quickener, their Slayer, and their Creator. Glory be to God! Hadi of Dawlatabad hath raised a standard and desired to guide the people. Say: Be silent, O heedless one, and bridle thy self, O ignorant one! By God’s life, thou art not the horseman of this field. We invited him to attend and listen, but pride seized him such that he cast the Cause behind him and committed that which caused the denizens of the pavilion of glory to lament. He who possesseth the Supreme Tablet beareth witness to this. The End.</p>
<p>This servant has ever been distressed and saddened by the tribulations of this Most Great Announcement and what hath been visited upon it by the enemies, to such extent that he seeth no deliverance for himself therefrom, for the Truth did arise to promote His Cause for forty years, without helper or assistant, and through the power of His Word did set the world in motion, such that from all directions they arose to investigate this Cause. And when the light became resplendent and the Cause manifest, the deniers emerged from behind the veil and wrought that which every possessor of ears heard and every person of insight witnessed. It behooveth us to overlook what he and his followers have done. After His ascension until now, the same message that His Holiness Afnan, Alif and Ha, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, had sent, was received. Nothing else has been received since then. Therefore it became necessary to inform that beloved one, for they had instructed that whenever it becomes necessary to inform of a matter, inform [him]. Thus was this detail submitted. The Command is in God’s hands - He doeth and decreeth as He pleaseth, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. That beloved one’s journey to the land of Kha to see His honor Ibn-i-A?daq, upon him be [the Glory of God] 966, is necessary and should not be delayed in any way. Upon receiving word they should set forth at once. I convey greetings, glorification and light to all the loved ones wheresoever they may be, and I beseech steadfastness for all on this day, for that is the most excellent of all deeds before [the Most High]. Glory and praise and benediction be upon you and upon those with you and those who love you and hearken unto your words concerning the Cause of our Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Servant. 17 [Rabi’u’l-Avval 1308]</p>

<p>The servant perceived the fragrance of your letter before its appearance and arrival. This testifieth and will continue to testify to the loftiness of your love and the excellence of your affection in God, the Lord of the Throne and earth, the Master of the hereafter and the former times.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Your words have stirred me and your utterances have gladdened me. After reading and reciting, I approached a place that God hath sanctified from the idle fancies of heedless creatures. When I arrived, I presented what was in your letter, whereupon the Master - may our souls be sacrificed for His sake - spoke:</p>
<p>“O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! We have heard thy call and perceived from thy letter the fragrance of sincerity and supplication unto God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to adorn thee in all conditions with the ornament of righteousness and fear of God, to protect thee from the evil of enemies, to give thee to drink at all times from the cup of recognition, and to ordain for thee from the Pen of Destiny that which will draw thee near unto Him and assist thee in that which thou hast been commanded in His Book. Verily, He is the Almighty Whom the veils of the deluded cannot hinder, nor the imaginings of the heedless. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Rida! Upon thee be My peace. Thou art ever remembered in the gathering of the captives. Blessed art thou for having drunk the choice wine of certitude and utterance in praise of God, the Lord of the worlds and the Goal of all peoples. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to open before thy face the door of His bestowal, to rain down upon thee from the clouds of His generosity the showers of His bounty and the outpourings of His mercy, to protect thee with the hosts of power and might, and to assist thee in good deeds. Verily, He is the Guardian of good deeds and the Revealer of verses. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God that the glad tidings of that spiritual beloved’s health and well-being arrived and became the cause of joy and delight. God is witness that I have ever been thinking of you and have ever beseeched the Self-Sufficient, the Most High for your well-being. However, since you have been in the service of His Honor the Trustee - upon him be God’s peace, protection and mercy - complete assurance and certitude was attained. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to preserve and protect him, to strengthen him through His might and exalt him through His loving-kindness. Moreover, mention of him was heard at times from the Master’s tongue. Surely this mention must have an effect in the world. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon him from the heaven of His grace the rains of blessing and favor. Verily, He is the Lord of creation and in His grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>The gift that was sent in their name has arrived. Praise be to God Who hath manifested from His presence that which indicateth His love and affection. Think not that there was any hesitation in accepting what was sent. Nay, by the very Self of the Lord, this servant beareth witness that it was accepted with supreme acceptance. The gaze of them that are endued with certitude is fixed upon love and purpose and the sender, not upon aught else. Love hath its aspects and stations. It is the teacher of hearts and souls and the revealer of mysteries. And since this deed was adorned with the ornament of love, its acceptance transcendeth all acceptance and is approved by His loved ones and chosen ones.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about this servant’s intention to gather the means for the garden remaining firm and steadfast - this is among the aspects of love, for when a hundred cometh, ninety is also with us. When love is established, its conditions and effects are present. This condition can never be separated or divided from that which is conditioned by it. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to preserve you and draw you nigh. Verily, He is the Lord of grace and confirmation, the Helper of them that do good amongst His servants, and the Ultimate Goal of them that know in His kingdom.</p>
<p>The apple of my eye, his honor Aqa Mirza Mu??afa - upon him be 9 6 6 [Baha’u’llah] - hath repeatedly made mention of you. Indeed, each of the existing chosen ones hath made and continueth to make mention of you, and all beseech from God, exalted be His glory, whatsoever constituteth the supreme ladder for ascent and exaltation. Verily God is the Generous Giver. Nothing escapeth His knowledge. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent.

<p>Praise be to the Goal of all the worlds, Who hath enabled His loved ones to turn unto Him and to stand firm, and hath blessed them to acknowledge and confess the blessed word “There is none other God but Him,” and hath adorned them with the ornament of justice and fairness. These are the servants whom God hath described in His mighty Book as honored servants who speak not until He hath spoken, and who act by His command. And prayers and peace be upon the Ensigns of His guidance and the Banners of His victory and the Cities of His knowledge and the Oceans of His grace, through whom every name was established upon the throne of glory and bounty, and the Sun of every attribute shone forth amidst humanity, and the Most Great Word encompassed all who dwell in the kingdom of creation, until the Names culminated in their Lord Muhammad - verily He is the Manifestation of the blessed Word, praiseworthy in His Cause and obeyed in His judgment - and upon His family and companions, the pearls of wisdom and understanding and the sources of ordinances and laws.</p>
<p>And then, the letter of that honored brother arrived and after its reading and review, it was granted audience before the Master. They said these matters are contingent upon consultation. Praise be to God, the soul that ascended did so with utmost joy and fragrance and with the light of certitude and assurance, attaining the horizon of the favor of the Goal of all the worlds. Neither wealth nor poverty of the world, nor the doubts and intimations of the nations, nor hardship and adversity and difficulty and tribulation prevented him from the Word of Unity nor deprived him from the Most Great Ocean. This is what transpired and all must mention with utmost sanctity and purity that which hath been revealed and flowed from the Kingdom of utterance and the realm of possibility. We beseech God, exalted be He, to send down upon him at all times mercy from His presence and favor from His own Self, and to give him to drink, from the hands of bounty, the Kawthar of eternity in the highest Paradise and the supreme Heaven. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Convey to each of the relatives the greetings from the Wronged One and console them. In truth, that which causeth burning grief and sorrow hath befallen those who remain. However, by the life of God, that departed one hath attained unto the ocean of God’s mercy and dwelleth in utmost joy and assurance with those near ones and sincere ones. The relatives too must in truth be joyous, for whatsoever appeareth from the Just, the Wise, is pure good. God, exalted be His glory, He is the All-Patient, the Concealer, the All-Forgiving, the Ever-Relenting, the Forgiver, the Merciful. In truth, sorrow in these days is not permitted. Were the proofs of this matter to flow from the Pen, the Perspicuous Book would be witnessed.</p>
<p>O Abdullah! Upon thee be the peace of God, the Lord of all names and Creator of heaven. The mother and sister and other sister and two sons - all are remembered before the Wronged One. We make mention of Hibatu’llah, upon him be God’s peace and favor, and We beseech God, exalted be His glory, for each one that which causeth elevation and ascendancy. This mention shall not be erased from the Book of the mindful ones and the scroll of the knowing ones.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven! Aid Thy loved ones to be steadfast in Thy Cause and draw them nigh unto Thee, and ordain for them the best of what Thou hast ordained for Thy trusted ones and chosen ones. Then send down upon them from the heaven of Thy favor a blessing from Thy presence and a bounty from Thy own Self. Verily Thou art God, the Lord of all worlds, and the Goal of all who seek, and the Most Merciful of the merciful ones.</p>
<p>A hundred thousand praises and thanks unto the Goal of the world Who hath enabled His loved ones to achieve that which is the cause of enduring mention and an everlasting name. This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth from the heaven of divine Will and the ocean of divine generosity that He may preserve that honored one and his relatives in all conditions beneath the shadow of His favor with utmost joy and gladness. Verily He is the most powerful of the powerful and the most generous of the generous, and praise be unto Him for He is the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>And regarding the matters you had written about, it was presented and They said to hold fast to whatever emerges from consultation, and the members of consultation are the certain, assured, and designated souls - upon them be God’s peace and favors. It is very difficult to find someone who would at once take the shop’s goods and pay the debts, for after the appearance of treachery in this land, blessing hath halted. Therefore one must act according to what is now easiest and most beloved and most beneficial. This servant asketh for you the good of this world and the next from the heaven of bounty of our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the exalted Throne. Make mention of the women from this evanescent one. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant patience and adorn with the garment of forbearance. Peace and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those with you and upon God’s righteous servants.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise sanctified above all mention of the world and its peoples befitteth the Lord of Eternity, Who through His Most Great Name conquered the world and made manifest the path of salvation. The purpose of the creation of beings and the manifestation of existence hath been the bestowal of His grace and the expression of His generosity and bounty. Through His will He brought them from nothingness into being, and through His wisdom He ordained the means of glory and exaltation, that all might ascend the ladder of knowledge to that most great station of glory and supreme nobility which is the recognition of His sacred Being. Glorified be His majesty, magnified be His bounty, and exalted be His grace!</p>
<p>The letter of that beloved of the soul, which was even as a brilliant and radiant sun, illumined the court of existence. This pure radiance hath been and is from the effulgences of the lights of divine love. What can this servant mention and what can he express in describing this station, when even those who have attained thereunto are seen to be powerless and wanting in its comprehension? For this is the station of love, the prince of all stations.</p>
<p>“I need a mouth as wide as heaven itself</p>
<p>To tell the praise of that which angels envy.”</p>
<p>After its perusal, and with joy and delight, it was presented before the face of the Lord. He said: “Praise be to God! They are adorned with that which beseemeth them. The atoms of creation bear witness to their trustworthiness, faithfulness, station and rank. O Muhammad - upon thee be the peace of God, the Single, the One! The riches of the world and the wealth of nations cannot compare with a single word of yours which hath been manifested through trustworthiness and faithfulness. The ornaments of the world are not mentioned before the trusted ones of God. That which is worthy of mention are those qualities which have been manifested among the servants from the friends of God. Praise be to God, they are adorned with the finest raiment in all the world. This is the shield of protection that preserveth the station of man. We beseech God that He may illumine the world through this luminary of detachment and adorn it with the ornament of trustworthiness. Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful, and He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Peace be from the Wronged One upon the friends of God who are there, and upon those whom neither the doubts of the people have withheld from the Truth, nor the clamor of the polytheists from turning towards God, the Lord of the worlds.”</p>
<p>In truth, the letter of that beloved was a herald of joy. This servant has always been and continues to be joyful at the happiness of that beloved of hearts. Indeed, a single drop of joy is witnessed as an ocean. Through the grace of God, exalted be His glory, this servant has been and remains confident and assured that whatever appears and transpires is pure good. “Whosoever places his trust in God, He is sufficient unto him.” Witness to this statement was the letter of that true traveler and spiritual emigrant who appeared solely through the Absolute Will - that is, the honored beloved, Aqa Mirza Husayn, upon him be God’s peace, grace and mercy. It arrived, and by the testimony of the loved ones, he has attained the most excellent of deeds, as it has been previously said: “The most excellent of deeds are the most difficult.” His letter was presented to the Master upon arrival, who repeatedly said: “Blessed be he, and may it be wholesome unto him.” At tea time, when the Branches of the Blessed Tree and the people of the pavilion of infallibility were present, He repeatedly mentioned him, and concluded with these blessed words: “We beseech God, the Exalted, to send down upon him and upon them from the heaven of His grace a blessing from Him, a grace from His presence, and a mercy from His side. There is no God but He, the All-Bountiful, the Generous, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.”</p>
<p>This evanescent servant sends greetings to the number of the drops in the seas to him and to the loved ones of that land, and beseeches for each one the outpouring of the True Generous One. Verily, He has power over all things. In response to the letter of the spiritual beloved, Aqa ’Ali, upon him be God’s peace, a letter was sent containing [expressions of] grace. God willing, may it be the cause of joy and unity. And as for the known matter, let them mention whatever they deem advisable. I beseech God, the Exalted, to teach you what is best for you. Verily, He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
<p>Another submission: The missive from the spiritual beloved Haji ’Abdu’l-Karim, upon him be God’s peace, arrived. Indeed, it was distinguished. Praise be to God, he is confirmed. I beseech God, the Exalted, to assist him, confirm him, and draw him near. Verily, He has power over all things. Final submission: As commanded, at this time the true emigrant and special traveler, that is, Aqa Mirza Husayn, upon him be God’s peace and grace, has brought news of the spiritual beloved Haji Husayn, upon him be God’s peace and mercy. The purpose is to express grace towards them. Indeed, they have performed what most of the people of the world are heedless of. They have always been and continue to be remembered. Likewise, as commanded, whenever their letters arrive, the loved ones of that land should write about his conditions. He repeatedly said: “Verily, He loves faithfulness in all things.”</p>

<p>He is the Light in Truth and God was ever living from eternity!</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I call upon Thee in this hour when I have detached myself entirely from all who are in the heavens and on earth, and have clung to the cord of Thy bounty, and have cut off all paths save unto Thee, until I have stood at the axis of journeying unto Thee, and have turned from creation unto Thee, and have turned away from all faces and directed my face toward the sun of Thine eternity. I have sought naught but the wonders of Thy grace, and hoped for naught save the marvelous signs of Thy creative handiwork.</p>
<p>And because of this, Thy servants have assailed me and pelted me with the stones of their idle fancies, and shot at me the arrows of their vain imaginings, to such an extent that the earth, despite its vastness, became too strait for me by reason of what the hands of Thy servants and the transgressors among the people of Thy realm have wrought. It is as though I were caught in the mouth of a black serpent, and red vipers, and yellow snakes, and white dogs. I find no refuge save in Thee, no helper but Thee, no succorer other than Thee, and no protector besides Thee.</p>
<p>I am bewildered now by how these people who differ regarding my station continue to sting me, even though Thou hast ordained for me nothing save servitude before Thy face, prostration before the manifestations of Thy sovereignty, and humble devotion at the gates of Thy bountiful mercy. But O my God, through Thy pure grace, and the essence of Thy generosity, and the substance of Thy love, and the subtlety of Thy affection, Thou hast clothed me in the garment of Thy guidance - a garment which none of Thy creation has ever surpassed or shall ever surpass.</p>
<p>I ask Thee, O my God, by Him Whom Thou hast made sovereign over me and over all who are in the heavens and earth, to make me patient in Thy tribulation and content with Thy decree. Moreover, cause mine eyes to turn away from all else save Thee and to watch for the wonders of Thy mercy, that perchance there may descend upon me that which will tranquilize my heart and gladden my being, that I may rejoice in the shadow of Thy most exalted providence.</p>
<p>I seek refuge in the vicinity of Thy Most Glorious mercy, and I beseech Thee at this moment to forgive those who have been heedless of Thy Most Great Remembrance and have turned to that which their desires have craved. Then forgive them, for they are Thy servants and Thy bondsmen, and they possess for themselves neither profit nor loss, neither life nor resurrection. Cause then, O my God, their hearts to be pure, their vision clear, and their hearing keen, that they may hear Thy verses with their own ears and not through the ears of others, and behold Thy beauty with their own eyes and not through the eyes of those besides them, and soar to the Most Luminous Horizon on the wings of their love, and ascend to the Most Exalted Horizon through the fire of their affection, that they may possess through Thy power what Thou hast created for them within themselves through Thy might. And verily this is a bounty that no bounty in Thy dominion can equal, nor any command in Thy lands. Then I adjure Thee, O my God, by the first fire that was ignited from the fire of Thy Being, and the first ocean that branched from the ocean of Thy Oneness, and the first light that shone from the horizon of Thy Self-Subsistence, and the first lamp that was lit in the niche of Thy love, and by Thy Name which Thou hast established in the station of Thine Own Self, and raised to the heaven of the glory of Thy Lordship, and made concealed in the pavilions of Thy might and hidden in the veils of Thy majesty, that Thou send down upon me and upon Thy servants from the rains of Thy bounty and the showers of Thy generosity, and clothe us in the garment of Thy forgiveness and the robe of Thy holiness, and make us of those who have been guided by Thy guidance, and have sought Thy good-pleasure, and have dwelt in Thy habitations, and have reposed in Thy presence - for in Thy hand is the sovereignty of power and might, and in Thy right hand is the kingdom of strength and authority, and Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and art well aware and informed of all that Thy servants do.</p>

<p>This is what hath been sent down from the direction of the mighty throne unto Our servant who hath been named the Merciful, and verily this is better for him than the sovereignty of earth and heaven. Thus hath it been ordained by One Who is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Exalted</p>
<p>Thy letter hath come before the Throne, and the fingers of mercy and power have taken hold of it, and the gaze of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate, hath turned toward it. We found therein the fragrance of sanctity in thy recognition of the Self of God, the Sovereign, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the breezes of the All-Merciful and for thy soul having been established upon the throne of paradise. This is from God’s bounty unto thee, but most of the people are heedless. Therefore give thanks unto God for having taken thy hand with the hand of power and might, and delivered thee from the hosts of fancy, and established thee beneath the shadow of His grace and favor, and made thee one of the companions of certitude, and enabled thee to stand firm in His love in days wherein intoxication hath overtaken all who are in the heavens and on earth. Rejoice then within thyself that thy letter hath been read before the presence of grace in sanctified and wondrous precincts. Glory be unto thee and unto him from whose pen flowed that wherewith thou didst call upon God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Thus doth God bestow His favor upon whomsoever He willeth of His servants and guideth him to the path of His glory and draweth him nigh unto His transcendent grace, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>But thou, O servant, hold fast unto the Tree, then taste of its fruits, then detach thyself from those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God and were among the deniers. Then stand firm in the Cause of thy Lord in such wise that shouldst thine own eye oppose thee therein thou wouldst be detached therefrom, nay, thou wouldst pluck it out from its socket. This is what the Beauty of the Cause commandeth thee from the direction of a mighty throne. By God! Whoso drinketh from this Salsabil shall be detached from every proof from all who are possessed of majesty, and from all who are in the heavens and the earth. His glance shall never return unto them and he shall behold them as children who possess neither reason nor discernment.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Do ye imagine that ye have believed in God after having denied and turned away from the Beauty Who hath shone forth from the horizon of the Unseen, before Whose dawning the faces of grandeur fell prostrate in worship of His exalted, transcendent, sovereign and omnipotent Self? Shut thine eye to all who are in the kingdom, then open it to behold the signs of thy Lord, that thou mayest witness His sovereignty in all things. Thus doth the Pen of sacred knowledge inform thee.</p>
<p>As for those who have fled from the Beauty of the All-Merciful, God hath rendered their deeds void and cast them into the abyss of His wrath as recompense for their actions and they were among the doers thereof. Take heed lest the denial of the deniers grieve thee, for We have found them today isolated in their unbelief, and therefore have We forbidden them from the holy shores with justice from Our presence, and verily We are just. Say: O people! Be fair unto yourselves - if ye turn away from this Beauty, to what refuge can ye flee this Day? Nay, by My Beauty, there is no refuge for you, no shelter for anyone, and no protector this Day save Mine own Self, the Sovereign, the Most High, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Fear ye God and flee not to the right or to the left. Enter ye this straight, manifest and upright Path. Say: Do ye prostrate yourselves before dust while leaving the Lord of Lords behind you? Evil is that which ye have chosen for yourselves. Alas for you, O company of deniers! Say: Should God desire to send upon you the breezes of His mercy, could anyone prevent them? Nay, by My radiant and mighty Beauty! And should He desire to chastise you with a flame of fire, could any soul deliver you therefrom? Nay, by My manifest, resplendent, all-encompassing sovereignty! Say: O people! I swear by God the Truth, the Lord of Words hath then come upon clouds of meanings, and around Him are Manifestations of God’s wisdom, then Dawning-places of a wondrous knowledge, and the matter hath been decreed from God, your Lord and the Lord of all creation. Thus do We bestow Our favor upon thee once again, O Rahim, that thou mayest be thankful for thy Lord’s gifts and be among those who remember the Beauty Whom God hath purified from mention by those who disbelieved and joined partners with God and were among the veiled ones. Leave the polytheists and what issueth from their mouths, for thy Lord hath exposed their falsity between the heavens and the earth, whereunto every discerning and insightful one doth testify. And when it is said unto them, “O people, by what proof have ye believed in God and the Manifestations of His Cause?” they will surely say, “The verses.” Yet when the most excellent Words are recited unto them from what hath been sent down from the heaven of God’s dominion, the Protector, the Almighty, the Powerful, their faces darken and they return to their seats and retreat to their abode in the nethermost fire, and thus do the guards of wrath encompass them, and verily We are the Subduer. Say: O people, by God the Truth, ye pass by nothing except that it denounceth you for your deeds in most eloquent and wondrous language, but since ye have veiled yourselves with veils of wrath, ye will never hear its call. Thus hath the matter flowed from the finger of ancient glory. And thou, leave them behind thee, then seek thy Lord’s bounty in all days, for His bounty hath ever been nigh unto the doers of good. And glory be upon thee, O people of glory, that thou mayest remain steadfast in thy Lord’s Cause through love of thy Master, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>Thy sealed letter hath reached the presence of this Wronged One, and from it We have inhaled the sweet savour of thy devotion to God, the Omnipotent Protector, the Self-Subsistent. We beseech Him to make known unto thee that which is concealed within the Written Tablet, and to grant that thou mayest catch the accents of the Mystic Dove that singeth upon the celestial bough, and hear the soft murmur of the water that is life indeed as it floweth in a stream of utterance and wisdom from the fountainhead of the Will of Him Who is the Lord of all mankind.</p>
<p>O friend! It behoveth thee to reflect upon the Word of God, to ponder its greatness, and to meditate upon its sweetness. This Word, verily, is sufficient unto the peoples of the earth. The first one to believe in Him Who was the Spirit was so enraptured by the Word of God that, in his eagerness to embrace its truth, he detached himself from everything that men possess. Such is the condition of all who would be leviathans in the Most Mighty Ocean.</p>
<p>O thou learned doctor and percipient divine! Know that the people have, for the most part, been hindered by their passions from turning themselves to God, the Lord of all names. Whoso looketh with his inner eye, however, shall be granted vision, and shall testify to what he witnesseth, exclaiming: “All praise be unto my Lord, the Most Exalted!” The tidings of God’s loving-kindness have been announced to land and sea, and unto the nations hath been given the promise of the advent of Him Who shall heal their sicknesses, even Him Who shall build up the Temple of the Lord. Well is it with them who understand!</p>
<p>Lo, the appointed time is now arrived, and Carmel crieth out as if moved to ecstasy by the soul-stirring breezes of her Lord. Happy are those who hear her cry! Whoso hearkeneth with his inner ear shall hear the voice of the Rock as he beareth witness, with a mighty voice, to the Everlasting God. Blessed are they who perceive the savour of Divine utterance and, severing themselves from the world of being, advance towards the Kingdom. Behold! The things that had been mentioned in the Books of old have now appeared, and yet the people, though they look upon them, comprehend them not!</p>
<p>Regard thou, O friend, the mystery of the Great Reversal in the Sign of the Sovereign. Through this reversal He hath caused the exalted to be abased and the abased to be exalted. Call thou to mind how, in the days of Jesus, it was those who were distinguished for their learning, the men of letters and religion, who denied Him, whilst humble fishermen made haste to gain admittance into the Kingdom–this is the meaning of that which hath been expressed by symbol and allusion in the obscurities of words.</p>
<p>Great, immeasurably great is the Cause! Peter, the Apostle, despite the pre-eminence of his rank and the loftiness of his station, when questioned held back from speaking. Wert thou, with thy thoughts centred wholly on God, to reflect upon the happenings of former times, thou wouldst see the light shining refulgently before thy face, and wouldst keep it constantly before thy gaze. The truth is, of a certainty, too evident to be enshrouded in a veil, the way too clear to be obscured by darkness, and certitude too manifest to be eclipsed by any fleeting whim. Those who have been debarred therefrom are the followers of their corrupt desires. Today they are reposing on their bed of slumber; erelong they shall awake and rush, without avail, to find the things that have escaped them. Well is it with them who have inhaled the Divine fragrance at the time when it was shed abroad: These, verily, have attained unto that which is the portion of the sincere among God’s servants.</p>
<p>Know thou that We have seen the letter “?ad”, which appeareth in the word “?ul?”, become embellished by the ornament of the upright Alif. This, verily, is that which hath been recorded in an outspread Tablet. No sooner were the splendours of that Divine Word revealed than the portals of heaven were unlocked, the Kingdom of Names made manifest, and all was brought to consummation by the appearance of the letter “Ha”, which had been connected to the recumbent Alif, itself embellished by the Point from which had sprung the Treasured Name, the Hidden Secret, and the Guarded Symbol–that same Point from which all things have appeared and unto which they have all returned. Thereupon We saw the Word give utterance to a Word which was received by every people in accordance with its own particular tongue and language. As it spoke forth, there rose above the horizon of its utterance a Sun of such effulgent splendour that, overshadowed by its radiance, the celestial sun grew dark; then it cried out: “The brow of seventy hath been adorned with the diadem of forty and united with the seven before ten”; at this it sighed, and moaned aloud: “Alas, I see the house oblivious of its Master, the son unmindful of his Father, the seeker heedless of the sanctuary and refuge for which he yearneth.”</p>
<p>O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of understanding! Whoso perceiveth that which though solid, floweth; which though static, flieth; which is both manifest and hidden, both resplendent and obscure will be so enraptured by the effulgence of heavenly illumination that he will rise up on the wings of ardent longing into the empyrean of nearness, holiness, and heavenly reunion.</p>
<p>Respecting thy comments on the question of “darkness”, We testify that it hath encompassed all mankind. Happy the man who hath been illumined by the light of Him Who hath shone forth resplendent from the horizon of the mercy of His Lord, the Most Holy. This darkness is naught but the idle imaginings of men, by which they have been prevented from directing themselves towards the Kingdom when, by the bidding of God, the Lord of the realm on high, it was made manifest.</p>
<p>As for thy mention of the opinion expressed to thee by a certain individual that, in so far as concerneth the Spirit, there existeth no difference between us, his assertion is correct, for the Spirit is too exalted either to admit of differences or to be comprehended by allusions. It is the revelation of the Light of God’s singleness amongst men, the Sign of His ancient eternity before the nations. Whoso turneth himself thereto hath turned himself unto Him Who sent it forth, and whoso turneth away therefrom hath turned away from the One by Whose power it hath been manifested and endowed with utterance. It hath not changed from age to age, and such as it hath been it shall remain. Such differences as may be witnessed in the effulgence of its light are to be attributed to the mirrors that receive it, and to the disparity, in form and colour, of the images they reflect.</p>
<p>O friend! Were but a single token to be revealed of the Secret which hath lain wrapped in mystery, the hearts of all those who, clinging to the things of men, have cast away the things of God, would be thrown into perturbation. Shouldst thou, having meditated upon the words that We have addressed to thee, arise with perfect steadfastness to act in such wise as We have intimated, thou wouldst undoubtedly accomplish such things as have been witnessed in a former age.</p>
<p>O friend! This Bird lieth imprisoned beneath the talons of cruelty and malice; It seeth for itself neither nest wherein to shelter nor heavenly expanse in which to fly. In such a plight as this, it summoneth mankind unto everlasting life. Blessed then be the attentive ear!</p>
<p>We beseech God to unite us in one holy court, and to graciously assist us to do that which is pleasing and acceptable unto Him.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Mighty, the Most Luminous, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>This is a Book that speaketh with truth and summoneth the people unto the Beloved of them that have known God. Were that which is treasured within it to be revealed unto men, all that dwell in the heavens and on earth would swoon away, save such as God hath preserved, His faithful servants. Say: The Beloved hath appeared, arrayed in mighty grief, yet the people are in manifest heedlessness. Say: He hath been imprisoned in this Prison through that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought, after He had promised every soul His presence. All worship Him at morn and eventide, yet recognize Him not. These heedless ones weep for what befell Him in a former Revelation, yet shed His blood in this present one. Thus do they act, being utterly unaware. They call upon Him by night and by day, yet object to Him at every moment.</p>
<p>Is there any possessed of vision who will behold and recognize the Beloved of God, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great? Is there any possessed of hearing who will hearken unto His melodies, sweeter than those of his Most Glorious Beloved, Who was a stranger in the lands of the heedless? Say: This is He Who sent forth the Messengers from His presence and brought forth from His realm the company of the Prophets. Fear ye God, O people! Object not to Him after He hath come unto you with the signs of God, your Lord, and with the clear tokens of God, your Beloved and the Beloved of all worlds.</p>
<p>How long will ye slumber upon the couch of heedlessness, and how long will ye wander distraught in the wilderness of ignorance? We sent unto you aforetime ’Ali with a perspicuous Book, Who gave you the glad-tidings of this Most Great, Most Mighty Revelation and took from you a covenant concerning Mine own Self. Look ye, therefore, into the Bayan, that ye may be numbered among them that truly know. And ’Ali wept in His days until He sacrificed His life in My path - to this all things bear witness, if ye be not of them that deny.</p>
<p>Say: O people, fear ye God, then have mercy upon My Soul. Sufficient unto Me is what hath befallen Me at the hands of all created things. Say: O people of the Bayan, have mercy upon yourselves and be not of the wrongdoers. Verily your Beloved commanded you in this Revelation not to demand of Him proof or evidence, and when He appeared with the truth, to turn unto Him and not to be of them that tarry. He emphasized throughout the Bayan that should He appear without proof or evidence, ye should not object to Him, but rather supplicate Him with humility, that perchance He might reveal unto you from the ocean of His bounty that which would tranquilize your souls and the souls of the heedless ones.</p>
<p>He hath appeared in truth with all the signs ere ye asked aught of Him - and God is All-Knowing, All-Informed of this. He hath come unto you from the Dayspring of the Cause with the clear tokens of God, the King, the Just, the Manifest One. He hath stood between heaven and earth with mighty sovereignty, and there hath appeared from Him the proof of ’Ali, then the evidence of Muhammad, then the testimony of the Spirit, then that which was brought by Him Who conversed with God. Beyond all this, He hath appeared with such sovereignty as no eye in all creation hath witnessed the like thereof, nor the eyes of the angels near unto God.</p>
<p>Yet ye have done unto Him that which none hath ever done unto another, and have perpetrated that which hath caused the Sovereign of the heavens and earth to lament. One day ye denied Him, another ye sought to slay Him, and yet another ye disbelieved in Him. The curse of God be upon you, O company of oppressors! Say: Ye are they who cast the Covenant of God behind your backs and were heedless of that which ye were bidden in all the Tablets, and forgot that wherewith ye were counseled in holy and noble Scrolls. Be fair in your judgment, though it be for less than a moment, if ye deny, by what proof do you establish your faith, O company of the heedless ones? By God, astonished at you are the denizens of the highest paradise, then the dwellers of the eternal realms, then the glorifying angels. Thus does the Dove warble upon the branches of the Tree of Utterance with verses of sorrow, and from its trilling weep the Pen, then the Tablet, then the eyes of the Prophets. And I say: I am content, O my Beloved, with what hath befallen me at the hands of these idolaters in Thy path, and I am content with what Thou hast ordained for me, for whatsoever Thou hast ordained for me is beloved of Baha. And I say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Thus have We sent down unto thee that which will cause thee to soar in the atmosphere which God hath sanctified from the odors of the idolaters. Empty thyself of all save God, then turn with thy heart unto God, the Most High, the Most Great, that there might be impressed upon it the sign of the beauty of the mention of thy Lord’s name, and that thou mayest be of them that attain. Proclaim the greatness of God unto thy son and unto them that have believed in God, the One, the Powerful, the Almighty, and give them the glad-tidings of this Most Wondrous, Most Great, Most Mighty Remembrance. Then preserve them through God’s might and power from the wolves of the earth, and purify them from the intimations of the idolaters. Then spread abroad what God hath sent down unto you throughout the land, that all may be quickened by the words of God and His signs, and may become aware of what hath been mentioned in the Tablets from the presence of One knowing, wise. Then make mention, from Us, of him who (Baba) hath visited the Ancient House, that he may be of them that are firm. Say: The Qiblih of all houses hath appeared, if thou be of them that know. Turn thy heart in the direction of the Most Great House, that the breezes of the All-Merciful may waft over thee and draw thee nigh unto the Purpose of the worlds. And the glory be upon thee and upon him and upon such of His handmaidens as believe and are pure, and such of His servants as remember Him. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Expositor from His Most Exalted Horizon</p>
<p>This is what hath been sent down for Javad, upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of Creation. O Javad! Upon thee be My Glory! The honored Amin hath made mention of thee. We beseech God that He may aid thee in all conditions, and cause to grow from the fruits of certitude wondrous trees in the blessed and goodly soil, and from those trees bring forth other fruits and leaves. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Mighty. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the All-Glorious.</p>
<p>The purpose of this blessed verse, in its primary rank and first station, is that the perpetuation of mention, name and glory hath ever been through the verses of God and the mention of the Supreme Pen. The believer in God who hath drunk from the Kawthar of certitude from the munificent hand of the Desired One of the worlds - the fruit thereof hath not been and will never be cut off from the world. From that blessed fruit there grow wondrous trees and new saplings from the goodly soil. The goodly soil signifieth pure and sanctified hearts and minds. These trees planted by the Kawthar of certitude grow and are nurtured until they reach the station wherein “its root is firm and its branches reach into heaven, nay beyond the heaven.” And from these trees other wondrous and exalted trees appear. This is the great glad-tidings for the aforementioned one. This verse is the dawning-place of all good, and likewise the greatest key for the gates of grace and bounty.</p>
<p>Were they to become aware of what hath been sent down from the heaven of mercy, and drink from the hidden Kawthar concealed within the divine words, they would occupy themselves with thanksgiving and praise to the Desired One of the world. For that which hath been revealed is everlasting and eternal, and shall forever remain preserved and immortalized in the Book under thy name. Blessed is he who hath attained unto mention by the Supreme Pen. It shall not be effaced nor altered. This station belongeth not to aught else, for the evanescence of all things and the permanence of the Face hath been recorded in the scriptures, books, psalms and tablets.</p>
<p>The Face, in one station, signifieth His Essence, exalted and sanctified be He; in another station, that which floweth from His Supreme Pen; and in yet another station, that which was known among the servants. Were anyone to taste the sweetness of what hath been revealed in this Tablet, he would soar on the wings of joy and gladness in this holy and blessed atmosphere, and would exclaim with his outer and inner tongue: “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and thanks be unto Thee, O my Beloved, for having sent down unto me that which shall endure as long as Thine own Self endureth. I testify that it is better for me than all that is on earth. My Lord! Thy servant testifieth in this my station that knowledge is in Thy grasp. How can my conjecture of Thy Self, my ignorance of Thy knowledge, my fancy and weakness before Thy power, and my fear before Thy tranquility stand? I testify that Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>For the Face there have been and are countless meanings. What hath been mentioned now sufficeth. O Javad! Nothing can compare with what hath been revealed aforetime and in this present time - no fruit, no effect, no traces, and no deeds. Children are like unto the leaves of trees - at times appearing, at times falling. But these children that have appeared from the Mother Book are everlasting and eternal. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this manifest grace and this mighty utterance. Despair not of God’s spirit and mercy under any circumstances. Say: My God, my God! I have turned toward Thee and clung to Thee. My hope art Thou, my desire art Thou, my aspiration art Thou. My will is Thy will, and my wish is Thy wish. I beseech Thee by the movement of Thy Pen, whereby Thou hast stirred all created things, and by the light of Thy countenance, whereby Thou hast illumined the horizons, to make me steadfast and firm in Thy Cause in such wise that nothing whatsoever shall prevent me. Then enable me to make Thy pleasure my pleasure and Thy will my will, such that I choose naught save what Thou hast chosen for me. I testify that Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Munificent, the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>The Seal of the Prophets - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - had five children, all of whom, during His lifetime, according to the requirements of consummate wisdom, ascended to heaven. The polytheists began to gloat, supposing that His memory and traces would vanish after His passing and not endure. At that time Gabriel descended and recited this verse from God - blessed and exalted be He: “Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of this world, but the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lord’s sight for reward, and better in respect of hope.” Through the divine revelation’s fragrance, the faithful were made joyous and the deniers sorrowful. Thus did the monotheists soar to the heaven of joy while the polytheists returned to their abode in the fire. Verily we are God’s, and verily unto Him do we return. It hath been witnessed that His traces have remained and endured on earth, and praise be to God, they shine forth among the servants in every station like unto the resplendent sun. We beseech God to aid His loved ones with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, and to give them to drink of the Kawthar of life from the hand of His bounty. Verily He is the Most Generous of the generous ones, and the Most Merciful of the merciful ones. There is no God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O My Name! The letter thou didst send hath reached Him Who hath testified to that which God hath testified concerning His Own Self unto the ultimate horizon, thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have taken note of its contents. We beseech God to make it a source of guidance unto all mankind and a sign of His good-pleasure amongst all the worlds.</p>
<p>As to what was mentioned concerning the Afnan and their turning, one and all, unto God - this was what God ordained when We were in Iraq. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. He manifesteth what He willeth and giveth to drink, unto whom He pleaseth, the wine of understanding. He is, in truth, the Protector of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>He hath mentioned in his letter the name of Bahram, desiring for him God’s grace. We, therefore, make mention of him at this moment, that the sweet savors of remembrance may waft from this luminous quarter upon him. All those whom the Tongue of Grandeur remembereth are remembered by the denizens of the Supreme Paradise and then by those who dwell in the Most Exalted Horizon. Thy Lord is, verily, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Should God so will and desire, We shall send unto him a Tablet wherefrom he will inhale the fragrance of the Best-Beloved. We beseech God to make him steadfast under all conditions and to strengthen him from His presence that he may mention Him amongst His servants. This, verily, is a great bounty.</p>
<p>As to what was mentioned concerning Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali and his turning towards God’s direction - the sun of permission for his return hath not yet risen. It behooveth him to remain among the people and to guide them through deeds, character, and remembrance, calling them unto God, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Bountiful. He is among those who have attained Our presence time after time. Say: Be thou grateful for having attained unto the presence of thy Lord, and be thou among the patient ones.</p>
<p>And concerning the tribulations that have befallen the loved ones - there hath befallen them in that place what befell Us in the prison. Say: Be not grieved thereby. God shall soon exalt them through the truth and abase the arrogant ones and the wrong-doers. He shall establish the truth through His sovereignty and seize those who have disbelieved and then committed injustice. He is, verily, the Subduer, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O My Name! The book of Mir was received and beheld before the Throne. The glance of divine favor hath ever been and will continue to be directed towards him. The answers to some questions, as ordained by God, were sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will and dispatched. Write unto him and convey Our greetings from this near yet far station. As for his request for forgiveness for one who has passed away, We have forgiven him. Indeed We have accepted his intercession, and We have increased the punishment of him who denied God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O My Name Mehdi! The dispatching of souls to various regions is not favored, for an unwholesome odor is perceived therefrom. Perchance people might imagine that which is unworthy of thy Lord’s holy court, sanctified above all worlds. In the early years, it was necessary to exalt the Word of God and manifest the Cause among His servants, even as the diffusion of the fragrances of the sublime Tablets and the sweet perfumes of the divine utterances were spread outwardly through messengers and inwardly through the angels brought nigh. Beyond what hearts and minds can comprehend was bestowed upon all who dwell on earth from the Source of the Cause and the Dayspring of grace. However, at present, the coming and going of designated souls is not viewed favorably, as it might cause perturbation in the hearts of the weak and the destruction of certain servants. Thus, from one perspective it is favored, and from another, it is not. The administrators of God’s Cause should ponder upon this matter and implement whatever is beneficial for His servants. The glory be upon thee and upon My loved ones who have attained unto the Cause of God, the Unalterable, the Mighty, the Great. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Amin! Upon thee be the peace of God and His loving-kindness. Thy letter was received. Praise be to God, it bore tidings of the health and well-being of the honored Afnan, upon him be the peace of the All-Merciful, and thyself and the other loved ones. God willing, proceed with utmost joy and fragrance in such wise that through the sweet-scented breezes of fellowship the people may be assisted to achieve unity, fellowship and concord. The favored community hath been afflicted. Now it is incumbent, nay obligatory, upon all to entreat the True One, exalted be His glory, that He may protect the monotheists and their cities and lands from the evil of the polytheists. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>His first mercy in the world of contingent being was the casting forth of the blessed Word of Divine Unity. Praise be to God, then thanks be to Him, then glory be to Him and bounty, for He hath favored us with the Word of Unity, and hath made us know the sanctity of His Being, and hath taught us the transcendence of His Essence above all likenesses and comparisons. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>This Wronged One hath, throughout the nights and days, commanded the servants of God unto whatsoever good and righteous deeds He hath revealed in the Book. However, in barren soil the seeds of counsel yielded no fruit and produced no growth. In place of trustworthiness appeared treachery, and in place of contentment, rebellion. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist those who have turned away to turn towards Him, and those who have calumniated to speak the truth. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>The letter thou didst send to this servant was perused. We beseech the True One to grant success and confirmation, and to illumine those in authority with the light of justice and fairness. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>The petition and letter of the messenger, upon him be peace, was considered. In some matters truth was with him when he spoke, yet we must beseech the True One to protect him that he may hold fast to that which beseemeth him.</p>
<p>O Trustee! This is the Day wherein whatsoever hath been hidden and concealed in existence becometh manifest and evident. God, exalted be His glory, speaking of the Day of Resurrection, hath said: “The Day when all secrets shall be tried.” Now this hath been partially revealed that all may acknowledge with clear certainty that which He hath proclaimed and promised.</p>
<p>God willing, his honor ’Ali-Haydar, upon him be the peace and bounty of God, will act with kindness toward him, that is, assist him to the extent possible. Regarding what thou didst write about Haji ’Ali-Akbar, permission is granted that he proceed with A. and H. And likewise regarding Shamakh and Banab, that which they have requested shall be sent from here. And thou didst mention Zayn - We beseech God to make him steadfast. God willing, the evil deeds of the treacherous ones and calumniators have been and will be the cause of steadfastness and trustworthiness among the friends in all regions, that is, it increaseth their praiseworthy qualities. What they have asked for shall therefore be granted.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention Ahmad-i-Farsh. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect him and ordain for him the good of this world and the next, and to forgive his father. He is the One to Whose generosity all created things have testified, and to Whose mercy all contingent beings bear witness. There is none other God but Him, the Forgiving, the Possessor of Great Grace.</p>
<p>Divine mercy hath preceded all and His bounty hath encompassed all. He is the Hearer and the Answerer. The hands of the detached ones are raised toward the heaven of His mercy. His generosity and grace are the cause and reason for the appearance of hope. I swear by the Sun of Truth which hath shone forth from the horizon of Muhammad’s brow - peace be upon Him - that He hath never disappointed any supplicant, nor will He ever do so, and He hath never prevented any seeker from the ocean of His gifts. If there appeareth to be delay in the fulfillment of some hopes, this is due to His consummate wisdom, which none knoweth save Him. Were this station to be unveiled, all would testify to that which hath been mentioned and hath flowed from the pen.</p>
<p>Say: O my God, my God! Thou seest Thy chosen ones and trustees in the hands of the calumniators and the treacherous ones who are consumed by the fire of greed, passion, tyranny and wickedness, who devour people’s wealth without any proof from Thee or evidence from Thy presence, and who desire naught but harm to Thy trusted servants. I beseech Thee, O Lord, by the Most Great Word through which the Sun of Divine Unity hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy Cause, and by which the hearts of Thy servants and creation have been illumined, to aid the heedless ones and calumniators to be trustworthy, religious, truthful and pure. O Lord! Help them to return to the court of Thy glory and the gate of Thy generosity. Verily, Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Pardoner, the All-Bountiful, the Kind, the All-Generous, the Compassionate. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the friends of that land. We counsel all to that which will elevate their stations and manifest their ranks, especially his honor the Shaykh, upon him be the peace and bounty of God, and his nephew. What thou hast mentioned in the letter of the Name of Bounty (Ism-i-Jud) hath been noted, and We ask confirmation and success for them in all conditions. Peace be upon thee and upon them and upon God’s righteous servants.</p>

<p>O people of Paran! By God and His Cause, the Wronged One hath turned toward you time and again, repeatedly, from the precincts of the Prison, and hath made mention of you through verses whereof God hath made each letter a fountain of Kawthar and Salsabil, and a source of the water of life for the quickening of all worlds. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Compassionate, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Blessed be your tongues for having acknowledged the Revelation of God and His sovereignty, and your hearts for having turned unto Him on a day wherein the fire of estrangement was kindled in all regions, and every oppressor arose to extinguish His light and quench His flame. Thus did their souls prompt them–they are assuredly among the transgressors in God’s Book, the Lord of all worlds. There have come before Our presence servants who have believed in God and His signs, and who have taken for themselves a station nigh unto the mercy of their Lord, the All-Compassionate, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>Beware lest ye be saddened by the fire of hatred which hath been kindled in the hearts of the divines who have violated God’s Covenant and pronounced judgment against Him through Whom the Path was made manifest and the Balance spoke, saying: “I am the All-Distinguishing, the All-Knowing.” Hearken unto My call and the scratching of My Pen, then observe that which hath appeared through the will of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Say: O people of Paran! The call of your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath been raised. Hearken, and be not of them that are veiled. Beware lest the doubts of the cawing ones prevent you from God, the True King, the Manifest. Cast away what the people possess and take what ye have been given from the presence of One mighty and great.</p>
<p>We have desired at this time to make mention of the Friend who hath ascended unto God, the Almighty, the All-Praised. Before his ascension We revealed for him that which brought solace to the eyes of them that are nigh unto God, and after his ascension We mentioned him from My Most Exalted Pen in such wise that the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Sublime Paradise welcomed it, as bidden by the Ancient Commander. O Friend! We have desired to make mention of thee at this time once again, as a mercy from Us–verily thy Lord is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones. The glory shining from the Most Sublime Horizon and the light radiating from this Most Glorious Station be upon thee, O thou who didst hear the Call when it was raised between earth and heaven, and who didst believe in God, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Blessed art thou, and blessed is he who loved thee and made mention of thy days, thy turning and thy devotion. We testify that he is among the sincere ones in the Book of God, the Lord of the Glorious Throne. Thus did the Pen speak when the Lord of Eternity was in this noble station.</p>
<p>O friends of God in Paran! Give thanks unto your Lord for having aided you to remember and praise Him, and for having drawn you nigh unto Him when the people were in manifest remoteness. Say: O concourse of men! Hearken unto that which the Lord of Destiny hath uttered from His Most Great Prospect, and be not of the heedless. By God! Ye were not created for yourselves, but rather to serve this Cause whereby the hearts of the idolaters have been sorely troubled. The banner of unity hath been raised before your faces, and the call hath been lifted up from the Most Sublime Horizon: “The kingdom is God’s, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, and the Master of this wondrous Day.” Your eyes were created to behold My signs, your ears to hear My call, and your hands to grasp My Book, if ye be of them that understand. Be ye of such constancy that the cawing of those who have turned away from God, the Lord of all worlds, shall not prevent you. Take ye, with the hands of power and might, the Book of God, the Master of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of My loved ones who have ascended unto God in that land, that they may inhale the sweet fragrance of their Lord, the Mighty, the Peerless. The first fragrance that wafted from the breezes of Revelation and the first light that shone forth from the horizon of the Throne be upon you, O loved ones of God and His chosen ones. We testify that ye believed in God when most of mankind denied Him, and hearkened unto the Call when it was raised in truth, and attained unto that which was recorded in the Books of the Messengers. Through you the Sun of Certitude shone forth from the horizon of possibility, and the ocean of utterance surged before the faces of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Ye are they whom the affairs of the world did not deter, whose resolve its might could not weaken, and whom the doubts of the suspicious could not veil. We testify that ye turned unto the Call when it was raised between earth and heaven, and remained faithful to God’s Covenant and His Testament when every wayward transgressor broke it. Through you the river of mercy flowed amidst all created things, and the Dove of Unity warbled upon the branches: “There is none other God but Me, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the Beautiful.” Blessed are ye, and blessed is he who maketh mention of you in accordance with what hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of your Lord at this time. Thus have We lit the lamp of utterance and illumined the hearts of My loved ones who have cast away all else but Me, clinging to the hem of My luminous robe. O Pen! Make mention of My handmaidens in that land and give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy which have preceded existence itself, from the first to the last. O My handmaidens and My leaves! Take ye the cup of immortality in the name of your Lord, the Most Glorious, then drink therefrom through My sweetest remembrance, in defiance of the divines of the earth and its jurists who have cast behind their backs My Book and taken the book of their own fancy in this Day wherein all things proclaim: “The veil hath been rent asunder and the Lord of Creation hath come with manifest sovereignty.” The glory from Us be upon them and upon you and upon every people that hath acted in accordance with what hath been commanded from the Tongue of God, which speaketh in this exalted station.</p>

<p>O thou who art mentioned before the Throne! Today the Blessed Tree of Divine Utterance in the midmost heart of contingent being speaketh forth with this most exalted Word: “O peoples of the earth! Turn with illumined hearts unto the Most Sublime Horizon. By God, the Truth! The Day hath come, yet the people are in evident obscurity.” O thou who gazest! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, Who from the horizon of the Prison turneth toward thee and maketh mention of thee, that perchance through the assistance of the Goal of all existence thou mayest preserve the people of that land from vain imaginings and guide them to the horizon of certitude.</p>
<p>Say: O company of the heedless! Purify your hearing and sight from what ye have heard, become illumined by the lights of the Luminary of proof which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the Most Exalted Pen, and understand that for which ye were brought from nothingness into being. Throughout ages and centuries the previous people reckoned themselves the most learned of mankind and the most excellent of nations, yet on the Day of His Manifestation they were found to be the most abject of all. From the beginning of time until now, not a single one of the divines of Persia hath attained unto the Purpose, being tormented in the wilderness of idle fancies. Yet the heedless ones have afflicted the helpless servants with vain imaginings, and these imaginings appeared on the Day of Resurrection in the form of a sword, descending upon the Truth and His companions.</p>
<p>Now the people of the Bayan are engaged in forming a party like unto the previous one. All the divines, throughout nights and days, would beseech God, glorified be His majesty, for the appearance of the Promised One, and would utter from their pulpits “May God hasten His relief.” Yet when the horizon of the world was illumined with the lights of the manifestation of Him Who conversed on Sinai, all were inflamed with the fire of hatred and perpetrated that which caused the denizens of the all-highest Paradise and the most exalted Heaven to lament and wail. Until now they have not lifted their heads from the couch of heedlessness.</p>
<p>It is incumbent upon that soul and those who are illumined with the light of recognition and enkindled with the fire of the Tree to arise for the sake of God and preserve souls from doubts and idle fancies. The heaven beareth witness, and the sun and moon testify, that from the first days until now this Wronged One hath stood before the faces of the world and called out with the most exalted call, in such wise that neither the opposition of rulers nor the tyranny of divines could deter Him from the Will of God. And when the fragrance of the musk-scented Shirt was diffused and the world was illumined with the dawning light of the Most Great Luminary, certain souls emerged from behind the veil and assailed the Wronged One, whereupon befell that which pen and ink are powerless to describe.</p>
<p>We beseech God to confirm and assist that soul in serving His Cause and guiding His servants. Hear thou the Call from the Divine Lote-Tree, raised upon the radiant earth on the shores of ’Amman through the providence of thy Lord, the Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Single, the All-Informed. We have mentioned thee before in a Tablet that shone from the horizon of God’s loving providence, the Lord of all worlds. By the life of God! The mention of Me surpasseth all the mentions of the world and whatsoever is with the nations. To this beareth witness the Supreme Pen of God from Its exalted station. Say: O concourse of divines! Be fair, by God! By what proof can ye establish that which ye possess, and by what evidence do ye object to Him Who, when He came from the horizon of power with the standards of His signs, before Him bowed the Books of the earth? Be fair, and be not of the oppressors. This is He Who hath not preserved Himself for less than a moment, and spoke before all faces that which He spoke in the earliest days. To this testifieth He with Whom is the Mother Book. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear ye the All-Merciful, and oppose not Him through Whom the Cause of God and His sovereignty were made manifest, and through Whom the Dove of Knowledge warbled upon the highest branches. Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. We have not entered any school. I was seated when the hand of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, raised Me up, and I was silent when He caused Me to speak that which draweth you nigh unto Him. Be grateful unto your Lord for this supreme bounty. O people! Cast aside idle fancies and vain imaginings, then turn ye unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Beware lest the affairs of the world withhold you from the Ancient of Days, or the greatest veils prevent you from this Momentous Announcement, concerning which God took covenant with His Prophets and His chosen ones. Have mercy upon yourselves and upon the souls of men, and be not of the transgressors. Say: O people of the Bayan! Leave Me to Myself. Sufficient unto Me are the peoples of the earth and their evil ones. By God! I desire naught but your reformation, your life, your salvation, and that which draweth you nigh unto God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say: Know ye Who calleth you, and recognize ye Who mentioneth you? By God! The Mother Book mentioneth you, yet ye are among the heedless. Thus hath the Sun of Meanings shed Its effulgence and the Supreme Pen revealed Its traces. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath witnessed that which God hath witnessed. Woe unto every remote denier. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those whom neither the doubts of the divines nor the signs of the learned have prevented, who heard the Call and responded, saying: “Here am I, here am I, O Thou Desire of the world! Here am I, here am I, O Thou Adored One of them that have recognized Thee!”</p>

Praise be to God that thou hast been assisted to mention the name of God, exalted be His glory. We beseech Him to aid thee under all conditions. Today all must seek from God, exalted be His glory, the victory of His manifest Faith. O Muhammad! The Cause of God hath been weakened due to unseemly deeds, to such an extent that the enemies of the Faith are striving with the utmost power and might to destroy it. The government and the people must all beseech God, exalted be His station, for deliverance. Such sorrows have been visited upon Us that the Pen is powerless and incapable of recounting them. As to thy mention of Haji Mulla Ali, who hath ascended to the Supreme Companion, and thy guardianship of his affairs - excellent is that which thy tongue hath uttered, but the people are heedless, veiled and withheld. For thirty years and more We have dwelt in the domains of the sublime state, and have ever counselled Our friends to love and obey. Nevertheless, there hath been visited upon Us that which hath not been visited upon any other wronged one. The tongue of the heart uttereth at all times these words: “Lord! Pour forth upon us patience and make firm our steps. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.” Such adversities have been visited upon these wronged ones as none save God’s knowledge hath encompassed or reckoned. In all conditions We have been and are patient. We have committed all affairs unto Him and have placed Our reliance in Him. Verily He loveth them that put their trust in Him. Praise be to God, for He is the Goal of all worlds, the Beloved of them that know, and the God of all who are in the heavens and on earth. We convey Our greetings to the friends and counsel them to fear God. Mention unto Haji Mustafa the words of the Wronged One. We beseech God to assist him and grant him success. We have heard his call. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, on his behalf in all conditions for that which containeth the good of this world and the next. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Giver, the Munificent, the All-Generous.</p>
<p>We make mention of Ahmad who hath mentioned Us, that he may be among them that rejoice. O Ahmad! Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto the word of unity and hast testified to that whereunto God, exalted be His glory, hath testified - that blessed and goodly Word “There is none other God but God,” at which the limbs of the idolaters and transgressors have trembled and continue to tremble. Blessed is he upon whose heart this exalted Word hath dawned, and whose light hath illumined all his members. We beseech God to assist thee in that which hath been revealed in the Book and to ordain for thee that which shall accompany thee throughout all worlds and preserve thee from darkness.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Muhammad-’Ali. Know thou that thy letter was present and whatsoever was mentioned therein was heard. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to adorn thy intention with the ornament of deed and acceptance, for thou hast been and art among the monotheists and believers. He hath said - peace be upon Him - “The intention of the believer is better than his deed.” Give thanks to the Goal of all beings, Who hath assisted thee to acknowledge and recognize the blessed Word of Unity. He is the Helper and Succourer of them that believe in divine unity and of the faithful.</p>
<p>O Muhammad ibn Muhammad, O Abdul-Karim, O Muhammad from the people of Za, and O Qasim! His honor the dervish made mention of you and your letters were received and noted. Coming to this quarter in these days is not permitted, for the opposers, for no reason - as the Persians say - seek pretexts and wish to find some pretext to raise an uproar. Therefore, coming in these days would not accord with wisdom. We beseech God to protect you and aid you to do what is right. The world has no worth, nor has it ever had. Strive that praiseworthy and befitting deeds may be manifested from you. Keep away from the corrupt, and do not associate with the oppressors and the stubborn. Pass your days with the utmost joy and fragrance, and be intimate companions with the righteous and the monotheists. Verily, He does not allow to be lost the reward of the doers of good. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O Ayn and Kaf! Your mention has ever been and shall ever be before the Wronged One. We beseech God not to deprive you of the rain of His mercy. He is the Bestower and He is the Kind. There is no God but He, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Help in Peril. Peace be upon you and upon your father and upon those who are with you and love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O God of the world and Lord of the nations! I beseech Thee by Him through Whom prophethood and messengership were ended and their mysteries were sealed and their breezes ceased, to assist Thy servants to turn unto Thee and to place their trust in Thee. Then protect them, O my God, through the hosts of Thy unseen realm from the enemies of Thy Self who have encompassed the lands. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Strong, the Triumphant, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O my leaf! Upon thee be the peace of God, His mercy and His bounty. The matter which takes precedence over all things and the cause which transcends all causes hath been recorded in the Book by the Most Bountiful Pen as being the station of meeting with God. All those who have drawn nigh, the sincere ones, the pure ones and the chosen ones have longed for this most holy, most exalted and most glorious station. However, God, exalted be His glory, in accordance with His consummate wisdom, hath opened the gate of reunion for some through His name, the Munificent, and the key of His name, the All-Bounteous. Blessed are they who have attained! And among these, He hath ordained death and departure from this world as one of the gates leading to the meeting with Him.</p>
<p>I swear by the Sun of Truth which hath risen above the horizon of the Prison that the mention of this most exalted station and supreme rank transcendeth all the pens of the world and the tongues of nations. Verily it is hidden in His knowledge and treasured in the stronghold of His protection. The empresses of the world and the queens of the nations have not attained unto this station, though in the nights and days they have, in mosques and churches, in monasteries and temples, beseeched and implored this station from the heaven of divine grace. However, that noble lady and leaf who hath ascended, by the testimony of the Most Exalted Pen, hath attained unto this most glorious station. After the appearance and rising of this Luminary of bounty from the heaven of divine favor, they should not be saddened by God’s irrevocable decree, but should engage with supreme joy in the remembrance and praise of the Lord of Power.</p>
<p>O my handmaiden! The love of children is a natural and mighty thing, and the cause and reason for its manifestation hath generally been due to external causes, for man hath loved and loveth the perpetuation of his name and mention, and the cause of this, in the sight of God and men, is primarily the perpetuation of traces, and children are reckoned as the greatest of man’s traces. Therefore the heart is attached to them and clings to them. For this reason, the greatest sorrow appeareth after separation following union. However, the perpetuation of outward traces, whether through children or otherwise, is limited and transitory, and is reckoned among perishable things in the sight of God. That which is greater than this, which endureth in the divine Kingdom, is the Word of God, which abideth forever in the divine Book of the All-Merciful and the heavenly Scripture, and is more exalted and greater in the sight of the Lord, the Chosen One, than a hundred thousand children and traces.</p>
<p>This Wronged One beareth witness that that leaf attained unto the Word of God, and mention of her hath repeatedly flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur and hath been recorded in the Tablets by the Pen of God. He saith: The Day of God is the day of supreme joy, and this is that day the mention of which seized the sincere ones and those who have drawn nigh with joy, eagerness, attraction and rapture. In the Qur’an He saith: “…that thou mayest bring forth thy people from darkness into light and remind them of the days of God.” Praise be to God that that noble lady attained unto the mention of the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness in the aforementioned days. Today the existing souls in the world, despite their outward life, are reckoned as dead in the sight of God, for those possessed of true life are souls who have attained unto the recognition of God. They are the possessors of eternal life and everlasting existence. And those dead who have received their portion from the breezes of revelation and the fragrances of inspiration, and have drunk from the Kawthar of recognition from the hand of bounty - they are alive and enduring in the sight of God. If the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful be revealed from […] that which is concealed in the hidden treasure of the Most Exalted Pen, thou shalt find it until thy last breath, occupied with the praise and glorification of God, seeking martyrdom in His path. Verily thy Lord is the True and Faithful Rememberer.</p>
<p>We desire at this hour to make mention of My handmaiden and leaf who hath ascended unto the Most Glorious Companion, as a command from God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>The resplendent, gleaming and radiant Light shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee, O My handmaiden, O thou who hast turned unto My horizon. I testify that thou didst leave thy dwelling place, turning thy face toward the Kaaba of God, the Lord of all men, and didst traverse the path, clinging to the Guide, until thou didst attain the Most Great Prison and didst hear the call from the Supreme Horizon, and didst witness that which flowed from the tongue of the Lord of all beings, at Whose appearance the limbs of the oppressors trembled and the hearts of the transgressors were troubled. We testify that thou didst attain unto recognition and didst acknowledge that which was sent down from the heaven of the loving-kindness of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The glory and the light and the radiance from Us be upon thee, and We beseech God, exalted be He, to send down upon thee, at all times, mercy from His presence and grace from His own Self. Verily, He is the One Whose mercy hath preceded all created things and Whose grace hath encompassed all beings. The power of the world cannot frustrate Him, nor can the might of the nations prevent Him. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Single One, the One, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Praised. Blessed is he who remembereth thy days and visiteth thee with that which hath been sent down from the heaven of thy Lord’s Will. He is assuredly among those who remember, in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>In the name of Him Who is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most High, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to God, through Whose Name the thread of Destiny moved, whereupon the lovers hastened to the place of sacrifice, and the sincere to the court of extinction, and the seekers of unity declared: “We must hasten toward these with our children and with all we possess.” Exalted is He Who attracted them through His verses, acquainted them with His realms, and gave them to drink that which caused decayed bones to stir. Verily, there is no God but He, the Almighty, the Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice unto your mention, O Beloved of my heart! The servant hath been honored by what hath wafted from the drops of your ink, which flowed from your pen whose rustling was raised in the remembrance of God, our Beloved, your Beloved, and the Beloved of all in the worlds. Although in such days wherein the Temple of Justice was afflicted beneath the talons of tyranny through that which the hands of the infidels have wrought, sorrows seized me and prevented me from remembrance and utterance. Yet through the establishment of the All-Merciful upon His Throne and His dawning from the horizon of the Countenance, the sea of joy surgeth, the cock of gladness croweth, and the dove of delight warbleth between earth and heaven. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to adorn His chosen ones with the ornament of patience and forbearance, and to make known unto them that which is hidden behind the veils. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>Observe how despite such tyranny that hath encompassed the world, they count themselves among the people of truth. I swear by the ocean of God’s mercy that were anyone to observe with true vision the deeds of the idolaters and truly comprehend them, he would become aware of the transience of the world and its worthlessness, reaching a station wherein he would see himself sanctified and purified from the world’s defilements and its veils. God is Most Great! They do not reflect what caused the martyrdom of the Prophets and saints of old. Though the Messenger raised with his soul the melody “The righteous are God’s, and the wicked are mine,” they martyred His sons without any guilt. It is not known whether the properties were infidel or their owner. If by the assumption of those idolatrous souls the owner was an infidel, for what reason did they plunder the properties? All things bear witness to their falsehood, their hypocrisy, their infidelity, and their idolatry. Fie upon them and upon their leader whom they have taken as a protector for themselves instead of God. Strange it is that the root of oppression and the tree of tyranny, which was the cause and reason for this great injustice, did not become aware even after being seized. These souls will not become conscious until they find themselves in the lowest fires. Soon shall they find themselves in grievous torment. With utmost joy and fragrance, be occupied with the mention of the Beloved of the worlds. The Afnan will not forget his own. He hath bestowed His mercy and grace upon all. If its manifestation hath not appeared in some, God will soon manifest it through His grace. Be thou assured and be of those who are steadfast. Occupy thyself with some occupation, placing thy trust in God, the All-Wise, for all are commanded to engage in some occupation. Verily, He is the Commander, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Another matter is that the petition of the Most Exalted Leaf, Her Holiness the Sacred Spouse - may all the glory and praise of God rest upon her - reached the Most Holy Court and a reply was sent; deliver it to her. Glory be to God! The heedlessness of the people of the world has reached such a degree that they have not been awakened by the great cry and supreme calamities beyond which none can be conceived. Consider the chief and what befell him. Nearly five hundred thousand souls have perished, and from beneath every tree in the vicinity of the Land of Mystery arose the wailing and lamentation of widows and others. Blood was shed to such an extent that most lands were observed to be stained crimson. That which was revealed by the Supreme Pen in the Tablet to the Chief has come to pass. Nevertheless, no one became aware of whence this occurred or why it occurred, although after the revelation of the blessed Tablet some people in those kingdoms heard these verses. Yet they are still observed to be in heedlessness and pride. All things are bewildered by their intoxication, heedlessness and slumber. By God! They are in a remarkable sleep. This evanescent servant beseeches and hopes that God will aid that dignified one to render such service that its mention may shine and gleam like a brilliant star from the horizon of the divine Tablet in such wise that no setting shall overtake it. Glory be upon you and upon those who love you and turn towards you and drink the choice wine of meeting you, and praise be to God, our Beloved and your Beloved and the Beloved of all the worlds. The Servant. On the 9th of Shawwal 1296.</p>

<p>He is the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy, the Most Manifest, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God, Who is sanctified beyond all names and exalted above whatsoever the people of creation make mention of, and transcendent beyond whatsoever the dwellers of the cities of eternity might describe. Exalted is He, unto Whose loftiness and elevation every exalted one hath testified, unto Whose inaccessibility and majesty every one possessed of grandeur hath borne witness, unto Whose sovereign might and power every possessor of strength hath attested, unto Whose holy sanctity every sanctified one hath testified, and unto Whose sublime transcendence every one possessed of abstraction hath borne witness. This is in that station wherein His sovereignty is established upon the throne of names and the sun of His manifestation shineth forth upon the world of creation. Otherwise, how far, how far is that station wherein the very reality of all mention is powerless to soar in the atmosphere of His remembrance, and the very essence of all description lieth wingless and cast down in the desert of His attributes. How remote are names from that Presence wherein praise is abashed to be attributed to His court, and transcendence is ashamed to fall within the realm of His indication. Exalted, immeasurably exalted, is He above whatsoever those who remember might mention of Him, or those who describe might attribute to Him, or those who profess His unity might affirm of Him, or those who know might comprehend of Him. He hath spoken with the tongue of His grandeur in the kingdom of His Own Self - glorified and exalted be He above what they describe.</p>
<p>My soul be a sacrifice for your love. The brief exalted letter, wherein were folded and concealed infinite worlds of love and affection, and which was sent by way of Hadba, reached this servant. I was honored to behold it. Praise be to God that you are blessed with health and that the sun of the love of God shineth bright and resplendent from the horizon of your luminous heart. Although the veils of the heedless and the allusions of the ignorant form a barrier, praise be to the Beloved of all horizons that the piercing glances of the steadfast and upright souls have burned away the veils of light, and the effulgences and revelations of the Sun of Manifestation have encompassed the world, to such extent that any sightless one, should he so desire, may behold the brilliant lights of the horizon of Revelation without any veil or barrier. Should any soul remain deprived this day, it is due to his own veiling and lack of search, in that he hath not wished to receive sustenance from the infinite ocean of divine bounties. Otherwise, this Most Great Revelation hath appeared in such wise that not the least occasion for hesitation remaineth for the peoples of the world.</p>
<p>In any case, were this servant to attempt to make mention of these stations, this letter might not arrive, as the travelers are about to depart this very moment. You had written that two petitions from this servant had arrived. Let that beloved one know that whenever anyone has been departing, this servant has taken the trouble [to write]; there was no negligence whatsoever in this matter. Thus far, this servant has submitted more than ten petitions. I know not whether they have failed to reach that beloved one or if something else has occurred. The circumstances of the Most Great Prison remain as before - outwardly, to all appearances, calm, but inwardly, as God hath said, in a state of upheaval and revolution. Likewise, travelers continuously, successively, and repeatedly arrive from all directions each day without permission. This servant is ashamed to mention this. I know not how they interpret all these firm and decisive verses that have been sent down from the heaven of God’s Command forbidding this matter. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to grant us success and remind us not to treat God’s Cause as a plaything and to be among His servants who act according to His command.</p>
<p>One of the emanations of the inner turmoil of this land was that two sons of Jinab-i-Ustad Baqir-i-Najjar - upon him and upon them be the glory of God - ascended to the Most Exalted Horizon due to the explosion of the steam-powered mill they had set up for grinding flour. At that time, once again a great commotion arose. In truth, the commotion which had been foretold upon first arrival at the Most Great Prison, and which manifested after several years, was renewed in that same manner on that day. This servant became certain that the Ancient Beauty had continually stated that the turmoil of this land had not yet subsided and its inner state was still in motion. This was God’s promise and it came to pass. After the incident occurred, it was repeatedly heard that the agitation of this land had not yet subsided. It became clear that more was yet to manifest, even though at present perfect ease and comfort is evident for the loved ones in the prison-city, and the officials show the utmost friendship and affection. Nevertheless, He states that it has not yet subsided. Verily He is the All-Knowing of what has appeared and what shall appear, and He is indeed the Triumphant, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent. I beseech your honor to convey to all the friends and nobles of that land, as well as all those connected to your honor, on behalf of this evanescent servant, sublime [and glorious] greetings and expressions of pure sincerity. Glory be upon your honor, upon those with you, and upon those who have believed in God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. The Servant. 9 Dhi’l-Qa’dih 1293.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate!</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the Quickener of all beings, the Creator of light and darkness, Who dispels the gloom of nights with the light of days, Who brings forth fruits from their sheaths, Who hath chosen from among the days eleven - the number of Huva - which is the Hidden Mystery known only to him who is acquainted with the secrets of destiny. In six of these He created the heavens and the earth, and there remained the number of Ha, which was revealed on the Night of Power. Thus doth every person of insight become convinced that whatsoever was created in the six was created for the Manifestations of Ha, who are the Five People of the Cloak. Then He adorned Ha with the embellishment of Ba, and the authoritative and hidden Word of God was completed - that Word which was the source of the utterance of the Command in the world of creation.</p>
<p>Through it He revealed Himself unto all things, whatsoever hath been created in earth and heaven. Then appeared distinction and detail in every kind among the existent beings and contingent things, which were endowed with elements according to what was ordained by the Lord of Names and Attributes. He that turned toward it believed in the Worshipped One, and he that turned away from it denied prostration and disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>When He revealed Himself through it unto the days, certain days turned toward Him, and after the passing of the Vav, He made Ha the festival of Islam and a treasure and honor for all peoples. When the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast was fulfilled, there dawned from the highest horizon the morn of our Festival of Sacrifice. Glorified be He Who ordained it by His irrevocable decree for the people of guidance, and distinguished it for those possessed of understanding who have believed in God, the Lord of the First and the Last.</p>
<p>He made it the brightest star in the brow of days, and the point in the brocade of time’s book from which stream forth the mysteries of the Furqan. It hath its manifestation in both creation and legislation. Blessed is he who bringeth forth the pearl of utterance from the shell of the heart bearing clear exposition. God hath made the first day a sign of unity and a manifestation of oneness for all servants, that all atoms might bear witness that there is none other God but Him, the Creator of earth and heavens.</p>
<p>Then He caused other days to dawn and made them days of Tashriq for this community, and through these three the four pillars were completed among creation. We bear witness that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been, and there hath been nothing beside Him. He shall ever continue to be even as He hath been.</p>
<p>The way to the knowledge of His Essence is barred, and the path to comprehending His Reality is cut off. The way is blocked and the quest forbidden. His proof is His signs, and His Being is His evidence. He is independent of the mention of aught else and is self-sufficient above the description of all else. He hath sent the Messengers and revealed the Books, and made them the manifestations of His signs and the dawning-places of His names and attributes, that all might bear witness to that which He hath testified of His own Self, by His own Self, before the creation of His heaven and His earth: that there is none other God but Him, and that He hath ever been one God, Single, Individual, Alone, Everlasting, Eternal, Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Verily the Messengers have concluded with the Guide of all paths. He is in the Most Exalted Horizon and speaketh forth from that most splendid station and most glorious horizon. Blessed are ye for having attained on this Most Great Festival unto the garment of recognition, and for having believed in your Lord, the All-Merciful, and in that which was brought by the Pride of all worlds and the Sovereign of all possibility - He through Whom religions were renewed and the breezes of forgiveness wafted over the people of rebellion - He Whose head was adorned with the crown of “But for Thee,” Who in the station of consciousness declareth “We knew Thee not” and in the station of effacement “I am He and He is I,” except that He is sanctified above the mention of “I” and “Thou” - the Beginning Who was adorned with the ornament of the Seal - the Manifest through Whom was manifested the mystery of the Hidden - the Manifestation of Eternity and Pride of all nations, Muhammad, the Chosen One. May God’s blessings and peace be upon Him and upon His family and companions through whom flowed what had ebbed, and whom God made the gates of knowledge for all who come and go. There is no God but He, the Beneficent, the Giver, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy most excellent names and Thy most exalted attributes, and by Thy Most Great Name through which the birds of the hearts of them that have recognized Thy unity have soared in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and loving-kindness, and the hearts of the sincere have ascended unto the heaven of the glory of Thy eternity, to make this Festival a blessing unto us and unto those who have acknowledged Thy unity and confessed Thy singleness. O Lord! This is a day which Thou hast made a festival among all days for the perpetuation of Thy remembrance amongst all people and their attainment unto the most exalted station. O Lord! We are poor - we have turned toward the shadow of Thy riches; we are weak - we have set our faces toward the Ka’bih of Thy favors and gifts; we are thirsty - we have hastened to the Kawthar of Thy bounty and bestowals. I beseech Thee by Thyself and by Muhammad, Whom Thou didst choose in the world of eternity above all other nations, that Thou disappoint us not of the wonders of Thy grace and bounty, and make us not deprived of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. O Lord! Send down upon us from the clouds of Thy mercy and the heaven of Thy grace that which will purify us from the defilement of the world and draw us nigh unto Thee, O Thou in Whose hands are the dominion of decree and the kingdom of its execution! O Lord! Illumine our eyes with the light of Thy recognition and our hearts with the light of Thy knowledge, then draw us unto the precincts of nearness and holiness and beauty. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Most High. There is no God but Thee, the Possessor of majesty and grace.</p>

<p>O Abul-Ma’ali, upon thee be the Glory of God!</p>
<p>In the name of Him Who calleth aloud with the most exalted utterance amidst all created things.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who was attracted by the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing and by the murmuring of the River of Meanings as it flowed from the right hand of the Throne of his Lord, the Lord of all beings, that the Most Great Joy might take possession of him on this Day whereon the Ancient King hath been made manifest through the Most Great Name and hath proclaimed: “There is none other God but He, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>
<p>O Abul-Ma’ali! The servant who is present hath at this moment presented thy letter before the Wronged One. We have answered thee through this Tablet whereby the horizon of utterance hath shone forth and the nightingale of the All-Merciful hath warbled upon the branches: “There is none other God but He, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.” We have inhaled from thy letter the fragrance of thy love and have heard that which thy tongue and heart have uttered concerning this Remembrance at Whose appearance all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck, save for a mere handful who represent the Countenance of thy Lord, the Lord of existence. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as We have found thee speaking My praise, turning toward My horizon, soaring in the atmosphere of My love, holding fast to the cord of My bounty, clinging to the hem of the robe of My grandeur, and humble before the revelation of My verses and submissive unto My Cause that prevaileth over all that was and shall be.</p>
<p>Hearken unto the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen in the Persian tongue, that perchance the people of that land might, through the utterances of the Revealer of verses, shatter the idols of doubt and misgiving through the Name of Truth and turn toward the horizon of the Cause. This is a Day the mention of which hath been recorded in all the divine Books through the Name of Truth, for it is known as the Day of God, wherein naught is mentioned save God, His sovereignty, His grandeur, His power, His majesty, and His mercy that hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Praise be to God that thy honor hath been enabled to make mention of the Truth, to praise the Truth, and to serve the Truth. Know thou the worth and station of this most great bounty and arise as behooveth the days of God. He is present and watchful, and at all times confirmeth them that are detached. Be thou assured of thy Lord’s favor and proclaim His Cause with wisdom and utterance, that perchance such souls as have quaffed from the Kawthar of life and are turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon might not remain veiled by former superstitions nor be deprived.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Ma’ali! Reflect upon the triumphant community, how on the Day of the Divine Balance’s manifestation, the rebellious and transgressing parties were accounted, nay, even more astray and misguided, as if they had not partaken of the Kawthar of certitude nor received a single drop from the ocean of fairness. In the Book of God, from the Most Glorious Pen, they are recorded and inscribed as worshippers of idols and vain imaginings. Blessed is the soul who has freed itself from previous superstitions and has turned with utmost sanctification and detachment toward the ocean of divine knowledge and the sun of heavenly wisdom. Behold, then mention what the All-Merciful has revealed in the Qur’an: “All that dwells upon the earth shall perish, but the face of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the Most-Bountiful, shall abide forever.” All are today perishing, though they perceive it not. For years and centuries, they have spoken of and awaited the appearance of an imaginary person in an imaginary city with imaginary signs and attributes. Yet when He appeared contrary to their understanding, reason, suppositions and imaginings, they raised the standards of rejection and unfurled the banners of denial and protest. The deeds of that rebellious, transgressing and heedless community are not surprising, for those possessed of insight and the people of the Most Sublime Vision have always recognized such souls as worshippers of the idols of vain imaginings. What is surprising is that the people of the Bayan have again become afflicted with the same delusions. By the Sun of the heaven of inner meanings, they are seen to be more remote, more misguided, and more veiled than all other peoples. They behold the Sun of Manifestation at its meridian and hear the call of the Lord of Names from the highest horizon, yet they turn away and indeed are among the most vehement enemies. This Most Great Cause has no likeness in what has gone before or shall come after, for it has appeared adorned with the most wondrous originality. Verily, He is the Originator of the heavens and earth. Blessed is the servant who has attained unto that which God, the Lord of the worlds, has desired. God willing, you should engage in teaching the Cause with the utmost determination, with wisdom and utterance, and in the name of the Ancient King rend asunder the veils of the peoples, that they might not remain deprived of the outpouring grace nor be bereft of the ocean of knowledge. Blessed art thou and thy brother who turned toward the Truth when most of creation turned away from it. We have indeed sent down unto him clear verses that he might rejoice and be among the thankful. We counsel all to manifest the greatest steadfastness in this Cause whereby the limbs of all names have trembled, save those whom God, the Almighty, the Powerful, has willed. Convey to all the friends the greetings from the Wronged One, that perchance through the fragrances of the garment of the All-Merciful’s utterance they may be illumined with the lights of steadfastness and be recorded in the Book of God among those who are firm and steadfast.</p>

<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath turned unto God, who hath been stirred by the fragrance of reunion in His days, who hath directed his heart toward Him, who hath spoken His praise, who hath been drawn by His verses, who hath desired to assist His Cause and to arise to serve his Lord, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. O thou who hast turned unto God! We have desired to give thee to drink of the Water of Life from a chalice whereof if thou shouldst drink but a single drop, thou wouldst find therein the taste of all the fruits and foods of Paradise. This is of the bounty of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. And We have desired to show thee the Ancient Beauty through an eye sanctified from all contingent things, and We have desired to cause thee to hear the Call from the mouth of thy Lord’s Will, that thou mightest give thanks to Him at eventide and at dawn. And We have desired to make thee soar in the atmosphere of longing, not with wings like the wings of birds, and to draw thee nigh unto the ocean not with feet like the feet of men, but rather through that subtle, spiritual, and real motion which proceedeth from the power of the spirit. By God! It is swifter than the lightning that dazzleth the sight. And We shall cause thee to swim in the ocean of thy Lord’s knowledge - an ocean whereof none hath attained to even a drop save whom God willeth, thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. The breezes of revelation and the fragrances of divine favors shall so take hold of thee that thou shalt move through the body of the world as the chief artery moveth through the human body. Say: O people! By God, the Hand of God hath appeared, and it is sovereign over all who are in earth and heaven. Were anyone to find the sweetness of that which We have sent down unto thee, the attraction of the verses would so seize him that he would cry out with a cry surpassing the crashing of thunderbolts in the mountains, and would be set ablaze with the fire of the Word in such wise as to set the horizons aflame. Whoso hath today attained unto the shield of protection which hath been woven by the hand of power, neither the swords of the world nor the darts of the factions can affect him. Thus have the rains of My bounty poured down and the fire of My love been kindled, that thy heart might rejoice thereby and that thou mightest arise to serve thy Lord with power and sovereignty. Give thanks unto thy Lord for His having turned toward thee the Countenance of God, and for His Most Exalted Pen having moved to make mention of thee, and for thy name having been inscribed in the most wondrous of Tablets. All things shall perish save that which hath been revealed unto thee in this Tablet, from whose horizon have shone forth the suns of grandeur and power.</p>
<p>In the most wondrous Persian tongue this is mentioned, and this is yet another bounty that thou mayest be among those who rejoice. Praise be to God that through the infinite outpourings of divine grace in these days when the horizon of the heaven of Will is resplendent with the Sun of Oneness, and the ocean of generosity through the Most Great Name is manifest and evident, thou hast turned unto the Most Exalted Horizon and clung to the Sure Handle. In gratitude for this supreme honor and mighty gift, thou must at all times be occupied with the promotion of the Cause of the All-Merciful. That the True One, exalted be His glory, commands His loved ones to promote His Cause is indicative of His grace. Each of the assured, certain, and steadfast souls must today regard himself alone as both the promoter and the one promoted. He hath ordained that promotion be through mention and utterance, that perchance dead souls and moldering bones may be quickened by the sweet savors of divine verses and turn toward the Friend, that all may attain the divine bounties and receive a portion of His vast mercy. The Kingdom of assistance is within His mighty grasp. Should He so will, He could through a single soul subdue the entire world. Observe the sun, which is but one of His signs: through divine confirmations it alone hath conquered the whole world. When such a sign in the horizons is thus observed, this same is proof that He is able, in the realm of the souls of His loved ones, to raise up one soul with such power, might and ascendancy as to subdue all the kingdoms of the earth. Every discerning mystic from this supreme example perceiveth that which he had not perceived before, and with heart and soul confirmeth the words of the All-Merciful which have streamed from His Pen. Yet this station hath been made to tarry and hath been prohibited, in accordance with consummate wisdom. None knoweth the mysteries of His wisdom save His all-pervading knowledge. Therefore, it is incumbent upon all today to conquer the strongholds of heedless souls through proof, evidence, mention and utterance, and to bestow fresh eternal life upon moldering bones through His remembrance. God willing, thou shalt shine forth from the horizon of the heaven of steadfastness like a brilliant star and illumine those regions with the light of recognition. Thus have We bestowed upon thee the hidden and abiding favors, and upon thy heart the holy and resplendent breezes of holiness, and upon thine ear My most sweet and most delectable call, and upon thy sight the meanings witnessed in this exalted Tablet. Be thou assured of His grace and favors. He will verily assist thee with the truth. He is, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful. He is with thee under all conditions. He is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. However, in all Tablets ye must be mindful of wisdom, for this is a matter concerning which the decree hath been issued in all circumstances. Blessed are they that act! The glory be upon thee and upon the sincere servants of God.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali, hearken unto the call of the faithful Beloved, Who calleth from the Most Glorious Horizon, saying: O My servant and son of My handmaiden! We have hearkened unto thy call and heard thy whispered prayer. At all times hath the glance of loving-kindness been directed toward them that have turned unto Him, and ever shall it be thus. No soul hath arisen to befriend another save that he hath entered the precincts of the true Friend. O Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali! If thou shouldst inhale the sweet-scented breezes wafting from the direction of the mercy of the Lord of creation, thou wouldst, with all thy heart and soul, utter these words and cry out among the servants in My Name: O servants! I swear by the Beauty of the Beloved that this is the mercy that hath encompassed all created things, and this is the Day wherein the divine bounty hath embraced all beings. O ’Ali! The fountain of My mercy floweth and the heart of My loving-kindness burneth, for never hath the Friend desired that His loved ones be overtaken by sorrow or touched by grief. When My Name, the All-Merciful, heard a word from My loved ones contrary to My good-pleasure, He returned to His place sorrowful and grief-stricken. And My Name, the Concealer, whenever He beheld someone engaged in exposing another’s faults, returned to the Most Holy Court in utmost sadness, lamenting and bewailing. And My Name, the All-Forgiving, when He witnessed any transgression from My friends, cried out and fell unconscious to the earth. The angels of the Divine Command bore Him to the Supreme Horizon. By My Life! O Nabil-Qabli-’Ali! The burning of Baha’s heart is greater than thine, and His lamentation more intense. Whenever an act of rebellion from any soul was made manifest in the Most Holy Court, the Ancient Beauty, out of shame, desired to veil His countenance, for He hath ever gazed upon faithfulness and acted in accordance with its requirements. When thy words were mentioned before the Divine Countenance, the ocean of My faithfulness surged, and the breezes of My forgiveness wafted, and the Tree of My loving-kindness was stirred, and the heaven of My bounty revolved. I swear by the Sun of the eternal horizon that I am saddened by thy sadness and grieved by thy grief. Thy sigh hath penetrated the Most Glorious Pavilion and reached the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. Thy cry was heard and thy lamentation reached the ears of the Ancient Lord. Blessed art thou, then blessed art thou! Thy confession appeared in a wondrous form before the Chosen One in His retreat, and thine acknowledgment shone forth with an exalted adorning in the presence of the All-Forgiving. Thou dost acknowledge and I am the Acknowledger; thou dost confess and I am the Confessor, for I acknowledge thy services and the hardships thou hast endured in My path. All atoms bear witness to My love for thee. O ’Ali! This call of thine is most beloved. Write, speak, and summon the people to the direction of the Lord of the worlds with such fervor and attraction as shall set them all ablaze. Say:</p>
<p>O my God, my Beloved, my Mover, my Attractor, the One Who calls in my heart and the Beloved of my inmost being! Praise be unto Thee for having caused me to turn to Thy countenance, to be enkindled with Thy remembrance, to call out Thy Name, and to voice Thy praise. O my Lord! O my Lord! Were heedlessness not to exist, how would the standards of Thy mercy be raised and the banners of Thy generosity be unfurled? And were error not to be declared, how would it be known that Thou art the Concealer, the Forgiver, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise? My soul be a sacrifice for the heedlessness of those who are heedless of Thee, for through it pass the breezes of mercy of Thy name, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. My being be a sacrifice for the sin of those who sin against Thee, for through it the winds of Thy grace and the fragrant musk of Thy favors are made known. My essence be a sacrifice for the disobedience of those who disobey Thee, for through it the sun of Thy gifts has shone forth from the horizon of Thy bounty and the rains of Thy generosity have descended upon the realities of Thy creation. O my Lord! I am he who has acknowledged every transgression and confessed to that which none in all creation has confessed. I have hastened to the shore of Thy forgiveness and dwelt beneath the shade of the pavilions of Thy generosity. I beseech Thee, O Lord of Eternity and Sovereign of the worlds, to manifest through me that which will cause spirits to soar in the atmosphere of Thy love and souls to wing their flight in the heaven of Thy intimate companionship. Then ordain for me, through Thy sovereignty, such power as shall cause all created things to turn toward the Dayspring of Thy Manifestation and the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation. O my Lord! Make me wholly annihilated in Thy good-pleasure and steadfast in Thy service, for I love life only that I might circle round the pavilion of Thy Cause and the tabernacles of Thy grandeur. Thou seest me, O my God, detached from all save Thee and humble before Thee. Do with me as befitteth Thee and beseemeth Thy majesty and well becometh Thy court.</p>
<p>O Ali! Thou hast been and art favored by the grace of the Lord of the Worlds. Through His might and power, arise to assist His Cause and exalt His remembrance amongst His servants. Be not grieved that thou possessest not outward learning and penmanship. The doors of all bounties are within the grasp of God’s power; He hath opened them and will continue to open them to the faces of His servants. God willing, may this sweet fragrance waft at all times from the direction of thy heart throughout the world in such wise that its fruits become manifest in every land. He is powerful over all things. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the All-Compelling.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>All praise befitteth the most holy and exalted Court of the Beloved One, Who from His Most Great Word created emissaries and made them heralds, that they might give glad-tidings to the peoples of the world and summon them to the most exalted horizon. And when the effulgences of the Sun of the Primal Word shed their radiance upon the Secondary Word, the world was seized by the vibration of the Word. Every soul in whom a light was manifest turned towards the Dayspring of existence, and this Secondary Word which appeared from the mouth of the emissaries penetrated the realities of men, and the lovers of the countenance of the Beloved Lord sought to attain His station, and with utmost lowliness and supplication gained permission and turned towards the Dawning-Place, the Source, the Rising-Point, the Fountainhead and the Return. When this turning and journeying occurred in the contingent world, the pilgrim house came into being - and it is the first guest-house of the world, the shelter of the chosen ones and the near ones, and the homeland of the people of Baha. A hundred thousand blessings be upon the one who gained permission and was honored to visit that place. From the first emissaries shall appear second emissaries, and from the second emissaries other emissaries unto the end that hath no end. But blessed is he who attained unto it in His days and drank the choice wine of His revelation from the hands of His bounty and partook of His favors at the table of His generosity. In truth, all others are in the shadow of decrease, except whom our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the heavens and earth willeth.</p>
<p>I submit that your letter arrived and was like musk, for from it wafted the fragrance of love for the Desired One of the worlds. After it was read and reviewed, it was presented to the Master. He said: “Praise be to God, in this month of fasting the sun of deeds hath shone forth and illumined the temples of those who have turned to Him and drawn nigh unto Him. Blessed is he who performeth what God hath revealed, purely for His sake - he is indeed among the sincere ones in the perspicuous Book.” End quote.</p>
<p>After presenting the prayer of the beloved of the heart, His Eminence Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of Power, He said before His face: “We beseech God, exalted be He, to make him a leader of His servants unto His path. Verily He is powerful over all things. O Ibn-i-Abhar! The servant present here read what thou didst supplicate at the beginning and the end. Verily the Wronged One heard and answered thee with that which causeth the fragrance of utterance to waft throughout all possibility.” End quote.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, in this blessed month they are occupied with the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory, and are turned towards Him. Tomorrow afternoon, which is Tuesday the 3rd, they shall turn with another of the pilgrims. He said: “This is the reward of his deed and his remembrance.” Later they will gradually summon the others. Your Honor should convey greetings from this servant to each one. He said that Your Honor should look after the pilgrims so that they may be engaged with joy and fragrance in the praise and glorification of the Beloved of the worlds. Especially in the blessed month of Ramadan, attention is necessary. They ask thee concerning the bounty - it is water and bread. Praise be to God, they are blessed with manifold bounties: the bounty of recognition, the bounty of deeds, the bounty of turning to God, the bounty of attaining His presence, the bounty of meeting Him, the bounty of hearkening, the bounty of witnessing. Were this table of power to be spread unto the end that hath no end, it would not be exhausted. “If ye should count the bounties of God ye would not be able to number them.” End quote.</p>
<p>In truth the glance of favor is directed towards you. The mention of those souls has ever been and continues to be in His presence. They stated that his honor Muhammad, upon him be peace, has received and continues to receive rewards and recompense for this service. Give him my glad-tidings and say: Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Though the reply to your letter was delayed, it is compensated in this missive, for it is adorned with the mention of the Master–may our spirits be sacrificed for His sake. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to continually grant unto all that which He has in these days bestowed upon some.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about his honor Aqa Asadu’llah, upon him be the peace of God, it has been granted. Likewise, the names of the advancing souls that his honor Aqa ’Abdu’l-Muttalib, upon him and them be the peace of God, sent have each attained what is befitting them. Happy are they! And the spiritual beloved, his honor Aqa Siyyid Asadu’llah, upon him be the peace of God and His favors–the request he had made has been granted acceptance. We ask him to act upon what was intended previously for the friends of God.</p>
<p>Regarding the wheat about which they wrote that it is finished, it should be mentioned to his honor the Most Exalted Name of Bounty, upon him be the peace of God, as this service pertains to him. He has ever accomplished and continues to accomplish it. His reward and recompense are with God and before God. Assuredly they should mention the details to him; consideration of this is necessary, nay, obligatory. Peace, spirit and mercy be upon you and upon the sincere servants of God. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O brother Ali-Akbar!</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the All-Compelling, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise befitteth and beseemeth that Desired One Who, through one blessed Word shining forth from the Dayspring of Divine utterance, hath caused the earth to be changed, the mountains to be crushed, the heaven to be cleft asunder, them that lie in the graves to be raised up, and the seas to overflow. On the one hand, the attraction of the resurrection seized all hearts, and on the other, the intoxication of the wine of recognition so encompassed the souls of them that had turned unto Him that they became unaware of themselves and all else. For the first existence was utterly annihilated in absolute nothingness, that an existence other than this existence might emerge from the realm of the invisible and attain to the exalted station of “Verily, we are God’s, and verily, unto Him shall we return.” Therefore, whatsoever hath appeared of heedlessness toward outward matters and worldly attachments was and is of no consequence. The Most Truthful One hath said: “The Day whereon man shall flee from his brother.”</p>
<p>God the One is My witness that from the moment this evanescent servant attained unto the wine of inner meaning, the fragrances of longing and desire and the sweet-scented breezes of attraction and ecstasy did so powerfully prevail that pen and tongue are powerless to describe them. How many were the days when, in the wilderness of separation, he was consumed by the fire of remoteness, and how many were the nights when, aflame with yearning, he beheld himself like unto a fish writhing upon the sand, until the hand of grace, wholly unmerited, drew this evanescent atom to the eternal realm. A world other than this world was witnessed, and utterances sanctified from letters and words were heard. And after recovering from that first intoxication and being honored with the second sobriety, this servant deemed it binding and necessary to make good whatsoever had outwardly been missed by him. For all are commanded to teach God’s Cause, that all people may be sanctified from the idolatry of associating partners with God and may acknowledge and confess the oneness of God. And in this station the command “to begin with them that are nearest” must be observed.</p>
<p>Therefore I submit to that honored brother that which Luqman submitted to his master: In the early dawn, when the breeze of divine favor was wafting, Luqman, kindled by the fire of the love of the All-Merciful, would raise his head from the pillow of rest and, finding his master in the embrace of comfort and sleep, would approach his bedside with utmost courtesy and say: “O master, arise! The gates of trade are open and the Concourse on High and the sanctified souls are engaged in commerce. O master, arise and deprive not thyself of this trade, for eternal pearls are being offered for sale and precious everlasting things are at hand.” And when he would find his master showing laziness, he would return to his place and become immersed and lost in contemplation of the wondrous handiwork of God and the mysteries of divine wisdom. And when he would observe that dawn was approaching, he would again turn to his master and say: “O master, arise, for the time draweth to a close. I fear the market-place may close while thou art still asleep. Arise and let not the time slip away, that perchance thou mayest not remain deprived of the outpourings of the All-Merciful in these last hours of the night.”</p>
<p>Now doth this servant submit: O brother, strive that in these divine days thou mayest acquire infinite bounties and be blessed with eternal favors. By the True One Himself, whatsoever is lost by any soul in this day shall be difficult to recover. Both you must raise your hands in supplication and this servant shall lift his hands in hope that perchance we may be illumined by the effulgent rays of the Sun of Truth and remain steadfast in His Cause with complete firmness. Behold the people as dead and turn to the Ever-Living One. Had the people of the earth attained unto a drop from the ocean of life, they would surely have hearkened to the divine call and witnessed the light of His countenance. Remember what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “They have ears with which they hear not, and hearts with which they understand not,” unto the end of His exalted Word. And it is most evident that the mention which befitteth this most exalted and glorious station cannot flow from the pen of this servant, for the ocean of divine utterance is sanctified and exalted above the expressions of this evanescent one, since it hath neither shore nor end. Therefore, I conclude by saying: There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist you and strengthen you in His remembrance and praise, and to protect you from the imaginings of every imaginer and the whisperings of every tempter who believeth not in God, the Single, the All-Informed. And another entreaty: Convey on behalf of this evanescent one greetings and salutations to all the kindred, both brothers and sisters and relations, and remind them with utmost love and kindness that perchance they may be adorned with the ornament of recognition and certitude and may turn unto the Dawning-Place of the Cause of the All-Merciful.</p>

<p>He is the Hearer of Justice and the Answerer through Grace!</p>
<p>The ocean of joy hath surged and the countenance of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, hath smiled, inasmuch as the Call hath been raised from the Land of ?a unto the Most Exalted Horizon and hath gladdened the dwellers of the Most Glorious Paradise and the Supreme Heaven by the arising of the Hands of the Cause and the Manifestations of Utterance before the Kaaba of God with a clear covenant and firm pledge, that the world and all that dwell therein might be illumined by the light of unity and concord. Exalted, exalted is this most high station! Exalted, exalted is this Covenant through which the scrolls of names have been renewed and the stations of the people of Baha have been elevated among all humanity!</p>
<p>O my God, O Fashioner of names and Creator of heaven! By Thy might and Thy majesty, Thy power and Thy sovereignty, I find no hosts more mighty than the covenant of Thy chosen ones before Thy face and their pledge to aid Thy Cause and exalt Thy Word. O Lord! Assist them with the hosts of righteousness and piety, and with that detachment whereby the gates of glory and bounty were opened to all who dwell on earth and in heaven. O Lord! Aid them with the banners of Thy utterance and the standards of Thy remembrance and praise, and ordain for them that which shall make them manifestations of Thy virtues and names and dawning-places of Thy generosity and bestowals. Thou seest them, O my God, turning toward the horizon of Thy grace and desiring to serve Thy Cause amongst Thy servants. Write down for them, then, with Thy Most Exalted Pen, every good thing Thou hast sent down in Thy Books and Thy Scriptures, Thy Scrolls and Thy Tablets. Verily Thou art He through Whose Most Great Name the world was subdued and through Whose Most Noble Name the gates of munificence and bounty were opened unto all peoples. I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Object of the knowledge of the wise and the Beloved of all who dwell in the heavens and the earth, to assist His Majesty the Sultan to turn unto Thee and to manifest Thy justice through Thy name. O Lord! Aid him through Thy party, then preserve him with the hosts of the seen and the unseen. Verily Thou art the Lord of all creation. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the Triumphant, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O Ali-Qabil-Akbar! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. Thy letters have attained unto Our presence and been heard. In truth, all that was mentioned therein was the cause of joy and gladness, for its words and letters were perfumed with the fragrance of unity and concord. I truly say: This New Covenant is in itself a mighty host. We have ordained it for the conquest of the citadels of hearts through Our Name, the Mighty, the Beloved. We hope that through these new and wondrous means the foundation of God’s Cause will be made firm and steadfast.</p>
<p>Some time ago these verses were revealed and sent to one of the wise ones - upon him be My glory: O Wise One! The power and structure of faith has grown weak in all regions of the world. The supreme remedy is needed. The dross of nations has seized them; the greatest elixir is required. O Wise One! Has the crown of victory such power as to transform diverse elements in a single thing and bring them to the station of pure gold? Though such transformation appears difficult and complex, yet the transformation of earthly power to heavenly power is possible in the sight of this Wronged One. That which effects this transformation is greater than the elixir. This station and this power are specific to the Word of God. It is the essence that transforms fear into certitude, weakness into strength, and abasement into glory.</p>
<p>One drop from the ocean of divine wisdom struck Badi’ and like a ball of fire he sought martyrdom. His moisture was transformed to heat, his weakness to power, his sluggishness to swiftness. At this time, what is needed is to seek healing from the Incomparable Almighty for prevalent chronic diseases. We beseech from the ocean of bounty of God, exalted be His glory, protection for you and the friends of that land. Verily He will protect you and aid you as He protected and aided you before. Behold the prison and its transformation, and the Cause and its sovereignty. In utter weakness complete power is manifest, and in poverty the kingdom of wealth is evident. Blessed are they who perceive and are fair-minded.</p>
<p>The glad-tidings of unity and concord illumined the horizons. Glory be to God! The oppression of the friends in Ishqabad became as conquering hosts and rendered a great victory to the Cause of God. These are the results of the wisdom revealed from the Supreme Pen in scriptures and tablets. Blessed are they who understand.</p>
<p>The essence of counsel and advice is this: if any of the friends commits an unseemly deed or manifests anything improper, the trusted ones of the Cause should, with utmost love and kindness, wisdom and care, gently and affectionately counsel and advise that soul. Surely such words, when offered purely for the sake of God, will be penetrating, helpful and nurturing.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! Aid all on earth to attain unto Thy presence and cause them to recognize what Thou hast ordained for them in Thy Books. Then adorn the teachers with the ornament of sanctity among Thy servants. Then through Thy power make their words penetrating. Then make them bearers of the standard of detachment and righteousness. Verily Thou art the Lord of creation, and the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Commander, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who hearken to thy words concerning this firm, wise Cause.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-’Ali of Dihaj, who has attained Our presence and won the victory! He is the One Who gazeth from His Most Exalted Horizon</p>
<p>The Book of God speaketh the truth and summoneth humanity unto His mighty and praiseworthy path. Verily it hath been sent down from the heaven of utterance by One Who is the All-Knowing Speaker. He Whom God promised in His Books of old hath come with a manifest proof. O Muhammad-’Ali! Hear My call from the precincts of My prison, then remember when thou didst stand before the gate, hearkening to the Voice of Him Who conversed upon the Mount when He was established upon the throne of revelation, to the dismay of the divines of Iran who denied the All-Merciful when He came with a clear cause. We bear witness that thou hast attained unto the presence of thy Lord and hast drunk from the Kawthar of immortality from the hands of thy Lord, the Munificent.</p>
<p>Hear in the Persian tongue - verily He speaks as He willeth; none can question His doings and He is the Mighty, the Powerful. Convey to the friends of God in cities and lands greetings and salutations from the Wronged One, and give each the glad tidings of the grace and mercy of God, exalted be His glory. Praise be to God, every seeker hath been blessed with the effulgences of the Daystar of divine bounty. O people of God! We hope that all may be set ablaze with the fire of the love of God - a blaze whose traces shall be manifest from every atom of existence. Every one of the petitions presented hath been heard and answered, and for each an exalted and most holy Tablet hath been revealed and sent down from the heaven of bounty. We beseech God to aid all to drink from the living waters concealed and treasured within the divine utterances. Whosoever attaineth unto this shall not be hindered from the Most Great News by the troubles of the world, the upheavals of nations, the oppression of tyrants, the might of aggressors, the doubts of Persian divines, or the clamor of the ignorant, nor shall they be deprived of the straight path. Blessed are they who drink thereof.</p>
<p>Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the friends in Kaf and Ra and say: Reflect upon that which hath appeared. The former people denied the verses and showed ingratitude for the special bounty. They kindled the fire of tyranny and burnt the pavilion of the glory and grandeur of God’s Cause and rent the veil of sanctity. Glory be to God! In the nights and days they would beseech and implore to attain the presence of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Yet when the dawn of grace broke and the world was illumined by the effulgences of the Daystar of Revelation, they all drew swords and spears against the Goal of the worlds. They were polytheists yet counted themselves among the monotheists.</p>
<p>Say: O ignorant ones! O heedless ones! O oppressors! Your deeds and words on the day of reckoning deprived you of God’s Most Great Name and the ocean of the All-Merciful’s mercy. The oneness of God, exalted be His glory, is not established save through the Manifestation of His Self, the Dawning-Place of His Cause, the Dayspring of His Revelation, and His Representative among creation. In the Dispensation of the Furqan, the Seal of the Prophets (may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake) attained this station. Were any likeness or peer to be found for that Essence of existence and Cause of creation, how could the sanctification of the Creator’s Being from peers and likeness be established? Should anyone attribute this station to any other, they are and shall be accounted as polytheists in God’s sight.</p>
<p>Know with absolute certitude that He was unique in His station, and through Him the oneness of the Divine Essence is proven free from likeness and peer. The letters of the Furqan were created by His Word. By God’s life! They have no share in this most glorious, most exalted station, at whose mere mention the musk of utterance diffuseth its fragrance throughout all creation. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who hath expounded this mighty, this impregnable station. That heedless people count themselves as monotheists, yet in God’s sight they are polytheists. Any fair-minded person would testify that this people are deprived of the deeds, actions and words of the Master of “But for Thee.” Would that they had adorned themselves with the ornament of justice and fairness, attained His presence, and hearkened unto that which is from God. Hear ye the call of the Wronged One and beseech God that all may be illumined and may attain unto true unity. He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. We have made mention of the loved ones of Hasanabad and Bahramabad - a mention that hath sanctified them from the praise of the world and from likeness and similitude. Praised be God, all are remembered and have attained unto His grace. We testify that they have quaffed the choice wine of utterance before the faces of all religions from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Most Merciful. At this moment We make mention of the loved ones of Shahr-i-Babik. O thou who art of Dahj! The True One maketh mention of thee in Bahji, and likewise of the loved ones of Khu. By the life of God! Whosoever hath attained unto the blessed word “Yea”, verily he hath found his place beneath the glance of God, exalted be His glory. His grace hath preceded all things, His mercy hath preceded all things, and His loving-kindness hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. The loved ones of every city and every land have attained unto the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. The Tongue of God, the Lord of all worlds, beareth witness unto this.</p>

<p>He is the Herald from His Most Glorious Horizon</p>
<p>A Book sent down by the King of the Kingdom to those who have believed in God, the Single, the All-Informed. O My loved ones in Alif and Ra, hear My call, for verily it draws you unto a station wherein the Lamp speaks forth light and prosperity for the party of God - those whom the veils of names have not prevented from God, the Lord of all beings, and whom the hosts of those who denied God’s proof and evidence and disbelieved in the Day of Judgment did not frighten.</p>
<p>O My loved ones! We have mentioned you before in various Tablets and We mention you at this time as a grace from God, the Kind, the Generous. Beware lest the clamor and opposition of those who have denied God’s Manifestation and His sovereignty and who have uttered that which caused the angels and the Spirit to lament, and those who appeared before the Face and heard the Call and attained unto what was inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the books of the Prophets and Messengers, make you sorrowful. Say: Beware lest you waste your stations or deprive yourselves of what has been ordained for you in the Most Exalted Paradise by God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Days and nights have passed, yet mention of your names has not appeared before the Throne. Say: Fear God, O companions of Baha, and be not among the silent ones. This is a Day wherein the Tongue of Grandeur has spoken amongst creation and all things have called out. This is a Day the mention of which the Lord of the world and sovereign of nations has sent down in His clear Book. Take it with the hands of power and might, then read it in the nights and days, a command from God, the Ordainer, the Wise.</p>
<p>We beseech God to assist you in that which draws the servants near unto Him, to aid you with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, and to protect you from the evil of the oppressors. Observe the power and sovereignty of God, how He seized the oppressors who shed the blood of His loved ones, denied His proof, and cast aside His clear evidence. Earthquakes have seized the tribes of the earth who broke God’s covenant and His pact and cast aside what they were commanded in His Mighty Book.</p>
<p>We beseech God to strengthen His Majesty the Sultan and protect him from the evil of those whom He raised up through means, wealth, and gold which deluded them, and the resources that made them among the most lost. These denied God’s favor after its descent, consumed people’s wealth unjustly, and imagined themselves to be among the monotheists. The Mother Book bears witness, as it moves in the palace which God has made the seat of His mighty throne, that no party among parties nor any host among hosts aided the Sultan, but My Supreme Pen aided him with an unbreakable covenant. To this testifies what has appeared from My loved ones in all regions, then those who circumambulate the House in this exalted station.</p>
<p>O son of Rafi’! Hear the call of thy Lord, the Most Glorious, then recite among the servants that thy Lord’s Book may draw them near to the horizon from which shone forth the luminary of God’s utterance, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. By My life! Those who consume His bounties yet deny His grace have betrayed Him. Verily, they are among the treacherous in My clear Book.</p>
<p>It behooveth every one who has turned unto God to remember His Lord for having aided him to recognize Him on a Day wherein the clamor of those near unto God was raised. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O God, Lord of Names, and glory be unto Thee, O Lord of all beings! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Glorious Name, Who bore hardships in Thy path and tribulations in Thy love, to assist Thy loved ones in Thy remembrance and praise and enable them to manifest Thy justice in Thy kingdom. O Lord! Thou seest them silent in Thy days, content with Thy decree. They desire naught save the reformation of Thy earth and the extinction of the fire of hatred and animosity in the hearts of Thy creation. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all names. Thou doest what Thou pleasest and ordainest what Thou desirest. There is no God but Thee, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Pen! Remember him who hath been named “The Most Great Victory”, who hath quaffed the choice wine of immortality from the chalice of Thy bounty, and who left his homeland, seeking his most exalted home before the throne of Thy justice, until he arrived at the spot wherefrom was raised My sweetest call and the shrill sound of My Most Exalted Pen. We bear witness that he hath attained unto that which was inscribed by the Pen of Thy loving-kindness in Thy Books and Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. O Lord! Aid them who are related to Thee to arise to serve Thy Cause - they who have turned unto Thee with radiant faces. Verily, Thou art the One Who ruleth through Thy sovereignty, Who dominateth through Thy signs, Who is manifest through Thy proof, Who speaketh through Thy Book, and Who holdeth fast to Thy mighty cord. The Kingdom and the Dominion belong to God, the Strong, the Conquering, the Almighty.</p>
<p>O son of Rafi’! Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thy letter reached the Prison, and thy Lord answered thee with such utterance as hath enraptured the hearts of them who are nigh unto God and the sincere ones. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those who have quaffed the choice wine of Mine utterance from the chalice of My bounty and who have acknowledged that which the Tongue of My grandeur hath spoken from the Kingdom of My wondrous utterance. We have desired to make mention of thine ear on another page. Verily thy Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His binding command, the All-Wise. Enter then the Ancient Paradise, and hearken to that which proceedeth from the Tongue of Power and Might. Verily, this is that which thou hast been promised in every sacred Book. Walk thou in My pleasure and be steadfast in My Cause.</p>

<p>He is God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>This is a letter from the Prisoner to him towards whom His glance was directed ere any among created things knew him, for We concealed the matter and clothed one of the servants in the garment of names, through a wisdom which none hath comprehended save God, the Almighty, the Most High, the Great.</p>
<p>O servant! Hearken unto the Call of God from the holy precincts, the spot wherein the Sun of eternity hath shone forth from the horizon of My Most Glorious Name, that there is none other God but He, the Almighty over what He willeth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise. Say: O people! The dawn of eternity hath broken from the horizon of your Lord, the Most High, and its lights have encompassed the worlds. Fear God, and corrupt not the earth, nor measure the words of God by your own standards. Fear God and be among the God-fearing.</p>
<p>O thou servant who gazeth toward God! Remember those days when thou wert present before the Countenance, and We imparted unto thee secrets veiled by screens and coverings. Thus did thy Lord’s mercy precede thee and thou wert among the successful. Yet hadst thou known in those days what befell Me, thou wouldst have wept and lamented and detached thyself from all the worlds. By God, the Truth! We manifested the Cause with the power of might and authority, and We sacrificed Ourself in the path of God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forebears. All peoples disputed with Me with whatsoever they possessed, and I arose to fulfill the Cause as I was commanded by an Almighty, All-Powerful, Mighty, and Ancient Ordainer.</p>
<p>In every time there hath been manifested through Him the power of God and His grandeur, then the sovereignty of God and His might. He would recite among you that which drew unto him the hearts of the Concourse on High and the angels brought nigh. Say: Were ye to look with a penetrating eye, ye would witness that the Primal Point in the Supreme Horizon now weepeth and waileth by reason of what your hands have wrought, O company of liars! Would that thou hadst been with Us in this Prison and become acquainted with that wherewith none among the servants hath become acquainted, and become possessed of a wondrous insight. Verily those who have not become acquainted with a single letter of the Cause have risen in falsehood and speak according to the promptings of their souls and their desires. By this have they been cursed in this world and the next, yet they perceive it not. Thou beholdest them today as naught but base rabble; nay, thou findest them more contemptible than that, wert thou of them that know. Fie upon them and upon that which their hands have wrought! By My life, they are in manifest error. Stand thou firm in the Cause and arise to praise God, thy Lord, and fear no one. He will protect thee with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, and He hath ever been nigh unto the well-doers. Thus have We imparted unto thee and informed thee and expounded for thee some of what hath befallen Us, as a mercy from Our presence upon thee, that thou mayest be gladdened within thyself by the sweet-scented breezes of holiness wafted upon thee from this luminous and radiant Scene. And the glory which hath shone forth from the daybreak of eternity be upon thee and upon those who have laid fast hold on the Sure Handle and are detached from all else but God. And praise be to God, my Lord and thy Lord and the Lord of all the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Exalted!</p>
<p>This is a Book from the Primal Point unto him who hath believed in God and His signs, who hath attained unto the presence of the Throne and was numbered among the triumphant ones, who hath heard with his own ears the melodies of God, and upon whom the All-Glorious hath dawned with the wonders of His light. Thus hath God’s favor and His proof, then His signs and His evidence, been perfected unto him, that he may stand firm in the Cause and leave all created things behind him, being among the steadfast. Even should he find himself alone in his love for his Lord, such that he witnesseth none throughout all the kingdoms of earth and heaven who hath turned towards Him, he shall not be troubled in his soul, nor shall he be of them that waver.</p>
<p>O servant! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My mercy and My loving-kindness, and forget not My favor. Then call to mind what hath befallen My own Self among the people, that perchance they may find a way unto Him Who is the Spirit. Go forth from that land with the spirit and sweet fragrance of God and with His leave, and shouldst thou find one with hearing ears, impart unto him what the Spirit hath imparted unto thee, that thereby his heart may be quickened and he may be of them that drink from the Kawthar which floweth in truth, whose stream shall never run dry, and shall never cease to flow by the decree of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>If thou shouldst witness the multitude of them that turn away, grieve not, but rather rejoice thereat, for God hath made the recognition of this Youth to be the exclusive privilege of His near servants, though they walk upon its heights. Thus do We make mention unto thee through Our bounty, lest there be effaced from thy heart that which hath been inscribed therein by a hallowed and luminous Pen.</p>
<p>Unite with the loved ones of God, then guard thyself against them who believed not in God from all eternity and were numbered among the idolaters. By God! Through the presence of such as these, every sweet and pleasant breeze is transformed, and from their souls proceedeth that from which all things flee, yea, even the denizens of hell. And shouldst thou find one who turneth away, permit him not to go beyond mentioning two words. Chastise him with the scourges of utterance.</p>
<p>Even if God were to bring you all the proofs of the first and the last, say: O people, fear God! The Youth of God has come to you, reciting unto you from the verses of your Lord, confirming what was sent down before from the dominion of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, the Glorious. He calls you at every moment unto Him and has sacrificed his spirit in the path of God, to such extent that he has not protected himself for less than a moment, as every fair-minded and clear-sighted one can testify. O people, fear God! If you deny these verses by which the Cause of every Prophet before has been established, while claiming belief in any of God’s Messengers, then by God, the denizens of the Supreme Concourse laugh at us, and so too do the realities of all things, were you but to know. The hosts of the unseen and the visible, and every discerning and informed one, mock us. Fear God, O people, and do not do what those before you did, who were among the heedless. When the Sun of the Cause shone forth upon them from the holy horizon, they paid no heed to it, then mocked and said: “Thus did we hear from our forefathers of old.” Say: O people, look not upon the loved ones of God with contempt, for they are the most exalted of creatures in God’s sight, even if in your eyes they appear as the lowliest of servants, were you but to perceive. A single hair of theirs is, in God’s sight, better than those who appear ascetic before men to preserve their leadership, while in secret they commit what even Nimrod did not commit. Thus has the command been sent down from the Pen of the Spirit, that it may be a reminder to Our seeking servants. Spirit and glory be upon you and upon those who have believed in God and have detached themselves from all else but Him.</p>

<p>He is the Mighty!</p>
<p>This is an epistle from this servant to the loved ones of God who have been afflicted with a separation the like of which no eye hath ever witnessed and no parallel hath appeared in creation - such that their hearts were consumed, their souls melted, their breasts were constricted, their eyes wept and their tears flowed, whereby signs of agitation appeared in the pillars of the mighty throne. Say: By God, the spirit hath departed from all things, every matter hath been overturned, all who are in the heavens and earth were shaken, joy hath been lifted from all things, and the Word of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent, hath been scattered by what the hands of the idolaters have wrought against God and His loved ones. Say: The sun hath been darkened from the horizon of Iraq and the moon hath been eclipsed by what these oppressors have done. Say: The eyes of the maidens have been blinded, the dwellers of the chambers have lamented, the temples of luminous holiness have fallen to the dust, the garments of the people of the Kingdom have been rent, and the realities of the denizens of the Realm Above have cried out in this great terror. The eyes of the people of the kingdom have never witnessed the like of what befell in those days the countenances of sublime holiness. Say: O people of the earth! By God, were ye to perceive in yourselves even as a mustard seed, ye would cast black dust upon your faces and fall prostrate upon the earth for all eternity. Alas for you, O company of the wretched, for what your hands have wrought, your tongues have uttered, and your hearts have imagined, until ye drove from His homeland this Bird that dwelt therein by the command of the All-Wise, the All-Knowing. Say: By God, the leaf of Paradise hath yellowed by what ye have done to servants who have not associated partners with God for even the twinkling of an eye. Say: The branches of the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary have been broken by your turning away from the Beauty of God after He shone forth upon you like the Spirit from an ancient and holy horizon. The boughs of the Furthermost Tree have been demolished by what befell the Word of God, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
<p>O City of God! Can I perceive anything within thee after the departure of that radiant and resplendent Sun? Nay, by God! I can neither perceive thee nor behold the beauty of Him through Whom we were blessed with the fruits of nearness every morn and eve. Alas! Alas! The hearts of the people of eternity have been pierced by the arrows of the idolaters. By God, O City! We take no delight in thy blossoms or thy flowers in any springtime, after we no longer behold within thee the rose of glory from the Beauty of the Beloved. Therefore, O City of God, inform thy people that the Bird hath taken flight - the Bird whose departure or death was their only desire. This hath been decreed by the Pen of holiness and wisdom. Remain ye, then, in your dwellings and rest upon your seats, for ye have attained what ye desired and achieved all that ye sought. Be ye of them that are at ease. Know with certainty that ye shall never again hear the melodies of God, never draw nigh unto a manifest meeting with Him, never witness the beauty of God among you, and never shall the words of God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Gracious, be cast upon you. Your seats have been enlarged by the departure of the Bird. Be at ease, then, O company of the heedless! Then there calleth out from the throne of the spirit a holy and wondrous countenance: “Blessed are ye, O company of the loved ones, for your patience in this great terror, for hearkening to the counsel of your Lord, and for your steadfastness in a Cause that hath caused the frames of the concourse of the exalted ones to melt away. God shall soon gather you thereby into a holy and luminous seat, as a reward for your patience. How excellent is the reward of the patient ones!”</p>

<p>O Afnan! Upon thee be My Baha and My loving-kindness. Thy letter reached the Wronged One and the Glorious One presented it. When completed, My Most Exalted Pen was moved to make mention of thee and of that which thou didst desire from the sea of thy Lord’s bounty, the Mighty, the Powerful. Thou didst hear the Call in the earliest days and didst respond to thy Lord when mankind was in manifest error. Thou didst turn to the Horizon when most of the servants turned away. This is from thy Lord’s favor upon thee. Be thankful and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Desire of the world, and glory be unto Thee, O Beloved of them that have recognized Thee! I testify that Thou hast appeared and manifested Thy Cause, and guided the people to Thy straight Path, and remembered me while Thou wert in the Most Great Prison - a mercy from Thee unto Thy Afnan. Verily, Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful. My soul be a sacrifice for Thy bounty, and my spirit be a sacrifice for Thy grace, O Thou Who art the Adored One of those in the heavens and on earth.” We have mentioned thee before with a mention before which all mention bows down, and We mention thee at this time in this perspicuous Tablet. Blessed is the Afnan who hath held fast unto the Divine Lote-Tree, recognized its grace and station, and spoken in its praise on this Day whereon its rustling and its call have been raised in this glorious and wondrous Station. We wish at this moment to change from the eloquent tongue to the luminous one. Verily thy Lord doeth what He pleaseth and ordaineth what He willeth. He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>In the name of the Peerless Friend! Today all things circle round the prison of ’Akka and utter a word which none save God, exalted be His glory, hath comprehended or will comprehend except by His command and leave. The Wronged One calleth out from the horizon of tribulation to the peoples of earth and heaven, and remindeth them through divine verses that they might attain unto fruits whose traces and mention shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. The ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance hath waves, and within it are concealed and hidden pearls of wisdom and mysteries. Blessed are they who are endowed with hearing and sight and have attained unto witnessing and hearkening. By the Sun of Truth! That which is lost today can never be regained, even as it is impossible to find a partner for the Lord. The loved ones of God must arise with complete dedication to assist the Cause, especially the Afnans of the Blessed Tree who in this Most Great Revelation have been adorned with the ornament of distinction and kinship, that they might protect the heedless servants from the vain imaginings of the former people. He is the Counselor and He is the Kind One.</p>
<p>And regarding what thou didst mention about the journey of the leaf of the Tree, the wife of the honored Afnan, upon them both be My Baha and loving-kindness, the luminary of permission hath dawned from the horizon of will. However, this is contingent upon the requirements of wisdom and expediency, O honored Afnan, upon thee be My Glory. O Afnan, upon thee be My loving-kindness. The smoke of vain imaginings and the dust of idle fancies have prevented the world from beholding. The True One, exalted be His glory, hath come for meeting, presence, and the bestowal of grace, but the divines and theologians of Persia became a barrier, preventing eyes from beholding and ears from hearing. This prevention from Persia hath influenced these lands as well. Beseech ye the True One to manifest that which shall be the cause of the world’s salvation and the deliverance of nations. Two Tablets, in response to thy request, have been sent down from the heaven of the favors of the Lord of all beings. Take copies thereof and deliver them, that perchance they may be illumined by the lights of the Day-Star of utterance which hath shone forth from the horizon of the divine Tablet, and may remain firm and steadfast in the Cause of God. Blessed is he who hath attained unto My Tablet in My days and hath drunk therefrom the Kawthar of Mine utterance. He is assuredly among those who are nigh unto God in His Book, the Lord of all worlds. Convey greetings from this Wronged One to all the kindred, and give them the glad-tidings of the effulgences of the Day-Star of grace which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of justice. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid them and assist them and make them of those whom the might of the world hath not hindered from turning unto God, the Lord of the Ancient Days - they who heard and turned and responded in days wherein the limbs of the heedless trembled and the hearts of the doubtful were troubled. The Command is in God’s hands, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have attained unto this momentous News.</p>
<p>Make mention, on behalf of this Wronged One, of the followers of Zoroaster, upon them be God’s loving-kindness. God willing, may they drink from the chalices of utterance of the Goal of all worlds that were previously sent, that which shall free and detach their hearts from all else save God. O Afnan! This blessed verse hath shone forth like the sun from the horizon of the Book: “Blessed is he who hath arisen from his place, cast away all else save Him, and hastened unto the Most Great Ocean and entered therein through His Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous.” Blessed is the tongue that hath uttered this most exalted Word and this most great Sign, and hath received its portion from the ocean of its meanings. He is assuredly among the triumphant ones in the presence of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>O thou who gazest toward My horizon and drinkest the choice wine of My utterance! Hear My call from the horizon of tribulation. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Lord of all beings, Who is established upon the throne. He doeth what He willeth. The oppression of the oppressors hath not hindered Him, nor hath the might of the aggressors frightened Him. He hath manifested Himself and stood before all faces, calling out with the most exalted call: “The Promise hath come, and this is He Whom the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds, did herald!” This is the Day whereon the Hidden One hath appeared, and through His appearance the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing hath been raised in the All-Highest Paradise, and the murmuring of the Living Waters hath been heard in the Most Exalted Garden, and the Dove of the Cause hath warbled upon the highest branches. The Kingdom is God’s, the Possessor of the Day of Judgment. Through Him did the Point speak and give glad tidings unto the servants, and the mysteries of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, were revealed. Verily, they who have been prevented from turning unto Him shall have no portion of the Most Great Ocean which hath surged before the faces of the nations and hath brought forth the pearls of wisdom and utterance from hidden shells, as a bounty from His presence. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and the servant present before His Face hath presented it. We have revealed for thee that which hath caused rivers of remembrance and praise to flow from the solid rock. Blessed is he who hath turned, and taken, and drunk in My Name, the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth. We mentioned thee before in luminous Tablets as a mercy from Our presence upon thee and upon His believing servants.</p>
<p>O Nabil-i-Akbar! Upon thee be My glory! We have desired naught save to extinguish the fire of rancor and hatred, and to reform the souls of all who dwell in the realm of creation. To this testifieth all things and this perspicuous Book. The world hath been perfumed by the breezes of revelation, yet the people are afflicted with a grievous cold. They behold the light yet deny it, and hear the verses yet turn away from them. Verily they are in manifest loss. Among the people is he who believed, then denied, and wrongfully consumed the property of others, uttering that which none before him had ever uttered. Thy Lord is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He cast the truth behind him when he followed the people, and through wealth was kept back from his ultimate end. Thus did his soul entice him. Verily, he is among the wrongdoers. He cast aside righteousness and piety when he was consumed by the fire of greed and passion. He hath committed that which hath caused every discerning soul to lament. Will his wealth profit him? Nay, by the Self of God, the All-Sufficient, the Most High! Will what he possesseth among the people avail him? Nay, by God’s compelling and wise decree!</p>
<p>Say: O my God, my God! I beseech Thee by the lights of the dawn of Thy Manifestation, and by what was hidden and treasured in the ocean of Thy bounty and bestowal, and by Thy power that hath encompassed all created things, and by Thy sovereignty before which all possibilities have bowed down, and by Thy Most Great Name which hath caused the hearts of the nations to tremble, to assist Thy loved ones to be trustworthy and religious, lest there appear from them that which beseemeth not Thy days and Thy Manifestation. O Lord! Thou beholdest them clinging to Thy cord - disappoint them not of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones among Thy sincere ones. O Lord! Adorn them with the ornament of righteousness, then preserve them from the evil of self and passion. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>In the Persian tongue I make mention: in these days, heedless souls have, in their greed for wealth, turned away from the Truth. To such a degree are they aflame with the fire of avarice and desire that the pen is powerless to describe it. For a paltry sum they have turned their eyes away from the Euphrates of mercy and have rent asunder the veil of trustworthiness. They have committed that which hath caused the very essence of truth to weep. Out of love for His servants and creatures, beseech God that He may aid all to achieve what befitteth human dignity and grant them success in turning from estrangement to acceptance, from greed to detachment, and from treachery to trustworthiness. Verily thy Lord is the Ever-Forgiving.</p>
<p>That which is essential today in that land is the unity of the friends of God, as well as the observance of wisdom. Say: Know ye with clear certainty that corruption and contention have not been and are not worthy of the people of truth in this Revelation. That which hath outwardly been bestowed upon the kings and rulers - opposition to them is in no wise permitted. God hath ever been observant of the hearts of His servants, and His purpose is that they become enkindled with the fire of divine love and illumined by the light of His knowledge.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that patience, tranquility and detachment have reached such a degree that the friends allow themselves to be slain but do not slay. That which occurred in Ishqabad is the cause of joy and gladness to the Ancient Beauty, for the friends did not retaliate and chose martyrdom in the path of God.</p>
<p>In any case, thou must strive to reform and refine souls. Make mention of the friends of that land on behalf of this Wronged One and give them the glad tidings of God’s grace and mercy. We beseech Him to aid all to perform such deeds as will diffuse the fragrance of His good pleasure and illumine the horizons of all lands. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Munificent. The Light shining from the horizon of the Will of God be upon thee and upon those who hearken to thy words concerning this momentous News.</p>

<p>O Ali, upon thee be my Glory! The Most Exalted Summit, the Utmost Goal, and the Supreme Horizon is a station whereof the Mother Book doth testify and the Preserved Tablet doth make mention, and wherein He Who conversed upon Sinai is established upon the throne of Revelation. This is the Call for the hearing of which the ears of the world were created. Blessed is the soul whom neither the vicissitudes of the world nor the ascendancy of the nations did hinder or deprive from the Most Great Name. Today all things are adorned and illumined with the lights of true unity. Beseech ye God that He withhold not His servants from His bounties and deprive not creation from the manifestation of His generosity. The glance of His loving-kindness hath ever been and continueth to be directed towards His loved ones - they who are detached from all else save God, who hold fast unto the cord of divine love, who act according to that which hath been sent down in the Book, and who are so steadfast in the Cause that the deniers, the barking ones, and the deceivers find no occasion to speak. They dwell beneath the shadow of the standard “Verily I am God” and are quickened and gladdened by the shrill voice of the Most Exalted Pen. These are the servants whose attributes have been recorded in the divine Books of the past and present. They have quaffed from the Kawthar of utterance and received their portion of the sealed wine. The clamor of the world is to them more insignificant than the buzzing of a fly. They speak for God’s sake and unto Him do they return.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, O Ali, for having turned towards Him, migrated, and directed thy steps until thou didst attain a place wherein was heard the rustling of the Blessed Tree, the flowing of the waters of oneness, and the whistling of the eternal winds. Verily He strengthened thee and enabled thee to attain His presence, to stand before His gate, to hearken unto His call and to behold His horizon. Give thanks unto God, by night and by day, for this bounty wherewith thou, thy son, and those with thee have been favored in the Most Great Prison. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The letters of the people of Qaf which were sent to thee before and after were presented by this servant before His presence and were honored to be heard. We have remembered them and do remember them and give them glad tidings of Our loving-kindness and mercy, and We counsel them with that which beseemeth them who are nigh unto God in these days of God, the Beloved of the mystics. We make mention of them through Our loving-kindness and remind them of Our verses and show them the waves of the ocean of Our generosity and the effulgences of the lights of the sun of Our grace. Verily thy Lord is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Thus have We sent down the bounty of Our recognition, the table of Our utterance, and the fruits of the Tree of Our loving-kindness. By the life of God! The Wronged One remembereth His loved ones at all times and commandeth them to that which will manifest their stations among the peoples of the world. O people of God! Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, through wisdom and utterance, and through the hosts of goodly deeds and character, that the fragrance of His good-pleasure may be diffused therefrom. And I am the All-Knowing Expositor. At dawn We remember the righteous ones, and neither by night nor by day hath the Pen of the All-Choosing ceased to move. Blessed is the servant who is attracted by its shrill voice and turneth with his heart to its horizon, and woe unto every heedless doubter.</p>
<p>Mention hath been made of Samandar, upon him be the glory of God, and of Qasim and Muhammad, upon both of them be the glory of God. Their letters were previously received, and all the names mentioned therein were adorned with the remembrance of God, the grace of God, and the bounty of God. We beseech God to aid them to preserve this most exalted remembrance and most glorious station. We make mention in this station of the wife of him who was named ’Abdu’l-Husayn in a Tablet that shone forth from the horizon of the sun of her Lord’s loving-kindness, the Mighty, the Wondrous. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for her that which beseemeth His generosity and grace. Verily, nothing can frustrate Him, and no affair can prevent Him. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. We make mention of My other handmaiden, the sister of Lutf-’Ali, who hath turned unto God and attained His presence. We give her the glad-tidings that My Pen hath been moved to make mention of her–the Pen through whose movement all created things were stirred and all existing things were turned towards the lights of My luminous and shining countenance. We make mention, too, of My other handmaiden, the wife of the late ’Abdu’s-Samad who believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We beseech God, exalted be He, to forgive them, to absolve them of their misdeeds, and to cause them to enter the most exalted Paradise–the station wherein the atoms cry out: “Enter ye, enter ye, O people of Baha and companions of the Crimson Ark! We long to meet you, to remember you, to praise you, to arise to serve you, and to circle round about you. God hath created us to serve you all. Enter ye, enter ye; enter ye all, enter ye all, in peace from God and mercy from His presence and grace from His side and light from His realm. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones, the God of all who are in the heavens and the earth, the Object of the hearts of them that know, and the Beloved of the hearts of them that long for Him.” The glory that shineth resplendent from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens, who turned unto Him and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the seen and the unseen!”</p>

Verily thy Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The treasures of meaning and utterance cannot equal the remembrance of thy Lord - to this thy Lord, the All-Merciful, beareth witness. He, verily, is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed. We made mention of thee before in words wherewith all things have spoken - sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Lord of all worlds. The fragrance of the garment of utterance hath been diffused from the Mount of Knowledge, and the Divine Lote-Tree calleth out with the loudest voice, yet most of the people remain heedless. They who are heedless this day of My choice sealed wine - these have no portion in God’s Book, the Mighty, the All-Praised. The Most Exalted Pen hath moved to make mention of you in numerous Tablets. He remembereth him who remembereth Him, and desireth him who desireth Him - a grace from His presence, for He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath turned toward My horizon, who hath drunk the choice wine of My loving-kindness, who hath soared in the atmosphere of My love, who hath responded when My call was raised, who hath spoken My praise among My servants, who hath held fast to the cord of My grace and clung to the hem of the robe of My generosity - he who hath been named Hussein in My writings and dominions. He is of the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark, inscribed in a Tablet which none hath beheld save My All-Knowing Self. Say: The first utterance which shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of mystic knowledge from the All-Merciful is upon thee, O thou who hast turned toward the Most Glorious Horizon, who art attracted by the screaking of the Most Exalted Pen, who art oriented toward the lights of the Countenance when it appeared after the passing away of all things. Thou art he whom the vicissitudes of the world did not prevent from the Ancient Being, nor did the clamor of nations from His binding Cause. Upon thee be the glory of God and His mercy, the peace of God and His grace. Blessed art thou for that which the Most Exalted Pen hath testified in thy favor, and for having attained the mention of thy Lord, the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven. Thou art he who hath drunk My choice sealed wine through My Self-Subsisting Name on a day wherein the servants turned away from God, the Lord of all worlds. Thou hast attained that which was hidden in knowledge and recorded in the Books of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>We bear witness that thou didst stand firm in the Cause when the Hour arose, such that neither the Hour and its portents frightened thee, nor the convulsion of the earth and its quaking. Thou wert steadfast in thy Lord’s Cause and didst speak His most great verses among all peoples. Blessed art thou, and joy be unto thee, and unto them that love thee, and unto them that make mention of thee according to what hath been sent down from the Tongue of Grandeur in this mighty, this impregnable station.</p>
<p>O God, my God! Lord of the seen and unseen, and Sovereign of existence! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy bounty and by Thy chosen ones and pure ones whom nothing whatsoever hath hindered from turning toward Thee - who stood before the faces of the world and declared: “We believe in the Dayspring of verses and the Manifestation of clear tokens Who hath come with a brilliant light and a mighty sovereignty” - to ordain for Thy loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Thee. Then forgive them through Thy grace and generosity. Thou art He by Whose command the ocean of forgiveness surged in the contingent world and the fragrance of Thy loving-kindness wafted among all religions. Then ordain for Thy loved ones the good of the hereafter and of the former days. Verily Thou art the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust below. There is none other God but Thee, the Compassionate, the Generous. Thou art the Ancient Bestower.</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned to God! Thou hast ever been and art remembered. The Wronged One’s gaze hath been and is fixed upon thee. Mention of him who ascended unto God hath been revealed in diverse Tablets, including in a Tablet which was revealed from the heaven of God’s Will specifically for His Holiness ’Aba, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, and was sent through Ibn-i-Asdaq, upon him be my Baha. Likewise was he mentioned in other Tablets, and in this blessed Tablet too, wherein the Sun of loving-kindness shineth resplendent from its horizon. Convey to all the kindred My greetings from the Wronged One and remind them of the verses of God. Great is this Day. Blessed is he who hath in this divine Day attained unto the outpourings of the true Bestower. Convey greetings to the people of Baha and say: O people of God! This is your Day. Know ye its worth, recognize its station, and arise as beseemeth you. Fear not the moving bubbles that appear briefly upon fetid waters, for ere long all shall return to their abode. This Wronged One and His loved ones must pray for all, that perchance the hidden rancor in the hearts of the followers of religions may be stilled and the light of harmony and unity may shine forth from the heaven of hearts. This is the purpose of the Wronged One, to which My soul, the Self-Subsisting, doth testify.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! We beseech God to strengthen thee through this Name in His Cause, that thou mayest be as a speaking standard and an upright banner raised high. However, wisdom is called for - wisdom in this day taketh precedence over most deeds. Blessed is he who holdeth fast unto it, and woe betide the heedless. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those whom neither the might of the wicked nor the ranks of the idolaters could weaken. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

The Supreme Pen hath testified for thee in this Most Glorious Station that thou hast sought the ultimate goal and the highest aim - the station wherein the call was raised from the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing before the faces of all peoples: “God, there is no God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” By its call were all things attracted, and by its manifestation did all names bow down, and by its mention were agitated the hearts of the polytheists who denied God and cast aside His Book out of their hatred for Him Who conversed on Sinai, Who is established upon the throne of Revelation and speaketh with the most exalted call: “By God, the Truth! He hath come at Whose appearance the eyes of those near unto God were solaced.”</p>
<p>Blessed art thou for having turned toward the Dayspring of Revelation and the Source of Inspiration whereby the ocean of knowledge surged in the contingent world and the call was raised from all directions: “He Who is the Lord of Names and Attributes hath come with the kingdom of signs.” Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>I bear witness that thou hast heard the scratching of My Pen and hast attained unto My traces and hast drunk the choice wine of revelation from the hand of My bounty in days wherein the fire of oppression and corruption was kindled among the servants who violated the Covenant and Testament of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O Rahmat! We beseech God to send down through thee mercy upon His servants there. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. When the Kawthar of My utterance took hold of thee and thou didst attain the choice wine of My knowledge, say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! Thine is the munificence and the glory, and Thine the grace and bounty, for Thou hast given me to drink, from the hands of Thy favor, the Kawthar of Thy grace, and hast ordained for me the blessing of recognition from Thy Most Exalted Pen in Thy Book wherein that which is revealed therein shall never be erased nor altered, throughout the duration of Thy sovereignty and Thy kingdom.</p>
<p>“O my Lord! I testify to the oneness of Thy Being and the sanctity of Thy Self, and that Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. The tyrants of the earth cannot prevent what Thou hast willed by Thy sovereignty, nor can the pharaohs of the lands prevent what Thy Will hath desired.</p>
<p>“O my Lord! Thou seest the poor one who hath hastened from his homeland to the ocean of Thy riches, and whom the hand of Thy bounty hath caused to enter the pavilions of Thy grandeur. I beseech Thee, O Thou Who hast illumined the horizons with the light of Thy manifestation and hast aided the servants to draw nigh unto the depths of the ocean of Thy oneness through the hidden pearls in the shells of Thy protection, to open before my face and the faces of Thy loved ones the doors of Thy generosity. Then grant us the blessing of attaining Thy presence time and again. Thou art He before Whose power all created things have bowed down, and before the dawning of the Day-Star of Thy Cause all contingent things have submitted. Ordain for us the good of this world and the world to come.</p>
<p>“O my Lord! Withhold not me and Thy loved ones in Banab from the waves of the ocean of Thy knowledge, nor from the effulgences of the sun of Thy mercy. Write down for us from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will draw us nigh unto the court of Thy might and the carpet of Thy presence. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Most Generous.”</p>
<p>Mention is made at this time of the friends in Bunab, both men and women. Praise be to God, they have attained unto acceptance and are illumined by the light of recognition. This is the Day of God and the Covenant is His Covenant. The waves of the ocean of bounty are manifest before all faces. Beseech ye God that He withhold not His servants from this grace, nor deprive them of this endless bestowal. The True One, exalted be His glory, is seated upon the throne of ‘He doeth what He willeth’ through His Most Great Name, and inviteth all to His eternal favor and everlasting generosity. Gladden ye hearts with His remembrance, then hasten with your hearts toward His direction. By the Sun of Truth, there hath appeared from God’s infinite grace that which hath had no likeness or equal. Take ye the chalice of bounty in His Name, then drink therefrom with wisdom and utterance, in defiance of every remote oppressor through whom the fire of hatred hath been kindled amongst mankind, and the realities of all things have cried out: “The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.” O people of Bonab! Praise ye the Desired One of the world, Who hath aided you to turn unto Him, to mention Him, and to recognize His sacred Being, and Who hath, in this night when darkness hath encompassed the world, illumined you with the light of utterance. The glory from Us be upon you, upon your first and your last, your outward and your inward selves, and the mercy of God and His blessings.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, greatness and power!</p>
<p>Praise be to God who hath made knowledge a lamp and wisdom a light, and hath linked it to godliness through His word “Fear God: God will teach you”, whereby He hath made clear the proof and revealed the path. Through it the dove of utterance warbleth upon the branch of divine knowledge - verily there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. Praise be to God who hath preserved it through wisdom and commanded all to follow it. Through it the foundation of existence was established, the clouds of bounty rained down, and His all-pervading Cause appeared to all who witness and are witnessed. Exalted is His Cause, exalted His sovereignty, and exalted His greatness, His power and His might. He hath sent forth the Messengers and revealed the Books to manifest His grace and demonstrate His bounty and generosity. He hath made them the dawning-places of His revelation, the daysprings of His Cause, the manifestations of His Self and the sources of His wisdom, until the Books were sealed with the Qur’an and the Messengers with the Lord of all possibility, through whom the earth and heaven smiled and the gate of bestowal was opened to all in the kingdom of names. Upon Him be God’s peace, blessings, mercy, favors, glory, splendor, bounty and grace, and upon His family and companions through whom the horizons of the heaven of divine knowledge shone forth upon all in the realm of possibility, the fragrance of unity was diffused among all religions, and through whom God’s power and sovereignty were made manifest and the standards of His Cause were raised among His creation. These are honored servants who speak not until He hath spoken and who act by His command.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter which diffused the fragrance of love for the Best-Beloved of the worlds caused the breast to expand and adorned the heart with boundless joy. After its reading and perusal it was presented before His presence. He said: “O thou who holdest fast to the cord of divine knowledge! Heedlessness hath laid waste the world. The foundation of the word of unity is observed to be shaken through the dissension and cawing of the polytheists. The banner of God’s word hath been raised and planted at the highest station of the world for thirteen hundred years, yet now it hath inclined due to the transgressions of evil and wayward souls. By the life of God! These things have occurred only through the heedlessness and disobedience of the servants. Beseech ye God to assist the people of unity and purify them with the water of repentance and return, that all may turn with perfect unity and without hypocrisy toward the supreme horizon and seek relief from God, glorified be His majesty. He is the Generous One Who heareth and answereth the cry of the oppressed. Glory be to God! Until now they have not discovered the cause of these new developments. We beseech God to assist the distinguished divines to that which preserveth the radiant Faith. Every soul must arise to redress what hath been lost, for if this matter is, God forbid, delayed, the beasts of prey will seize and plunder what remaineth. This Wronged One beseecheth God, glorified be His majesty, to assist thee in that which causeth the fragrance of eternity to be diffused. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee, then give thanks unto thy Lord, the Generous. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for thee from His Most Exalted Pen the good of the hereafter and of this world, and to make thee so firm, steadfast and upright that thou shalt see in existence naught save His manifestation, His signs, His power and His might.” We seal these words with the remembrance of God’s loved ones and chosen ones, that the fragrance of sincerity unto God, the Lord of all worlds, may be diffused thereby.</p>
<p>The End</p>
<p>God is witness and testimony that from the beginning of the ignition of the fire of oppression in those regions and other places, they beseeched God in utter helplessness to extinguish it, and they said: O servant present, this word will be answered only when people awaken from the sleep of heedlessness and arise to remedy what has passed. In any case, for the generous ones no task is difficult. Through God’s grace and favor we have been and are hopeful that He will not deprive His servants of His infinite favors. Verily He has power over all things. That honored one has always been and continues to be remembered, and it is hoped that this favor will be the cause and means of exaltation, ascendancy and elevation. This is not difficult for God.</p>
<p>Regarding the journey of Aqa Mirza ’Ali-Muhammad, upon him be God’s peace, they said the choice rests with that honored one himself - whenever wisdom requires it, he may proceed. Conveying mention and praise to the friends in that land is entrusted to that honored one. Peace be upon you and upon God’s righteous servants.</p>
<p>The watermelon seeds that you sent arrived, and after your letter, permission for another steamer was granted to Haji, the emigrant traveler. This favor encompasses that honored one and him, for he is present by proxy and has attained representation and been blessed with pilgrimage. All this is from God’s grace and mercy unto the Guardian of the hopeful ones and the Guardian of the sincere ones.</p>

<p>[…] He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath adorned the world with the light that hath shone forth, risen, gleamed and flashed from the horizon of Hijaz, and hath caused all in the regions to speak and proclaim that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been sanctified beyond mention and utterance, and exalted above the comprehension of all created things. Every mention boweth down before the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of His mention, and every understanding shrinketh before the dawning of the light of His knowledge. Glorified be His greatness, exalted be His might, and sublime be His station! He it is Who sent forth the Messengers to exalt His Word, to manifest His commandments, to establish His laws, and revealed unto them the Books for the guidance of His servants and creation, until it culminated in the Book that distinguished between truth and falsehood, which was named the Furqan in the kingdom of utterance, and was made an enduring testimony for all who dwell in the realm of possibility. And the prayer that shineth from the horizon of the heaven of God’s loving-kindness, and the peace that gleameth from the kingdom of grace and bounty, be upon him whom God made a support for those near unto Him, a sovereign for the monotheists, a shield for the sincere ones, a fortress for those who seek refuge, and a mercy to the worlds. Were it not for him, the decree of Divine Unity would not have been revealed and the standard of detachment would not have been raised. And upon his family and companions who conquered the lands through his name, aided the Cause of God by his command, and strove in the path of God with true striving until most lands were illumined with the light of unity.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all created things and in Whose right hand are the reins of all possible things! I beseech Thee by Him through Whom Thou didst adorn the firmaments of the heavens of Thy glory and illumined the hearts of those near unto Thee among Thy creation, to send down from the clouds of Thy generosity that which will tranquilize the hearts of Thy servants and the hearts of those who have turned toward the horizon of Thy grace and favors. Thou seest, O my God, how tribulation and adversity have encompassed Thy dwellings and Thy lands. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne, the mysteries of Thy Book, the Manifestations of Thy revelation, the Daysprings of Thy knowledge, the Sun of Thy grace, and the Ocean of Thy knowledge which surgeth before the eyes of the world, O Thou Who art the Lord of eternity, to aid Thy loved ones and chosen ones, then preserve them, O my God, from the evil of those who have risen to spread corruption and have kindled fire in the lands. O my God, Thou seest how the idolaters have encompassed those who believe in Thy unity; do Thou preserve them through Thy bounty and the arms of Thy power and might. There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant received your letter and was gladdened by your mention and praise, and by what shone forth from the horizon of your sincerity toward God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all worlds. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist you and aid you in His remembrance and to preserve you from the evil of every oppressor who hath violated God’s Covenant and His Testament.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding Jinab-i-Haji Ali Baba, upon him be God’s grace and bounty, praise be to God he has drunk from the cup of grace. Though it be but a small portion, the light that has appeared is itself evidence of the grace of God, exalted be His glory, and will surely show the straight path. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, and hope that He will assist him to turn with his whole being to the Most Sublime Horizon and the Supreme Summit. His petition was presented before the Divine Presence and a most mighty and holy Tablet was graciously revealed in reply, written in this servant’s hand. I beseech God to confirm him and enable him to achieve that which He loves and is pleased with, for if one attains today to this supreme bounty, one has attained to all bounties - that is, those bounties that have existed from the beginning that has no beginning and will exist to the end that has no end. And if, God forbid, one remains heedless of this Cause, one will be deprived of all good things.</p>
<p>That the aforementioned personage attained to the mention of the Divine Purpose in his early days is clear evidence of the happiness stored within him, for many souls in distant lands have not yet attained to such special mention. Blessed be he!</p>
<p>As to what was written regarding the upheavals in that land, these are all fruits that have appeared from the trees of the deeds of the heedless ones. The enemies have surrounded the white faith [the Baha’i Faith] from all directions, yet no one perceives what is the cause and reason. May God grant justice that perchance they may arise to redress what has been lost.</p>
<p>Regarding movement, stillness and similar matters, these are contingent upon consultation. Whatever emerges from consultation, let it be acted upon with trust in God. After this matter was presented in the Most Holy Presence, it was stated: “At present there is no preference for movement. Verily God is with the patient and those who trust in Him.” End quote.</p>
<p>I convey greetings to all the friends and masters, and I beseech confirmation for all. Peace be upon you and upon God’s sincere servants.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Glory!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who has guided us and you to His straight path, Who has taught us that which preserves us from the accursed Satan, Who has aided us in His remembrance and praise, and Who has made known to us that which, through His abundant grace, draws us nigh unto Him. And blessings and peace be upon His Messengers and His chosen ones, through whom the rains were caused to fall, the fruits appeared, mysteries were unveiled, standards were raised, and banners were planted, and upon those who followed them with pure hearts for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>And now, your letter, which was in truth a book adorned with the ornament of love and affection, illumined the tablet of the heart and strengthened the realm of vision. Praise be to God that through the confirmation of the true Gardener, fine and desirable saplings have been planted. If their water depends upon the discussions and consultations of assemblies, it would be difficult to observe any fruit. However, God willing, there shall fall from the heaven of grace and the cloud of justice abundant and continuous rains without delay or hindrance. God willing, may they be successful in all matters. The Ancient Beauty declares that all the friends must hearken with the ears of heart and soul to the counsels of the Wronged One and act according to them. The adornment of the world hath ever been, and will continue to be, the wisdom revealed in God’s Book, and the adornment of man is through goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. For wisdom, various meanings have been recorded and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books of the Prophets. This is that wisdom of which He saith: “Whoso hath been given wisdom hath been given abundant good.” All must fix their gaze upon it and hold fast unto it. It is the lamp of the world and the guide of nations. Were this station to be fully described, time and space would not suffice. Wisdom is the fear of God, exalted be His glory. However, today that which is beloved is to guard the tongue from that which causeth clamor to be raised, and to consort with all men with kindliness.</p>
<p>O ’Ali, O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! Convey My greetings to the friends and say: God willing, may ye be dawning-places for the reformation of the world, adorned with praiseworthy characteristics, and in all conditions hold fast unto wisdom and depart not from it in your rising up, your sitting down, your speech, and your association with others. Wisdom is that by which man becometh beloved by all. O ’Ali! Care must be taken, for utterances of which people today are bereft of understanding and heedless have been and will be the cause of harm. Concealment is better than revelation, and silence is preferable to speech. Say to the loved ones: Hearken unto the counsels of the Wronged One and preserve them in such wise that forgetfulness may not seize them. Praise be to God that ye are enriched by the divine bounty and are occupied with His remembrance and praise.</p>
<p>From the blessed passages, Grace and Mercy are manifest and evident. No mention of this evanescent one is needed or necessary. Your letter was presented, and verily it caused joy and smiles to appear. It was as if a herald from the realm of freedom came unto the prison and gladdened its inhabitants with fresh fragrances and new utterances, offering the cup of joy and bestowing the chalice of delight. O how pleasant is your time, how pleasant your station, how pleasant your words, and how pleasant your deeds! God willing, may pleasantness be upon pleasantness, and joy upon joy.</p>
<p>However, regarding the wisdom that was mentioned, all the friends of God must truly hold fast unto it, for the people are unaware and heedless of the purpose. Therefore, one must speak words that bring tranquility to the servants and likewise cleave unto deeds that engender love.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote concerning the honored Mr.&nbsp;Siyyid Yahya, the spiritual companion Mr.&nbsp;Muhammad, and the beloved of the heart Mr.&nbsp;Ali Akbar, upon them be the Glory of God - all are gazing toward the direction of grace. These details were presented. All were previously mentioned, and after the presentation of this passage, each one was individually mentioned and showered with kindness. God willing, may all be assisted and succeed in that which God loves in all conditions. This evanescent one conveys greetings and praise to each one. God the All-Knowing is witness and testifier that they are before mine eyes. I beseech His exalted Self to send down upon your honor and upon them that which brings joy to the eyes and gladdens the hearts. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Haji Muhammad Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God, it was presented and a blessed tablet in this servant’s handwriting was sent specifically for him. May God, exalted be His glory, guide those intervening souls who are the cause of obstruction and prevention. This evanescent one sends greetings to Mulla Ali, upon him be the Glory of God. God willing, may they be successful, and likewise to the aforementioned one and those with him.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>O ’Ali! We have heard your call and have become aware of what lies within your heart of the love of God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds. With Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth; not an atom’s weight of the deeds of all created things escapes His knowledge. With Him is the mystery of the heavens and what is treasured in the vaults of earth, and what lies within the hearts of His unified servants. We have been with you at all times. At times you turned to holy glances when the attraction of the Cause took hold of you from the presence of One mighty and powerful, and at times you were heedless - such is the nature of man. Grieve not over this, but be in manifest joy, for your Lord has accepted what you have done in His love and heard what you spoke in His wondrous and new remembrance. When you were engaged in My remembrance, We were before your face and heard your words, and I am the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Blessed are you for having fulfilled God’s Covenant, not breaking His pact, and not being among the idolaters.</p>
<p>Turn with your heart to the Qiblih of all horizons, then aid His Cause at all times and be not of the hesitant ones. Take the chalice of life and fear not the manifestations of Satan. Say “In the Name of God and by God,” then drink thereof by My leave, My command and My sovereignty, and fear not the hosts of the oppressors. Say: “By God, that which was never manifest in creation has been made manifest!” Then the tongue of grandeur speaks above My head saying, “Blessed be God Who has sent forth the Youth, then dispatched Him and caused Him to shine forth from the horizon of the Cause with evident sovereignty.”</p>
<p>Trust in God, then arise amidst the peoples of the earth and say: “O people! The proof has appeared and the Beauty of the All-Merciful has shone forth from the horizon of creation with a mighty adorning. O people! Fear God! This is He for Whose sake the Prophets and Messengers sacrificed themselves. This is He for Whose love ’Ali was suspended in the air and was struck by the bullets of hatred from the hosts of the deniers.” Say: “O people! Do you imagine that He gave up His spirit for His own sake or for your sakes? Woe unto you, O most lost ones! By God, He sacrificed Himself in My path and gave up His spirit for My decisive, mighty and wise Cause.”</p>
<p>Raise your heads from the slumber of passion, then turn to the Dayspring of eternity that you may witness the Sun of the remembrance of your Lord’s Most Exalted Name shining from the horizon of glory with the sovereignty of grandeur and majesty. Be not of those who have distanced themselves from the shore of nearness and are among the bygone ones.</p>
<p>Say: “O people! Fear God and deny not Him upon Whom has befallen in God’s path what has befallen no one before, as you would testify were you to be fair. Have you not heard that when the Luminary of the horizons was in the region of Iraq, all the servants opposed Him, and in every moment the arrows of the wretched descended upon Him from the clouds of destiny while He stood between earth and heaven? At times He turned His holy face to the peoples of the earth saying, ‘O people! The clouds have been rent asunder and the Lord of Lords has come with mighty sovereignty!’ And at times He addressed the people of the Gospel saying, ‘By God, He Who ascended to heaven has veritably descended and circles round the Youth, if you be of those who see!’ And once He addressed the people of the Furqan saying, ‘The Messenger of Muhammad has come from before with clear sovereignty!’</p>
<p>Turn then to the people of the Bayan and address them in the mystery of the line: Prepare yourselves, O people, for the Most Great Manifestation and purify your hearts from all doubts and allusions, for soon shall the Dwelling Place of verses be established upon the throne of names and attributes. For in that time the appointed hour of the Cause had not been fulfilled and the Face had not been unveiled, and We were behind a mighty veil. When the appointed time came, the fingers of divine power rent asunder the veil of concealment, and the Face shone forth from the horizon of glory and power, and the Tongue of God spoke amongst all worlds. Thereupon the pillars of all created things were shaken, and the feet of every soul did stumble, save those who had detached themselves from all things and had drunk from this Spring. Thus have We imparted unto thee from the wondrous melodies on this Night wherein the Ancient Beauty reclined upon the couch of sorrows by reason of that which befell Him from the manifestations of Satan. His tongue doth speak, His eyes do rain tears, and the Pen of the Cause lamenteth as it moveth before His face upon this luminous and holy Tablet. Say: O people, He hath appeared with the most wondrous melodies - will ye not be among those who perceive? Soon shall all that ye possess perish and ye shall return to your abode, wherein ye shall find for yourselves neither spring nor beloved. The melodies of God have been completed and His wondrous songs have ended in the paradise of this holy and wonderful Tablet. And the mercy that dawned from the horizon of eternity be upon thee and upon the people of Baha who are established upon the crimson ark and who traverse the sea of certitude.</p>

I testify that thou didst take hold of the Book of God with power from Him and might from His presence, and didst believe in it and hasten unto it until thou didst enter and present thyself at the Gate.</p>
<p>Thou art he who recognized the Dawning-Place of God’s Cause, the Source of His Revelation, the Manifestation of His Command, the Recipients of His Knowledge, the Fountainhead of His verses and the Wellspring of His proof. Blessed art thou for having drunk the Kawthar of meeting from the hands of bounty, and for having sought the shore of the sea of reunion in the end, and for having attained unto the Day wherein the mountains were set in motion and the Temple of the Manifestation was established upon the throne of His Name, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>

And blessed is the servant who hath recognized thy station and remembered thy days and what befell thee in the path of God, thy Creator, thy Sovereign, thy Originator, thy Benefactor and thy Lord.</p>
<p>I testify that God’s decree was the most beloved of all things unto thee, and this is a station none have attained save those near ones and sincere ones whom God hath described in His perspicuous Book as honored servants who speak not until He hath spoken and who act by His command.</p>
<p>I testify that thou wert steadfast when the foundations of the world were shaken, and tranquil when the hearts of the nations were troubled, and calm when limbs trembled in fear of God’s Most Great Name. Thou art he whom the Call attracted when it was raised between earth and heaven, such that thou didst forsake the world and turn thy face toward the Countenance after the passing of all things.</p>
<p>[…] ascend to the highest summit, and after thy ascent the Supreme Pen hath revealed thy station and hath remembered thee in such wise that the fragrance thereof shall never be exhausted throughout the eternity of the most excellent names and sublime attributes. Thou art he who left his homeland for the love of God, Lord of the seen and unseen, and who departed from his house yearning to attain His presence, until thou didst surrender thy spirit in His love and good-pleasure. Peace be upon thee, upon thy beginning and thine end, thy outward and thine inward self, and the mercy of God and His blessings.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven! I beseech Thee by the scratching of Thy Supreme Pen and the breezes of Thy Revelation, O Lord of the Kingdom of eternity, and by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the rain-showers of the clouds of Thy bounty, that Thou forgive me and my father and my mother and my kinsmen, and whosoever hath held fast unto the cord of Thy loving care and clung to the hem of Thy bounty. O Lord! The poor one hath stood before the gate of Thy riches, the sinful one hath hastened unto the dawning-place of Thy bestowal, seeking the wondrous gifts of Thy favors and grace. I beseech Thee, O God of the worlds and Object of the desire of them that are near unto Thee, by this grave and by him who lieth therein, that Thou disappoint me not of that which is with Thee. Write down, then, for me the good of this world and of the world to come. Then fulfill, O my God, my needs and whatsoever draweth me nigh unto Thee, O Lord of all men, Master of the Throne on high and of earth below.

<p>This sorrowful servant, seated in the land of grief, nourished by the essence of sorrow, drinking from the springs of sadness, rained upon by showers of anguish from the clouds of woe, and drenched by torrents of grief from the heavens of tribulation, calls out to you and all who are with you with a mournful voice, bidding you to act upon all that hath been inscribed in the testaments, both past and future. Be not deprived of the outpourings of the boundless breezes of mercy, and remain not distant from the rapturous melodies of the eternal Dove, for whatsoever hath appeared of the wondrous and manifold bounties shall pass away, and whatsoever melodious and delicate songs are heard shall vanish. Therefore, with pure striving and the essence of endeavor, walk ye upon the path of the exalted and glorious Living One, and thereafter find repose upon the carpet of glory and the throne of power. Ere long shall ye drink the cup of evanescence from the hand of the cupbearer of eternity, and quaff the chalices of love from the hand of the celestial maiden. Make ye ready, that perchance ye may not waste the blessing of life and be accounted among the heedless. Strive then with utmost power, that haply some service may proceed from you that shall win the good-pleasure of the King of the realms of blindness and the Sovereign of light. I swear by God, Who hath seated this servant upon the throne of sorrow, that this station is greater than whatsoever existeth in the highest heavens and the lowest earth. Strive, while life endureth and ye have not yet departed from this mortal cage, that ye may not commit that which would be a cause of remorse and regret. This servant, despite all the afflictions ye have heard about–and verily none greater than these hath appeared in all creation–passeth not a moment without feeling shame and embarrassment before the holy countenances and the faces of the near ones, for no service hath proceeded from this sorrowful servant that might bring joy to Their presence. How fitting is this verse in this regard:</p>
<p>How can I lift my face in shame before my Friend,</p>
<p>When no worthy service from my hand did descend?</p>
<p>But I call upon the Intended One in this state wherein from the clouds of love the drops of yearning pour down as torrential rain, and from the winds of grace the breezes of tenderness flow forth in melting streams, while the cauldron of longing sings its melodies, and the dove of separation warbles its tunes, and the hoopoe of affection takes wing in flight, and the peacock of oneness arrays itself in splendor, and the owl of gloom trills its song, and the salamander burns in the fire of desire, and the fish in the ocean of love’s radiance is submerged, while the heavens of union are lifted up and the stars of attainment are obscured, and the sun of manifestation is veiled and the light of emergence is concealed, and the earth of sorrow is spread wide and the tree of despair is planted firm, and the mountains of tranquility are crushed and the seas of concealment overflow, and the brilliance of hope is darkened, and the eye of the beloved waits expectantly - perchance the nightingale of faithfulness might sing upon the branches of the tree of extinction, and the nightingale of radiance might take wing among the boughs of the Lote-Tree of Sinai, and the leaf of the dove might warble upon the leaves of the tree of eternity, that haply the withered tree might bear fruit and the fallen Lote-Tree might be replanted, and the silenced nightingale might burst into song, and the wing-clipped hoopoe might soar to the holy heights, and the extinguished fire might blaze forth, and the stagnant stream might flow again, that we might be nourished from the cups of joy and delight, and taste the fruits of the tree of love, and gaze into the polished mirror. But God knows that at this moment such tears have rained from my eyes and such drops have streamed down my face like the rain of mercy that the sighs of my eyes have stopped the pen from moving and the flood of tears has prevented ink from marking the page. How excellent are these words:</p>
<p>My weeping makes Noah’s flood seem but like my tears,</p>
<p>And the fire of Abraham is as my passion’s burning;</p>
<p>Were it not for my sighs, my tears would drown me,</p>
<p>And were it not for my tears, my sighs would consume me;</p>
<p>Jacob’s grief expressed not the least of my sorrow,</p>
<p>And all Job’s afflictions are but a portion of my tribulation.</p>
<p>And if what afflicts Me were to befall the mountains, and were Mount Sinai to bear them before the Divine Manifestation, verily it would have crumbled to dust. Yet, despite all these tribulations and afflictions, these trials both hidden and manifest, I remain expectant and watchful for successive favors and manifest bounties, that perchance the Cup-Bearer of the Countenance of Glory might, from the crimson chalice, give Me to drink the wine of destiny, so that the hoopoe of sorrow might be gladdened by the fragrances from the city of Sheba, and become enchanted by the cooing of the Dove of Glory. Perchance this darkened mirror might be illumined by the Countenance of Beauty, and this blackened stone might be made to shine by the Face of Majesty. Haply this dejected heart might find solace, and this grieving soul might attain unto glad-tidings. Wherefore I say: There is no power nor strength except through God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We are God’s, and unto Him shall we return.</p>

<p>The mystery of the great reversal in the sign of the sovereign hath appeared. Blessed is he whom God hath aided to acknowledge the Six which were raised up by this Alif - verily he is of the sincere ones. These passages were presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. This is what the Mother Book hath spoken: O Lion! O thou who gazest upon the One, the Single! These expressions are found in a letter which Sheikh Ahmad Ahsa’i - upon him be the Glory of God - wrote to someone, and all its explicit statements, allusions, intimations and symbols refer to the Manifestation Himself. The purpose was to inform people and make them aware of the days when the Sun of Knowledge would rise from the horizon of Iraq. The Shaykhis inquired about the Sheikh’s words, the beginning of which is adorned with these sublime words: “Verily, after the passing of the ALMS by the AMR, the Mahdi - peace be upon Him - shall arise…” until he said “The letter Waw consists of three letters making six, and Alif, and six, and six days have passed, and the Alif is the completion, and there is no more to be said, and how about the latter six days, otherwise the return would not occur” - referring to the blessed verse “ye shall return” because it is the secret of inversion for the symbol of the chief. The pronounced Waw has three letters - two Waws and one Alif in between. The meaning is that six days passed and ended, referring to the blessed verse in the Qur’an where He, exalted be He, says: “We created the heavens and the earth in six days.” He states that heaven was rolled up like a scroll, and all that was with it, and likewise the earth. He speaks of elevated heavens in the Qur’an with their suns, moons and stars, which are the divines, mystics, laws and ordinances - all established by the Alif between two Waws. And if someone achieves recognition of the remaining six, meaning these new and wondrous heavens, the Cause is completed through the Proof - that is, he knows, acknowledges and recognizes the Proof, and the Most Great Name appears. And concerning His words “the secret of inversion for the symbol of the chief,” this refers to the tradition “He maketh their highest to be their lowest, and their lowest to be their highest.” Observe how the chiefs who occupied the highest station descended to the lowest station - this is the secret of inversion, and this inversion appeared from the symbols and intimations of the Chief. After the appearance of the blessed word “He” in the garment of “I,” heaven was rolled up, the sun was darkened, the stars fell, and the earth was cleft asunder. How many divines who considered themselves oceans of knowledge were, by the aforementioned word, returned to the worst of stations, nay, were brought to naught, and how many servants who were remembered in no gathering were, by virtue of their acceptance, reckoned among the denizens of the highest heaven. These are the leaves of the scrolls, the words of the Psalms, and the letters of the Book. The jewels of the world were extracted from the retort and alembic of wisdom and utterance, which is the Supreme Pen, by His command - and He is the Ordainer, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>For a long time this Wronged One has not been inclined towards scholarly investigation, nor is He now, for in the early years such scholarly matters were discussed as would suffice. Now this brief exposition that hath been set forth was solely out of consideration for you. Know thou the bounty of thy Lord and render thanks unto Him at morn and eventide. The Shaykhis themselves have mentioned that when the departed and honored Haji Siyyid Kazim - upon him be the Glory of God - was asked about the elevated one, no answer was forthcoming, and likewise from other Shaykhis. And all acknowledged that were the meaning of these passages to become manifest, they would turn towards the Supreme Horizon. Nevertheless, they were seen to be as stones, having no movement, or as those struck down, as God the Exalted hath said: “And thou mightest have seen the people therein struck down as though they were the hollow trunks of palm-trees.” Beseech ye God to awaken the heedless ones, to guide the seekers unto their goal, and to not deprive His servants of this fragrance that hath perfumed the world. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. His is the command, both in the past and in the future.</p>
<p>O Beloved of My heart! The door of fairness is shut and the path of justice is blocked. All are occupied with vain imaginings unworthy of mention, and are veiled from the light of the Sun of Revelation. Woe unto them and unto those who follow them! Nevertheless, since it hath been commanded that all hearts should show forth the utmost love and kindness unto all who dwell on earth, We therefore beseech the Exalted Lord in utter lowliness that He may guide His creation and hold them back from oppression and tyranny. He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. In the Book of Isaiah - may my spirit be a sacrifice for all besides Him - there is a passage that hath previously testified to that which hath been expounded by the Most Exalted Pen concerning the meaning of the words of the revered Shaykh - upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God. He saith: “For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.” (Chapter 65, verse 17).</p>

<p>After completing the response to your numerous letters, two more communications dated the 29th of Sha’ban and 5th of Shawwal arrived, causing joy and gladness. Praise be to God that the fragrance of sincerity emanated from them. However, the response to the earlier letters was written five months ago, but its dispatch was delayed due to the turmoil in surrounding areas. Now that these two letters have arrived, the previous response has been connected and sent.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Aqa Muhammad Ibrahim of Manshad (upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory), and likewise your mention of the afflictions that befell him, all was presented before the Most Holy Court. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in response, blessed and exalted be His words:</p>
<p>That which befell the loved ones of Manshad is what befell the friends of God, exalted be His glory, in the first and last generations. There hath come upon them that which caused the Concourse on High to lament. Blessed are they! The Supreme Pen hath testified in their favor that which shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endureth. Thus hath the decree been ordained from God, the Lord of the worlds. There hath befallen Us in the Land of Ta and other lands that which is greater than what hath befallen them in this straight Path. We give thanks unto God in all conditions. Soon shall all that is in the world perish, and the sincere ones shall behold what hath been ordained for them in the highest Paradise as a recompense for what they have wrought in this Momentous Announcement. Sufficient unto them is the testimony of the Wronged One in the Most Great Prison, would that they knew. They should rejoice in what hath been sent down unto them from the Supreme Pen. Happy are they, and joy be unto them, for having drunk the cup of tribulation in the path of God, the Lord of Names, Who hath come with a perspicuous Book and hath adorned each one of them with the ornament of forgiveness. And by virtue of what hath befallen them, God hath forgiven their fathers and mothers. This is yet another bounty from the presence of One Who is Forgiving, Generous. O My loved ones! Grieve not over anything. By My life! There hath been ordained for you that which shall bring joy to every discerning one who hath knowledge. The glory be upon you, and upon those who are with you, and upon your children and your families who have attained unto the recognition of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The mention of the divine friends from among the people of Manshad hath been revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will in numerous places. They have attained unto that which shall endure as long as the kingdoms of earth and heaven shall last. Blessed are they, and again blessed are they.</p>
<p>Regarding your mention of the vision of Aqa Muhammad Ibrahim (upon him be the Glory of God), it was presented before the Most Holy Court. This is what was revealed from the heaven of the bounty of our Lord, the All-Knowing: The world of dreams has been and continues to be one of the realms of existence. Its details and mention have been revealed from the Supreme Pen in numerous Tablets. However, this dream and others like it that may cause harm and commotion in their expression and execution - acting upon them is not permitted, and indeed even their expression is not permitted. O Ibrahim! Today fix thy gaze upon the horizon of wisdom. Whatever is contrary [to divine law], acting upon it is forbidden. This is what the All-Wise hath decreed in His perspicuous Book. Dreams do not compare or equate with God’s explicit ordinances. Set aside the dream and take what the All-Bestowing hath revealed in the Book. We have commanded wisdom for all in the Books, Scriptures, Psalms and Tablets, and have forbidden that which is contrary. Take what ye have been commanded and set aside what ye have been forbidden by the One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. Praise the Intended One of the world that thou hast been blessed by His mention and confirmed in His knowledge. Strive that thou mayest be distinguished among humanity by spiritual qualities and goodly deeds. This is the counsel of the All-Knowing Counsellor unto thee and all the servants. Be thankful unto thy Lord for this great bounty.</p>
<p>As to thy request for forgiveness for thy departed father and others, it hath been granted. God hath forgiven them as a mercy and favor from His presence. He is verily the Forgiver, the Bountiful, the Generous. Regarding what thou didst write about blessing and abundance, be engaged with utmost joy and fragrance. The promise of blessing hath been sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will. God willing, it shall encompass all the friends. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Munificent, the Giver, the Compassionate. The names of all those mentioned in thy letter were presented at the Most Holy Court and were adorned with the ornament of Divine mention. God willing, may all speak and act as befitting and hold fast unto that which they ought. The relatives of the departed Aqa Siyyid Ja’far, upon him be the glory of God and His mercy, are remembered at the Divine Threshold. This is glad tidings from the servant unto them. I convey greetings and salutations to all. The glory that shineth and gleameth be upon thee and upon every steadfast and unwavering knight whom God hath described aforetime: “No fear shall be upon them, neither shall they grieve.” And praise be to God, the Possessor of all that was and that shall be. The Servant. The first of Safar [1300].</p>

<p>Exalted is He Who hath spoken and caused all things to speak in His remembrance and praise! Exalted is He Who hath revealed that which lay hidden within the pavilion of His Command and the tabernacle of His glory! Exalted is He Who hath taken the chalice of everlasting life and, with the fingers of bounty, hath offered it unto the peoples of creation! Blessed is he who hath drawn nigh and taken hold of His Most Glorious Name, and hath drunk deep in remembrance of Him Who is sanctified above all mention! Exalted is He Who hath stood among His servants, at times speaking through His Most Beautiful Names, and at times through His Most Exalted Word! Exalted is he who hath hearkened unto His most sweet call and turned toward His Most Holy and Most Exalted Horizon, and hath heard from Him that which caused both Moses to tremble in the heights of Sinai and the Beloved to be transported on the night of His ascension when the lights of the Lord of Names were unveiled! We beseech God to aid the peoples of the earth to attain unto that which hath appeared and been made manifest through His sovereignty that overshadoweth both earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this evanescent one received thy letter, which was traced by the pen of love and affection and adorned with the mention of God, the Lord of creation. When I opened and read it, I turned toward the Dayspring of the Throne and laid before Him all that was written therein. Thereupon did the Ancient Beauty smile and speak that which would be as spirit unto the bodies of the world and as light unto regions which none save God, the Lord of all nations, hath discovered. He spoke, and His Word is the truth: “We have heard his call and turned toward him, and have answered him through this perspicuous Book which itself beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and which proclaimeth that He is indeed the Most Great Name.” Thus hath the Pen of Revelation spoken, yet most of the people are heedless.</p>
<p>O servant! Rejoice and be glad that the gaze of thy Lord hath been directed toward thee, and that He hath sent down for thee that which shall cause thy remembrance to endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. When thou attainest unto this bounty, arise and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds, and light be unto Thee, O Light of the worlds!” And concerning him who was named Aziz, blessed is he in that he hath been mentioned from before the Throne, and that the tongue of grandeur and glory hath been moved to make mention of him in this spot which hath been designated by the Most Beautiful Names and at times as the Most Great Prison. Thy Lord is, verily, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Convey My glorification unto him and say: Hold fast unto the cord of the Cause and say:</p>
<p>“O Lord of all men! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the All-Bountiful, not to deprive me of that which lieth with Thee. Ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy righteous servants who have cast away the world and turned toward Thy most exalted horizon. O my Lord! I am he who hath turned with his whole being toward Thy countenance and hath clung to the hem of Thy bounty. Forgive me and have mercy upon me, for Thou art the best of them that show mercy and the best of them that give. And shouldst Thou chastise me, then every limb of my body would testify to Thy justice and to Thy favor. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>God willing, may you be blessed with the infinite favors of God, and adorned with the effulgence of the light of His countenance. Beseech ye the Almighty and Most High that He may render all successful in attaining this most great bounty and may guide them to the supreme horizon. O my brother! Although the horizon of the Manifestation is resplendent and illumined with the Sun of Divine Beauty, yet most men are seen to be bewildered and perplexed, nay, dead and lost. Most strange it is that they have not yet found the sweetness of the most pure wine, and have not attained to that exalted station of nearness which is the recognition of God. We beseech God that He may awaken those who slumber through the breezes of the dawn of God’s Day, and bestow eternal life upon the dead through the outpourings of the ocean of His grace. Verily, He is the Bestower, the Giver, the Generous One. In every land a clamor hath been raised and will continue to be raised, for the Supreme Pen hath announced this in the Most Great Tablets and verses. Therefore must all take refuge in God, the Almighty and Most High, and hold fast to none but Him. This is the greatest bounty and the divine counsel recorded in all the Books. Today all friends must, in complete humility, submissiveness and utter servitude, summon the people to God without observing in themselves the slightest trace of life. By the Sun of the horizon of utterance! There is no station higher today than pure servitude, nor hath there ever been. We beseech God that all may attain thereunto and that the friends may fix their gaze upon this station. God guideth whom He willeth unto the straight path. God willing, may you be occupied at all times with the mention of the All-Merciful in the utmost joy and delight, and remember with highest praise all the masters, friends, and well-wishers on behalf of this evanescent one. God is witness and testifier that this evanescent one hath been and is at all times occupied with the remembrance of the friends of God, and it is hoped that they may manifest, with the utmost love and ardor, in this Day for which there hath not been nor shall be any likeness or equal, and be engaged in the praise and glorification of God. The Glory be upon you.</p>

<p>The All-Sanctified, the Most Great, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Glorious! All things proclaim that He Who is the Lord of Names is come, yet the people remain behind a clear veil. The seas have surged by virtue of that Most Great Name which hath appeared from the horizon of eternity, yet most of the people remain fast asleep. The call of God hath been raised from the lofty Tree in the heart of Paradise, yet the people of creation remain in manifest remoteness. O My loved ones in that land! Hearken unto the call of your Lord, the All-Glorious, from the Ultimate Tree upraised upon the luminous Spot. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the All-Forgiving, the Bountiful. Turn with your hearts unto the Best-Beloved, then take the chalices of life in the name of your Lord, the All-Merciful, and drink therefrom in His Name, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. By My life! This honor sufficeth you - that ye have drawn nigh unto the Best-Beloved while the people are in grievous loss, that ye have attained unto Him Who is the Purpose while they remain in grave delusion. Arise in the name of your Lord, the All-Merciful, amidst all creation in such wise that the sincere shall find in your faces the radiance of the All-Glorious. Thus doth this imprisoned Stranger command you. Do sorrows overtake you when ye behold yourselves beneath the shadow of your Lord, the Most High, the All-Knowing? God shall soon exalt you through the truth, inasmuch as ye have turned unto Him in days wherein the feet of all the world have slipped. They have clung to vain imaginings while ye have won the recognition of Him Who is known, when He Who is the Self-Subsisting appeared with His name, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Did ye but know the measure of this bounty, ye would soar with longing in this subtle atmosphere. Blessed are ye for having heard, turned unto Him and said: “Here am I, O God of the worlds!” How many a mighty one was prevented, and how many a weak one was strengthened through His Name, the Powerful, the Almighty! How many a lofty one descended from his seat, and how many a lowly one was raised up through His Name, the Mighty, the Wise! Blessed be your faces, for ye have turned unto Him Who is the Intended One; blessed be your hearts for having borne the trust of the love of the Beloved; blessed be your ears for having heard His sweet and wondrous call. Beware lest the vain imaginings of them that have disbelieved in God, the One, the Peerless, the All-Informed, disturb you. Stand firm in the Cause in such wise that neither the gloom of glory nor the might of them that have turned away from the Fountain of nearness and are numbered with the heedless may shake you. We behold you in your station and hear your call. Verily, He is with His sincere servants. Your names have not been withheld from the Supreme Pen. By My life! It hath moved in your remembrance, and He Who speaketh in this remote station beareth witness unto this. He desireth him who hath desired Him and loveth him who hath loved Him, and His remembrance hath preceded all who remember.</p>
<p>Know ye that We are in the Most Great Prison between two factions among the nations, and there befalleth Us at all times that which hath not befallen any of the Messengers. Whereat the Dove hath lamented and the Beauty of the Ancient of Days hath mourned in the pavilion of grandeur. Thus doth your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised, inform you. Can tribulation prevent Me from the remembrance of the Lord of Names? Nay, by the Creator of the heavens, if ye be of them that know! Arise to aid the Cause of your Lord as your Master hath arisen, in such wise that neither the greatness of the turbans nor the might of them that have wronged and are among the most lost shall prevent you. When ye desire to render aid, hold fast unto the cord of wisdom. Thus hath the All-Merciful commanded you in the Tablets. Verily, He is the Ruler over what He willeth. Unite in the Cause, for thereby are gladdened the hearts of the chosen ones and grieved the hearts of them that deny. Through unity will the Cause of your Lord, the Possessor of creation, become manifest. Blessed is he who hath held fast thereunto - he is assuredly among the triumphant. Let not the world and its conditions sadden you. All shall perish and there shall endure what hath been ordained for you in the Kingdom of your glorious and beauteous Lord. For him that hath no helper, He is his Helper, and for him that hath no friend, He is the Friend of them that turn unto Him. Verily the Cause is in God’s hands; He giveth to whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He pleaseth. He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. O concourse of the righteous! When ye receive the Tablet of God, take it with hands of certitude, then read it with the spirit of joy and fragrance. Verily it will draw you nigh unto your Lord, the All-Merciful, and will aid you in that which your Ancient Master hath desired. Ye are in your homes while the Lord of the House remembereth you in the land of exile. Be ye thankful and be of them that remember. Ponder ye upon God’s favor and His mercy. Verily He hath revealed unto you the verses in the prison after it was encompassed by the hosts of the oppressors. We have veiled that which hath befallen Us; were We to unveil it the trees would be overturned, the spirits would swoon, the rivers would cease to flow, the fruits would fall, the mountains would crumble, and they that are in the heavens and on earth would be sorely troubled. How wonderful are these tribulations that have descended in the path of God, and how wonderful are these hardships that have encompassed Me in the Cause of your Lord and the Lord of all worlds! Blessed is he who hath this day fulfilled God’s covenant and His testament, and was of them that are guided. Blessed is he who hath been stirred by the breeze of God and was of them that are detached. Blessed is he who hath cast away the world, turning unto God, the Most High, the Most Great, and was of them that are steadfast. Blessed is he who hath detached himself in the love of his Lord from all else beside Him, and was of them that are firm. Thus have We sent down unto you the verses; they are clear proofs unto all in the kingdom. May the glory that hath shone forth from the horizon of the Most Glorious be upon you, O loved ones of God, inasmuch as ye have turned unto the Qiblih of the horizons and were of them that are assured.</p>

<p>Praise be befitting unto the Lord of all desires, Who, through His complete power, hath brought forth the pearls of wisdom and utterance from the shells of the ocean of knowledge, and through these two precious pearls hath bestowed perfect order upon the world and guided His servants to the realm of immortality. In all conditions His purpose hath been and is the exaltation, elevation and loftiness of the station of His creation, that all may attain unto that which shall assist and protect humanity throughout all worlds. At times He appeareth in the form of a lamp, and at others in the guise of an army. In truth these two are two banners, nay rather two pavilions - the station of rest and the seat of security have been and ever shall be beneath the shade of these two pavilions. Blessed is he who hath chosen therein a place for himself.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God, my Desire and my Beloved! I beseech Thee by the Banner beneath whose shade, despite its loftiness and grandeur, the heaven itself doth dwell, that Thou aid Thy chosen ones and loved ones in a manner befitting the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy generosity. O Lord! Thou seest this servant of Thine, detached from all save Thee and turning unto the lights of Thy countenance. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him of that which he seeketh from Thy mighty grace and all-encompassing favor.</p>
<p>And now, the letter of that beloved of the heart arrived like a flowing spring. We took it in the name of Truth and drank of its mention. Its fruit was joy and its effect was gladness. After its reading and perusal, it was honored to be heard before His presence. Though the Temple be hidden from sight, yet his mention and name are present. Praise be to God, thou art favored with the Most Great Bounty and known by the name of the Peerless Beloved. We beseech God, exalted be He, to open before his face the gates of His mercy and make him a standard of His steadfastness among His creation. We ask Him to ordain for him the good of the hereafter and of this world, and of all His worlds. Peace be upon him from Us, and upon those who follow him, and upon those who acknowledge the unity of God, His uniqueness, His grandeur and His sovereignty.</p>
<p>Glad tidings! On this night, which is the first of the honored month of Rajab, the letter from the honored and compassionate Ali Akbar, upon him be God’s peace, arrived. His verses were both flowing and witty, and were presented in the gathering of the chosen ones. In truth, the fragrance of sincerity and love wafted from it. Likewise, in the presence, it was favored with the glances of grace. Each of his words bore witness to love and testified to submission and affection. Convey my greetings to him, and say: Previously you struck a river, now you have struck an ocean. Blessed be the people of your monastery who are intoxicated thereby! In truth, that wine which the poets have spoken of existed before the grapevine - they spoke the truth and right is on their side, for this wine is the wine of love, and by the testimony of God, exalted be His glory, love was the cause of creation. Not only was there no grape there, but there was not even the father of the grape.</p>
<p>We conclude these words at this time with the remembrance of our Purpose and His loved ones there, and We make mention of Qurratu’l-’Ayn ’Abdu’l-Husayn, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah]. God willing, he is adorned with refinement and embellished with virtues. May he hold fast in all conditions to that which is befitting. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to protect him. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Peace and remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne and the exalted Seat.</p>

<p>Praise be unto the Lord of all desires, Who befitteth and deserveth it, Who hath given strength unto His loved ones, bestowed power upon them, and made them the cause of unity, harmony and the reformation of the world. Through them He hath united the hearts of His servants and raised the banner of His victory and the standard of His might. I pray and send salutations upon the first light that shone forth from the horizon of existence from the Educator of the seen and unseen, through Whom appeared the decree of unity among the peoples and the command of prayer at the most exalted station, and upon His family and companions whom God made the treasuries of His knowledge, the mines of His wisdom, and the repositories of His laws, and through whom were manifested God’s dominion and power, His signs and His might.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter of that beloved of the heart arrived, removing all that caused sorrow and bestowing all that brought joy upon every element of body and being, hair and sinew and vein. Glory be to God! In the Tablet of Wisdom mention is made of the penetrating power of the Word. God, our Lord and the Lord of the mighty Throne and the elevated Seat, speaketh the truth. This servant beareth witness that the word of the loved ones courseth and floweth through and penetrateth all elements - how much more so the Most Exalted Word of God! This evanescent one is incapable of describing its effect and penetrating power. After its reading and perusal, he proceeded to the Most Great Shrine where it was presented before His countenance and attained the honor of His hearing. He said:</p>
<p>We beseech God to aid him in nurturing, reforming, and uniting. We ask God to assist him in all that he hath purposed for the betterment of His loved ones’ affairs. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful. Praise be to God! All that hath transpired hath been and is for the good, for there hath been no betrayal, waste, excess, or unseemly matters. The deed is clear and evident as the sun. We beseech God to bring about reformation. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Generous, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>We make mention of all the loved ones in that land and convey Our greetings. We beseech God to aid them all in patience, tranquility, and that which befitteth man’s true station. In truth, the loved ones of that land are deserving of mention and favor. God willing, it hath reached and will reach them. Upon them be God’s peace, mercy, favor, and kindness.</p>
<p>Convey greetings from the Wronged One to ’Ali, upon him be God’s peace and favor. We beseech God the Most High to strengthen him through His grace, to make him a standard of His remembrance, and to manifest through him that which shall endure as long as His names endure. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant also begs to be remembered and greeted by him. Furthermore, let that beloved of the heart convey this evanescent one’s greetings, praise, and mention in whatever manner is befitting. I beseech God to remove whatsoever hath caused separation and distance, and to waft the fragrance of meeting and reunion. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>The letter of that beloved of the heart was a perfect example and comprehensive explanation. It is hoped that through God’s grace - exalted be His glory - that which causeth joy and gladness to hearts and souls shall be made manifest. This evanescent servant is assured of the favors, but that beloved of the heart must, as commanded, carry out whatever he deemeth advisable. God willing, victory and triumph accompany that beloved one. Praise be to God, his steps are blessed and love and sincerity are present. In such case, divine assistance shall surely arrive and that which causeth reformation shall appear.</p>
<p>At this moment He spoke regarding the affairs of the Afnan, upon him be God’s peace and favor. The command was given to consult, that Haji Mirza Hasan and Haji Muhammad, upon them be God’s peace and favor, should be present and consult, and whatever resulteth from the consultation should be followed. Now too, that honored one should consider and consult whether that place or another place would be advisable according to the time, and act accordingly. In all cases, all must do that which is beloved and acceptable in God’s presence. Upon their return, they should go there and convey greetings from the Wronged One. I ask that He may grant thee success, strengthen thee, draw thee nigh, and cause thee to return unto Us. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Choosing. End.</p>
<p>Indeed, since His Holiness the Afnan, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, hath newly arrived in these parts, his satisfaction must be considered. This matter is essential. This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth God to aid all in that which He loveth and is pleased with. This evanescent one’s request is that whatever that honored one deemeth advisable and conducive to joy and gladness, he should convey to the loved ones of that land on behalf of this servant. The glory, mention, and praise be upon your honor and upon God’s sincere servants.</p>

<p>In the Name of the One All-Knowing!</p>
<p>Praise be to the Beloved Who hath gathered together the peoples of the world through His blessed word “No imperfection canst thou see in the creation of the God of Mercy,” and through another word hath made manifest the greatest differentiation. Through His Name was raised the banner “Verily I am God,” and through His manifestation was revealed the meaning of “All things shall perish save His Face.” He is the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing. The might of the powerful hath not weakened Him, nor hath the majesty of princes rendered Him powerless. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. There is no God but He, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! The servant present hath made mention of all that was written to thee by him who beareth the name of H and S, upon him be My glory. Blessed is he, for he is among those who have taken the path unto Him Who occupieth the throne. They have been and are beneath the glances of God’s loving-kindness. We have given him glad-tidings of this aforetime, and We give him glad-tidings in this noble Tablet. Likewise his petition reached the Most Holy Court through the Most Great Branch. Verily We have read and heard his call and the mention of his heart in the love of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, and We have answered him and will answer him with that which all the treasures of the world cannot equal. He is verily the Answerer, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that they have attained unto the lights of the Throne and have realized the presence of God, which is the greatest of all deeds. This is a Day the description of which hath left the Pen of Creation powerless, and all the world was created for this Day. Nevertheless, none have understood save a few. Whosoever hath attained unto its understanding hath attained unto all that hath been revealed in the Books. The attention, mention, acceptance and desire of no one shall be lost. All are recorded and inscribed in God’s Book. For each one hath been ordained that which would bewilder minds to mention.</p>
<p>God willing, ye have been and shall continue to be assisted. Thereafter the servant present laid before His presence another letter which Abuturab, upon him be My glory, had written to thee. Praise be to God, the fragrance of divine love was diffused from his letter. They have hearkened unto the call of Him Who conversed on Sinai and have recognized the divine Day from which most of the divines and mystics are veiled, and have attained unto the lights of the Sun of Revelation shining from the horizon of the heaven of God’s Tablet. God willing, may they be assisted in that which shall cause its mention to endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Blessed is he who hath turned to the Most Exalted Horizon, who hath arisen to serve the Cause and hath spoken that from which the fragrance of inner meanings hath been wafted among the people of utterance. Glory be upon him and upon those who have attained unto the sealed wine in the days of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>In the letter of him who beareth the name of H and S, upon him be My glory, mention was made of certain souls who have turned to God. We make mention of each one of them as a favor from Us and a mercy from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O ?akim! There hath come before the Wronged One a letter from one who loveth Us, wherein mention was made of thee. We make mention of thee that thou mayest give thanks unto God, thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. God willing, thou shouldst be so transported by the choice wine of the utterance of the Best-Beloved of all possibility that the might of the world would have no effect upon thee and the power of the nations would not render thee weak. Be thou occupied with the mention of the Truth through wisdom and utterance, that perchance the dead may attain unto life through the sweet-scented breezes of the garment of the All-Merciful, and the withered may be made fresh. This is the true springtime, inasmuch as the breezes of the mercy of the All-Merciful are wafting from the rose-garden of the Revelation. Blessed is the soul that hath been stirred by these spiritual breezes and hath quaffed from the cup of joy. God willing, mayest thou ever be the recipient of God’s bounty and be enabled to make mention of Him.</p>
<p>As to what was written regarding the brother of the two martyrs, his petition was received and an answer was sent from the Most Holy Court. Were he to act in accordance with Our counsel, he would witness that which he hath never before seen. The glance of Our favor is directed towards him. God willing, may he be confirmed.</p>
<p>Likewise, mention was made in their letter of Mirza Ibn-i ’A.B. We make mention of him at this hour that he may rejoice in this wondrous remembrance. Blessed is he in that he hath turned towards the Supreme Horizon and hath attained unto this remembrance which shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. We counsel him and those who have believed in that which the All-Merciful hath sent down in His holy, mighty, and great Book. The glory of God rest upon him and upon them and upon thee from God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>We send Our greetings from this spot unto him who was named ’Ali-Qabli-Naqi, that he may rejoice in these greetings from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We make mention of him even as We mentioned him before, and of those who have believed in God in that place and turned towards Him when every heedless one turned away. We give him the glad-tidings of the passing away of all that they witness today and of the endurance of that which hath been ordained for them in the Kingdom of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him through Whom the Ocean of Divine Knowledge hath surged before the faces of all religions! All praise, sanctified from the perception of all created things and the recognition of all contingent beings, befitteth the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court of Him, the Self-Subsisting, Who, single and alone, stood up before the faces of the world and gave unto all the Most Great Announcement. Through His steadfastness, the standard of “God doeth whatsoever He willeth” was raised aloft, and the banner of “Verily, there is none other God but Him” was unfurled in the most exalted station. Neither the hosts and legions of the world, nor the rancor and hatred of the nations, could deter Him from His purpose. With power and authority He broke the seal of the Choice Wine and summoned all to partake thereof, that they might drink of that for which they were created. Yet all arose in opposition, save whom God willed. The Truth, glorified be His majesty, in all His Books gave His servants the glad-tidings of the appearance of this Most Great Cause and this Mighty Announcement. Blessed is the soul whom neither the veils of the divines nor the might of rulers prevented from the divine path, nor deprived of the ocean of utterance.</p>
<p>Thy letter which thou didst send to this servant was presented before the Wronged One. We perceived the fragrance of thy remembrance and utterance, and witnessed thy turning and devotion at that time. We beseech God to aid thee in His remembrance and praise, and to make thee among those whom neither the blame of the blamer nor the clamor of him who hath turned away from God, the Lord of all worlds, could deter.</p>
<p>When thou dost inhale the fragrance of My raiment and attainest unto the choice wine of My utterance, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me unto Thee and made me recognize the Dayspring of Thy signs, and caused me to hear the trilling of Thy Pen and guided me unto Thy path. I beseech Thee by Thy power that hath encompassed all created things, and by Thy Command that hath surrounded all contingent beings, and by Thy Name whereby every mouldering bone was quickened and every wise decree was manifested, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love, in such wise that the swords of the world shall not withhold me from drawing nigh unto Thy Most Great Name. O Lord! Thou seest me turning unto Thee and holding fast unto Thy cord. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Kingdom and the mysteries of Thy Dominion to ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall be with me in every world of Thy worlds. Then protect me, O my God, from the suggestions of the faithless and the allusions of the cawers. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention concerning thy brother Muhammad Ibrahim, We make mention of him at this moment as a token of the grace of God, the Lord of all worlds. O Muhammad Ibrahim! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One from the precincts of the Prison. He maketh mention of thee and counseleth thee to remain steadfast in this Most Great Cause, and to be trustworthy and chaste, and to act in such wise as to exalt the Cause of God amongst His servants. He, verily, is the Manifest Counsellor. Be not grieved by the oppression of the oppressors. Reflect upon the days of the Lord of the Messengers and the Seal of the Prophets, and likewise upon the days of the Spirit, the Son of Mary. There befell them that which caused the clouds to weep and the heavens to lament. Yet afterwards the lights of the Cause encompassed all regions. The names and traces of the idolaters all returned to nothingness, and the standard “There is none other God but He” was raised to the most exalted station. For every matter there is an appointed time and a fixed term. When its term is come, it shall appear in truth. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We make mention also of thy other brother who was named Ghulam-Rida, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful. O Ghulam! The Lord of all beings maketh mention of thee from the precincts of the Prison and giveth thee glad tidings of the grace of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Fix thy gaze upon Him at all times and place thy trust in Him in all matters, holding fast to the means. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing Teacher. Praise be to God that thou hast been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and hast attained unto the Most Great Word from God, the Lord of all beings. Know thou the station of this most great station and say: “My God, my God! Aid me to preserve this station, then ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy sincere servants. Thou art, verily, the Most Merciful of the merciful.” His honor the Trustee, upon him be My glory, hath repeatedly made mention of thee and of his honor Aqa Muhammad Isma’il. Mention of the friends hath ever flowed from his pen. We make mention of him who hath turned towards the Countenance, and We beseech for him from the heaven of grace and bounty that which shall endure as long as the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, shall endure. And as to what thou didst mention concerning turning towards this direction, in these days the heedless are intervening and preventing the hapless people. We beseech God to ordain for you the reward of attaining His presence and meeting Him. He, verily, is the Hearer, the Answerer. Convey My greetings to the loved ones, that they may perchance take a path to Him Who occupieth the throne. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon those whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from turning towards the Supreme Horizon - they who have heard and have responded: “Here am I, O God of all who are in the heavens and on earth! Here am I, O Thou Who art the Goal of the mystics and the Beloved of them that have drawn nigh!”</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise be sanctified above pen and ink unto the Lord of the Day of Reckoning, Who befittingly and worthily calleth out on that Day “Unto whom belongeth the Kingdom this Day?” and answereth by His own Self “Unto God, the One, the All-Compelling.” He is the Omnipotent Who brought forth from a Point the Letter, and from the Letter the Word, and from the Word the books of the world. Glorified be His praise and exalted be His knowledge, transcendent be His station! And blessings and peace be upon His Messenger, and upon Him Who standeth firm in His Cause, Who gazeth toward His horizon, Who speaketh forth His commandments and ordinances, Who relateth His most excellent Names and most exalted Attributes, through Whom the celestial spheres revolve and the realm of dust is adorned, and upon His family and companions through whom God’s victory and His Cause, God’s sovereignty and His power were made manifest.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God and the Desire of my heart! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue the world and didst distinguish the monotheists among the nations, to assist Thy servants who have acknowledged the Word of Unity and have recognized what Thou didst command them regarding the signs of detachment which testified to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and to that which the tongue of Thy power hath uttered in the kingdom of Thy Cause. O Lord! Abandon them not among Thy heedless servants. Aid them through Thy bounty and preserve them by Thy sovereignty. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Strong, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in these days all must hold fast unto the truth and be supplicants of His grace, beseeching that He protect the people of unity from the polytheists. This matter is binding upon all. May He change the weakness of this community into strength. He is the Able, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Your letter was received, and the fragrance of love wafted therefrom. Praise be to the Goal of all the worlds that He hath confirmed you in steadfastness and love. Were the True One, exalted be His glory, to grant life and were we to desire to offer thanks for but one of His bounties throughout the duration of His earthly and heavenly kingdom, we would have sought the impossible. Therefore do we grasp the cord of His grace and cling to the hem of His generosity, that He may assist these weak and poor ones in that which is befitting and may enable them in such wise that this evanescent world may neither engage them nor deprive them of His good-pleasure. After reading and reviewing your letter, We proceeded to the Most Great Prison and details were presented. They said: “Praise be to God that they are occupied with the mention of God and are firm in His Cause. We beseech God that He may cause him to be steadfast in such wise that the calumnies of the corrupters and the whisperings of the atheists may not withhold him from God, exalted be His glory. O Muhammad-’Ali! Grieve not over anything. The sorrow and joy of the world are both transient. God willing, thou shalt be confirmed in that which altereth not and shall not be erased from the scroll of names. This Wronged One hath ever besought God, exalted be His glory, for the exaltation, elevation, tranquility and steadfastness of His loved ones. Assuredly His prayer is answered and His call shall receive response, now and in the future. He it is Who hath named Himself the All-Hearing, the Answering, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.”</p>
<p>You have ever been mentioned in the prison and continue to be. You should occupy yourself, with complete joy and radiance, and trusting in Him. Verily, He confirmeth whomsoever He willeth through the hosts of strength, power and might, and He is the Exalted, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>Concerning the matter of partnership about which they wrote, permission was first granted as previously explained, and now it has been referred to the honored Ism’u’llah [Name of God]. He will write you the details. All the gentlemen – may the Most Glorious Glory of God be upon them – have the utmost love for you. Their purpose in mentioning these matters is to protect wealth from the thieves and traitors of the world. For instance, when the honored Mulla Ali – may God’s peace be upon him – received a sum of people’s money in trust to sell in Aleppo and its surroundings, after arriving at his destination, divine decree overtook him and that true bird ascended on the wings of certitude. Immediately the people’s money was seized, and the consul of Aleppo auctioned it off and disposed of it before news could reach its owners and they could claim their property. The actual money disappeared - where is trustworthiness? Where is religion? Where is truthfulness? Where is purity? All these have become as rare as the philosopher’s stone, nay rather, non-existent. In any case, it is for this reason that they have written what they have written. It is quite clear and evident that whatever you possess, you consider it to be from God. This servant, with utmost humility and supplication, begs that at all times blessings may descend upon you from the heaven of bounty like a torrential rain. He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty. The sent fabric arrived. You have always taken trouble and continue to do so. May God, exalted be His glory, grant you abundant reward. Verily, He has power over all things and is worthy to answer prayers.</p>

<p>Praise be to that Desired One Who is worthy and befitting of all praise, Whose love is the cause of unity among all the peoples of the world, and servitude unto Whom is the cause of salvation. Glory be unto Him! Glory be unto Him! Verily praise cannot reach the court of His might, and mention cannot attain the threshold of His sanctity. Whatever is composed of letters and expressed in words is created - how can it be worthy of the most holy and exalted Court of the Desired One, Who hath created the world with a single word? In any case, since He hath commanded us to praise Him, we praise Him, and since He hath enjoined love, we attribute ourselves to Him in all conditions and seek from the ocean of His grace that which pleaseth Him.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O our God! Aid us to remember Thee and praise Thee, and to accomplish that which will improve the affairs of Thy servants. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayer.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter arrived and was received. After it was read and understood, it was presented at the Holy Threshold, and He said:</p>
<p>O thou who gazest toward the Most Sublime Horizon! This Wronged One hath, from the earliest days until now, accepted countless afflictions for the unity of God’s servants. How many nights in the prison of Tihran did He endure the cruelty of enemies. If ye were to count the tribulations of the Wronged One, ye could not reckon them. Repeatedly were We imprisoned and banished, and from land to land were We carried, until finally the prison of ’Akka was designated as Our abode. These fleeting days of the world have never been, nor are they now, worthy of any attention. Man must strive to prepare for God’s infinite worlds and arise with complete determination to accomplish that which is pleasing to the Friend. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist His loved ones in that which He loveth and is pleased with.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that thou hast been confirmed, and what thou hast written is correct and acceptable. Regarding Aqa Muhammad-Rahim, upon him be the Glory of God, permission hath been granted, but his journey dependeth upon his own desire. As for thy temporary stay in that land, permission hath also been granted, but thou must observe wisdom. Aqa Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, also hath permission to set out, that is, to make the journey.</p>
<p>This servant seeketh from God that He may assist His loved ones in that which will cause the reformation of the world and the education of its peoples. I convey greetings, praise, love and affection to Aqa Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, and I say that deeds performed for God’s sake will not remain nor ever shall remain concealed. A pure deed is like the spring rain - its effects are manifest and evident. I beseech God to assist him in that which will transform the sorrows of that land into joy and delight, that the seeds of love, affection, unity and concord may sprout forth.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, he hath intended to make the journey, and this intention hath been accepted. After it was presented before Him, He said: “God willing, may he be assisted in that which is the cause and means of eternal salvation. Praise be to God, he hath attained unto that which most people are observed to be deprived of. Now he must strive, perchance he may become the cause of awakening those who sleep and the salvation of the heedless.” We beseech God to assist him to turn toward the Wronged One, that he may hear and see. Verily He is the Lord of all creation. There is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>This Wronged One hath ever desired the good of God’s servants and commanded love, affection, kindness, unity and concord, and such deeds and character as would cause the manifestation of human perfections. God sufficeth as a witness.</p>
<p>God willing, may all be assisted and enabled to act according to that which hath been mentioned. This servant mentioneth in His presence that which would cause the light of unity to be acquired. Indeed, it hath been long since we have seen him. It would be most excellent if he would come, both to be freed from sorrows for a while and to attain the most great bounty. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist us in that which He loveth and is pleased with.</p>
<p>You wrote nothing about your spiritual friend, that spiritual youth, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors. Wherever he may be, God’s favor hath been and is with him. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon him and upon every steadfast, firm and upright one, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>The remembrance of God to all who are in the heavens and on earth. Through it the spirit of life was breathed into the world. Blessed are they who know. Verily it is the Lamp of God unto all who are in the worlds. When it issueth forth from the mouth of God the whole creation is perfumed with its fragrance, yet none can perceive it save those who have turned to His Countenance with manifest sincerity. At times thou seest it as fire among the righteous, and at times as water whereby God quickeneth every mouldering bone, and at times in human form. Blessed be the All-Merciful Who hath sent it forth with truth and caused it to speak with verses that all within the heavens and earth cannot equal. Blessed are they who reflect! Say: If ye desire the Sun, behold, it hath appeared in its form and hath shone forth from the horizon of might and power with rays that have encompassed the worlds. From it all things draw their sustenance, and verily it is the Most Great Bounty unto all who are in the realm of possibility, yet the people are debarred therefrom by following their desires, save those who have cast away what they possessed and taken what they were bidden by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. At times thou seest it as the surging ocean, and from each of its waves thou hearest: “This is He at Whose mention God’s scrolls were sent down aforetime, and this is He Who was promised you in God’s Tablets - the Sovereign, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Praised.” And verily it is the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. Blessed is he who dwelleth beneath its shade; he is indeed of those who have attained. Then doth the Tree lament what hath befallen it from the heedless ones, when the people stone it with the rocks of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Verily it speaketh the truth and calleth all unto God, the Mighty, the Peerless. They are barred by what they possess from what God possesseth. Fie upon them for having broken God’s Covenant and His Testament, and for having followed every obstinate infidel! Is there anyone who will abandon prejudice and look with the eye of fairness? Nay, by My life! None shall attain thereunto save honored servants who have rent asunder the veils in the name of God, the Lord of Names, and have arisen among the people with this all-compelling Remembrance of what was and what is to come. Such is the station of the lions of possibility, not of the foxes of earth. Thus hath the Pen of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, spoken the truth. O My loved ones! By God, ye are the stars of the heaven of power. All good hath been created for you, did ye but know it. Grieve not for what hath escaped you. It behooveth everyone possessed of glory to serve you and circle round about you. How wonderful is this praiseworthy station! Subdue hearts through the name of the Best-Beloved and adorn your heads with the crown of the remembrance of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Leave carrion to the dogs and immerse yourselves in the ocean of detachment. Thus doth the Lord of creation command you. Blessed are the people who understand. Ponder the state of the people and what they possess, that thou mayest be assured that they wander distraught in the wilderness of error and are unaware. They acknowledge what was revealed aforetime yet fail to recognize it. Have they recognized the Resurrection and what hath appeared therein? Nay, by My Self, they are a blind people. They say the Bridge is true, and the Balance is true, and Paradise is true, and Hell is true, and the Hour is sure to come. Yet when thou questionest them about what they mention, thou findest them in the darkness of ignorance. Lo! They are the heedless ones. If thou asketh them about the Qa’im, they say He is in a known place. They speak that which causeth children to laugh, let alone those servants who have soared in the atmosphere of knowledge and are assured of God’s signs. We have rent asunder those veils for the people of the Bayan and taught them what We desired through Our grace. Verily thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Yet when We removed the veil from them, thou findest them in a greater veil than before. Lo! They are confounded! Among them are those who have attained the presence of God and His manifestation, and have drunk the choice wine of life in the name of their Lord, the All-Merciful, detached from every idolater and outcast. And among them are those who have clung to the fancies of the past and have been prevented by the contrived succession from Him by Whose finger the Preserved Tablet was inscribed. We see him more veiled than the followers of the Furqan. To this testifieth the Lord of Religions, but the people hear not. Say: Fear God and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who possesseth knowledge of all things, did ye but know. This is He Who, were He to rule on earth as in heaven, none would have the right to object, as attesteth He Who came with the truth through this Most Great Name. Say: O people, purify your hearts and ears from that which ye have heard from the followers of the Furqan. By God, they possessed naught but their own desires which appeared unto them thus. Thus did their souls entice them, and they were among the worshippers. Blessed is he who remaineth steadfast in the Cause, and the strong one who rendeth the veils asunder through the power of his Lord. He is indeed among the firmly rooted. Grieve not at what the idolaters say. Hearken unto that which the Tongue of Grandeur uttereth from the right hand of the luminous Spot: “This is My Beauty wherewith We have revealed Ourselves unto all who are in the heavens and on earth.” Were the breezes of God’s Word to pass over thee, thou wouldst be so attracted that thou wouldst cast aside the people and all that they possess, calling out with this Most Great Name. When thou art illumined by the lights of the Tablet, turn with thy heart to the Kaaba of Glory and Power. Say: Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me through the tongue of the Wronged One while He was imprisoned in the hands of the oppressors.</p>

<p>O Sabri Effendi!</p>
<p>He is the One Who calleth betwixt earth and heaven!</p>
<p>This is a mention from Us unto him who hath attained the presence of God and won His most sweet call and appeared before the Throne and toward whom was directed the gaze of God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting, and who circled round the Cause for successive years - to this doth My Most Exalted Pen bear witness in this glorious and beloved station. Grieve thou not over aught; that which shall gladden thy heart hath been ordained for thee. Verily thy Lord is the Giver, the Mighty, the Loving. Remember when thou didst attain Our presence before the Throne time and again and didst hear the call of the Wronged One in this exalted Stronghold. Beware lest the affairs of the world sadden thee. Remember thy Lord, the Possessor of all names, at morn and eventide. He verily will protect thee in truth. He is, in truth, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>Know then that thy letter hath come before Our face and hath won the gaze of Him by Whose name every witness and witnessed thing doth speak. Be thou assured of thy Lord’s grace. Verily He remembereth him who remembereth Him and desireth him who desireth Him in His praiseworthy station. The Sun of Permission hath dawned from the horizon of the will of the Lord of Destiny, through Whose bidding the Greatest Vision appeared and every stone and clod did speak: “The Promised One is come and that which was recorded in the preserved tablet hath appeared.”</p>
<p>The Most Exalted Pen declareth: Praise be to God that through divine favor thou didst abide for numbered years beneath the shade of the divine Lote-Tree, and now too the Sun of Permission shineth upon that which thou didst desire. He will verily aid thee in what He willeth. He is indeed the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thou shouldst turn to the land of the All-Merciful with utmost joy and radiance and, according to thy capacity, occupy thyself with the mention and praise of the Beloved of the world, that perchance the slumbering may awaken and the dead be quickened by the living waters.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the world! The morn of hope hath dawned and the sun of knowledge shineth from the horizon of insight. While time remaineth, deprive not yourselves of the everlasting bounty and strive that ye may not be deprived of the spiritual waters in the divine days. Be not gladdened by the world and whatsoever is therein. By the life of God! Every treasure hath been and is the cause of sorrow, grief, and infinite regret. Never hath any transient thing been the cause of independence, nor shall it ever be. Ere long shall all be seen to be non-existent save what God, the Mighty, the Forgiving, the Generous, hath ordained. God willing, thou shouldst speak of the love of God with utmost steadfastness, be occupied with remembrance of the Peerless Friend, and conduct thyself with perfect wisdom. He will assuredly assist thee through His grace, and He is verily the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>The tribulations of this Wronged One in the horizons have been evident to thee. After successive years when the Ancient Beauty opened the prison gate through the key of power and turned toward the plain of Akka, how many vexations and matters that would waste the Cause of God arose, to such an extent that their mention is not permissible. Ask thou God to enable His loved ones to do what He loveth and pleaseth and to make them of those who move not except by His will, who cling to naught but His hem, and who speak naught but His beautiful praise.</p>
<p>Had this land been as God desired it, We would not have given thee permission to depart. However, since upheavals are observed both outwardly and inwardly therein, We have given thee permission to proceed to another land, that perchance some souls may become mindful and turn their gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon. He is verily the Ordainer, the All-Knowing. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have won this Cause and believed in God, the Single One, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O thou who circlest round the Throne! Hearken unto the call from the realm of bounty - verily there is no God but Me, the Forgiving, the Generous. My Most Exalted Pen desireth to make mention of thy mother who turned toward the direction of the Throne and sacrificed herself in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. We testify that she attained the presence of God and heard the call of her Lord when the Desired One was seated upon the throne of His mercy that hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Grieve not for her - verily she hath ascended unto the Sadratu’l-Muntaha, the Most Exalted Horizon, and the Supreme Companion. He beareth witness to this, by Whose will all things move. Thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have crowned her with the crown of remembrance in this exalted station. All things shall perish save this remembrance which hath today flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur and Power. Verily thy Lord is the Bestower, the Bountiful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed is she and blessed are they who remember her after her passing, and the splendor of God rest upon her from His presence, the Beloved of them that know.</p>
<p>We make mention of the loved ones of God in that land and We send Our greetings to their faces from this mighty and wondrous station. When thou seest them, give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness, My favors and My mercy that have encompassed all things great and small. Say: Ye are remembered before the Throne. Beware lest the signs of the world make you sorrowful. Remember your Lord, the Most Merciful, at morn and at eventide. The splendor of God be upon you and upon those who love you and make mention of you and hold fast unto the cord of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Mighty, the Eternal, the Self-Subsisting!</p>
<p>This is the Book which guideth unto righteousness. God hath made it a proof and a remembrance for all who are in the heavens and on earth. There is no doubt therein. It hath been sent down in truth from the presence of One Who is All-Wise, All-Informed. Therein is that which guideth men to the paradise of eternity and draweth them nigh unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Therein hath the Point of Knowledge been expounded and the words of God have appeared in a clear Arabic tongue. Thus do We set forth the verses for you and cast upon you that which will guide you unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Therein doth God command His servants to observe pure justice, and this is His grace unto all created things.</p>
<p>O people! Be guided by the guidance of God and follow not your desires, nor be ye of them that turn aside. Say: Verily the Morn of divine revelation hath breathed forth from the presence of One Who is exalted and great. Say: Verily the Sun hath shone forth from the presence of a mighty and powerful Sovereign. Beware that ye grieve not over anything, but rather rejoice with the joy of God and enter the holy paradise, a noble and glorious seat. Beware that ye think not evil of God and sell not the Joseph of Faith for a paltry price, but enter the Egypt of certitude in the presence of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>Know ye that God had servants before you who migrated with His chosen ones, and the idolaters gathered against them until matters reached such a pass that they strove with them until they were all slain and martyred in the ways of God, the Powerful, the Most High, the All-Knowing. Among them is the true account of Husayn, when he departed from his home with his family and companions, as ye hear tell each day and hour. The hosts of unbelief surrounded them from every side and prevented them from returning to God’s sacred sanctuary. The armies of infidelity rose against them and cut off all means of entry and exit. Ye have heard all this from these idolaters who exhort others but exhort not themselves, who mention God and His loved ones from the pulpits yet in their hearts are not among those who remember.</p>
<p>When matters grew severe for God’s companions, they strove with their wealth and their lives to such a degree that the eyes of the Concourse on High were directed toward them and the angels drawn nigh were bewildered, until they sacrificed their souls and spirits in the path of their Lord. The ornaments of earthly dominion deterred them not, nor did love of anything hold them back. They hastened to God’s good-pleasure with great joy. Their spirits ascended to the Supreme Companion and their eyes were solaced by beholding the lights in a holy and noble dwelling-place.</p>
<p>O company of emigrants! Ye have migrated in the paths of your Creator, yet no adversity or hardship hath touched you, nor hath the slightest harm befallen you. Ye have traversed paths of glory in this journey of yours, and the people have welcomed you in every land and accompanied you from every city until ye arrived at a glorious and resplendent spot. Beware lest your hearts be straitened. Waste not your right, nor count your faith as a favor to God. Rather, God bestoweth favor upon you in that He hath guided you unto Himself, granted you His presence, and chosen you from among all created things. Know ye that God hath ordained no station for anyone save in following His command, and this is indeed a mighty matter in God’s presence. Apart from this, none shall be mentioned before God even should he rule over all beneath the sun. This is a certain truth.</p>
<p>If God should command any of the kings to sweep the threshold of the place wherein His Name is raised, this would be better for him than the sovereignty of the past and future. Verily His command is binding upon all His servants - this is His bounty unto them though He needeth them not, and He is indeed independent of all creation. Say: O people! Burn not the fruits of your deeds with the fire of your vain imaginings, and be not among the veiled ones. Say: God hath reckoned up your fancies and whatsoever was in your hearts, and with Him lieth the knowledge of the hidden things of the heavens and earth, if ye be of them that are assured. O ye emigrants! Give thanks unto God, your Creator, and be not heedless of that wherewith God hath preferred you above His servants and guided you unto the path of mighty righteousness. Sanctify your souls and follow not your desires, nor walk in the footsteps of them unto whom God hath given no light. Follow instead him who hath come unto you with clear authority and reciteth unto you the verses in a wondrous, pleasing tongue. Know ye that God hath ordained for you that which He hath ordained for none before you, such that your names are mentioned in the company of all worlds. Can there be conceived in all creation any station greater than this? Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! Therefore rejoice within yourselves, then be patient in the Cause of God and in whatsoever befalleth you in His path, and be not of them that are perturbed. Ye shall find your deeds preserved with God in the Book wherein no deed of the doers shall be left unrecorded. Thus hath the Tablet been completed though the mysteries of the Pen are not exhausted, wherefore We say: We are content, O our Lord, with what Thou hast decreed and wilt decree, and We say: Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>The representation of this evanescent one before the Afnan of the Divine Lote-Tree - may my spirit be a sacrifice for their love - is that the blessed, radiant and manifest leaf from which wafted the fragrances of the love of the Beloved of the worlds, and from which emanated the perfume of the garment of the All-Glorious’ affection, adorned with the name of His Holiness Ismu’llah M.H. - upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious - reached this servant, this evanescent attendant. For some days His Holiness has departed from before the Throne to those regions, and since he was not present, it became incumbent upon this servant to respond to your letter on his behalf. Praise be to God that your letter became the cause of boundless joy and gladness. We beseech God to gladden the heart and ears at all times through the perusal of your noble letter and exalted discourse, for verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Several days ago when His Holiness Aqay-i-Ismu’llah was present, your letter which was written to him was sent to the Most Holy Court, and in response to certain passages therein, wondrous and sublime words were revealed from the heaven of divine will and dispatched. God willing, they will have reached you by now. Concerning what you wrote about the severity in the prison-city, that which was destined has come to pass, and praise be to God, in these days the fragrance of security has wafted, and the corruption, enmity and wickedness of those impure souls has become evident and manifest to most of the people of the city. Some of the prisoners have been released, and seven specified individuals spend most of their time with utmost joy and delight traversing the marketplaces and associating with the companions during the day, except that they return to prison at night. In brief, there has been and continues to be perfect ease and expansiveness, though the people of this city are by nature corrupt and hypocritical, as they are counted among the people of Syria. This is the utterance of His mighty grandeur where He says: “Its people are the most wicked of men and its land the best of lands, except for the lands which God hath specially ordained by His command - verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” However, at this time they are quiescent.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about sending copies of the sublime Tablets to the land of ?ad, it is evident that your honor has always girded up the loins of service and has made and will continue to make mighty efforts in spreading the verses and signs of God. Blessed are you and blessed is he who holds fast unto you in the love of God.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the loved ones in the land of Kha, it was presented at the Most Holy Court. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke: “It behooveth them to thank God for having caused them to recognize the Dawning-Place of His Self, the One Who dominates all who are in the heavens and on earth. We beseech Him to aid them to serve Him and to remain steadfast in His Cause. Verily this is a mighty matter and a great bounty.” End quote.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the son of that distinguished person, it was presented before the Throne. Verses have been revealed for them both that are unequaled by anyone in the kingdom, and the original revelation was sent.</p>
<p>Concerning what you mentioned about the base sinner and his return to hell, this is what God promised in the Book - verily our Lord is severe in punishment. For after that sublime Book was sent to him, the divine proof was completed against him from all directions, yet he remains in astonishing heedlessness. Therefore there was revealed unto him from the Kingdom of Power that which returned him to a wretched station. And regarding what was written about Haji Husayn and the deeds of that sinful one, upon him be the curse of God, it is evident that this smoke arises from that fire. However, in that detailed Tablet which was revealed to that sinful one himself, at its end a passage was revealed indicating that a soul from among that group would attain to the truth. In any case, each one acts according to his way, and that which befell Haji Husayn was in the path of God. We beseech God to assist him in all conditions. The details concerning him were presented before the Divine Throne. Expressions of loving-kindness have dawned and become manifest from the Dayspring of Divine mercy in relation to him, and it was stated that such known opposers have no need of teaching, for after the wondrous account We commanded all to observe supreme wisdom and to protect the accepted souls.</p>
<p>In any case, convey countless greetings from this evanescent servant to the aforementioned Haji and say that praise be to God that there befell you what befell the loved ones of God in this land. And further, it is requested that on behalf of this servant they convey wondrous and exalted greetings to each and every one of the Afnan of God and His loved ones. May my spirit be sacrificed for their love. We beseech God to assist me in mentioning them in His Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Wondrous, Most Pure, Most Mighty and Most Impregnable Court.</p>

<p>He is the Mighty, the Witnessed One!</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my Lord and my Beloved! I render thanks unto Thee for the wondrous favors of Thy oneness, which Thou hast caused to flow forth and hast sent down from the heaven of Thy holy Being. And we praise Thee, O my Heart’s Desire, for that which Thou hast manifested of the gems of Thy bounty that have filled the pillars of the heavens and have encompassed and embraced all who dwell within the realms of contingent beings. And for that which the Daysprings of Thy power have brought forth from the most exalted station - the station of the throne of Thy grandeur - until its manifestations reached the lands of Thy creation, whereby the waves of the ocean of Thy oneness surged in all things, and from all things flowed forth the streams of Thy singular bounty.</p>
<p>By Thy might, O my God! Thy favors have attained such heights that no point can be seen in Thy kingdom but that from it have been detailed the mysteries of the wisdom of the sovereignty of Thy Lordship, and no speck of dust can be found but that it testifies of itself, by itself, to Thy unity through that which hath shone upon it from the effulgences of the lights of Thy oneness. And since such is the condition of Thy creation, how can anyone attain unto Thee or describe Thy beauty?</p>
<p>Therefore do I bear witness before Thee, and call to witness the denizens of the Supreme Concourse and the dwellers of the pavilions of eternity, that Thou hast ever been sanctified above the description of all contingent beings and wilt ever remain hallowed beyond the mention of all created things. All eyes are fixed upon the dawning of the lights of the beauty of Thy handiwork whereby Thou hast created all beings, all minds are bewildered before the signs of Thy majesty whereby Thou hast encompassed all things visible, all souls are thunderstruck before the manifestations of Thy self-subsistence whereby Thou hast revealed all things mentioned.</p>
<p>All this, O my God, is but of the wondrous gifts Thou hast bestowed upon the people of Thy kingdom and the gems of Thy bounty upon Thy creatures, without being asked. How then, O my God, when one of Thy servants asks of Thee or one of Thy bondsmen seeks from Thee? May the self that would ask of Thee that which befitteth not Thy station be nonexistent, and may the being that would seek from Thee that which is unworthy of Thy presence be no more!</p>
<p>By Thy might, O my Beloved! He who hath drunk the wine of Thy beauty will hope for naught save meeting Thee, and he who hath attained unto the remembrance of Thy love will find no rest save in reunion with Thee, and he who hath tasted the sweetness of Thy nearness, how can he be patient in Thy remoteness and separation? Nay, by Thy might! The hearts of the lovers will find no peace save in the precincts of Thy mercy, and the souls of the yearning ones will find no rest save beneath the shade of Thy providence.</p>
<p>Glorified, glorified art Thou, O my Lord, my God, my Object of worship, my One before Whom I prostrate, the Beloved of my heart and the Physician of my soul! I have ever wished to extol the wondrous praise of Thee, yet have found myself powerless to do so, for I observe that my praise is but a sign of Thy eternal handiwork, no more than the buzzing of a bee in the wilderness of Thy power, or the chirping of an ant in the desert of Thy might and sovereignty. How then can my praise ascend to the heaven of Thy holy mercy whereunto the hearts of none of Thy chosen ones have soared? And how can my description reach that station which the minds of none of Thy near ones have attained?</p>
<p>Yet, O my God, when I observe that the praise which floweth from my pen, or issueth from my tongue, or is manifested in my works, is naught but from the wondrous tokens of Thy supreme power and can only be realized through the gems of Thy most great handiwork, then is my heart assured, my being gladdened, and my reality made joyful, for Thy handiwork is naught but a mirror of Thy beauty, and in Thy deed naught can be seen save the lights of the glory of Thy Being and Thy majesty. For were any imperfection […] from deficiency or flaw must needs return unto its Creator and testifieth to its Originator. Far, far be it from me to behold in Thy handiwork aught save the effulgent splendors of Thine unity, or to see therein aught except the treasuries of Thy holy wisdom. Whatsoever proceedeth from me or floweth from my pen can only be through Thy power and might, and whatsoever is prompted by Thy will and manifested by Thy strength. How could it be befitting to the sovereignty of Thine essence or worthy of the court of Thy glorious dominion? Nay, by Thy resplendent beauty, all that cometh from Thee befitteth Thy presence and is worthy of Thy beauty. This is of the certitude wherewith Thou didst create me and establish me in the kingdom of Thy creation and the dominion of Thy command. Therefore, O my God, were all that I have mentioned in this luminous, radiant Tablet to be reckoned as a single letter, it would contain all that beseemeth Thy station and glory - a truth beyond all doubt, for verily Thou art its Manifestor, Creator, Originator, Maker, and Fashioner. Since this is so, I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst cool the fire in the hearts of them that love Thee, and through which the breezes of reunion wafted over the hearts of Thy loved ones, to aid those who have sought shelter beneath the Sadratu’l-Muntaha in the vicinity of Thy Most Exalted Name. Then raise them up through Thy most sublime exaltation, and turn them toward the shore of eternity, and sanctify them from all that existeth in the realm of creation. Then gather them, O my God, before Thee at the appearance of Thy beauty in Thy final Manifestation, for verily Thou doest what Thou willest, and Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>O Name of Generosity! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of existence. Thou didst send the letter from Ali Haydar, upon him be my glory. The Most Great Branch presented it before the Presence and it was honored to be heard. Praise be to God that the aforementioned one hath been assisted to serve the Cause - a great success indeed. Say: My God, my God! Aid him who hath turned unto Thee and discovered the fragrances of Revelation in Thy days, and who hath been so intoxicated by the choice-sealed wine that he hath cast aside vain imaginings, holding fast to the cord of Thy grace and that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. O Lord! Illumine his heart with the light of Thy knowledge in such wise that the horizons may be illumined thereby. Verily Thou art the Lord of the Day of Mutual Disillusion. O Lord! Thou seest him standing in service to Thee, gazing toward Thy horizon, hoping for that which lieth with Thee. I beseech Thee by the pavilion of Thy glory and the tabernacles of Thy grandeur and that which hath flowed from the Pen of Thy Command, to ordain for him that which shall profit him in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Name of Generosity! Convey greetings from the Wronged One and give him the glad-tidings of the appearance of the Best-Beloved of the worlds. He hath ever been and continues to be mentioned in the Most Holy and Exalted Court. As for what was mentioned concerning Mirza Ali Akbar and Mirza Muhammad, upon them be the Glory of God, it was honored to be heard. We make mention of them both that perchance the remembrance of God, the Lord of Names, may draw them nigh unto the Most Exalted Horizon and grant them the good of this world and the next. There is none other God but He, the Omnipotent, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Ali before Akbar! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee from the prison and calleth thee to God, the Lord of the worlds. Cast aside the suspicions and idle fancies of men and take hold of that which thou art commanded by God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say: By God! The horizon of Revelation hath been illumined by the Day-star of certitude. Come ye, come ye, O people of the earth, and be not of the heedless ones. This is the Day which the Point of the Bayan foretold, and before Him Muhammad the Apostle of God, and before Him the Spirit, and before Him He Who conversed with God. Say: The Mother Book hath appeared, would ye but hear, and the Sovereign of utterance hath come, would ye but perceive. Take hold of the Tablet of God with the power that proceedeth from Him and remind the people of that which hath been revealed therein from God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Say: Fear ye God, then judge fairly concerning that which hath appeared in truth, and be not of those who understand not. The ocean of knowledge hath surged in the contingent world and the river of mercy hath flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto the heedless ones. This is the Day whereon the Herald hath called out from every direction and the Cry hath been raised in truth, yet most of the people do not understand. Thus hath the heaven of knowledge revealed its stars and the sea of utterance its waves. Blessed is he who hath heard and seen and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds, and glory be unto Thee, O Desire of them who have recognized Thee!”</p>
<p>We make mention of Muhammad who was mentioned in the book of one who loved Me and arose to serve My mighty Cause. O Muhammad! By God! The promise hath come to pass and this is the Day whereon men have stood before the Lord of the worlds. We were foretold of it by Him Who conversed with God aforetime. Bring forth the people from darkness into light and remind them of the days of God. Say: The Day hath come and He Who conversed on Sinai speaketh: Verily there is no God but Him, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Behold, then mention what the people of the Furqan committed when the All-Merciful came with manifest sovereignty. The divines and doctors of the earth turned away from Him and pronounced judgment against Him with such injustice as caused the denizens of the Kingdom and the dwellers of the Realm of Might to lament. Say: My God, my God! The fragrance of Thy raiment hath been diffused throughout Thy realms and the tokens of Thy greatness have been spread abroad throughout Thy lands. By Thy glory, O Thou the Goal of the world and the Beloved of the nations! The breezes of Thy Revelation have so carried me away that I have turned toward Thy most exalted horizon, clinging to the cord of Thy grace, O Thou Lord of Names and Creator of heaven! I beseech Thee by Thy Cause to ordain for me through the Pen of Thy Command that which Thou didst ordain for Thy chosen ones who attained unto the Greater Steadfastness in such wise that the oppression of the world did not deter them, and they arose and proclaimed: “The Sovereign Lord hath come! The Kingdom is God’s, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed!”</p>
<p>O my Lord! Disappoint me not through Thy bounty, nor debar me from the oceans of Thy mercy and the rain of Thy grace. O my Lord! Thou beholdest the poor one standing before the gate of Thy riches. I beseech Thee to assist him to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee and to serve Thy Cause. Thou art, verily, powerful to do what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Ali Haydar! Rejoice in the bounty of thy Lord. The Tablet began with the name of the All-Bountiful - upon Him be My glory - and ended with thy name - upon thee be the glory of God and His favors. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist thee through the means of the seen and the unseen, and to enable thee to achieve that which shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. There is none other God but He, the Forgiving, the Kind. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon him and upon thee and upon those who have quaffed the choice wine of utterance in My Name, the Self-Subsisting, and the Kawthar of proof through My remembrance, the Inevitable, and the Salsabil of certitude through My beautiful praise.</p>

<p>In His Name, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful</p>
<p>O my God! There hath come before Thee from Thy servant a letter wherein he hath acknowledged Thy unity and confessed Thy oneness, and hath sought pardon from the ocean of Thy bounty and Thy favors for himself and for others among Thy loved ones. O Lord! Sprinkle upon them from the oceans of Thy bounty and Thy gifts that which shall purify them from the mention of aught else but Thee and shall sanctify them from beholding aught except Thyself, and illumine them with the lights of the Sun of Thy countenance which hath shone forth from Thy most exalted horizon and hath illumined the earth and heaven. Then cause them to drink from the Kawthar of immortality through the hands of grace and bestowal in this Dawn whereby the horizon of divine knowledge hath been illumined and the Day-Star of certitude hath appeared, that they may witness the sanctity of Thy Being from all peers and the exemption of Thine Essence from all likeness. O Lord! Clothe them with the robes of Thy forgiveness and adorn them with that which Thou hast willed in Thy days. Verily Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou pleasest. Thou givest and Thou withholdest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O Lord my God, by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the earth and heaven, and through which Thy sealed wine was unsealed for the people of creation, to aid Thy servant Javad to exalt Thy Word in Thy kingdom, whereby hearts may be drawn to the Dayspring of Thy revelation and the Source of Thy inspiration, and whereby the denizens of the graves may hasten to the Manifestation of the appearance of the light of Thy Being and the Source of the revelation of the fire of the Tree of Thy Divinity. Then rend asunder through him the veils of imitation, that the Sun of divine unity may appear to all who dwell in Thy earth and heaven. O Lord! Thou knowest that I have desired naught save what Thou hast desired, and have spoken naught save what Thou hast inspired me through Thy bounty and favor. I have arisen by Thy power to promote Thy Cause and have summoned all to the heaven of Thy knowledge and the ocean of Thy grace, in such wise that neither the oppression of kings hath deterred me from Thy remembrance and praise, nor the clamor of the peoples from describing Thee and revealing Thy Cause. I have openly conveyed unto them that which Thou didst command. Praise be unto Thee for having made me the guardian over Thy creation and creatures in such wise that the might of the oppressors and the power of the tyrants hath not weakened me. I have manifested Thy all-compelling Will and Thy all-encompassing Purpose, and have revealed that which lay hidden in Thy recorded scriptures and Thy revealed tablets. Praise be unto Thee–praise whereby the sincere ones may soar to the most exalted heights and the near ones to the Uttermost Tree. And praise be unto Thee–praise whereby Thy traces shall be established and Thy laws shall be manifested. And praise be unto Thee in whatsoever Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily Thou art the Ruler over whatsoever Thou pleasest.</p>
<p>Moreover, I beseech Thee, O my God, to enable my loved ones to arise to serve Thy Cause and to aid Thy Faith. Verily, Thou art He to Whose power and might all created things have testified, and to Whose grandeur and sovereignty all things possible have borne witness. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest through Thy command that prevaileth over the worlds. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>In His Name, Who speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance.</p>
<p>Verily We desired to set forth the verses unto thee in yet another setting, for He is indeed the Omnipotent, the All-Choosing, that the fragrances of revelation might draw thee in such wise that thou mayest arise amidst all creation in the name of thy Lord, the Creator of invention, and point with thy right hand toward the East and proclaim: “By God! The Dayspring of divine knowledge hath shed its radiance!” and with thy left hand rend asunder the veils of the peoples of the West through this Name whereby the idols were struck down and religions were shaken. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and from it We perceived the fragrance of thy love for God. We have sent down unto thee this Tablet whereby the breezes of divine knowledge have wafted and the fragrances of forgiveness have been diffused throughout all possibility. We beseech God to aid thee in His service in such wise that thou mayest rend asunder the veils of men and summon them unto sanctity and detachment and unto deeds that befit the days of their Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Verily, when We arrived at the Most Great Prison, We once again summoned the Manifestations of power unto God, the Revealer of verses. The world so deluded them that they cast behind them that which they were bidden by God, the Lord of Names, and took that which would lead them back to the fire. Soon shall they know that which hath escaped them in the Cause of God, and shall lament their lot. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Be thou as a bird soaring in the atmosphere of love and knowledge, and rising from the horizon of utterance with such remembrance as shall attract the minds and cause bodies to take wing. Say: O people! The Salsabil hath flowed and the seal of the choice wine hath been broken. Turn ye, then drink in the name of Him Who is the Overlord of all existence. Beware lest the clamor of the idolaters prevent thee or the might of the wicked frighten thee. Remember God with joy and fragrance, and with the wisdom We have sent down from the heaven of revelation and inspiration, that through thy remembrance every slumberer may arise, every heedless one may turn, and every hesitant doubter may hasten. Thus hath the Dove warbled and the Cock of Paradise crowed, that thy heart may rejoice and thou mayest aid thy Lord, the Lord of all mankind. We had previously sent down unto thee a Tablet in the Persian tongue most sweet, and following the arrival of thy letter, this Tablet in the most eloquent language, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Verily, the glory rest upon thee and upon those who have attained unto this Day wherein all things have proclaimed: “The kingdom belongeth unto God, the Cleaver of the daybreak!”</p>

Blessed is the servant who hath cast away transgression and wickedness and taken hold of righteousness and godliness, as bidden by the Ancient Commander. We have sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs. Joy be to him who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto every heedless and remote one. We have mentioned thy father who hath ascended unto the Supreme Companion with a remembrance whereby have been enraptured the hearts of them that know. The glory be upon him and upon thee and upon those whom God hath related unto thee, from God, the Forgiving, the Generous. We have mentioned each one of them, both men and women, with that whereby the eyes of them that know have been solaced.</p>
<p>O Abu-Turab! The All-Bestower hath come at the final return, yet the people are in doubt and schism. The light hath shone forth through that which the Speaker of the Mount hath uttered, yet most of the people remain heedless and turned away. Their pride hath held them back from the Sovereign of the Manifestation, and their vain imaginings have veiled them from turning unto the Dayspring of certitude. We make mention of thy son who was named Taqi and give him the glad-tidings of My grace and loving-kindness and the light of My bounty whereby the horizons have been illumined.</p>
<p>O Abd-i-Azim! The Lord of the Day of Judgment maketh mention of thee on this manifest Day with a remembrance whereby the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath wafted throughout all possibility. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having guided me unto the horizon of Thy manifestation while the people were in darkness and error. I beseech from the heaven of Thy grace that which beseemeth Thy bounty, for Thou art the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. His be the praise and glory for having aided His loved ones to turn towards Him and for having sent down unto them that which shall endure throughout ages and centuries.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-i-Ibrahim! He Who was named Muhammad-i-Ali, who circled round the Throne time and again and appeared before the Face at eventide and at dawn, maketh mention of thee. It behooveth thee to render thanks unto God for having aided thee in a Cause from which the servants were held back on the Day of Return. We have mentioned the friends of God before and after, and We shall continue to mention them despite every ignorant deceiver.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-i-Qabli-Husayn! After thy departure from that great city, a fire of malice was ignited therein. The oppressor hath ripped open the she-camel of trustworthiness, devoured the sheep of equity, stung the temple of truthfulness, and committed that which hath caused the pens to lament. He cast truthfulness behind him, clinging to the delusions of his own self. Thus did his soul prompt him. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. The Most Great Law hath wailed, and tears have flowed from the eyes of the faithful at morn and at eventide. He hath violated My sanctity after We had honored him among the servants, turned away from the Wronged One after We had made him a dawning-place for companions, united with God’s enemy in causing Me harm, and together they have committed that which hath caused the temple of justice to swoon and the limbs of the chosen ones in the Most Exalted Paradise to quake. They have wrought that which the Pen is powerless to recount and which the Tablets cannot bear. We have mentioned thee before, and at this hour, as a token of Our grace, for verily I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Pen! Turn thy face toward him who is named Sadiq, then give him to drink of what hath flowed from thee from the Euphrates of loving-kindness and favor. O Sadiq! Verily truthfulness lamenteth and weepeth, and at this moment, beneath the claws of the calumniators, it crieth out saying:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Deliver me through Thy bounty and save me through Thy grace. O Lord! Thou seest how the liar hath wronged me and imprisoned me in the jail of self and passion. I beseech Thee, O Lord of all being, by Thy power that hath encompassed the world and by Thy mercy that hath preceded all peoples, to deliver me. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>

<p>O thou who gazest upon the countenance! At this time thy letter was presented by G.A., and We made mention of thee with that which diffused the fragrance of love and affection. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to open before thy face the door of His blessing and grace, and to make thee a standard of His mention among His creatures. Ask thou God to open the vision of His servants and to make them among the people of justice and fairness. Blessed art thou! He is with thee under all conditions, and aideth whomsoever cleaveth unto Him. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>O Samandar! The Most Great Branch hath made mention of thee at this time and brought thy letter into Our presence. We hearkened unto it. Praise be to God that thy manifest and hidden call is raised for the exaltation of the Word. This is of God’s grace upon thee. Thy recompense hath not been and shall not be lost, and whatsoever thou hast wrought in God’s path hath been recorded in the Book and is preserved from change, alteration and obliteration.</p>
<p>Rejoice thou with this glad tiding: Previously, petitions and letters arrived from that region at the Most Holy Court. The Supreme Pen paused in reply until now. From every direction petitions and letters arrive continuously while time is scarce. However, God willing, in these days answers shall descend from the heaven of loving-kindness and be dispatched. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the loved ones in that land. The letter of Nabil-i-Akbar, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, which he wrote to the servant present, arrived and in these days a reply shall be sent. We have made mention and continue to make mention of Javad, Khalil, their nephew and all other loved ones. Praise be to God, each has attained unto the traces of the Supreme Pen, and mention of all hath repeatedly been made and continueth to be made in the Most Great Scene. Upon them be the glory of God, His loving-kindness, God’s grace and His mercy.</p>
<p>The letter of Darbaghi, upon him be the glory of God, which was sent in the name of Jud, was presented at the Most Holy Court and was seen. Mention was made of a group in that leaf, and at the time of its presentation, the Euphrates of divine mercy was flowing and the rains of grace were pouring down. We beseech God to assist them in deeds which draw them nigh unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Today the faithful must be occupied with the standard of godliness, the banner of detachment, and the hosts of wisdom and utterance in aid of the Cause of the Desired One of the worlds. O Samandar! The Divine Lote-Tree is ablaze in such wise that the worlds of knowledge are powerless to comprehend it; yet the people remain cold. Say: Most of the servants are wandering in the wilderness of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Where is the arm of Thy power, O Desired One of the worlds? And Thou seest them in the desert of hopelessness and error. Where are the breezes of Thy grace, O Deliverer of the worlds?</p>
<p>O Samandar! I complain unto thee of those who attribute themselves to the Wronged One yet perpetrate that which causeth My heart, My pen, and My limbs to lament. Today it hath become clear and evident to most that God’s decree in the Scriptures, Books and Tablets is sanctification and detachment. Some in cities and regions have committed that which causeth the limbs of justice to quake and the heart of equity to be troubled. The loved ones of that land must beseech God and supplicate for justice and fairness for those souls. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. By God’s life! The wrongs suffered by this Wronged One are beyond reckoning. Every fair-minded person and every discerning scholar beareth witness to this.</p>
<p>Mention was made of his honor Yun Kha, upon him be the Glory of God. Praise be to God that they became aware of that which most of the people of the world are heedless, and turned towards a Cause from which all have turned aside save those whom God willed, and hearkened unto that for which ears were specially created from nothingness. They should render thanksgiving unto God, exalted be His glory, throughout the days and nights.</p>
<p>As to permission for the aforementioned one and two others, there hath never been any doubt that this Revelation hath loved and continues to love the presence of the friends, and seeketh for them the bounty of nearness and meeting, and the feast of revelation and witnessing. However, in this land, following the clamor raised by the previous governor, some discussion hath arisen, as hath been revealed in the Tablets from the Supreme Pen. We have therefore withheld permission for the friends, except for those souls who had previously been blessed with the effulgences of the lights of the Luminary of permission. Now, should wisdom require it, they may proceed; otherwise, God shall record for them the reward of attaining His presence in His decisive and perspicuous Book. Give him My greetings and remind him of that which hath been revealed by My Most Exalted Pen in this lofty station which hath been designated as the Most Great Prison by the Ancient Commander. The Glory which proceedeth from Us be upon thee and upon those whose names thou didst mention, for whom the verses of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, were revealed from the Pen of Command, and upon those women who have believed in the All-Informed Single One and have held fast unto the handle of purity and have attained unto that which was revealed in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>

<p>Tablet of Visitation for the Martyrs of the Land of Ya</p>
<p>In My Name, the Sorrowful, the Joyous</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! The greatest calamity hath come to pass, whereby the hearts of the chosen ones have melted, all things have lamented, and the dwellers of the cities of names have wailed. Say: The resplendent Light from the horizon of the heaven of bounty, and the Spirit whereby God quickened the denizens of the most exalted Paradise, and the Peace which God made the glory of Islam, and the manifest and radiant Prayer from the horizon of God’s will, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, be upon you, O Dawning-places of glory and bounty, O Daysprings of detachment in creation, and Sources of beneficence throughout all regions.</p>
<p>I testify that through your remembrance, the hearts of lovers were attracted, and through the ascension of your spirits the decree of unity and concord was made manifest on the Day of the Covenant, the Concourse on High was made joyful, and through the light of your faces the cities of glory and splendor were illumined. I testify that by your calamity the rock cried out, the great cry was raised, and tears flowed from the people of the depths of oneness. I testify that by you and the light of your steadfastness was adorned the brocade of the Book of Faithfulness in the mortal realm of creation, and by your suffering the heart of Baha lamented, His Most Exalted Pen cried out, and the outpouring from the clouds of grace and bounty was cut off.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O Treasures of faithfulness! Alas, alas, O Dawning-places of light in the heaven of praise and remembrance! Through your calamity the ocean of utterance was stilled from its waves, the Lote-Tree from its fruits, and the Sun from its radiance. Verily, those near unto God wandered through deserts and wilderness, mountains and valleys, seeking fragments of your bodies that perchance they might inhale from them the fragrance of the love of God, your Creator, your Beloved, your Goal, your Worshipped One, and your Quickener. Blessed are ye, and blessed is he who loveth you, visiteth you, and visiteth those who visit you.</p>
<p>I testify that ye have attained the most exalted station and the supreme height, and have reached a place wherein God Himself consoleth you, and consoleth your children, your families, and your descendants. Alas, alas, for the injustice whereby the hearts of the highest Paradise and the people of the cities of detachment behind the crimson sea were consumed! Blessed are ye, O Dawning-places of light among mankind, and blessed are ye, O Daysprings of names in creation!</p>
<p>The Wronged One hath ever been speaking of your remembrance, your praise, and what befell you in the path of God. A Countenance from among the countenances of the most exalted Paradise called out and said: “O Beloved of earth and heaven! Through Thy grief the universe well-nigh returned to nothingness. Have mercy upon the world, O Beloved of eternity!” Verily, the Faithful Spirit at this moment hath descended from his most exalted station with hosts of angels and the Spirit to visit Thy loved ones and friends who quaffed the wine of martyrdom in Thy path.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O Knights of the field of detachment! Alas, alas, O Manifestations of the mysteries of martyrdom in creation! I testify that through your calamity the Eye of God wept in His station and the Most Exalted Pen before His face. I testify that the verses lament your afflictions and the evidences cry out at your tribulations. Were it not for you, the mysteries of servitude would not have appeared among creatures, nor the stations of submission and contentment among creation. Ye are they through whose arising to serve the Cause the servants arose to that which God desired in the final return.</p>
<p>I testify that through you the gate of generosity was opened upon the manifestations of existence, and the foundations of ranks and hosts were shaken. I testify that through your acceptance all created things turned toward the Dawning-place of names and attributes, and through your turning all contingent beings faced the source of verses. Blessed is the earth honored by your footsteps, the place adorned by your blood, and the spot made a repository for the fragments of your bodies. Through your grief, the breezes of God were withheld from wafting and the Pen from flowing. The fragrance of His garment testifies that the Mother Book laments over you on behalf of your mothers, and the maidens of Paradise cry out in place of your kindred and your sisters. Blessed are you all, the first and the last of you, your outward and your inward being, and the mercy of God and His blessings rest upon you.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Glory be unto Thee, O my heart’s Desire! Glory be unto Thee, O my Hope! I beseech Thee by the blood of these souls and the pieces of their bodies, by their steadfastness, their patience and their forbearance, by their being enkindled with the fire of Thy love and their turning toward the light of Thy countenance, by their remembrance and their devotion in Thy days, by their sacrifice of their spirits in Thy path, and by their submissiveness and humility before the manifestations of Thy commandments and Thy laws, to adorn the hearts of the peoples with the light of Thy love and Thy knowledge. Then enable the princes of Thy earth and the learned ones of Thy lands to execute justice and equity in Thy realm. O Lord! Thou seest Thy chosen ones in the hands of the oppressors who have cast behind their backs Thy covenant and Thy testament, who have denied Thy bounty and disputed Thy signs. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy mercy and the effulgent lights from the horizon of Thy tablets, and by those who have cast aside all else save Thee and have taken what Thou didst send down from the heaven of Thy will and the atmosphere of Thy desire, to transform the abasement of Thy loved ones into might through Thy power, and their poverty into wealth through Thy riches. Furthermore, I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, by the blood that hath been shed in Thy path, O Lord of all beings, to forgive me and my parents, then fulfill my needs and what I have desired from the heaven of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy bestowals. Verily, Thou art the All-Forgiving, the Ever-Pardoning, the Almighty, the All-Merciful, the Generous.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Everlasting, the All-Knowing!</p>
<p>The Tongue of Grandeur speaks, addressing you: Blessed art thou for having recognized God, thy Lord, for having detached thyself from all else save Him, and for having turned unto Him. This, verily, is a supreme bounty. Joy be unto thee for having drunk from the cup of loving-kindness and for having answered thy Lord when He called all who are in the heavens and on earth with a word from His presence - a word by which the faces of the heedless were transformed. Blessed art thou, for the clouds of thy Lord’s mercy, the Most High, the Most Great, have rained upon thee, and in thy heart hath grown the plant of the knowledge of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Impregnable. Blessed art thou for having cast behind thee the book of the transgressors and for having taken hold, with manifest strength, of the Book of thy Ancient Lord. Glad tidings be unto thee for having been illumined by the Sun of Grandeur and Glory, from which the birds of night have fled into the layers of hell. Joy be unto thee for having been enlightened by the lights of thy Lord’s countenance and for having turned away from the faces of the idolaters.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who has taken the cup of eternity in My Most Glorious Name, drinking at times in My Name, the Most Exalted, the Most High, then again in My Name, the Most High, the All-Wise, and yet again in My Name by which the pavilion of names was rent asunder, then once more in My Name, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful, and again in My Name through which all things have spoken in remembrance of Me, and yet again in My Name, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Peerless. Those who have detached themselves from all save God and have ascended to the heights of divine realities are praised by the denizens of the Supreme Paradise, then by the people of Paradise, and then by the tongues of them that have known.</p>
<p>Bear thou witness to thy Lord’s power, how We have made the earth a level plain and the mountain of idolatry to be scattered dust. Say: Exalted is our Lord, the Most Merciful, by Whose will the worlds were transformed. He, verily, is the One with power over all things. There is no God but He, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. We have adorned the Garden of Good-Pleasure with the ornament of Our Name, the Most Merciful. Whosoever entereth therein shall hear from all created things therein that there is no God but He. His is the greatness and the majesty, His the power and the bounties. He creates what He willeth as He willeth. He giveth and taketh away. None can resist His command or escape His sovereignty. He, verily, is the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>We have indeed heard the cry of the idolaters from every direction. Say: Die in your wrath! He has appeared in such wise that no one possessed of religion can deny Him, except by denying God, His sovereignty, His grandeur and His glory - and such are indeed among the lowest of the low. Say: Today your deeds and what you possess shall not be mentioned before even one of God’s servants, how much less before His Own mighty and wondrous Being. Say: Whither will ye flee, and to whom will ye cling? Can ye find any path besides Mine? Nay, by My Self, the Truth! Then run ye in the wilderness of vain desire; ye shall arrive but at the place of negation and burning fire. Try it, O heedless ones!</p>
<p>Behold their paucity of understanding and comprehension. They say “We believed in Ali before,” yet they deny Him Who sent him with manifest sovereignty. He was indeed sent by My command, did ye but know. Read ye what We have revealed unto him, that perchance there might dawn from the horizon of your hearts the Sun of Our Most Glorious Name, that ye might be numbered with the successful ones.</p>
<p>Leave thou these people and their remembrances and what they possess, and fix thy gaze upon the face of thy Lord, the Dawning, the Luminous. Give thanks unto God for having preserved thee from the hosts of Satan, from the arrows of their allusions and the spears of their indications, and for having given thee to drink of the pure wine from the hand of this Manifestation, through which the heaven of the exalted was raised and the House of Prosperity was built. Say: Praise be to God Who has detached me from all else save Him, Who has caused me to know the Manifestation of His Essence, and Who has purified me from the doubts of the doubtful ones. O my Lord! Separate me not from the Beloved of the worlds, neither in this world nor in the world to come. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>And if thou desirest to know what hath befallen Me in this Prison, be thou assured that at every moment there hath rained upon Us an arrow from the arrows of fate, and We, in Our love for that which hath been ordained in the Tablet by the Pen of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, have welcomed it. Then were Our affairs straitened from every side, and We render thanks unto God, and We have not been impatient, nor shall We ever be impatient, through His might and power, even should all who are on earth combine against My tribulation and ordeal. And I proclaim in all things, at all times, that the Kingdom on that Day belongeth to My Self, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Arise thou, by God’s leave, to promote My Cause, then gather together My loved ones and remind them of My remembrance, and shelter them beneath the wing of My mercy and the pavilion of My glory and the canopy of My gracious favor. Then give them to drink from the chalices of My bounty, and stir them with the passing of the breezes of My grace and favor, and gather them together in My Cause lest they be disturbed by the clamor of the oppressors and the croaking of the polytheists and the caviling of the deniers. Convey My glorification unto their faces and gladden them with My mention of them, that they may rejoice in the remembrance of God and be numbered among the steadfast. And the glory that hath no likeness or peer be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, young and old alike, and praise be to God, the King, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Gracious.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Thy sweet remembrance hath awakened me, and what hath been diffused therefrom of the fragrance of the love of our Lord, the Most High, the All-Glorious, hath gladdened me. When I read and understood, I presented myself before His Presence and submitted what was in thy letter. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, exalted be His glory: “O Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin! The Wronged One mentioneth thee from this manifest station and announceth unto thee what hath been ordained for thee from the Most Exalted Pen. Thy Lord is, verily, the Announcer, the All-Knowing. Blessed is he who hath loved thee and loveth thee, and who hath heard from thee the verses of God, the Lord of the worlds. Thou art he whose heart We have adorned with My love, whose tongue with My remembrance, whose eyes with beholding My horizon, whose hand with taking My Book, and whose feet with steadfastness in My Cause. Art thou able to thank thy Lord for His favor, His grace, and His bounties? Verily, He thanketh Himself on thy behalf, as a mercy from Him unto thee. He is, verily, the Bestower, the Generous.</p>
<p>“Make mention of My loved ones on My behalf, then recite unto them what hath been revealed from My Pen, and give them the glad-tidings of My remembrance and My favor. Say: Beware lest sorrows overtake you while the Dawning-Place of joy mentioneth you with His wondrous remembrance. Rejoice in God, your Lord. He remembereth you with that which the most exalted Paradise cannot equal, how much less what hath been created on earth. By the life of God! Were ye to become aware of His favor, ye would thank and praise Him until the spirit ascendeth unto the Most Exalted Companion. He Who speaketh the truth beareth witness unto this. There is none other God but He, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>“Verily, We make mention of Our loved ones in Nun and Jim, and We remind them of what hath been sent down from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Make mention of them on My behalf and glorify their faces from Me. Say: By God! This is the Day of Remembrance, did ye but know it, and this is the Day of Praise, did ye but recognize it, and this is the Day of Love and Unity, did ye but understand it, and this is the Day of the Balance, did ye but believe it. By God, the Truth! The Balance hath been set up, whereby all deeds shall be weighed from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And this is the Day of Reform, the Day of Steadfastness and Certitude, the Day of Wisdom and Utterance. Blessed are the people who hear and act. Thus have We mentioned those who were from thy land, as a favor from Us unto thee. He is, verily, the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>“And We make mention of Abdullah, whose letter was presented before the Face and submitted by the servant present before the Throne, and We answered him with these verses: O Abdullah! We heard thy call when We were outside the prison, and We have sent down unto thee this Tablet. Rejoice in thy Lord’s favor, then thank Him by night and by day. Grieve not over anything. Verily, thy Lord’s favor hath encompassed all created things. Glorify the faces of those who are with thee on My behalf, and give them the glad-tidings of the mercy of Him Who speaketh the truth from the most exalted station.</p>
<p>“And We make mention of Ali-Qabli-Akbar, whose letter the servant present before the Face hath submitted, that he may thank his Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Rejoice thou in My remembrance, then act according to what hath been ordained in My Book. Thy Lord is, verily, the Teacher, the Acquainter, the Explainer, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>“We make mention at the end of the Tablet of My handmaidens in that place who have believed in God when He came with His name, the Self-Subsisting. Rejoice, O My leaves, in the remembrance of God, then thank Him for what He hath sent down unto you that which shall endure as long as the Kingdom and the Dominion endure.”</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice for your mention. I submit that the remaining Tablets which were previously mentioned are now being sent. And all that was sent previously should reach either Jinab-i-Haji Kamaluddin, upon him be the Glory of God, or Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God, that they may deliver them. This servant found no opportunity this time to respond in detail to your letter. God willing, it will be submitted later. Convey on behalf of this evanescent one greetings and salutations to all the friends in that land who have drunk and are drinking from the choice wine of your utterance. May Jinab-i-Mihman, upon her be the Glory of God, be blessed through divine grace. The servant heard mention of her from the Tongue of Grandeur on this blessed and beloved night. And whatever Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Sadiq, upon him be the Glory of God, had mentioned was submitted to the Most Holy Court. They said a response will be sent. Verily We make mention of him and the one named Hasan who attained to My service for a number of years. Nothing escapes His knowledge. He is possessed of great faithfulness. The Glory be upon your honor and upon those with you, and upon him and upon him and upon them (m.) and upon them (f.) from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

<p>Praise be to God, the Eternal, the One, the Enduring, the Everlasting, the Ancient, the Timeless, Who findeth no helper, no companion, no minister, no supporter, and no offspring. All created things have testified to His sanctity and all contingent beings have witnessed to His detachment. He is indeed sanctified above all that hath been and all that shall be. He cannot be described by any description save His own, nor can He be praised by any attribute save His own. His tongue hath testified of His own Self that verily He is God, there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. And peace and blessings be upon Him Whom God hath made the Dawning-Place of His Cause and the Source of His wisdom, and established Him in His own stead in all things that pertain unto Him. He is indeed the Manifestation of His most beautiful names and His most exalted attributes. And upon His family and His companions through whom the mysteries were revealed, the signs became manifest, and the trees gave utterance. Dominion belongeth unto God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice for your steadfastness and your uprightness! The most exalted letter, like unto a brilliant light, illumined the horizon of the heart and perfumed the court of existence. This servant perceived therefrom the fragrance of your humility, your submissiveness, and your steadfastness in the Cause of God and His service. After its reading and contemplation, and after being overcome with longing and yearning, he proceeded to the Most Great Presence. After presenting it, He said: “O Ali, O Afnan! Upon thee be My peace and My loving-kindness. Thy letter which thou didst send to this servant was read before the face of the Wronged One and was honored to be heard. We beseech the All-Merciful to protect the Afnan and to open before their faces the gates of grace and bounty. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Praise be to God that in all matters they place their trust in the Truth. In such case, sorrow and the like are not permitted. When the heart findeth its way to the Most Great Ocean, grief and distress have no recourse but to flee. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to exalt thee through His Name, to give thee to drink of the Kawthar of His bounty, and to bestow upon thee that which beseemeth the ocean of His generosity and the heaven of His grace. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Peace be upon thee from Us and upon My loved ones there who have not been deterred by the censure of the people, nor by their turning away, nor by their blindness, nor by their objections, nor by their might and power, from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of Lords.”</p>
<p>This servant also conveyeth greetings to each of the loved ones and beseecheth from the Intended One, on their behalf, whatsoever leadeth to the elevation of their station and the perpetuation of their remembrance. Verily our Lord is the Answerer of prayers and the Lord of all created things.</p>
<p>And regarding the storehouse in Beirut, after presentation He said: “O Ali, upon thee be My peace. These matters have been made contingent upon consultation. In truth I say that this decree hath ever been beloved in the sight of God, and its command hath been revealed in the divine Books from the Most Exalted Pen. Hold fast unto consultation, for verily it shall profit thee and His loved ones. To this testifieth every knowing and informed one.”</p>
<p>That which they wrote concerning the letter of Jenab-i-Aqa Mirza, upon him be Baha’u’llah, was presented and accepted, and one blessed Tablet was bestowed. Likewise the Tablet of the Afnan, Jenab-i-Haji Mirza Mahmud, upon him be the Most Glorious Baha’u’llah, and the reply to the letter of Jenab-i-Aqa Mirza Abu’l-Hasan, upon him be Baha’u’llah, was bestowed and sent. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to enable all to attain unto that which conduceth to nearness, detachment and piety. They have also stated regarding the Huquq that whatever they can send should be sent, as these days some hardship hath appeared, but God will change it to ease, verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>The receipt requested by the Afnan, Jenab-i-Aqa Siyyid Ahmad, upon him be the Most Glorious Baha’u’llah, was sent; please deliver it. The matter of the Afnan requireth attention. His own view is not known. They are aware of the available persons; whomsoever they request will be sent. Jenab-i-Amin, upon him be Baha’u’llah, was dispatched according to instructions solely so that the Afnan would not be alone; there was no other intention whatsoever. In any case, there are many rabble and ruffians in that city. They must conduct themselves in such a manner as to ensure the confidence of the merchants from all regions, and they must spend within measure. The means have not been and will not be withheld; they must hold fast to this and act accordingly. We beseech God to protect him from the evil of his enemies. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>This servant in all conditions holdeth fast to the cord of divine favor, that He may assist that honored one and manifest that which causeth nearness and is conducive to tranquility and rest.

<p>Unto Sheikh Ahmad of Salmas in Salonika</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, majesty and power!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath caused all things to speak forth that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been sanctified above all contingent things and exalted beyond all created beings. Through His all-conquering power He hath created whatsoever He hath willed, and through His pervading Will hath manifested that whereby His servants may ascend. He hath no likeness in creation nor any equal in invention. He doeth as He willeth. He is indeed the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And now, the servant hath been honored with your letter which telleth of your ascent and progress, your acceptance and love, your affection and your humility and submissiveness before God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. We beseech the Exalted One to assist you in all conditions and cause you to speak that which shall benefit the servants through wisdom and utterance. He is verily the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Your petition reached the Most Holy Court and was presented in its entirety. He said: “We have heard your call time and again, and have answered you before and before that, and in this manifest hour. Give thanks unto God for having caused thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of His Cause, Who speaketh in His name amongst the worlds. Convey My greetings to My loved ones who have turned towards God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech God to assist them and grant them the wine of steadfastness. He is verily the Powerful, the Almighty. It behooveth you to remember God in the watches of the night and the ends of the day, at dawn and at eventide. God verily heareth and seeth. He is indeed the All-Encompassing, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, He bade me convey to you that you should give the friends of God to drink of the Kawthar of tranquility and the Tasnim of patience and forbearance. Let them not be saddened by the lack of permission to come hither. He verily commandeth them that which profiteth them. Whosoever hath turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and accepted the Ultimate Truth is accounted among those souls whose mention hath been revealed in God’s Book, both past and future. Ye should, with utmost joy and gladness and complete steadfastness, occupy yourselves with the remembrance of God and service to His Cause. The affairs in these lands are not in order, and some measure of upheaval is apparent from external sources. All must today fix their gaze upon the horizon of God’s good-pleasure and soar in the atmosphere of wisdom. Praise be to God that the names of the loved ones of that land are mentioned in the Most Holy Court, and His favors are manifest towards each one. Likewise, the petitions of those souls were presented in their entirety before His presence. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid us and them to that which He loveth and is pleased with.</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned towards God! Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and We have heard what thou didst mention therein. We beseech God to assist thee in all conditions and to enable thee to make mention of this beauteous Remembrance. We heard thy call aforetime and made mention of thee in such wise as to gladden the hearts of the sincere ones. Grieve thou not over anything, but put thy trust in God. Verily, He is with His believing servants. All that thou beholdest shall perish, but that which this exiled Prisoner hath uttered shall endure unto thee. Whatsoever proceedeth today from the Source of the Cause hath been and shall continue to be for the benefit of the loved ones of God. All must be content and thankful with whatsoever the Beloved hath willed. All must be mindful of wisdom. No one should utter words that may cause clamor, perturbation and the turning away of souls, for most people are weak and are unaware of the cups of divine bounty and the lights of the celestial suns. The steadfast and mighty souls must, with the utmost wisdom and utterance, draw these weak ones to the immortal heaven. Whosoever today gazeth with complete certitude and assurance towards the horizon of the All-Merciful is accounted among those who have attained the court of nearness and reunion. All must attain the highest station of joy and delight through hearkening unto this goodly word.</p>
<p>And likewise was presented the petition of Karbala’i Muhammad. He said: We love him who loveth God and who hath testified to that which God hath testified concerning His Own Self by His Own Self, that there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. O Muhammad! Hold fast unto the Sure Handle and cleave unto the hem of the bounty of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Be thou content with what hath been ordained for thee. Verily, He knoweth what thou knowest not. He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Grieve not over separation, for He recordeth for whomsoever He willeth the reward of one who hath drunk the Kawthar of reunion from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved. It behoveth thee to rejoice in My remembrance of thee and to thank God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>Mention was also made in the Most Holy Presence of Isma’il Aqa and Haji Ibrahim. God willing, may all be engaged in the remembrance of the true Friend in the utmost joy and gladness, and this servant, with faltering tongue, conveyeth greetings to all. The Glory be upon thee and upon them.</p>

<p>He is God. Praise be to God, Who hath ever endured through the endurance of His Essence and subsisted through the subsistence of His Being and was exalted through the transcendence of His holy eternity - He Who brought forth all created things through a single word from His Book and clothed them in the garment of existence through His command and will. And I offer prayers and salutations upon the first Tree that brought forth the fruits of knowledge and wisdom, and the first Light that shone forth from the dawn of Oneness, and the first Mirror that reflected all the names and attributes in the sanctified realms - He Who was Muhammad in name and praiseworthy in deed - and upon His family, with abundant and everlasting peace forever.</p>
<p>O My brother! Your letter has reached Us and We have understood all the references and words contained therein. The lamentation of your heart and the cry of your soul have been heard regarding the poverty, need, adversity and distress that encompass you. We beseech God to grant you that which you love and with which you are content, for verily He is the Generous, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Know thou at the outset that I am not worthy to associate with the servants in the lands after corruption has appeared on land and sea through that which the hands of men have wrought. Dost thou not witness and see how the dogs of the earth from all regions have gathered against Me, attributing to Me that which cannot be uttered in speech nor flow from the pen? How then canst thou be with Me, or sit in My presence, or associate with Me?</p>
<p>From the day God made Himself known to Me and taught Me the wonders of His knowledge and the gems of His wisdom, I have sacrificed My spirit, My soul and My body in His path, and each day I await what God hath ordained for Me through His inevitable decrees and His established judgments. Hast thou not heard how they seized Us and Our possessions, expelled Us from Our homes, and then drew forth against Us the sword of hatred from the sheath of enmity? These transgressors shot at Us the arrows of rancor though We called them to naught but God and desired for them only that which would transform them from the left hand of self and passion to the right hand of glory and eternity. We commanded them only what God had commanded them in the Book. Then they all rose against Me in hypocrisy and slew Me with the swords of discord, as though I were imprisoned in an iron cage, My cries and lamentations unheard, such that I could not utter a single letter of what God had graciously bestowed upon Me and honored Me with through His bounty.</p>
<p>By God! If thou wert to become aware of My secret, thou wouldst weep for the adversity and hardship that have befallen Me. And were the veil to be lifted from the eye of thy heart, thou wouldst flee to the mountain peaks from My sorrow and what hath come upon Me. In these circumstances of tribulation and these calamities that have descended, I have clung to the hem of patience and resignation, held fast to the cord of trust and detachment, and in every moment I say: “There is no power nor strength except in God.”</p>
<p>Therefore, consider within thyself: Can anyone accompany this destitute servant, this limited and abased one? Nay, by My Lord, unless he walks in His footsteps–that is, turns with his whole being to his Lord and turns away from all else, hastening to the fields of struggle in his Lord’s path as he rushed to the assemblies of glory in pursuit of his desires. He must be steadfast in God’s Cause such that his foot does not slip even if all creation opposes him. He must not boast over anyone in anything, nor desire for others what he does not desire for himself. In contentment, he must reach such a station that if he finds means he spends, and if he lacks he gives thanks. Each day he must increase in his love for his Lord and in his submission to his Creator. In resignation he must reach such a state that were the rains of poverty and abasement to pour upon him, he would not grieve in his soul nor change in his essence. In these days, no one can enter the shore of this ocean, much less its depths. Therefore, it behooveth thee to return to thy place and, if thou findest within thyself My love, beseech God, thy Lord, to protect this lamp from these diverse winds, and this dove from the talons of these reprobates. Verily He is near, ever-ready to answer. And if thou art adorned with these attributes, then it behooveth thee to recite this prayer morning and evening:</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst cause the rivers of Thy holy oneness to flow, and didst send down from the clouds of Thy mercy the outpourings of Thine eternal might, to have mercy upon this poor and needy one who hath entered the shore of Thy riches, and this lowly one who hath arrived at the wellspring of Thy glory, and this weak one who hath clung to the cord of Thy power, and this ignorant one who hath hastened from every direction until he entered the city of Thy knowledge. In Thy hand is the dominion of command and the kingdom of creation. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.</p>

<p>He is God - exalted be His station, the Grandeur and Power</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who was in the heights of glory, grandeur and majesty, and will be as He has been throughout all eternity. He cannot be described in words nor characterized by the standards of men, and He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. O beloved of my heart! Such hath befallen the Faith of God as caused the dwellers of the highest Paradise and the inhabitants of the most exalted Heaven to lament. The enemies have surrounded from all directions and sought to extinguish the Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of Batha. The servant beseecheth his Lord to protect His loved ones and chosen ones, and honor them with His presence on a Day wherein faces have turned black and eyes have stared in terror.</p>
<p>In Persian I state: Alexandria, which was in truth the crown of Islamic cities and was like a bride among countries and lands, was seen stripped of the garments of security and tranquility and the ornaments of glory and prosperity by the might of English artillery. In ten hours its heights were brought low. The natives were in utmost weakness while the foreigners were exceedingly strong and triumphant. Power and dominion belong to God, the One, the All-Informed. These are the remaining manifestations of what God hath revealed in the Book. Blessed are they that understand and attain.</p>
<p>In these days a detailed letter was written in response to that spiritual beloved’s missive, but since postal matters are disrupted, its dispatch was delayed and this brief note is submitted instead. It is hoped that the other letter will be sent later. Since foreign powers have attacked Egypt, this land is not free from turmoil either. The friends of God who were in Alexandria have all returned to this land, and whatever they possessed was plundered along with people’s properties. When calamity becomes universal it becomes bearable. Alexandria and all therein is ruined, burnt and pillaged, but God’s grace protected His friends. We praise Him in all conditions. A detailed letter was sent previously but no news of its receipt has come. God willing, it will have reached and been seen by now.</p>
<p>Concerning [M.S.] - upon him be the Glory of God - about whom you wrote, previously a Most Great, Most Holy Tablet was revealed specifically for him and sent forth. In the detailed letter which this servant wrote to that loved one, details were mentioned, and now those details are being presented again. In all conditions, I beseech and hope from God - exalted be His glory - that He will protect that loved one and assist [M.S.] - upon him be the Glory of God - in that which is the cause and means of eternal life. Verily He has power over all things and is worthy to answer prayers. Mention of him has been made repeatedly in the Most Holy Court, and since he had requested to be assisted in a matter that would be the cause and means of eternal and everlasting remembrance, it was commanded that he appoint a deputy for the construction of a lofty, exalted House. This matter is one that will endure and remain as long as the Most Beautiful Names endure, and its fruits are greater, mightier and more excellent than a hundred thousand children. However, after that loved one’s second letter wherein he had written of his desire to pay the Huququ’llah, after this matter was presented, He said that if the Huquq is paid and this edifice is raised therefrom, it would be nearer and more excellent in the sight of God and would be adorned with the ornament of acceptance. In this case, absolute freedom is attained. Verily, He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the Commander, the Doer, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>Indeed this is a great bounty concerning him. He should occupy himself with praise and thanksgiving to God in the nights and days, and act with utmost joy and fragrance and submission and contentment according to what has been commanded. Blessed is he!</p>
<p>The responses to both letters from that loved one were all written in the detailed letter, and likewise the response to that loved one’s previous letter containing various matters was written and sent. God willing, that has arrived and this too shall arrive thereafter. Every hardship is adorned with the garment of ease when He so wisheth and willeth. Mention was also made in detail of those related to that loved one. The request is that you convey greetings from this evanescent servant to all relatives, friends and chosen ones. It is hoped that all will attain to the grace, mercy and loving-kindness of God - exalted be His glory. The Glory be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon those who have attained to the recognition of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>Praise be to God! The pearls in the shells of the sea of divine bounty are ever manifest and renowned. His signs have encompassed the world, and His evidences shine resplendent before all faces. Yet all remain heedless and veiled. What hath prevented thee from beholding, and likewise from hearkening to the call raised from the direction of the Divine Throne by day and by night? The light of His Cause doth shine forth and is manifest from every direction, such that the signs of the Hour and the mysteries of the Resurrection have become apparent in a manner that all the pens in the world are powerless to recount. This servant conveyeth greetings to each of the loved ones, and from the ocean of God’s bounty and the sun of His mercy beseecheth that all may be assisted in that which will cause the exaltation of the Word of God and their own stations. Blessed are those souls who, having acknowledged and recognized this incomparable Treasury, have attained unto the Most Great Steadfastness. Today the pavilion of glory hath been raised to its loftiest station, and the lights of the dawn of His Revelation have appeared from the Most Exalted Paradise in such wise that no fair-minded person hath denied or will deny it. This servant and the loved ones in that land must, with the utmost lowliness and supplication, beseech from the Self-Sufficing One whatsoever is worthy of this Day and cleave unto it. Verily He is the Kind, the Generous, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for his honor Mirza Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be the glory of God. His word, exalted be His majesty and His glory: O Tongue of Grandeur! Withhold not Thy bounties from Thy loved ones, nor disappoint them of that which Thou hast ordained in Thy Book for Thy chosen ones. Turn unto him who hath turned unto Thee, then make mention of him with such remembrance as to attract the hearts of all the world. I testify that this Day is Thy Day - sing before all faces and warble that the Kingdom of Utterance and its dominion have come to hearken unto Thy most exalted call and the scratching of Thy most exalted Pen. Withhold not those who have turned unto Thee from the Day-Star of Thy Revelation. Take their hands with the hands of Thy power and deliver them from the mire of idle fancies through Thy might, Thy sovereignty, Thy strength and Thy will. Thou art He Whom the affairs of men cannot hinder, nor the turning away of them that have denied and disbelieved. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-’Ali! Verily We have mentioned thee before and at this time, and We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid thee and those who have believed in that which beseemeth the heaven of His generosity and the ocean of His bounty. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having guided me and sent down unto me from the heaven of Thy grace the signs of Thy grandeur. O my Lord! Thou seest the poor one standing before the gate of Thy bounty, and the helpless one clinging to the cord of Thy power and sovereignty. Ordain for him that which beseemeth Thy glory and Thy bounty. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>We have desired to make mention of him who is named Ustad-Aqa, that he may rejoice and be of them that are thankful. Today the Sun of Truth hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of will, proclaiming: O peoples of the earth! Ye have been created for this Day - recognize ye its station and that which hath appeared therein from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And He saith: O party of God! Be not grieved at that which hath befallen you in My path. Soon shall ye behold that which no eye in creation hath beheld, and shall find yourselves in a glorious station. Strive that ye may attain unto that which will adorn you with the glory of God’s good-pleasure. Rejoice not in that which ye possess.</p>
<p>You find yourselves in a noble station; strive that perchance ye may attain unto that which adorns you with the glory of God’s good-pleasure. Be not gladdened by what ye possess, nor despair of the Spirit of God and His mercy. Verily He is with His servants who turn unto Him. Great is this Day and great is its bounty. Deprive not yourselves. The Truth, exalted be His glory, hath ordained for His loved ones that which is the cause of eternal life and everlasting rest.</p>
<p>Say: Praise be unto Thee for having caused me to hear Thy call and enabled me to turn towards Thee, and for having given me to drink of the choice wine of Thy knowledge, and for having mentioned me in Thy verses and shown forth unto me Thy clear tokens. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me the heaven of Thy grace nor the ocean of Thy bounty. Thou art verily the Generous, the Lord of abundant grace.</p>
<p>O teacher, O Husayn! Hear My call from the precincts of My prison and remember My days and what hath befallen Me in the path of God, the Goal of all mystic knowers. He whom I had nurtured turned away from Me and rose up to slay Me after I had protected him for successive years. I testify that he denied My verses and rejected My favor and turned away from My beauty after We created him from the clay of refinement. He who possesseth the perspicuous Book beareth witness to this.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me, and thanks be unto Thee for having guided me, and glory be unto Thee for having caused me to hear. I beseech Thee to strengthen them that deny to acknowledge, them that turn away to turn towards Thee, and the oppressors to be just. O my Lord! I have forsaken my self, turning unto the lights of Thy countenance. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me from the wonders of Thy grace and bounty. Verily Thou art the Almighty over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Supporter, the Helper.</p>

<p>O Ali, hear My call and be not of the heedless ones. Follow the path of the Spirit in My love, for this is indeed the foundation of faith, if thou be of them that know. Cut thyself from all faces save My glorious and luminous face, then forget all remembrance save My wondrous and exalted remembrance, then be patient in all things save separation from Me. This is a revelation from one who turneth penitent unto God.</p>
<p>Say: By God, greed is condemned save in seeking the wonders of My great bounty, and all asking is rejected save for union with Me, if ye be of them that seek. Say: All anxiety is forbidden save anxiety in My love, and this is the straight path of justice. All fear is unseemly save fear in yearning for My beauty, and this hath been ordained by the finger of mighty glory. All passion and desperation are banished save passion in My affection, and this is better for all who believe in God and His Messengers than the sovereignty of the worlds.</p>
<p>Be still in all matters save in turning toward My clear and straight path. Say: By God, looking upon aught save God is forbidden unless one seeth in all things the manifestations of the revelation of My love - this is the law of them that know. Say: Of all things that have been and shall be created, My soul loveth them not save in their connection to My enduring and gracious Beloved. Verily He is Ali before Nabil, and He is the sovereign of truth and certitude.</p>
<p>Read ye these verses in your dwelling-places that ye may stand firm in the love of God such that the words of the polytheists cause you not to slip. Soon will the Samiri call out among you as We promised you before, and the calf will cry out, and this is an inevitability inscribed in the preserved tablets of glory.</p>
<p>Thus doth the Tongue of Remembrance mention you that ye despair not of the spirit of God, forget not the grace from Us, and be not of the heedless ones. By God, whoso tasteth the sweetness of a single letter of this Tablet and is blessed with what is ordained therein shall arise by himself between the heavens and the earth proclaiming his Lord’s Cause, and nothing shall prevent him though all created things oppose him. This is a revelation from God, the Exalted, the Great.</p>
<p>Say: This Dove hath states and melodies at this moment with God that the ears of the unitarians cannot bear to hear - how much less the ears wherein is the cotton of heedlessness. They shall never hear, and if they hear they hear naught save the utterances of the polytheists from their likes. Thus have We explained to thee that which will purify thy being, thy heart and thine ear from the words of the opposers.</p>
<p>Say: By God, We found not in all creation a single ear alone unto which the Spirit might cast what was cast into My breast, and God is unto this the Witness and the Knower. This Tablet beareth witness to that, and it sufficeth as a witness and trustee beyond all the worlds. Thus have We been brief in speech and veiled the matter until God shall bring forth a wondrous command on the day when minds shall be confounded, souls crushed, and the eyes of all mankind fixed in terror, as ye witness in these days. This is proof thereof, if ye be of the assured ones.</p>
<p>Thou, therefore, hear My counsel and that wherewith I have counseled in the Word of God, the Mighty, the Powerful. Find rest in thyself, then stand firm in thy Lord’s Cause and turn not unto those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God and never perceived it in their souls, being among the heedless. These are they who deny the signs of God while reciting the verses revealed before Him, and such is their way - know this, O concourse of the beloved! They make mention of God at all times, yet when He came upon the clouds of holiness in the manifestation of His name, the Husayn, they fled from Him, turned away from His beauty, and were not among those who perceived. Thus have We taken account of them and informed you about them, lest your feet slip and that you may remain steadfast in the Cause of God, your Lord. Say: This is an ocean unto whose shore none hath attained, how much less unto its depths, were ye of them that perceive. Say: By God! Should all who are in the heavens and on earth dive therein, they would not be able to hear the call of a single pearl of its pearls, nor would they be able to bring forth what is treasured therein, save what the hand of grace may cast upon them. This is of the bounty of God, the Most High, the Most Great. Say: O people! By God! Were it not for the Spirit speaking, My Pen would not move, but when It speaks, this Pen speaks to manifest the grace of My Lord and to bring forth His favor, and for this have I been afflicted at the hands of these oppressors. Thus does He cast upon thee the way of holiness at a time when He is imprisoned in this remote prison, like unto a bird whose wings are broken, fallen into a deep well, finding no helper for itself save God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. We beseech God to lift Us up and deliver Us from this prison, that thereby the eyes of those near unto God may be solaced. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon His sincere servants.</p>

<p>O ‘Ali! From the fire of separation from thee were consumed the hearts of them that are nigh unto God, and by thy departure have wept the eyes of the inhabitants of the cities of eternity, and the Maids of Paradise have rent their garments in the lofty chambers, and the Holy Spirit hath cried out, and the Dawning-Place of the Most Beautiful Names hath lamented in the Most Glorious Paradise, and the eyes of the sincere ones have shed tears. O ’Ali! From thy sighs were the veils consumed and the pillars of the House did quake, and the Faithful Spirit did cry out. By God! When thou didst turn thy face toward the Most Holy Court, the scene of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great, the denizens of the Supreme Kingdom did journey with thee and circle round thee, until there appeared the darkness of the City wherein was imprisoned the Beloved of the worlds. By God! At every footstep did the people of the Kingdom and they that dwell in the cities of Names send their blessings upon thee, from thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. And the Most Great Spirit addressed thee between earth and heaven, saying: “O ’Ali! Blessed art thou for having drawn nigh unto the Spot round which circle the Manifestations of the Cause from among the Prophets and Messengers. Blessed art thou for having inhaled the fragrance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, and for having desired to attain the presence of Him for Whose loss Moses, He Who conversed with God, did lament. O ’Ali! Thou art he who hath been named in the Supreme Concourse the Sultan of Pilgrims. By God! None among all created things hath preceded thee in this, and all things bear witness unto this, even as thy Lord, the Possessor of all Names and the Creator of earth and heaven, hath testified. How excellent is this station which none hath attained save him whom thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised, hath willed. Thou art he at whose lamentation the heart of the world hath lamented, and at whose cry of longing and wail of separation the Eye of Grandeur hath wept upon the Spot wherefrom mention of the worlds hath been cut off. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the Most Great Pilgrimage. By the Beauty of the Wronged One, Who speaketh between the heavens and the earth: Mina yearneth for thy presence, and the Hill hath moved from its place in its longing to behold thy countenance, and the Station longeth for thy station, and the Sacred Monument perceiveth what thou hast been given by God, the All-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful. O ’Ali! This is the shore of the Most Great Sea - thine eyes have been solaced by gazing thereon, and from it wafteth the breeze of reunion and the fragrance of attainment. Give thanks unto thy Lord, then prostrate thyself and say: ’Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds!’ This is the station wherein the Son of Imran cast off the shoes of separation and drank the choice wine of verses from the cup of thy Lord’s will, the Lord of all names and attributes, and the intoxication of the wine of thy Lord’s call seized him in such wise that he swooned, and when he recovered his senses he said: ‘Thou art my God and the God of all that are in the heavens and on earth.’ And before him came the Friend of God, and We lifted for him from the hem of the veil a thousand thousand veils, whereupon he said: ‘Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having shown me the kingdom of command and creation and made me one of them that have attained.’ O ’Ali! Verily, We were with thee in all conditions, beholding thy burning with the fire of separation and thy longing for the precincts wherein every atom proclaimeth that there is none other God but Him, the King, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O ’Ali! Thy purpose was the Purpose of the world, and thy turning toward the Kaaba of eternity is better than the deeds of them that circle round the Ancient House. There hath been ordained for thee that which none can reckon save thy Lord, the All-Encompassing, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Say: Glorified art Thou, O my God, O Beloved of my heart and Purpose of my inner being! Praise be unto Thee for having enabled me to draw nigh unto the station wherein the lights of Thy countenance have shone forth and the sun of Thy bounty hath dawned. O Lord! I know not by what deed Thou hast honored me with this station which hath ever been the goal of Thy chosen ones and the refuge of Thy loved ones. And praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having heard the cry of the yearning one in his separation and guided him to the abode of nearness and glory and reunion. O Lord! Deprive not Thy servants from drawing nigh unto the seat of Thy Cause, and drive them not from the court which Thou hast made the dawning-place of Thy bounty. O Lord! Thou seest the burning of the hearts of them that yearn in their separation from Thee, and the agitation of the hearts of them that hope in their remoteness from Thee. O Lord! Give them to drink the wine of reunion by the hand of Thy mercy, and grant them the pure water of nearness and meeting through Thy grace and favor. Verily, Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Praise be to the Beloved of the worlds that thou hast attained unto the Most Great Pilgrimage and been blessed with the greatest good deed. From thy longing for the Most Exalted Horizon, all the dwellers in the cities of names are in lamentation and burning, and they have beseeched God - exalted be His grandeur - to honor thee with attainment unto the Most Pure Station and the Most Great Vista. By the Ancient Beauty! Thou hast attained unto a bounty that hath no likeness. Be not grieved, for thy grief causeth signs of sorrow to appear upon the Countenance of the Ancient Beauty. Hearken unto the divine call from the horizon of the will of the Lord of the world and Creator of the cities of names, and return with utmost tranquility and composure to the Dawning-Place of the revelation of the All-Merciful. However, there is no need for haste. Verily, God loveth them that are patient.</p>

Be not among those handmaidens who make mention in the realm of utterance of matters that never had nor have any truth, for thy Lord knoweth the hearts of all. Were He to desire to mention in this blessed and goodly Tablet the secrets of each heart, He would be able, but as He hath loved and ever loveth the name of the Concealer, therefore hath He veiled most matters from the eyes of strangers.</p>
<p>O My handmaiden and daughter of My handmaiden! Beseech God that thou be not accounted among those handmaidens who are occupied with a transient shadow and remain heedless of the enduring Sun, who inquire of the bat whether the sun hath risen, or whether the world-illumining Sun of Divine Unity hath dawned from the Most Holy and Most Glorious Horizon. They remain deprived of a single ray from the Sun of Suns while imagining they have rent asunder the veils of imitation and are seated upon the seats of the glory of unity. Vain indeed are their imaginings!</p>
<p>Say: O My handmaidens! By My Beauty, naught but My remembrance is acceptable and naught but My love is admissible. Even should all created things appear in the most glorious and exalted raiment, yet tarry for less than a moment on the path of the All-Merciful, they would be accounted as utter nothingness and complete void in the sight of God. Therefore, O My handmaidens, purify your gaze from darkened souls and turn unto the Greatest Horizon. By the True God! This is the Command of the Most Great Beauty Who is established upon the Most Pure Throne. These words have I revealed from the Dawning-Place of utterance out of My love for your souls, that ye may not be deprived of the Beauty of the All-Glorious through mentioning this one or that.</p>
<p>By My Beauty! The Tablet known as the Tablet of Baha which was sent - not all who dwell in the heavens and earth could equal a single letter thereof. Yet it seemeth it hath not been read, or if read, they have interpreted it according to their own fancy, not as it was revealed. Say: O My handmaidens! Account not the enemy of My Beauty as a friend, nor reckon the opponent of My Self as beloved. Today My love is the balance - whosoever attaineth unto it hath attained unto the Beauty of God and His presence and all good, and whoso faileth hath been and shall remain deprived.</p>
<p>Therefore, O Hajar, be thou one who migrateth unto the love of God - that is, migrate from all who are on earth and rest beneath the shade of the Tree of Divine Love. In this case thou art accounted among the emigrants in the sight of God, even if thou dwellest in thine own home all thy life, for migration hath not been by foot, but hath ever been and shall be by heart in the sight of God. Although for men if these two stations be combined it hath been and shall be most beloved, yet this must be with God’s leave and is specific to men, not women. So long as thou remainest steadfast in My love, know of a certainty that thou art present before the Throne, for not a single atom between the heavens and earth is visible except that the realities of all things are present before the Throne of the All-Merciful every morn and eve. This is one of the hidden mysteries which hath been manifested by the Pen of My declaration through the grace of thy Chosen Lord. Therefore dwell in perfect stillness and gaze in complete tranquility toward the horizon of the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>And further, remind the handmaidens of that land of the wondrous and exalted mention of the King of Oneness, and say: O handmaidens of God! Be not as those who are moved by every wind and stirred by every breeze. Ye are the leaves of the Tree of the Cause; therefore, hold fast with all your strength to the branches of the Tree, lest ye be severed by the darksome autumn winds from the original Tree. This is the counsel of the Divine Beauty, if ye be of them that are faithful. And glory be upon him who is guided and detached from all who dwell on earth.</p>

<p>In the name of the All-Knowing Expounder! O thou who hast been named the Exalted! Upon thee be the Glory of God! God willing, thou hast ever drunk and wilt continue to drink from the pure crystal stream of the knowledge of the eternal Beloved, and wilt cause others to drink thereof. Thy letter was presented before the Throne, and the eye of loving-kindness was directed towards it. Blessed art thou for having been mentioned before the Throne time and again, and for having been vouchsafed that which diffuseth the fragrance of divine favors throughout the everlasting dominion of both the seen and the unseen. That which is incumbent upon thee and obligatory in this day is to arise to serve the Cause of God and, detached from all else that exists, to occupy thyself with the promotion of the Cause of the Lord of all being, and to bestow upon the peoples of the world the choice sealed wine which hath been unsealed by the finger of the Self-Subsisting. The outpourings of divine revelation continually and successively drip from the leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree, appearing and shining forth in the form of words in the divine Tablets. Blessed is he who hath attained unto them, discovered their fragrance, spoken in praise of their Creator, and arisen to serve their Fashioner and Originator.</p>
<p>Those who possess a sense of fairness have ever inhaled and continue to inhale its fragrance. Consider that in this Revelation all know that He attended no school, acquired no learning, and sprang not from a house of learning. Moreover, most of His days were spent in affliction, confined in various prisons. Yet His pen hath become the wellspring of infinite divine knowledge. Were one to observe with an eye purged from the ophthalmia of base desire, in every drop thereof one would behold the ocean of knowledge and wisdom surging. And just as God’s knowledge encompasseth all things, so too do all His other names and attributes. These verses represent but a single manifestation among the manifestations of Truth. Were the details of these stations to be mentioned, these tablets would not suffice. Were all the learned ones of the earth to be present at the time of the revelation of verses, be assured that all would acknowledge them, for they would find no escape or refuge save God, the Speaker, the Articulate, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Soon shall ye witness the penetrating influence of the divine Word and the encompassing power of His might. Though even now it is evident and manifest that while imprisoned among the heedless, He hath openly and clearly, without allegory, summoned with utmost power both kings and subjects alike to the direction of His choice. Due to the weakness of the servants, the station of this Revelation hath not been fully described save according to their capacity. “They have not estimated God according to His true measure.” Some among the weak ones, not having attained to the lofty station of true understanding and not having become aware of the greatness of God’s verses, have therefore composed certain phrases and made vain claims, considering the station of Truth to be limited to these. As hath been revealed: “Among them is he who imagineth that verses must end with ‘the All-Knowing’ or ‘the All-Wise’, or must have an ‘alif’ added to their end, or must have an additional ‘nun’ appended to similar endings, supposing these to be words which the All-Merciful hath revealed in his heart. Nay, by God! Rather hath Satan whispered in his heart. Those who have denied the proof and openly rebelled have indeed lost.” If people were truly seeking the Truth and recognizing it as it deserves, they would forsake the entire world and all within it, turning their faces toward the All-Merciful. Your honor should, God willing, be engaged at all times in serving the Cause and reminding the people. Divine confirmations have been and continue to be present. As you observe, though outwardly confined in prison, We are occupied with your remembrance. This is solely for the sake of God, that perchance you may arise to serve the Cause and guide those who have lost their way in the wilderness of error to the horizon of guidance. Likewise observe the inner confirmations which have been and will continue to be directed toward the loved ones of God. Most people are as infants; they must first be nourished with the milk of wisdom and gentle foods, and afterward with stronger nourishment. Thus doth wisdom dictate. Verily, thy Lord is the Educator, the All-Knowing. Previously, the Most Holy, Most Great Tablet was revealed specifically for your honor and is being sent with this tablet. Be assured of thy Lord’s favor, for He remembereth thee as He remembered thee before. Strive to quicken the dead with this water which God hath made the cause of life to the worlds. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The souls that were mentioned in your book - all are blessed with the remembrance of God. Give them the glad tidings of Our remembrance of them and acclaim them face to face, that they may rejoice in the acclamation of their Lord, the Most High, the All-Conquering, the Almighty, the Powerful. Verily the glory be upon you and upon them and upon those who have attained unto this Mighty Announcement.</p>

<p>Blessed is He Who hath sent down the verses and made them a sign from His presence, an evidence from before Him, and a proof from His side. He, verily, is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Blessed is He Who hath manifested what was hidden in knowledge and raised up one who spoke the truth before the faces of the servants. He is the One Who caused His servant to speak forth His remembrance and praise in the prison, in such wise that neither the tyranny of the oppressor nor the cawing of every croaker who denied God’s right in the beginning and the end could strike fear into him.</p>
<p>O son of Abhar! There hath come before the Wronged One what thou didst send unto him who hath arisen to serve the Cause of God, the Lord of lords. Blessed is the soul that hath borne tribulations in the path of God, the Lord of the Day of Mutual Summoning. Blessed be thy tongue for having spoken the truth, and thy countenance for having turned toward God, the Revealer of verses. This is the Day wherein every hidden thing hath been revealed, every concealed thing made manifest, and every silent thing hath spoken, to the shame of those who have denied God and rejected His proof which hath encompassed all who are in earth and heaven.</p>
<p>O thou who speaketh in My Name and who hath arisen to serve My Cause! Hearken unto My call from the precincts of My prison. It verily draweth thee nigh and guideth thee unto the Most Great News, whereby existence hath been thunderstruck, the mountains crumbled, and the heaven of religions cleft asunder. Give thanks unto God for having enabled thee in prison to make mention of Him and sing His praise, and to manifest that which was hidden from eyes.</p>
<p>O son of Abhar! A hundred thousand praises be unto the Purpose of the world Who, through the Most Great Name, hath opened the gates of the hearts of nations. Through His Name, He hath transformed fear into tranquility, remoteness into nearness, and darkness into light. He is the One at Whose command the clamor of the aggressive doth not deter Him, nor do the doubts of the suspicious hold Him back from His purpose. By the life of God! This servant and His loved ones behold themselves immersed in an ocean of joy, for amid the uproar of these days, when grief hath come upon His Majesty the Sultan from every party save this party, who have not abandoned the bounds of respect and propriety. In truth, propriety hath a magnificent station with the Lord. Blessed is the soul that hath attained thereunto and hath not been deprived.</p>
<p>This Wronged One is bewildered and thoughtful through the nights and days: what hath befallen the divines of the age, the theologians of the time, and the sages of the era, that they have committed that which hath caused grief to the monotheists and the detached ones? O son of Abhar! This is the time for the manifestation of gratitude and the appearance of praise, for this party, after divine grace, celestial favor, and pre-existent mercy, hath shown no disrespect. Even while the pretenders are engaged day and night in intrigue and deception. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having preserved Thy party through Thy power and sovereignty despite enemies and the appearance of the wicked ones. No harm hath come upon the blessed person of the Sultan from them. If this matter be denied in these days, its signs and manifestations shall surely encompass the world thereafter, and all shall acknowledge the appearance of divine grace and mercy. Verily, He doth not suffer the reward of the doers of good to be lost.</p>
<p>His honor and the other loved ones should repeatedly call the people to patience and forbearance, and not be distressed by the deeds of some. They should fix their gaze upon the horizon of the Cause, not upon the words and deeds of the servants. The essence of the Cause and the good intentions of this party are not hidden from His Majesty the Sultan and the Chief of Princes. If, out of wisdom, some matter should appear from the Sovereign Commander, one must hold fast to the cord of patience. This Wronged One beseecheth God to preserve and protect this party, lest some matter should appear that would lay waste the deeds and patience of forty years. No blessing and no food hath a sweetness that prevaileth over the sweetness of patience. Whatsoever appeareth from this party is for the sake of God, and the gaze of all is fixed upon the horizon of His favor. He is the One unto Whom all are drawn, Who bestoweth full recompense upon them that seek Him. There is none other God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Beseech ye the one true God that He may unveil before His Majesty the Sultan and His Highness the Grand Vizier that which will enable them to become aware of this Wronged One’s purpose and aspirations. By God! They would then find themselves established upon a ship which no winds could move and no waves could harm. Thus hath the Wronged One spoken, as a token of His grace upon thee. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Compassionate, the Most Generous. Thou hast ever been and continuest to be remembered. Take hold of the Most Great Handle in the name of the Lord of all mankind and say: O my God, my God! I beseech Thee by the Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Dayspring of Thy clear tokens to unveil unto Thy servants that which Thou hast unveiled unto us through Thy power and Thy sovereignty. Thou art He through Whose Name Thou didst raise the standard of free will before the faces of the righteous and the wicked alike. There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest, through Thy binding and perspicuous command.</p>

<p>He is the Most Wondrous in the All-Glorious Horizon!</p>
<p>These are the verses of God which have been sent down in truth from the presence of the Mighty, the All-Knowing. They are indeed a guidance to those who believe, and a mercy and reminder to another people. We have verily sent down to thee from the heaven of grace a Book before whose contents the hearts of all the world are powerless to comprehend. We have sent it unto thee as a mercy from Our presence upon thee and upon Our near servants. Should God so please, it shall reach thee and bestow upon thee what it containeth of the mysteries of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. When it reacheth thee, take it with the hand of might and power, then act in accordance with what thou hast been commanded therein from the presence of the Mighty, the Most Beautiful. Tarry not in any matter, but make mention of thy Lord in secret and in public, and be of those who are steadfast in the Cause and are among the trusting ones. Beware lest anything deter thee from the path of thy Lord, or the denial of those who disbelieved after having acknowledged God their Lord at the time when the veils of fancy were rent asunder and the Sun of the name of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great, shone forth from the holy horizon. When He once again manifested Himself unto them from the direction of the Throne through His Most Glorious Name, they denied Him, and thereby their falsehood in the former time became evident. They returned to their abode and joined those who had preceded them among Our idolatrous servants. Thus doth God render void the deeds of those who have made a jest of the Cause within themselves and who were in grave doubt and schism.</p>
<p>Know thou then that he whose name correspondeth to that of Nabil hath appeared before the Throne, and upon him hath shone the light of the Sun of the Beauty of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. He attained the presence of God and His verses according to what was ordained for him, and verily thy Lord is the Bestower, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. When the time appointed for his sojourn in the precincts of thy Lord’s mercy was fulfilled, We sent him back unto thee with a clear Book, and We favored thee once again and revealed this Tablet and dispatched it unto thee that thou mightest find from it the fragrance of the Beloved and be among the successful ones. Arise to serve the Cause, then remind the people of the verses of God, the Ancient Sovereign. Grieve not; give glad tidings of what hath appeared and shone forth from the holy horizon. He walketh, and behind Him walk the realities of all things, but the people have veiled themselves from the Revelation of God and His Cause, and are among the heedless. They have taken fancy as their lord besides God. By My life! They are more heedless than the peoples of old, as evidenced by what issueth from their mouths, even as thou hast heard from them and art among those who have heard. Rend asunder their veils by a power from Our presence and a might from Us, that they may ascend unto a holy and gentle atmosphere. Say: O people! By God, ye were created for this Day, and concerning this hath God taken a covenant from you in the particle of the Bayan, then in the particle of the Furqan, then in the particle of the Gospel, then in the particle of the Torah, then in the particle of every world of His worlds and every page of the pages of His glory. To this do all atoms bear witness, were ye of the fair-minded.</p>
<p>Beware, O people, lest ye break God’s covenant and His pledge. Rather, fulfill that which ye pledged in the presence of the near ones and the Messengers. When the deniers are asked, “Who is your God?” they say “Allah.” And when asked, “By what proof?” they say “The verses.” Yet when God’s verses are recited unto them, they flee therefrom and become among the turn-aways. The eye of creation hath not witnessed any more heedless than these, for they deny that whereby they pride themselves above all the peoples of the earth and whereby their faith is established, yet they perceive not. Say: If ye deny this proof, then by what proof do ye reject the Faith of the Furqan? If ye say they denied God and His verses after they were sent down in truth, ye too have denied their like and their Revealer. What, then, is the difference between you, O company of the deluded? By thy life! Their likeness is as those who affirm the rays for the stars yet deny the manifestations of the Sun with such brilliant, radiant light; or as those who worship that which neither heareth nor seeth, and when asked “By what proof?” they say “Thus found we it in the books of our forefathers of old.” Know thou that these believed not in the Primal Point, but rather in the idols of their own selves and desires. For had they believed in Him, they would not have denied Him in this Revelation whose lights have encompassed all worlds. Thus have We detailed unto thee the stories of these people and explained the verses with clear and evident signs. We sent unto those who believed therein Tablets, one of which sufficeth as proof for all the worlds. Do thou bring forth the pearls of knowledge and wisdom from the shells of their words, that perchance they who are detached may discover what lieth therein and be of those who are assured. Thus did We command thee before, and We command thee now, that thou mayest be of those who act. And since We sent thee a Tablet before, We have therefore been brief in this Tablet. Yet were We to will to remain in this transient world, We would assuredly send thee whatsoever God wisheth and desireth, for verily He is the Best of Senders.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise befitteth the Beloved of the world and the Desire of the nations, from whose right and left hands giving and taking are ceaselessly flowing and manifest. He taketh what He giveth, and giveth what He hath taken. Hidden in His taking are a myriad consummate wisdoms, and likewise in His giving. He hath made known the loftiness and sublimity of giving through taking. From the grain that the millstone hath ground upon doth man produce flour - from such travail doth this blessing emerge, and from such hardship doth this ease appear. For this reason have they who are nigh unto God, the sincere ones and they who recognize His unity, resigned themselves to all things and with perfect steadfastness shown patience in whatsoever hath befallen them, inasmuch as He knoweth what we have while we know not what He hath, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>The letter of that honored friend arrived and was laid before the Throne. Thus did the Tongue of Grandeur speak, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One</p>
<p>O Husayn! Reflect upon the tribulations of Husayn. Outwardly they appeared as afflictions, severe and momentous, yet through them the ocean of mercy surged, the light of recognition shone forth, and the sun of grace dawned. His martyrdom became a support and champion to the resplendent Law of the Messenger of God. His deeds were, in their essence, as the sun in the heaven of the Qur’an, and he was the tender and waterer of the garden of inner meanings. Were but one of the mysteries of tribulations in His path to be mentioned, all would freely hasten to the field and seek martyrdom. Today, whatsoever station thou mayest consider, the Truth standeth manifest therein - whether the station of father or above it or below it. Let it suffice thee that the Supreme Pen doth in this station console thee and comfort thee, and maketh mention of him who hath ascended. He was adorned with the ornament of the love of God, and was assured and acknowledging through the utterance of the Pen of the All-Merciful. Now doth he dwell in the precincts of mercy, receiving endless bounties. Blessed is he, and blessed art thou, and blessed are they who are with thee, and blessed are they unto each of whom We sent a Tablet from whose horizon shone the sun of thy Lord’s tender mercy, the Gracious, the All-Bountiful. The glory be upon thee and upon him who hath ascended to the Most Exalted Companion and attained unto that which God, the Lord of all worlds, ordained for him.</p>
<p>Thy letter did truly cause complete sorrow, for it bore grievous tidings. God is Our witness that perfect anguish and grief appeared. However, when it was laid before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence and brilliant verses were revealed from the heaven of Will, the flames of sorrow were suddenly stilled and the fire of cares was extinguished, nay, grew cold with a coldness that shall never be warmed. For such utterances were revealed in this station from the tongue of the Desire of all things that every soul longed for death that perchance they might attain the like thereof. Blessed is he who hath ascended unto Him. Convey on behalf of this evanescent one greetings and peace to the kindred, and console them.</p>
<p>Another matter is that at the time of your departure, several names were written and sent to the Most Holy Court, and the promise of the revelation of Tablets from the heaven of bounty was manifest, and they were revealed some time ago. This time they are being sent according to the number ten. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to enable them to reach their destination and to adorn creation anew with a fresh raiment, that they may not be saddened or disturbed by the vicissitudes of time, the hatred of the wicked, the enmity of the divines and the envy of the doctors of law. At one time this exalted word was revealed from the tongue of the Lord of all beings - exalted be His grandeur: “O thou who art present! The friends of God are today the recipients of such bounty and loving-kindness as all the pens and oceans of the world are powerless to reckon. They must not be saddened by ephemeral happenings. Whatsoever may occur to their minds or whatsoever their powers of imagination may conceive is [with God], created and present and waiting for His loved ones. Under such circumstances, grief is not permissible. Joy upon joy, gladness upon gladness, delight upon delight, bounty upon bounty is their portion. To this beareth witness He Who hath spoken and speaketh: verily there is no God but Him, the Manifest, the Resplendent, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Helper. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.” I hope that if wisdom permitteth, you will convey my greetings to the friends in that land. The yearning of my heart and soul exceedeth all bounds, but in view of the wisdom revealed in the Tablets, it is not permissible to mention names. Glory and praise and greetings be upon you and upon those who have attained unto the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>

<p>He is the Herald from the Supreme Horizon</p>
<p>This is a mention from Us to one who has attained the lights of the Kingdom when the Sovereign of the Realm of Might came with a Word that caused all who are in the heavens and earth to swoon, and every treacherous one who clung to vain imaginings was shaken. We make mention of him who turned towards the Most Great Ocean and heard the murmur of the Water of Life in the days of the All-Merciful, that he may rejoice and be of those who are thankful. We have turned from this Most Great Scene towards those who were martyred in the path of God, the Lord of Destiny, and We make mention of them with such remembrance that when it was inscribed, the Book proclaimed with the most exalted call: “By God! Thou hast attained unto the Most Sublime Word from God, the Lord of all worlds.” Blessed, then blessed is he who purposed to seek the Purpose of the world and sacrificed his spirit when the clamor of the nations was raised, in the path of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Blessed is the soul that attained the wine of certitude in the days of the All-Merciful and was martyred in the path of God in such wise that the kindreds of the Supreme Paradise and the dwellers of the Cities of Names lamented. The Creator of heaven, the Lord of the Throne and of earth bears witness to this, yet the people are in manifest loss. The Most Exalted Pen testifies that they were servants whom neither the hosts of the world nor the might of those who disbelieved in God, the Lord of this mighty Day, could frighten. Through their acceptance, the denizens of earth and heaven accepted, and through their turning, every face turned towards the Face of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O ?ali?! Blessed art thou for God has aided thee in the service of His Cause and chosen thee from among His creatures to preserve the Station which He made as a throne for His Temple, a footstool for His feet, and a dawning-place for His sovereignty that encompasses all who are in the heavens and earth. It behooves thee to beseech God in the nights and days that He may strengthen thee in this Cause hereafter as He strengthened thee before. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful. We counsel thee to fear God and to that which preserves thy station which We have given thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Praised be the testimony from the hands of the bounties of their Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. They responded when they heard the call of the Desired One and hastened to the land of Taff, the place wherein the Most Exalted Word was martyred. Thus doth God mention whomsoever He willeth of His servants. He, verily, is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. At this moment the Tongue of Grandeur addresseth them and those who were martyred with them, saying: Upon you be the remembrance of God and His praise, the fragrances of God and His verses, and the mercy of God and His favors. Ye are they who cast the world behind you and hastened unto God, the Lord of eternity, when the nations were in manifest loss. Ye are they who aided God on earth and manifested His all-compelling power to all the worlds. We testify that through you were standards raised by the hands of bounty, and ye bore witness to that which God had testified before the creation of the heavens and earth that there is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Thus have We adorned the Paradise of Utterance with the roses of knowledge. He, verily, is the One Who doeth what He willeth through His word “Be” and it is. We return at the end of the Book to thy mention, O Salih, and thy brethren and what pertaineth unto thee, that thou mayest rejoice and give thanks unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. By God! Houses shall perish, trees shall be broken, winds shall cease, but that which We have built for thee by the hands of power shall never be touched by annihilation. To this beareth witness the Lord of the invisible and the visible. The glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have attained unto the remembrance of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. And praise be to God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>The call hath been raised from the Most Exalted Horizon, and they who dwelt on Sinai’s Mount in the realm of divine knowledge were thunderstruck. The Rock cried out and proclaimed: “The Ocean of Union hath surged, and the Lord of the Day of Reckoning hath come, riding upon the clouds.” Blessed is he whom the hosts have not weakened, though he be mighty, and whom the ranks have not daunted, though he be powerful. He hastened, and hearkened, and attained unto the presence of God, the Almighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the earth! Hearken unto My call which hath been raised in truth, and follow not the sources of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Say: The proof hath appeared and the stream of Salsabil hath flowed from the Pen of God, which speaketh from the most exalted station. We have heard thy call and have turned toward thee from this Spot which God hath made the Dawning-place of lights, and We have answered thee with a Tablet from whose horizon shineth the Day-star of the favors of the Lord of creation.</p>
<p>The servant who standeth before the face of the Wronged One hath read thy letter. We have revealed for thee that which shall endure as long as the Kingdom of God, the Lord of Lords, shall endure. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to make thee a sign of His signs and a standard among His standards in this Cause whereby faces have been darkened and feet have slipped. There hath befallen Me in the path of God that which no eye hath seen nor ear heard. To this beareth witness the Mother Book which speaketh before the faces of all parties. The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>When the light shone forth from the horizon of Manifestation, the Maid of Heaven came forth from the Most Exalted Paradise and walked until she stood before the face of the Lord of all mankind. She cried out and said, pointing with her luminous finger to the head of the Lord of Destiny: “By God! This is the Hidden One now made manifest in truth, and this is the Treasured One concealed within the hearts of the Prophets and mentioned in the books of God, the Lord of all men.”</p>
<p>Say: Be fair, O people of the Bayan, concerning this Book which God hath made the point round which circle all the books of the world, and this Remembrance before which all remembrances bow down. Say: Present yourselves before the Face that your eyes may behold what no eyes have seen and your ears may hear what no ears have heard. He is the One Who cannot be known except through Himself and Who needeth not the testimony of scriptures, books and tablets to prove His Cause. Were it not for Him, the Bayan would not have been revealed, nor would My Herald, Who sacrificed His life in My path, have come.</p>
<p>Fear God, O people, and be not of them that go astray. Say: By God! He was silent - God made Him speak; He was seated - the hands of power and might made Him arise; He was sleeping - the breezes of the morn of Revelation that blew by God’s will, the Lord of the Day of Return, awakened Him. Say: O people of the Bayan! He speaketh not from mere desire. To this testifieth that which hath been sent down from My Most Exalted Pen. Fear God and follow not every heedless doubter.</p>
<p>Say: O people of denial! Deny not Him Who hath come with that wherewith the Messengers came before, and Who hath revealed that which lay hidden in the treasure of God’s protection from time immemorial. Say: Read ye what ye possess and We shall read what We possess. Then shall ye find yourselves in greater loss than any polytheist or liar. Say: Remember ye the Day of Mubahalih in the Land of Mystery, when the Dawning Place of Inspiration came forth from the precincts of the House, directing His steps toward the House of God, the Lord of all men. We arrived therein while no one else entered it. Then did the Day-star of the Cause shine forth and the Ancient Beauty appear without veil or covering. Say: O people! Can anyone stand with Him in the arena of proof and evidence? Nay, by His Self, the All-Merciful! Thus have We sent down the verses and made manifest the evidences that thou mayest arise to aid the Cause of thy Lord with power and sovereignty.</p>
<p>O Samandar! In the Land of Mystery, the great ordeal has become more manifest than the sun. Nearly one hundred souls, including travelers and emigrants, were present; nevertheless, the deniers rejected it while the ignorant ones of the world accepted it. Convey My greetings to the loved ones of that land on behalf of the Wronged One, and give them the glad tidings of the effulgences of the Day Star of Manifestation. The matter of the honored Shaykh, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, is clear and evident. Indeed, he has borne countless hardships and has been wronged. We have instructed Jinab-i-Ism-i-Jud, upon him be My glory, to provide the details. And ’Abdi, that is, ’Abdu’l-Husayn, is remembered before the Wronged One. Wondrous and exalted Tablets have been sent especially for the loved ones, both men and women. Regarding what is being sent, it is beloved that copies be made and, after comparison and verification, be given to their owners. Praise be to God, all are mentioned and have attained the traces of the Pen. We beseech God to assist them and to confirm them in such steadfastness as will make firm the feet of the world. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The Glory from Us be upon you and upon those who are with you and who hearken to your words, and upon My loved ones in the cities of God and His lands - those who have not broken My covenant and My testament and who were among the steadfast in this Great Announcement and this Manifest Cause.</p>

<p>O Letter Ba’ to Letter Jim! Grieve not at the vicissitudes of the world. Find solace in the remembrance of God and be content therewith above all else. By Him Who made the Letter Ha’ the ornament of His Own Self, and with it adorned His kingdom and His dominion and His holy realms, ye have profited in your trade in such wise as none can reckon save God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds. He maketh mention of you in His seat, that ye may mention Him amongst the servants with wisdom and utterance, perchance ye may find them lightened from the burden of earth and all that is therein, and ascend unto a station that was highly exalted in the supreme Paradise. Beware, beware lest ye step forth from the robe of wisdom. They in whose hearts is doubt have appeared in the garments of faith, and thy Lord beareth witness that they are liars. Believe not every claimant who speaketh as his passion biddeth him. Thus doth He Who speaketh the truth command you. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the Unseen. Rejoice in His days and behold the signs of your Lord, the All-Merciful, and ponder them. By My life! They have encompassed the worlds. Glory and spirit be upon thee and upon those who have chosen the path unto God, the Almighty, the Great.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, to Him belong greatness and majesty!</p>
<p>O Letter ?a’! Hear the call of the Letter Ha’ that speaketh in the crimson hill, the place wherefrom the decree of destiny was severed, and from which the fragrance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, was diffused. Grieve not at the world and what occureth therein. By My life! All that is thereon shall perish, and there shall endure the face of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Blessed art thou for having urged on the steed of high resolve until the beauty of the Divine Unity was made manifest unto thee. We have accepted what hath passed from thee. Verily thy Lord is the Powerful, the Helper. This is the Day whereon the heaven was cleft asunder and the earth was rent and the path was set up, and this, verily, is the Balance. Say: The Balance hath appeared in the form of man, and walketh and speaketh and writeth what proceedeth from His lips - the servant present before the Throne, whom the peoples of all worlds from among those who followed Satan could not prevent. We have forsaken the world and its people, and have turned to a station wherein naught is seen save God, the Lord of all religions. By Him Who illumined the dawn and manifested the Night of Power! He speaketh between the heavens and the earth and calleth all unto God, and the might of the oppressors preventeth Him not, though they should all unite against Him with sword and spear. God hath written down for you the reward of them who have attained His presence and heard His call. Be content with what God hath been content with. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Merciful.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, to Him belong greatness and majesty!</p>
<p>This is a Book from Us unto him who hath turned towards the Holy Court. Verily his Lord is the Mighty, the Generous. They who follow God’s command, by My life, are in My good-pleasure and soar in My atmosphere and hear My call and circle round Me. They are, verily, the companions of paradise. Give thanks unto thy Lord for having wandered from thy homeland until thou drewest nigh unto thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Exalted be this noble and mighty station! Had the people known what lieth beyond the veil, they would have turned unto it with their heads, but they have been prevented from this mighty grace by what they have earned. They who have drawn nigh unto the Dayspring of Revelation are of the people of Baha. Their names have been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in a preserved and mighty tablet. Glory be upon thee and upon him who hath drunk the cup of tribulation in the path of his Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, to Him belong greatness and majesty!</p>
<p>By the grace of the All-Merciful, may His Chosen Ones be joyous at all times, content with the good-pleasure of the Friend and thankful. Today, wisdom is beloved for the education of the peoples of the world. All the loved ones must assuredly not transgress it. It has been observed that in every place where actions were taken contrary to that which God hath permitted, naught but sedition was manifested as a result. Hearken unto the call of the Friend, act according to His bidding, and be content. Be not grieved by separation, for afterwards, by His command, that very separation was the essence of nearness, and parting by His leave was the reality of union. These are the pure waters of inner meaning that have flowed from the Wellspring of the Pen of the All-Merciful. Drink thereof and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His station, to Him belong all glory and grandeur.</p>
<p>O Sin! The Manifest Truth declareth: This is the Day wherein the chosen ones must fix their gaze upon the command of the All-Choosing One and must efface their own will before the Will of God. That is, after the issuance of the binding decree from the direction of the Fashioner of bones and the Lord of all nations, that very command must become the beloved thing. How blessed, then, is he who ascendeth unto this station! Therefore, ye must observe with perfect wisdom whatsoever is deemed beneficial to the Cause, and act accordingly. Deeds take precedence over words. A goodly deed hath been and shall forever be the distinguishing feature. Be thou never grieved. Verily, He ordaineth for each one that which is best for him. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>O Mirza Abu’l-Qasim, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the One Who gazeth from His most exalted horizon. This is a Book sent down in truth from the heaven of Divine Will as a token of God’s grace, the Lord of all worlds, that it may draw the servants unto the most exalted horizon and bring them nigh unto Him. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Peerless, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned thy face unto the lights of His Countenance! Hearken unto the call of Him Who hath been wronged. He remembereth thee in the prison and remindeth thee of the verses of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. This is a Day whereon the Herald hath called out from every direction, the mountains have passed away, the Ark of the Bayan hath sailed upon the ocean of divine knowledge, and the Dove of proof hath warbled upon the highest branches. O peoples of the worlds! By God, the All-Merciful hath come with a sovereignty that neither the hosts of the world nor the clamor of the nations who have violated God’s Covenant and His Testament, who have disputed His verses and denied His Most Great Cause and His Mighty Message, can ever withhold. The stream of life-giving waters hath flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful, yet most of the people remain heedless. They have denied God’s favor and have changed it into disbelief. Lo! They are among the oppressors in a perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>We have heard mention of thee and have beheld thy turning unto Us. We have turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison and have remembered thee in this wondrous Tablet. When thou art blessed with it and findest the fragrance of utterance from thy Lord’s verses, the All-Merciful, say: “My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having strengthened me, made me recognize Thee, and caused me to hear when Thy sweetest call was raised and the pen of Thy most exalted Pen moved. I beseech Thee by Thy Cause through which the ocean of divine knowledge surged in the contingent world and the banner of Thy remembrance was raised amidst all religions, to make me aflame with the fire of Thy Sacred Tree, illumined by the lights of the Sun of Thy Revelation, uttering Thy praise, soaring in the atmosphere of Thy love, standing before the gate of Thy bounty and generosity, and serving Thy Cause. O Lord! Thou seest me detached from all else but Thee and turning unto the lights of Thy countenance. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which lieth with Thee. Ordain for me to attain Thy presence and to stand before the gate of Thy grandeur, and if Thy decree preventeth me from attaining Thy presence, ordain for me the reward of meeting Thee and that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have heard Thy sweetest call and have attained Thy presence, O Thou Who art the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below! O Lord! Aid me to serve Thy Cause and to arise for that which Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book in such wise that neither the might of the world nor the clamor of the nations shall hold me back. Then write down for me, O my God and my Master, the good of this world and the next and that which shall profit me in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.”</p>
<p>Hear in the Persian tongue: Today is the day of remembrance and praise, and the day of service. Service to God, exalted be His glory, and assistance to His Cause have been and are through goodly deeds, pure character, and the fear of God. We beseech God to assist you in promoting His Cause, that you may be enkindled with the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree–an enkindlement which the polluted and fetid waters of religious opposition cannot extinguish. The most excellent of all deeds today is to teach His Cause with joy and fragrance. Whosoever achieves this has achieved all good. Strive that you may attain to that which shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. The cawing ones are spread abroad like locusts. Beseech God to protect His loved ones in that land. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the friends in that land. Say: O party of God! Hold fast to the cord of patience and cling to the hem of service. This Day has no peer or likeness. Deeds performed therein are the sovereign of all deeds, and remembrance therein is the king of all remembrance. Deprive not yourselves. Set the world ablaze with the fire of the blessed Lote-Tree. Hold fast to the cord of unity and concord. Ere long will the Cause of God encompass all things and its signs appear throughout all regions. We beseech God to assist you and not deprive you of that which is ordained in His Book.</p>
<p>In the Scriptures and Tablets We have counseled the people of God to observe serenity and dignity, humility and submissiveness, kindness and grace, and wisdom. All must hold fast to the cord of wisdom and utter that which God desires. Should you engage in service in that land, the reward of attaining His presence is ordained by God. This matter–namely, teaching–is most great. If you hold fast to it, it is, in the sight of God, closest to godliness. And if you wish to return, there is no objection, provided wisdom dictates it, for the command of wisdom is most firm. In most Tablets We have commanded all to observe it. God suffices as a witness. The glory which proceeds from Us be upon you and upon God’s loved ones there, and upon those whom nothing whatsoever has prevented from drawing nigh unto God, the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O honored one, his eminence the Afnan, his honor Aqa Siyyid M–upon him be all the glory of God, the Most Glorious–may he be favored with the most luminous gaze.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! Although the darkness of the vain imaginings of the divines of the earth–those souls who are heedless of the Truth–hath encompassed the world, and the tyranny and oppression of rulers hath shaken the very foundations of all lands, and the deeds of the idolaters and transgressors have deprived hearts of their freshness, yet the call of the Desired One of all worlds and the lights of the Countenance of His Revelation have been raised and are shining forth in such wise that, in the eyes of them that are endued with vision, naught else is to be seen. At every moment He imparteth news unto the world, and the fragrances of His verses are wafted from the direction of His Prison. He is the Spirit of the world and the cause of the existence of the sons of men. Blessed is he who hath found and recognized Him, and woe unto the heedless ones!</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the Frequented Fane! I beseech Thee by the appearance of Him Who conversed on Sinai, Who calleth aloud between earth and heaven, that Thou aid Thy chosen ones to do that which beseemeth Thy sovereignty and grandeur. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O my Lord! Thou seest and knowest that this servant desired to make mention of them who are related unto Thyself and whom Thou hast named the Afnan of Thy Tree, though this be beyond my station and rank. Yet I make mention of them lest I be deprived of this bounty, and I thank Thee for this and for having enabled me to do so. Then, after making mention, I turn in repentance unto Thee, that this may serve as evidence of my powerlessness to make fitting mention of Thy loved ones. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the Kawthar of Thy utterance and the mysteries of Thy knowledge that Thou aid Thy Afnan as Thou didst aid them before, and ordain for them that which beseemeth Thy generosity. Verily, Thou art the Munificent, the Generous.</p>
<p>And furthermore, may my spirit be a sacrifice for your steadfastness, your remembrance, and your service. His blessed letter, which was sent along the way, bestowed light upon the heart, expansion upon the breast, and strength upon the vision. Praise be to God, the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory, was found therein, as well as the sweet news of His health and those with Him. Thanks be to the Goal of all the worlds, for His grace has been and continues to be manifest at all times, to such an extent that all the world is incapable and falls short of enumerating it.</p>
<p>If you wish to know of the conditions in the Land of Purpose: His honor the most great Master, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and the two Stars, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and the august ladies, upon them be the Glory of God and His grace and favor, were circumambulating. Later, according to the command, they proceeded to Beirut. God willing, may they ever be occupied with the remembrance of Truth and find rest beneath His shade.</p>
<p>After reading His letter before the Throne, these exalted words were revealed and sent down from the Source of verses and the Manifestation of clear proofs. He says, exalted be His glory and universal be His bounty and great be His station:</p>
<p>“O My Afnan, upon thee be My glory! The very arteries of the world are moved by the divine verses, and at every moment divine reinforcement reaches it, otherwise all would be seen as perished and extinct from the oppression of the people of the earth and the divines of the lands. Ask ye of God that He might knead the dust of certitude with the water of knowledge, and raise up souls who shall be seen as firm and steadfast as mountains in the Cause of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, and who shall attain such a station that no earthly affair shall prevent them from God, exalted be His glory, and a door to another world shall be opened unto their beings. By the life of God! Any soul who attains even a trace thereof shall see all who are on earth as mere handfuls of dust. Praise be to God, repeatedly hast thou attained that with which the world cannot compare.</p>
<p>“Convey My greetings to Muhammad, upon him be My glory. Say: Verily God shall be with thee, He heareth and seeth, and He is the Hearing, the Responding One. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to all the Afnan and gladden them with boundless favors.”</p>
<p>This servant also offers greetings and salutations to each one. God willing, may all become dawning-places of God’s will. The Tablets that were previously requested have been sent, numbering fourteen, by the count of the All-Bountiful. It is hoped they will arrive and be found as keys for hearts, as Kawthar for those thirsting in the wilderness of divine love, and as light breaking forth from the darkness of these days, and that all may take their portion from the ocean of their meanings.</p>
<p>I offer greetings and salutations to their honors, the illustrious Afnan, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God, who are present in that land. Blessed are they and joy be unto them for what God has confirmed them with and mentioned them in various Tablets. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Compassionate, the Generous. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon them and upon those who love them and turn unto them for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-Shafi’ - He is the Dawning Place from His Most Exalted Horizon! This is a Day wherein all things proclaim: “O concourse of creation! The Greatest Veil hath been rent asunder and the Greatest Scene hath been adorned through the revelation of God, the Lord of Destiny; yet most of the people remain heedless.” On this Day the Tongue of Glory calleth out from the pavilions of grandeur: “O denizens of earth and heaven! The Hidden Mystery hath appeared and the Self-Subsisting hath come with a sovereignty that neither the hosts of the world nor the armies of the oppressors among men could withstand.” Whoso hath shattered the idols of vain imaginings in the name of his Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, and hath turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon, saying: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all mankind, for having caused me to hear Thy call and honored Thy lands with Thy footsteps. I testify that through Thy manifestation that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds, hath been fulfilled. These are the days which Thy ambassadors, Thy messengers, and Thy chosen ones foretold through Thy word: ‘Lead forth the people from darkness into light and give them the glad-tidings of the days of God.’ Thus was the matter decreed in the Book by God, the Evident, the All-Knowing.” Is there any with hearing to hear the call of God? Is there any with vision to behold the Greatest Sign? Is there any possessed of steadfastness to arise and speak with wisdom and proof amidst the concourse of the Bayan? By God! That which cannot be mentioned by utterance nor described by what hath been revealed concerning it hath appeared. By the life of God! Verily it was revealed to exalt His mention and His Word - to this testifieth every fair-minded and perceiving one.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Shafi’! Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One and the servant present before His face hath presented it. Verily thy Lord heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have heard thy call and have answered thee through this Tablet whereby the breezes of the All-Merciful have wafted and the fragrance of utterance hath been diffused throughout all possibility. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Bountiful. Blessed is the soul that hath heard the call of its Lord and attained unto that which it was commanded by the Ordainer, the All-Wise. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear ye the All-Merciful and follow not your idle fancies. Follow Him Who hath come with the truth by a command whereagainst all who are in the heavens and earth are powerless to stand. This is a Day wherein the Proof calleth out with the loudest voice, wherein the Evidence speaketh amongst all creation, and the Testament crieth out before its Glorious Lord; yet the people are wrapped in a thick veil.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Thou hast spoken in the most eloquent tongue; now speak in a sweet Persian tongue. O Muhammad-Qabl-i-Shafi’! May you be blessed through divine favors! Your letter reached the Most Exalted Station through the Afnan, upon him be the Glory of God, and was honored to be heard by the Lord of all beings. Today it is incumbent upon everyone to move according to that which God has willed, meaning to submerge their own will and desire in the Will of God, to fix their gaze upon the will of the Friend, to turn toward His desire and to hold fast to His command. Today the Balance is manifest and proclaims with the most exalted call: “I am the Distinguisher, the Separator, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” How excellent is the condition of those souls who have clung to the Book of God and acted according to it. In all the Books this blessed Day is rightly attributed to God. One must arise to perform such deeds as befit this most holy Day. By My life! Goodly deeds have been and ever will be the helpers of Truth. If today someone should arise for the sake of God and act according to what He loves and is pleased with, assuredly the fragrance of his deeds will guide and lead people to the choice sealed Wine which has appeared and flows forth through the grace of the Finger of the Self-Subsisting Lord. The divine utterance shines forth like the sun, and the Path of the Lord stands out among all paths like a banner upon the hills, manifest, clear and evident. No sign among the signs of Truth resembles it, yet the vain imaginings of people have held them back and their conjectures have veiled them. God willing, may the friends of God attain to that which is the cause of protection, blessing, bounty and salvation. Praise the Beloved of the world that you have attained unto this Most Great Tablet and reached this station through the Afnan. Be thankful and be among those who give praise. Beseech God that He may assist all the friends to achieve what He desires. While time and opportunity remain, perchance such deeds as are adorned with the good-pleasure of the Friend may be manifested from the mirrors of existence. Verily thy Lord is the Expositor, the All-Wise. Verily thy Lord is the Rememberer, the All-Knowing, and the All-Informed Counsellor. You had sought forgiveness for certain souls. All have attained unto the Word of God. We have forgiven them as a grace from Our presence and a mercy from Our side, and We have mentioned them in verses from which the sincere ones will find My sublime and mighty fragrance. The Primal Point hath said that all were created for this: that they might be mentioned once in His presence. Know thou the station of this rank and hold fast to that which hath been commanded by God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and upon those who have acted according to that which they were commanded by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O Lord of eternity and Desire of the nations! I testify that they who claimed Thy love and spoke Thy praise and beseeched their Lord in the nights and days for Thy manifestation and meeting, and who would rise at the mention of Thy Herald saying “May God hasten His relief,” and who lamented in His separation and shed tears in His absence - when the appointed time came and the Light shone forth from the horizon of manifestation, they denied Him and His verses, rejected His right, and denounced Him openly from the pulpits until they pronounced sentence for the shedding of His blood and killed Him with such injustice as caused the dwellers of the pavilions of Thy greatness and the inhabitants of the Most Exalted Paradise and the Sublime Garden to lament. I beseech Thee, O Lord of Names, to protect Thy party from the evil of these people, then assist them with the hosts of the unseen and the visible, then ordain for them from Thy Most Exalted Pen the reward of attaining Thy presence and standing before Thy face and circling round the throne of Thy majesty. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art He Who with the finger of Thy will didst rend asunder the veils and the shrouds.

<p>O daughter of Hashim! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee in the Most Great Prison. Dost thou recognize Him Who maketh mention of thee? This is He by Whose grace the whole world holdeth fast and by Whose name they speak. From monasteries and temples and mosques and churches do they seek Him and call upon Him, yet remain veiled and debarred from Him. The cause of this debarring hath been and continueth to be the divines of the various parties. Say: […]</p>
<p>O my God and my Desire! I praise Thee and beseech of Thee that which befitteth Thy bounty and generosity. Thy handmaiden knoweth not what profiteth or harmeth her. Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Within Thy grasp of power lieth all things. Grant that which Thou deemest expedient. Thou art the Bestower, the Loving.</p>

He hath ever been and continueth to be mentioned in the Most Holy Court, especially on this night when the Tongue of Grandeur speaketh his praise, and two days ago a special Tablet was revealed from the heaven of Will for his son, that is, ?abibu’llah. We beseech God to assist His servants to hearken unto His utterance in remembrance of their Lord, the Mighty, the Manifest, the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>

Grace is within the grasp of divine power; He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth. Davud is in his place while the Wronged One is occupied with his remembrance in the Most Great Prison. No earthly means can equal this bounty. Blessed is he who hath attained in this Day, and woe unto the heedless ones. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

My brother Ustad Kazim, from whom no good effects have been witnessed, has multiple veils.

One payment arrived and they wrote it in my brother Ustad Kazim’s name. This has become a source of his veils, [saying] “I have not sent any payment, so why has this receipt been sent in my name?” That beloved one should be very careful in writing names, as this servant acts according to that beloved one’s letter and sends acknowledgment of receipt.

For each one has been revealed that by whose light the horizons of utterance are illumined and by whose mention the people of the cities of justice are made joyous and content. Soon it will be sent and will be illumined by the lights of the utterance of the Goal of the worlds.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written that His Honor Aqa Muhammad-Javad (with nun and ra), upon him be the Glory of God, has arranged with that beloved one to deliver the mentioned amount each year, after being presented at the Most Holy Court, this word appeared from the Kingdom of Utterance of the Goal of the worlds: “O Trustee! He hath attained unto acceptance and is engaged in service. Leave this matter to himself so that whatever occurs may be with spirit and fragrance. Verily We greet him once again that he may give thanks to his Lord, the Generous, the Bountiful.”</p>
<p>And regarding what was written about Ibn-i-Shahid, upon him be God’s Glory and favors - if souls act with perfect spirit and fragrance and gratitude for the sake of God, it is accepted; otherwise, leave them to themselves, turning unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. This servant greatly wonders at souls who have attained unto the light of recognition and faith, yet hesitate in what is befitting the Day of God. We beseech God to assist them and grant them success. Verily He is the best Helper and the best Guardian, and He is the Compassionate, the All-Knowing, the Wise.</p>
<p>As regards the matter of regular allowances about which they wrote, it is by no means permissible to mention it to them. Concealment of this matter from all is necessary and obligatory. This evanescent servant beseeches God to assist them to attain wealth and independence. If they cleave for a while to contentment and arise to serve, assuredly the gates of bounty will be opened before them and the sun of wealth will shine forth from the horizon of the Ancient Lord’s generosity, even as this has been manifested in previous communities and they have heard thereof.</p>
<p>Another matter concerns the funds sent by three trustworthy souls - his honor Aqa Muhammad-Rida (of Muhammad-Abad), his honor Karbala’i Aqa Husayn (of Tabas), and his honor Aqa Muhammad-Baqir (of Naraq), upon them be the Glory of God - which were received and accepted with favor. However, the beloved and honored one, Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be [the Glory of God], requested the receipts, as they had been received from him and given several months ago. Later that esteemed one requested them again, and as he repeatedly mentioned this, they were sent. The point is that receipts for these three items have been given twice, and that beloved one should be informed of this.</p>
<p>Another matter: According to the command, if the beloved of the heart, his honor Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be the Glory of God, should proceed to the Caucasus region and conduct himself with wisdom, this would be acceptable and beloved in the sight of God.</p>

<p>In the name of God, exalted be His glory, His is the majesty and power!</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Your mention, which was described in brief, was received, bringing the fragrance of love and bestowing a fresh gift. Now, in response to your brief letter, I must present a brevity that contains length, and that is the letter Mim which appears at the beginning of the name ‘Mahbub’ (Beloved). In one station its numerical value is forty, which some have described as the perfect number, and this number was associated with the time of the Seal of the Prophets, may my spirit be sacrificed for His sake. God is witness and testifier that from the name ‘Mahbub’ new breezes of love and knowledge are manifest and evident. Whosoever attains unto this has attained unto all good. The Command is in God’s hands, the Desired One of the mystics and the Beloved of those who are near.</p>
<p>Now from your brief letter, indeed from the first letter of the name alone, countless books of love, fellowship, affection, and unity can be derived. When your handwriting arrived and its contents were perceived, it gave new power to the taste. In truth, a sweet intoxication from this wine occurred. At once, approaching the Presence, it was presented, and He said:</p>
<p>They have partaken of their share from the Kawthar of divine love at every moment and received their portion. We beseech God to grant him at all times that which will draw him near and through which his clear Cause will be exalted.</p>
<p>This pearl of brief utterance which hath appeared from the ocean is a brevity wherein infinite worlds lie concealed, and likewise the realms of meaning and utterance. Praise be to God that those beloved ones have been and continue to be successful in all conditions, and whatsoever they sent was truly for the sake of God and complete endeavor was expended therein - it was and shall ever be worthy of mention. Its effects have preceded and its fruits shall follow. The fruits of divine favor from it are manifest, brilliant and evident, for it became present, watchful and aware of mention and praise. From that direction, that beloved one and that one who turned to God - the true Haji who was present and attained - were partners and helpers in that service, and from this direction were all-encompassing favors and countless bestowals. Now observe how something that was not worthy of any mention became the cause of all these favors appearing. His is the praise for His bounties, His is the praise for His utterances, His is the praise for His favors, His is the praise for His benevolence, and His is the praise for His mercy that hath encompassed us. It is most clear and evident that these favors had no connection to him, yet God made him the cause for their appearance.</p>
<p>That spiritual beloved, His Holiness Ali, upon him be the glory of God, the One, arrived and delivered the spiritual repasts and the fountains of the All-Merciful. God is witness that this servant hath ever desired to make mention of you. All aspects of the heart have been seized by the rays of mention and praise shining from that direction. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that this supreme bounty may endure and that its manifestations may ever remain constant and its fragrance diffused. In brief, the surging waves of separation are not yet stilled - at every moment they appear with new force and in different form. The separation from Ali hath wrought and continueth to work such effects. God willing, its consolation shall come through another meeting, and the command is God’s, the Possessor of Destiny.</p>
<p>The envelopes which were destined from the beginningless realm to become the bearers of Tablets and the extenders of spirits have in these days arrived through the endeavor of that beloved one and shall attain infinite outpourings. In truth, these envelopes were and are the beloved envelopes of the world and are accounted as one of the divine treasuries, for within them are stored and concealed the pearls of wisdom and utterance and the gems of knowledge and certitude. How can the pen describe or the heart enumerate? We beseech Him, exalted be He, to unite us with you and bestow upon us that which hath no likeness or peer. Verily He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>I convey humility, submissiveness, mention and praise to each of the loved ones in that land, and I seek for each that which shall cause the world’s advancement and the progress of nations. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is. Prayer and peace and mention and glory be upon your honor and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. And praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.</p>

<p>O Siyyid Mahdi, upon thee be the Glory of God! He is the Truth, the Knower of the Unseen! O Mahdi, read what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “O my son! If there be a matter the weight of a mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth.” All that was deposited in this blessed verse concerning misery and felicity, detachment and greed, trustworthiness and treachery, hath been made manifest and evident. Blessed is the eye which the veils of idle fancies have not prevented, and the ear which hath attained to hearing. Glory be to God! The treacherous one hath claimed trustworthiness and opened the tongue of counsel. O Mahdi, that which was hidden in the breasts hath been revealed, for the Day wherein secrets are laid bare hath raised its banner, and that which was concealed in the eyes and hidden in the breasts hath, through His all-compelling Will, been made manifest and apparent. No condition of the Hour, and no secret of the Resurrection remaineth unrevealed; nay rather, that which no understanding, knowledge or learning hath comprehended hath been made manifest. The Truth, exalted be His glory, encompasseth and is not encompassed. Verses descend like rain, and evidences from before and after shine forth like the sun. Blessed is the eye that seeth and the ear that heareth, and woe unto the heedless!</p>
<p>Thy letter which thou didst send to the Name of God hath attained unto the Most Holy Court. Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the station honored by Thy footsteps, and by the Names which have won the glances of Thine eyes of grace, and by the House wherein was raised Thy most sweet call and the most exalted scratching of Thy Pen - by Thy might, the lovers have been consumed by the fire of remoteness in Thy days. The force of separation hath so seized them that their spirits have well nigh departed from their bodies. Look, O my God, upon those who seek Thee with the eyes of Thy mercy, and deliver them from the torment of remoteness through the grace of Thy nearness. Then make me, O my God, so firm in Thy love that the calumnies of the people and the doubts of those who have denied Thee and Thy signs shall not prevent me. O Lord! Open before the faces of the religions, through Thy name the All-Merciful, the gates of Thy grace and mercy, that they may return from their vain imaginings to the horizon of certitude through Thy power and bounty. Then ordain for me and for those who love Thee and have drunk the choice wine of Thy revelation from the hand of Thy bounty, every good thing Thou hast sent down in Thy perspicuous Book. Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds!</p>
<p>O Mahdi, upon thee be My Glory! Thou didst request permission to attain Our presence. In these days divine wisdom doth not permit such permission to be granted. Be patient, for thy Lord is the All-Patient, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech God to ordain that which His prevailing Will hath determined. In these days sorrows descend from every direction and the divine sheep are afflicted amidst wolves. Ask God, thy Lord, to protect His servants through His power and dominion, and to assist them in that whereby His Word may be exalted amongst His creation. Verily, He is powerful over all things. We make mention of thy brother, and We are the All-Mentioning, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Hearken unto the call of God, the Single, the One. He draweth thee nigh unto His most exalted horizon and ordaineth for thee that which shall solace the eyes of the observers. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy mother and thy sister, and upon those who have believed in God, the Lord of the Throne, and upon My handmaidens who have believed in the Lord of the exalted Seat. We make mention of him who desired to attain My presence, who was named Muhammad-Hasan, and We give him glad tidings of My grace and We beseech God to ordain for him the reward of attaining the presence of Him Who conversed on Sinai. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. And We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Baqir and We beseech God to raise through him the standard of steadfastness and to strengthen him in His remembrance and praise and the service of His Cause. Verily, He is the Protector of those who remember Him and the Master of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>O Ali! Hear My call from the precincts of My prison and say: Praise be unto Thee, O my Goal and my Beloved, for having caused me to turn towards the Kaaba of Thy knowledge and to acknowledge that which the tongue of Thy grandeur hath spoken. I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which shall preserve me from turning to anyone but Thee. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Most Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Siyyid Mahdi! Upon thee be the everlasting glory of God. As to what thou hast asked concerning the Revelation, thou hast indeed spoken the truth, and the truth is with thee. We beseech God to make known unto all the station of this Revelation and teach them of its mighty tidings.</p>
<p>O people of God! Cast away what the people possess and take hold of My Book through My strength, My power, and My sovereignty. Then drink of the Kawthar of utterance in My Name and My remembrance, despite those who have turned away and disbelieved, even to the point of pronouncing judgment against God, the Lord of the mighty throne. Grieve not over anything. Turn with illumined hearts to the Most Sublime Horizon - this station wherein the Tongue of Grandeur speaketh, and around which circle the Most Exalted Paradise, the Supreme Heaven, and the company of those near unto God and the sincere ones.</p>
<p>The glory from Us be upon thee, O Mahdi, and upon those whose names thou hast mentioned at the end of thy letter, and upon thy other brother, and thy other sister, and upon every steadfast and firm servant in the Cause of God, the Lord of this exalted station.</p>

<p>=== START BH01297 ===</p>
<p>I testify that there is no God but Him, acknowledging what the Tongue of Grandeur testified before the creation of the heavens and earth, and affirming what He revealed in His decisive, revealed and manifest Book. Prayers and peace be upon Him Who shone forth and appeared from the horizon of God’s will, the Lord of all worlds, Who was adorned with His most beautiful names and supreme attributes, Who was the Purpose of the creation of the world and the appearance of nations, and through Whom prophethood and messengership were sealed by the command of God, the Lord of creation, and upon His family and companions through whom the veil of idle fancies and vain imaginings was rent asunder among the peoples, and the light of certitude shone forth from God, the Powerful, the Mighty, and through whom the Kawthar of divine knowledge flowed throughout creation and the Dove of Utterance warbled upon the branches that there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And then, may my spirit be sacrificed for you, some time ago this servant was blessed with the traces of the Pen of that Beloved One - may God exalt Him. From His words wafted the fragrance of true sincerity and spiritual attraction to God alone. Although the fragrance of spring is with the trees, and pure water with the saplings, and the Kawthar of union with the seekers, and the Salsabil of meeting with the lovers, a hundred thousand praises be to the Purpose of all worlds Who adorned the Afnans of His Tree with that which befits His grace and bounty. After reading and learning of it, He intended to present it before His presence where it was honored to be heard.</p>
<p>O My Afnan, upon you be My peace. In truth, your separation has been prolonged - the Wronged One bears witness to this and He is the Just and Trustworthy Witness. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant you a full portion from the oceans of His gifts and bounties, and to illuminate you with the effulgences of the Day-Star of grace. He is the True Bestower and the Eternal Giver. No matter has ever prevented His grace, and no thing has ever blocked His bounty. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>End. Praise be to God, you have ever been and continue to be blessed with special favors. Whatever this servant might express in this regard would be counted as audacity. I seek forgiveness from God, the Great, for this great audacity.</p>
<p>As for the delay in responding to your letter, I have been and remain ashamed, but you know that in some days opportunity is lacking, as the matter is evident and manifest, and that Spiritual Beloved One Himself is witness and testimony to the truth of this servant’s plea. My excuse is, God willing, acceptable to the Afnan of the Blessed Tree, may my spirit be sacrificed for them. I beseech and hope for the wondrous favors, bounties and gifts of God, exalted be His glory, that soon the carpet of nearness will be spread and the rug of remoteness rolled up. In truth, when the Day-Star of meeting rises, pen and tongue are incapable and fall short of describing it, as confirmed by those endowed with vision and the people of the Most Sublime Vision. Now, on this Saturday night, the 15th of Rabi’ul-Awwal, He is present before His face and again makes mention of you, meaning that through God’s grace, exalted be His glory, you have been and continue to be remembered. Likewise, mention was made by the Beloved of the honored Haji Muhammad-Rida, upon him be the glory of God. This servant also conveys greetings and praise to him and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, for his success and confirmation.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou hearest the cry of the lovers and the plaint of those who yearn for Thee. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst deliver Thy chosen ones from the evil of Thine enemies and didst exalt Thy Cause through Thy power and might, to assist Thy loved ones to do what is pleasing and acceptable unto Thee. Then ordain for them, O Thou through Whose Name the ocean of generosity surged throughout the world, that which shall profit them in the hereafter and in this world, and shall draw them nigh unto Thee in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Lord of grace abounding. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>In truth, whenever this servant intends to write in service to the Afnan, he finds himself possessed of such eagerness that neither paper nor pen can contain it. Love and affection bear witness to this and testify thereof. However, as attention must be given to that which is essential, these brief missives must suffice, else the pen would find no rest from the fire of longing, nor would the tongue choose silence. In any case, I beseech Him, exalted be His glory, to aid in that which befits pure servitude unto His own Self. Peace, remembrance and glory be upon you, upon those who are with you, and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>The Beloved Spirit His Eminence Samandar, upon him be all the most glorious Baha, may gaze upon it with most radiant and pure vision</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who is unique, but not through the uniqueness known to creation; Who is one, but not through the oneness perceived by contingent beings; Who is supreme, but not through the supremacy spoken of by the people of creation; and Who is sanctified, but not through the sanctification uttered by the Concourse of Creation. We bear witness that there is none other God but Him, and none knoweth Him save Him, and none mentioneth Him save Him, for whatsoever the people of earth utter is bounded by the limitations of creation. Far exalted is the Truth above being approached by the birds of knowledge or being ascended to by the attributes of those in the realm of possibility. He hath created all things through the Will which He hath brought into being in the realm of possibility through the essence of possibility itself. He, verily, is the Sanctified, the Exalted, the Holy, the Mighty, the Help in Peril.</p>
<p>And then, the servant hath attained unto your letter, whose words wafted like a gentle breeze over the gardens of hearts and minds, whereby spirits and intellects were renewed, for they told of your love for our Beloved and the Beloved of all worlds, and of your arising to make mention of God, our Goal and the Goal of them that know. Exalted is He Who strengthened you, exalted is He Who caused you to speak, exalted is He Who enkindled you, exalted is He Who taught you, exalted is He Who caused you to know, and exalted is He Who made you one who speaketh, who remembereth, and who praiseth His beautiful praise at morn and eventide.</p>
<p>This servant was honored to receive the letter of that beloved one. God the One is witness that boundless joy was attained from its arrival, though grief had encompassed this servant due to the sorrows that had befallen those beloved ones. However, since whatever hath occurred hath been for the sake of God, we must fix our gaze upon the Kingdom of submission and contentment. What befell his eminence, the embodied spirit, Nabil-ibn-Nabil, upon him be the Most Glorious Baha of God, hath grieved all. Yet a hundred thousand blessings upon them who, in their earliest days, drank from the cup of tribulations and tasted from the chalice of trials. May my soul be a sacrifice for His love. We beseech the True One, glorified and mighty be He, that through His all-pervading power and conquering might He may protect those beloved ones and their kin.</p>
<p>Counsel all the friends to observe wisdom, for this day they are commanded to do so, and this matter hath been revealed in God’s Tablets from the Pen of the Divine Unity, as some become grieved and disturbed by the authority of those in apparent power. The True One hath regarded and continues to regard all with the eye of His encompassing mercy, and this is but one of the fruits of wisdom, while a hundred thousand wisdoms lie hidden and concealed in the wisdom He hath commanded all to observe. None knoweth them save Him. Though in the past year some lack of wisdom occurred in certain lands - we beseech God to assist all to do what He loveth and is pleased with - yet some of those who acted considered their actions to be wisdom. Their judgment returneth unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Convey greetings from this servant to all the friends in that land, especially to his eminence K.D., upon him be the glory of God. Though they are not present, their mention hath been and continues to be in the Most Holy Court.</p>
<p>Likewise, regarding his eminence Mulla ’Abdu’r-Razzaq, upon him be the glory of God - in the letter he wrote to his eminence Ism-i-Jud, he had requested certain Tablets for certain ones. All have been sent down from the heaven of favor and dispatched. God willing, they will be honored by them. Furthermore, all that was sent - the rice and crown - has arrived. That honored one has indeed endured and continues to endure many hardships. From the land of Rasht, petitions from both relatives and others have reached the Most Holy Court, and answers to all have been revealed and dispatched. God willing, may all remain steadfast in the Cause of God through the fragrances of divine verses and the breezes of the Lord’s days, with such steadfastness as has not been witnessed before and shall not be witnessed hereafter. Convey sublime and glorious greetings from this evanescent one to Jinab-i-Abu-Turab and his brothers who were mentioned in your letter.</p>
<p>Another matter: due to the abundance of correspondence, there was no opportunity to write anything to your honored brother, upon him be the eternal glory of God. God willing, I hope to be forgiven. Two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of favor specifically for you and him and have been sent. Another matter: I have not written anything to Jinab-i-Ism-i-Jud, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], as permission for his presence at the Most Holy Court has been granted and was previously dispatched. Upon you and upon him and upon those who have believed be the glory of God and His mercy, and the light of God and His kindness. The Servant. 11 Jamadi’ul-Avval 1293.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, might, grandeur and power!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who taught the Supreme Pen that whereby the realities of all things were attracted, and caused it to speak His praise and glorification in the kingdom of names. And peace and blessings be upon the Lord of His chosen ones, the Dawning-Place of His knowledge amongst His servants, and the Source of His command throughout His lands - He through Whose grace speech was revealed and Whom God taught expression - and upon His family and companions, the daysprings of the horizons of His might, power, grandeur and sovereignty.</p>
<p>To proceed: Your letters arrived repeatedly, each one a perfect blessing and all-encompassing joy that seized the foundations and adorned them with the ornament of delight. After reading them, I proceeded to His presence and presented them before Him. The Lord - may our souls be a sacrifice for Him - spoke thus:</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The station is desirable and the companion sought after, for truly rare indeed has it been and continues to be. In truth, a soul adorned with human attributes is seen as rare as red sulphur, nay rarer still. Should a soul be confirmed and perceive the fragrance of the utterance of the Purpose of all worlds from the Surih of the All-Merciful, then at that moment this station and its loftiness will become somewhat evident. His blessed and exalted Word states: “The All-Merciful taught the Qur’an, created man, taught him utterance.” Now man is the station of the gathering of all gatherings. God hath made him the Dawning-Place of His most beautiful names, the Dayspring of His most exalted attributes, the recipient of His knowledge amidst humanity, and the source of His commandments and ordinances in the realm of creation. Verily, he is the gate of God’s wisdom amongst His servants and the treasure of knowledge amidst His creation. Through him God hath manifested whatsoever He hath willed. Verily, He is the Master of creation, and within His grasp lies the reins of all matters from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Your honored host, may God the Blessed, the Most High, strengthen him, is among those of the aforementioned station, meaning he is considered human in the sight of God. Blessed be he! We beseech God to strengthen him, assist him, and ordain for him that which will exalt his name in His lands among His servants. Verily, He has power over all things.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! In every instance, His Honor Effendi, may God strengthen him through His Eternal Name, is mentioned, and surely there are effects and fruits from this mention. We beseech God, the Blessed, the Most High, to strengthen His Honor and manifest for him what has been ordained. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>In your previous letter, spiritual friend, you mentioned the feast gathering and attendance thereat, as well as the presence of the distinguished orator, namely His Honor Sheikh Abbas, may God the Most High assist him. Although this servant has not had the honor of meeting him, I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to sanctify the orators of the world and adorn them with the ornament of knowledge and deeds. Verily, our Lord is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>However, when your letter arrived, a learned person present recognized him and said that he is truly a servant of the government with sincerity, and has revealed the secrets of certain religious leaders who are in fact opposed to the nation and government, this being the result of association and friendship. Then another person said that according to your mention, he is an inspector from the government. This servant stated that we do not know these things - we consider all as servants of God unless we witness wrongdoing with our own eyes, and in any case, we pray for all and have no secrets ourselves except the mention of God and His oneness.</p>
<p>Then he wished to say a few words, but it was observed that perhaps words might arise causing displeasure to both parties, so this servant arose and the meeting concluded. In truth, what causes joy and delight to this servant is that you are in the presence of an accomplished and distinguished person, namely His Honor Effendi. This is a great bounty and an exalted station. Thanks be to God, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about His Honor and his good deeds, good intentions, and good fellowship - yes, yes, this servant bears witness, and likewise the friends of this land and their chief all testify that His Honor possesses praiseworthy qualities and laudable attributes. I beseech the True One, exalted be His station, to increase his station at all times. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Generous, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>The friends around the Master all send greetings and especially ask for you that which befits His generosity. And now, the apple of our eye, His Honor Aqa Mirza Mustafa, upon him be 9 6 6 [Baha’u’llah], sends greetings and mentions that spiritual friend in various stations. We beseech God to strengthen him and you and His loved ones in what He loves and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Lord of all beings and the Master of the last and the first.</p>
<p>Peace and mercy be upon you and upon God’s righteous servants.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and the Power</p>
<p>The outer and inner eye is fixed upon the horizon of the utterance which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an, blessed and exalted be His Word: “Verily with difficulty cometh ease.” It is hoped that this ease will appear with the Most Great Light from the horizon of the favors of the Truth, exalted be His glory, accompanied by the hosts of joy, delight, gladness, wealth and affluence. Universal are His favors, perfect His beneficence, all-encompassing His grace, and His mercy hath preceded all else. And blessings and peace be upon the Knight of the arena of might and power, through whom the breezes of revelation were cut off from among the nations and prophethood in the world came to an end, and upon His family and companions, the standards of justice and the banners of guidance, through whom God revealed His power, His might, His sovereignty, His grandeur and His authority - blessings that are eternal and everlasting. Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>The letter from that beloved one arrived with spirit and fragrance, and was honored to be read before Our presence. O Muhammad, be not sorrowful. By the life of God, the world is seen as but a handful of dust. The winds of divine will blow upon it, carrying it wheresoever they list and giving it whatsoever shape they desire. It hath not been, nor is it, worthy of mention in the sight of the people of Baha. The purpose is that your honor should not be saddened or distressed by its events. Praise be to God that trustworthiness is established and detachment proven, resolve and prudence are present, and the matter is in God’s hands. In such case, sorrow is not permitted nor grief befitting, for this is a day of joy. Indeed, the grief and sorrow of those who are nigh and sincere arise only when they witness from someone, God forbid, a deed from which the fragrance of treachery or wrongdoing emanates. Praise be to God, your honor’s intention and deeds have been for God’s sake; their end shall be good. Convey My greetings to the friends in that land, and We counsel them with that which God hath counseled His servants aforetime in His Books, His Scriptures and His Tablets. They must, with sanctified and illumined hearts, with complete resolve and perfect wisdom, unite in holding fast to the reformation of their affairs, that their good deeds may be proven before God and their striving to uphold the truth, to manifest the Most Great Trust among the peoples, and to establish this Most Exalted Cause may be proven before men. This Wronged One ever mentioneth each one of them and seeketh for each in this transitory world that which is lasting and eternal. May God illumine their faces and their hearts and exalt their stations and ranks. Verily He is the Protector of the doers of good and the Helper of those who act. Praise be to Him, for He is the Goal of the mystics.</p>
<p>Two letters from your honor arrived, each a door to meeting and reunion. Though outwardly this appeareth difficult, yet with God and the manifestations of His power it is easy and simple. I beseech the exalted Truth, glorified be His majesty, to manifest that which is the cause of joy and the source of gladness. Verily He is knowing of all things. In the nights and at dawn, in the mornings and evenings, I beseech the Truth for that which is the cause of elevation and advancement. Verily He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. I bear witness, and all things bear witness, to His power, His sovereignty, His might, His generosity, His grace and His favors. There is no God but He, the Hearer, the Answerer, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>To those honoured ones in that land I convey my greetings. They are present before my eyes and before my sight - how could they be effaced from my heart, when the saplings of love have been planted therein and watered by the rains of God’s grace, exalted be His glory? The love of friends neither diminishes nor perishes, for God, exalted be His glory, has thus described it. God willing, may each one act in accordance with what befits the station of His chosen ones. God is my witness that when the first letter arrived, mentioning the illness of that beloved one, what it did to this lowly one! Praise be to God, afterwards the glad tidings of recovery arrived and made amends. According to the command of that beloved one, they must not be sorrowful, for sorrow is the cause of certain manifestations. Verily our Lord knoweth, and He is the All-Healing, the All-Wise. And though from the second letter there wafted at first the fragrance of sorrow, yet at its end the light of joy was evident. Praise be to God and thanks be to Him in all conditions. May prayer and peace and remembrance and praise be upon you all and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the glorious throne.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>Praise be to the Desired One, Who hath befittingly adorned His loved ones with the ornament of supreme steadfastness, and bestowed and conferred upon them the food of certitude from the chalice of proof. The Supreme Cause of this most great bounty hath been the King of existence and Lord of the praiseworthy station, through Whom the river of divine knowledge hath flowed throughout all possibility, and the Dove of Utterance hath warbled upon the highest branches. Sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Lord of Lords. Upon Him rest the blessings of God, His grace, His peace and His mercy, and upon His family and companions, and upon those who attained unto His days and acted according to that which they were bidden in His Book.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter of that beloved of the heart arrived, and that which was written concerning the heedless ones and deniers became known. In this connection, after presenting the matter, they stated that association with such souls, if it leadeth to their awakening and remembrance, is praiseworthy; otherwise they merely report to their like that so-and-so came, delegated and accepted, and such calumnies as the honored Observer himself knoweth. We have spoken what We have spoken for the sake of God. We have no concern with the deeds of such souls. The condition of those who have accepted is evident, and likewise the turning away of those who have turned away is clear and manifest. We have desired good for all the peoples of the world. Our purpose is that the causes of discord be eliminated from all horizons, and that the light of unity illuminate all hearts and minds.</p>
<p>God is Our witness, and all atoms bear testimony to what We have endured in the path of His Cause, what We have seen and what We have heard. In the days when, by reason of the intensity of tyranny, day could not be distinguished from night, this Wronged One stood forth before all faces and, with loudest voice, proclaimed the Most Great Word, His purpose being to cleanse and sanctify the servants through the living waters of divine counsel from vain imaginings, rancor and hatred. When the Cause became somewhat manifest, they rushed forth and assailed the Wronged One, and said that which ye have heard, and did that which ye have witnessed. I have placed My trust in God and have committed My affairs unto Him. My success is from Him alone, and I seek victory from none but Him. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>In truth, the lamp of justice hath been extinguished and the sun of equity concealed. That beloved one himself hath heard that whose putrid odor of falsehood hath corrupted the world and deprived it of the fragrance of truthfulness. As to what was written concerning the sum that was stolen, in a previous letter a word was mentioned from the blessed tongue regarding this matter. Subsequently they said that mention of the theft should not be made to those who had given it, as this would cause them sorrow. We accepted this, and if a receipt is required, it shall be sent. They said: Write to the Observer that in truth the ornaments of this world befit its people. By the life of God! Were it not for this community, not a penny would have been accepted, and yet this matter is the supreme bounty and mercy for those souls who have given and continue to give. In these days, due to religious considerations, some amounts were transferred to be given to others, the details of which were mentioned before.</p>
<p>Let the honored friend, Aqa Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be God’s peace, not be saddened by what hath occurred. There have ever been traitors in the world. I beseech God to grant unto him and unto this servant that which the hand of the traitor and thief cannot reach the holy hem thereof. I likewise beseech God to kindle him with such fire of His love as shall cause the heedless to become enkindled. Verily God hath power over all things.</p>
<p>I convey greetings to the loved ones. I present remembrance and salutations to the beloved of the heart, the honored Shaykh and those with him, upon them be Baha’u’llah. I hope that a meeting shall also take place, as the honored master, his eminence AF, upon him be the Most Glorious Baha’u’llah, God willing, intendeth to proceed to those parts. The servant beseecheth his Lord in all conditions to make us among those whom neither the profit of the world nor its ornaments and colors have prevented from His straight path and His mighty and great Cause.</p>
<p>The true light of the eye, the honored Aqa Mirza ?abibu’llah, upon him be God’s peace, praise be to God, is present and hath taken shelter beneath the blessed Divine Lote-Tree with utmost joy, delight and health. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those with you, and upon those who have acted according to that which they were commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of the mighty throne.</p>

<p>Praise be to the All-Giving Lord, the Master of origin and return, Who hath uttered that which leadeth to the advancement and elevation of existence, the tranquility of the world, and the order of nations, and Who hath adorned the Afnan among His servants with kinship unto Himself and illumined them with the rays of His special bounty and favor. And blessings and peace be upon His handiwork through whom the world was set ablaze with the fire of the love of God, through whom the gate of heaven was opened and the treasures of the Divine Throne and all that was stored therein were revealed, and upon His family and companions, the dawning-places of might and the daysprings of power, through whom authority was manifested, the rock cried out, the ocean of justice surged, and the fragrance of equity was wafted abroad. My spirit be a sacrifice for your service, your mention and your praise.</p>
<p>Your multiple letters arrived and gave fresh light to the eye and a new melody to the ear. We beseech God to strengthen your pen and to cause the ink to succeed in mentioning love and unity. In truth, from every word thereof the fragrance of the spirit was diffused. After perusal, We proceeded to the Most Great Prison where it was presented, and He declared:</p>
<p>He is the Helper, the Chosen One!</p>
<p>O My Afnan, O ’Ali, upon thee be the peace of God and His loving-kindness! Praise be to God Who hath granted health, bestowed strength, and confirmed thee in the recognition of His blessed Self. Were it not for His grace, who would be able to turn unto Him or recognize even a single one of His mentions? At all times the rain of grace and bounty descendeth from the clouds of mercy. We beseech Him to protect thee and to confirm thee in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Grieve not over the severe trials that have befallen through God’s irrevocable decree, for after every hardship He hath promised ease, and after every intensity, relief. Throughout all ages people have experienced both hardship and relief, and afterwards they have attained to that which hath no equal. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou seest me turning unto Thee and clinging to the cord of Thy generosity, the cord of Thy grace, the cord of Thy bestowal, and the cord of Thy bounty. I am surrounded on all sides by that which hath caused my limbs to quake and my heart to tremble. I beseech Thee, O Reformer of all affairs, by the One Who conversed on Sinai, and by the Light and its Manifestation, and by Thy Prophets and Thy chosen ones, and by Him through Whom and through Whose advent the heavens of Thy power and the spheres of Thy utterance were honored, to transform these sorrows into joy, this hardship into relief, this difficulty into ease, and this abasement into supreme glory. I testify that Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest. Thou hearest and answerest, and verily Thou art the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>We send greetings to the loved ones in that land. Convey Our greetings to Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be the peace of God and His grace. Permission was sought previously for one of the loved ones and permission was granted. The other loved ones are mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. We beseech God to confirm them all in fellowship, unity, love and concord, and in deeds that lead to the exaltation of their station. Verily, He hath power over all things. We have ever mentioned and continue to mention the loved ones. We beseech the Exalted One to protect them and to send down upon them blessings from the heaven of His bounty. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>All praise and bounty belongs to God, inasmuch as He protected the companions of the prison with sovereignty, glory and grandeur, and bestowed love and affection upon them. I beseech His exalted Self to gather them beneath the banner of His generosity that hath encompassed all existence, and to aid them to achieve praiseworthy character and goodly deeds. Verily He is the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth the Eternal Truth to adorn that blessed and auspicious being with the ornament of joy and delight, and to make manifest the means of gladness and felicity. Although according to the utterance of the Master, the people of grace, truthfulness, kindness and forbearance have ever reposed beneath the shade of His favor, for their glory is of God and their joy hath been and is in Him. This is why in one of the Tablets He saith: The dominion of the Afnan is established in the divine Kingdom, not in the earthly realm of water and clay. Verily He is the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. It is hoped that through God’s grace and favor that which beseemeth His generosity, bounty and munificence may be made manifest. I convey greetings and praise to the loved ones of that land, and I have mentioned and continue to mention each one of them. Verily our Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. The prayer that Haji–upon him be God’s peace–requested was sent. It is hoped that they may attain unto it and drink from the choice wine of its utterance. Verily He is the Helper, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Majesty and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise be to the Desired One of the world Who, through a hundred thousand means, hath manifested and nurtured His servants and guided them to His straight and evident path. He hath gathered the wanderers in the desert of love and affection beneath the shade of His blessed Word, and through the outpourings of His mercy and the effulgences of the Sun of His grace hath bestowed bounty and repose. Glorified be His majesty and all-pervading be His favor! There is none other God but Him. And peace and blessings be upon His Prophets and His chosen ones who have drunk the choice wine of utterance and manifested His Cause to all who dwell within the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>And now, may my spirit be a sacrifice for your honor! Your esteemed letter arrived and was presented in its entirety. He said: “O My Name! Upon thee be the peace of God, His mercy, His grace and His favors.” Thy letter was presented before the Wronged One and was heard. From every letter thereof wafted the fragrance of love, sincerity, devotion, recognition and steadfastness. Praise be to God, thou hast drunk the choice wine of certitude and utterance from the cup of the bounty of God, the Lord of the worlds. Well is it with thee! And the servant present acted in accordance with thy request. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to cause thee to attain, at all times, unto new bounties, heavenly sustenance, everlasting mention and eternal gifts. He is verily the Bestower, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>The letter of Siyyid Hashim, upon him be the Glory of God, attained unto His presence. Praise be to God that he hath attained unto that which was recorded and inscribed in the divine Books. We beseech God to aid him to serve His Cause with wisdom and utterance. They have attained unto His presence. Now is the time of service, that is, the teaching of God’s Cause, exalted be His glory, that perchance a thirsty one may drink from the ocean of grace, or one who hath turned away may attain unto the honor of acceptance, or one immersed in idle fancies may be adorned with the effulgences of the lights of the Daystar of Revelation. Blessed is he who, through mention and utterance, causeth the people of the world to be adorned with the ornament of knowledge.</p>
<p>O My Name! The deniers of the Bayan have clung to calumnies the like of which have never been heard from time immemorial until now. It is not known by what proof they accept the Point of the Bayan while turning away from Him Who sent it. Thou knowest how lofty is the station of the Cause and how base are the calumnies of the people. It behooveth tears of justice to flow and the cry of cities and regions to be raised. Mention hath been made of Siyyid Mahdi, and his name hath been recorded by the Pen, and likewise Siyyid Husayn and Siyyid Muhammad and the believing handmaidens. All have, at this hour, received their portion from the ocean of the utterance of the All-Merciful, and the rain of mercy hath descended upon them from the heaven of grace. Convey to all of them the greetings of the Wronged One and give them the glad-tidings of that which hath been mentioned. We beseech God to ordain for them the good of this world and of the next. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>The letter of Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be the peace and bounties of God, was reviewed, and likewise we have heard and seen what was mentioned concerning Amin, upon him be the glory of God. We beseech the True One for that which is the cause of glory, exaltation, prosperity and comfort of His loved ones. In these days the affairs of this land are also in upheaval, and most are passing their days in hardship. We beseech God to aid the Trustee with the hosts of grace and bounty, and to open before his face the door of wealth and affluence. Verily He is the Lord of creation. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Powerful. Should He wish, He transmutes hardship into ease and sorrow into joy, and He is the One who has power over all things through His command “Be! and it is.”</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Take the hands of Thy loved ones who are encompassed by tribulations due to their connection to Thee and their arising to serve Thee, to mention Thee and to praise Thee. O Lord! Withhold them not from the ocean of Thy bounty, nor from the effulgent rays of the Sun of Thy generosity. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Cause through which Thou hast transformed darkness into light, tyranny into justice, and oppression into equity, to send down from the heaven of Thy bestowal a blessing upon Thy chosen ones and loved ones. O Lord! Thou seest their weakness before the waves of the ocean of Thy power and might, and their poverty before the manifestations of the lights of the Sun of Thy Revelation and riches. Ordain for them that which befitteth Thy generosity and grace. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The bounty is manifest and the grace is resplendent to such a degree that it is itself its own proof and evidence of itself, having no need of mention by this evanescent one. At every moment I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, on behalf of His loved ones, for that from which the fragrance of His good-pleasure wafteth. Verily, He is the Generous, the Bountiful. Peace, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne.</p>

<p>Beirut. His honor Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be Glory of God. First of Ramadan 1302.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise be to the Goal of the world Who, through the breathings of correspondence, adorns hearts with a new ornament and souls with a wondrous beauty. In truth, letters are divine messengers that arrive from the cities and regions of love, affection, fellowship and unity. We beseech Him that this grace may not be cut off and this bounty may not cease. He is the Bestower Who gave life to the world of acceptance through the Word of Unity, and in the arena of manifestation conquered cities and regions with the swords of power and certitude, and raised the banner of His Oneness over the hearts of those who have turned to Him and the sincere ones. His is the praise and the bounty, His the gratitude and the greatness, His the glory and the mercy. And blessings and peace be upon the Dayspring of His Cause, the Lord of His chosen ones, the Seal of His Prophets, the heaven of His mercy and the sun of His grace, through Whom were opened the gates of the treasuries of mysteries and distinction was made between the wicked and the righteous, and upon His family and companions who, when they heard the call from the direction of the Most Great, arose and said: “Yea, Thou art our Lord and our God, our Goal and the Goal of all who are in earth and heaven.” These strove with true striving and aided the Faith of God with true aid.</p>
<p>And then, although thy letter was not Israfil’s trumpet, yet it gave life. This is one of the talismans of the Lord of Glory, exalted be His grandeur. His names have revelations and manifestations. May God grant time that we may ponder His signs and tokens and manifestations and conditions, and clearly and evidently observe the effects of power and might and greatness and exaltation. His grace is greater than what hath been and is mentioned. Sometimes He ordaineth pleasure and delight, at times sorrow and grief, and at times He freeth and detacheth man from both. Indeed, if the drops of the sea could be counted and the sands of the deserts limited, these stations too would be bounded. Who can render thanks by hand or tongue? In all conditions I beseech for thee His aid and confirmation, and likewise for myself, though this too is wrong - man hath no self or self-will. He must be attentive to the Command and arise in service like a corpse in the hands of the washer.</p>
<p>After the letter was presented before His face, He said that although thou art not physically present, thou hast been and art remembered night and day. Thy mention hath been made in His presence. Repeatedly He said: “We sent him when his presence was needed. We considered the desire of the Afnan purely for the sake of God. We beseech God to grant him reward.” And now, according to what was mentioned, they intend to wait for another steamer, and He said that since We have absolute authority, permission may perhaps be granted, but We beseech God that it may not reach the point of “We strengthened them with a third.” God willing, they will return by another steamer.</p>
<p>And concerning what thou didst write about his honor the Hakim - truly he is the manifestation of virtues and the dawning-place of kindness. Virtues are the adornment of the world and the life-giving force of nations, and are in truth the manifestations of the highest Paradise and the most exalted Heaven. If these were to vanish from the page of the world, it would truly become a manifestation of the fire of hell. In any case, this servant praiseth the Goal of the world Who confirmed him in that which hath ever been loved and accepted by God. The grace is in His hands - He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth among His creation, and He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.</p>
<p>Verily this servant sendeth greetings to him and mentioneth him and beseecheth God to make his breaths a lamp unto the darkness of the world and his face a healing to the sick among the nations, and through the ocean of His wisdom to purify chronic and persistent diseases and base and degraded morals. And I beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist his honor with the means of the heavens and earth and to confirm him in what He loveth and approveth. He is the Lord of creation and the Sovereign of the hereafter and the former life, and the Lord of the throne and the earth.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! The servant beseecheth God to grant him a mouth as wide as the heavens that he may mention the loved ones of God and His chosen ones and His trustees in His lands, among them his honor Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be mention and praise from God, the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven. Verily the servant remembereth his honor and doth not forget him - his Lord, to Whom is his return and abode, beareth witness to this. And he sendeth greetings to Husayn, upon him be the peace of God. His honor departed and no further news of him was received. God willing, may all attain true health. Peace be upon him and upon those with him, and peace be upon you and upon those with you.</p>

<p>My beloved, his eminence Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah] the Most Glorious, may regard with his most pure gaze.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Glory!</p>
<p>May my spirit be a sacrifice unto your presence! The servant has attained your gracious letter and found therein the fragrance of Tasnim, as it was adorned with the mention of our Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Due to the many occupations of this evanescent servant, there is no opportunity to present that which was intended. I beseech your abundant grace to accept my excuse and apology. Therefore, I briefly submit:</p>
<p>You had previously inquired about two matters which remained unanswered. The first concerns the meaning of His exalted words regarding “the sixth and the sixth of the sixth.” This is what was revealed in response: “By this We intended the proportions of humors in balanced bodies according to the people’s doctrine. Know that phlegm is one-sixth of blood, and bile is one-sixth of phlegm. This is the meaning of what We mentioned, and black bile is three-quarters of yellow bile. We have another explanation, for verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” Thus ends the quote.</p>
<p>Regarding your question about inheritance, His exalted words state: “When We heard the cries of the children in the loins, We doubled their portion and decreased from the others.” The inheritances in the Divine Book are made into two thousand five hundred and twenty shares, which encompass the nine divisions. This number is divided into seven portions, each portion going to a class of heirs as mentioned in the Book. Among these, nine sixties, which equals the number of “Muqt,” is designated for the children. The meaning of His exalted words “We doubled their portion” is that one equivalent was added to it, making it two “Ta,” and what was increased was decreased from the others. For example, it was revealed “And for the spouses from the Book of Ha according to the number of Ta and Fa,” meaning eight sixties equaling the number of Ta and Fa was designated for the spouses. Now sixty and half of sixty, which equals ninety, was decreased from the spouses and added to the children, and so forth until the end, where the amount decreased becomes nine sixties, which was added to the first nine sixties.</p>
<p>Regarding your inquiry whether the brother must be from both father and mother or if being from one side is sufficient for inheritance: If the brother is from the father’s side, his right is as mentioned in the Book. If from the mother’s side, one-third of his right reverts to the House of Justice and two-thirds to him. Likewise for the sister. This is the answer to the two previous questions.</p>
<p>Concerning the Tablet of Aqa ’Abdu’l-Ghani and the letter of Aqay-i-Kalim, may my spirit be a sacrifice for him, which was specifically for Aqa Mirza Musa, you wrote that it had not arrived. Both were sent on the thirteenth of Dhi’l-Qa’dih. The Tablet of Aqa ’Abdu’l-Ghani was among the tablets of his eminence Haji Mirza ’Ali-Akbar B.R.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Aqa Ibrahim from the people of N.J., excellent is what you have done in his regard, for the best of deeds is that a person not act without the good-pleasure of the Truth. Blessed is he in that he heard what you mentioned to him from the Truth. It is never permissible for anyone to come without permission, although many souls have turned towards the Most Holy Court this year without permission. We beseech God to assist them in what He loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about some Tablets being bound specifically for the Indians, along with the sublime Tablet which they sent through Aqa ’Abdu’l-Karim - this matter was highly acceptable at the Divine Threshold. They said that your honor has been and continues to be engaged in service to the Cause. Blessed is he and good tidings unto him! I humbly convey sublime and glorious greetings to all the friends of God in that land, one and all, and express my utter nothingness and sincerity. May the Glory rest upon your honor and upon them.</p>
<p>The Servant [of God]</p>
<p>19 Rabi’u’th-Thani</p>
<p>May I be a sacrifice for you! A Tablet has been revealed from the heaven of divine wisdom regarding the stages of teaching the Cause and conduct among humanity, specifically for the Name of God M.H., upon him be [Baha’u’llah’s Glory] 966. A copy of it was sent. Your honor should make a copy and send another copy to Muhammad M., upon him be [Baha’u’llah’s Glory] 966, along with the letter which this servant has written to him. I beseech the Most High to assist His loved ones who have arisen to serve His Cause to act according to what has been revealed in His mighty and sublime Tablet.</p>

<p>He is God - exalted be His station, the Most Great, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>Pure praise and glorification befit the unitarians, before whose might the limbs of the polytheists tremble. These are the hosts of whom He said “O hosts of God, mount ye!” Their might obliterated the might of the world, and their power transformed the highest palaces of kings into the abode of spiders and owls. The arch of Chosroes stands as witness. The signs of victory and triumph were manifest in all regions and directions. What became of that power, and where did that might go? Had these servants held fast to the divine law and the way of Muhammad (peace be upon Him) and moved according to God’s command and His good-pleasure, surely the world would have been illumined and its people found rest. Every word of the divine utterances, nay every letter thereof, is influential and beneficial. Those souls who are illumined by the dawning lights of the Sun of Truth see in every letter a book, and every word is the dayspring of light and the dawning-place of knowledge. Where are the eyes to see and the ears to hear?</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven! We confess our powerlessness, our shortcomings, our transgression of our bounds, and our misdeeds that have prevented us from drawing nigh unto Thee, and our sins that have come between us and the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of Thy grace and the manifestations of Thy favors. O Lord! We have fled from ourselves to the shadow of the canopies of Thy generosity. I beseech Thee by the Dawning-Places of Thy revelation, the Daysprings of Thy inspiration, the Recipients of Thy knowledge, the Manifestations of Thy Self, the Sources of Thy Cause, and by the Seal of Thy Prophets, to assist us in what hath escaped us, then illumine our hearts with the lights of Thy knowledge. O Lord! Protect Thy servants, Thy unitarians, and Thy sincere ones from the evil of every polytheist, and strengthen them through Thy power, Thy sovereignty, Thy might, and Thy dominion. Thou art He Whom nothing can frustrate and no affair can prevent. Ordain, O my God, for the unitarians among Thy creation that which will exalt them and aid them, that they may remember Thee among Thy servants and Thy creation, in Thy habitations and Thy lands. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous, the Strong, the Powerful, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And then the letter arrived, news arrived, glad tidings arrived, for it brought joyful news of that spiritual beloved’s health and well-being. It was an auspicious messenger and a welcome herald that drove away sorrow with overwhelming power. With its coming, joy found opportunity and took sorrow’s place. Praise be to God, the rain of grace is ever-showering and the lights of bounty are ever-shining and manifest in all times. Were it not for His grace, who would be capable of mention? His is the praise and glory, His the gratitude and bounty. One revelation from the revelations of the Sun of His grace brings forth a hundred thousand worlds, and one manifestation of His justice raises a hundred thousand lamentations. What can the Manifestations say of “He doeth whatsoever He willeth”? The Command is His Command, and the power is His power, and we are among the thankful ones.</p>
<p>After hearing what the scribe uttered, it was presented before our Lord (may our spirits be sacrificed for Him), and He said: “Praise be to God, they have attained to that which most are deprived of. They are turned toward the highest horizon, holding fast to the cord of grace and clinging to the hem of bounty. We beseech God to manifest through them that which will cause the countenance of existence to smile, and to aid them in His remembrance, His praise, and the service of His Cause, even as He has aided them, and to enable them to act according to what has been revealed in His Book, even as He has enabled them. Verily, He is powerful over all things. There is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.”</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about the friends in the land of Qaf and Fa and the honored friend Aqa Ahmad (upon him and them be God’s peace), it was presented and gained acceptance. God willing, We shall send him that which will gladden his heart and comfort his eyes. Likewise, We make mention of the friends of that land. Give glad tidings of Our greetings to Ahmad, and likewise to the others. We beseech God the Exalted to aid them and draw them near to Him, and to manifest through them that which shall adorn the pages of the world and be a remembrance for the nations. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, they have been mentioned at this time and will be mentioned hereafter. Two glad tidings should be sent. As for their request for pilgrimage, it was accepted by proxy for that beloved one. We beseech God to accept the deeds, and surely they are accepted. All the Branches (may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps), and likewise the people of the pavilion of infallibility, all send their greetings. Peace, remembrance, and praise be upon you and upon God’s sincere servants, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>The path of God is more manifest than the sun, and His proof more perfect than all that exists in creation. He is the Praised One in His deeds, the One to be obeyed in His command, the Dominant One in His sovereignty, and the Manifest One through His signs which have encompassed the horizons. The tabernacle of glory hath been raised upon the most exalted place, and the banner of His Cause hath been hoisted upon the highest standards. Yet the people of the earth remain heedless and veiled, save for a numbered few who are the Hands of the Cause among His servants. In truth, praise and glorification today befit these souls who have arisen to reform the world and are confirmed in that which exalteth the Word of God. Otherwise, the Ancient Beauty, exalted be His glory, is sanctified and exempt from all that minds can comprehend or tongues can utter. And the prayers, the peace, and the glory be upon His loved ones and His chosen ones who have not broken His covenant and His testament - servants whom God hath described in His Books, His Scriptures, and His Tablets.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O God of all beings and Goal of all creation! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy knowledge and the sun of Thy bounty to assist Thy loved ones at all times in that which will draw them nigh unto Thee, and ordain for them that which befitteth Thy generosity and Thy gifts. Verily, Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter of that spiritual beloved arrived. In truth, it was like a warbling nightingale and a melodious verse. The servant testifieth that it was as a dove cooing upon the branch of divine knowledge. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who confirmed you, assisted you, caused you to know, taught you, and enabled you to voice His praise amongst His servants. The fragrance of the love of God and steadfastness was diffused and evident throughout the entire letter. His is the grace, the bounty, the grandeur, and the majesty. I beseech and implore the Self-Sufficient, the Transcendent, in all conditions to increase His confirmation upon that beloved one and to aid him through the means both seen and unseen, that thou mayest utter in every state, with wisdom and utterance, that which will draw people nigh unto God, the Goal of all the worlds. When the servant heard thy melodies and warbling, he approached the Most Exalted Station and the Supreme Summit, until he attained the presence and presented it before His face. Then did the Tongue of Grandeur speak that which caused the sun of grace and favors to shine forth and its lights to encompass all lands. His word - exalted be His utterance and exalted be His proof - is as follows:</p>
<p>In His Name, the One Who ruleth over all who are in earth and heaven!</p>
<p>The servant who is present before the Wronged One hath presented and read that which the tongue of thy heart hath uttered out of love for God and His verses, and out of longing for the wonders of His grace and His bounty. We have found therein the fragrance of sincerity and supplication unto God, the Lord of creation and the Speaker on the Day of Reckoning. Blessed art thou for having drunk the choice wine sealed with My Self-Subsisting Name, and for having attained unto the fragrances of My utterance, and for having soared in the atmosphere of My love, and for having turned toward the ocean of My knowledge, and for having faced the lights of the Countenance, and for having spoken in praise of God, the Lord of the mighty throne. And blessed be thine ear for having heard the Call, and thine eye for having witnessed and beheld My greatest signs. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to manifest through thee that whereby His verses and that which He hath revealed in His Book may be spread abroad, and to confirm thee in every good thing that hath flowed from His Pen. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon whoso heareth thy word concerning the Cause of God, the Dominant, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Praise and gratitude be to God! The scratching of the Most Exalted Pen is raised, and the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree is heard. The benevolence of God, exalted be His glory, is manifest and evident. We beseech God, exalted be His station, to grant at every moment that which will cause the exaltation of His Word. At the time when your supplication was presented, We found you assisted by the confirmations of your Lord, Who has dominion over all who are in the heavens and on the earth.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Ahmad, upon him be the glory of God, it was presented, and a most holy and exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of bounty and sent forth. God willing, he will attain unto it and receive his portion from the ocean of inner meanings. This servant conveys greetings and glorification to him, and beseeches God to ordain for him that which will draw him near and enable him to succeed in mentioning and praising Him. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the piece, four blessed pages were sent. God willing, they will arrive and you will attain unto them. I presented your mention, praise and glorification to the Branches of the Divine Lote-Tree. They expressed their favor and besought God, exalted be His glory, for your confirmation. Glory, radiance, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those with you who have achieved the greatest steadfastness in this mighty Cause.</p>

<p>In the name of Him Who was the Self-Subsisting over all who are in the earths and the heavens! Glorified art Thou, O my God! This is Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, who hath entered into the precincts of Thy sanctity and, laden with manifold sins, hath hastened from every direction unto the court of Thy gracious bounty. He desireth to drink from the chalices of Thy mercy and seeketh the wonders of Thy grace which Thou hast specially ordained for the Letters of Thy might and the Words of Thy holiness, that he may become on earth a reflection of Thy countenance, a mirror of Thy beauty, a guide unto Thee, one turned toward Thee, and one who speaketh of Thee, for in Thy hands is the kingdom of the heavens and earth. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Inaccessible, the Exalted.</p>
<p>Yet I have not attained that which I have sought until now. Rather, whenever I sought shelter beneath the tree of Thy Lordship, Thou didst drive me away by Thy power, and whenever I lay down upon the couch of Thy Divine Unity, Thou didst awaken me by Thy might and then remove me by Thy power, as if Thou hadst not created me in Thy dominion and wouldst not recognize me in the realm of creation among Thy servants. Whenever I desired to soar in the atmosphere of Thy holy sovereignty, Thou didst burn my wings with the fire of Thy dominion, then cast me down into a valley which none can reckon save Thee, wherein I remained without count, extent, time, age, eternity, covenant, epoch, cycle, or revolution, until Thou didst show mercy unto me thereafter, and didst honor me and grant me two wings of moist red ruby in the mystery of Thy Most Exalted Name.</p>
<p>Then after that, Thou didst cause me to ascend by Thy power to the heavens of Thy Cause, yet Thou didst not grant me time to reach them and didst bring me down and return me to another valley. All this didst Thou do unto one than whom none on earth knoweth Thee better, and none in the kingdom loveth Thee more ardently. What then is the recompense of him who turneth away from Thy presence, is heedless of Thy countenance, and ascribeth partners to the sovereignty of Thy oneness? Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee! How wondrous are the manifestations of Thy deeds toward me! How mighty are the expressions of Thy handiwork concerning me! Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for all of this and the entirety thereof, and unto Thee be thanks, O my Beloved, for all that Thou hast sent down or wilt send down, hast willed or wilt will, hast loved or wilt love.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! This servant of Thine hath come before Thee once again, with a tongue grown weary and speech become burdensome. He knoweth not a single letter of the wonders of Thy knowledge with which to remember Thee, nor comprehendeth any mystery from the lines of the universality of Thy grace’s outpouring with which to describe Thee. Yet, since he is as a seed from Thy holy land, he desireth that Thou plant him by the hands of Thy bounty in the soil of Thy Divine Unity, that he may yield the fruits of Thine eternity in the cloud of Thy Lordship and put forth the leaves of Thy oneness in the atmosphere of the intimate fellowship of the heaven of glory of the King of Thy bounty.</p>
<p>This is an infant who desireth to drink from the breast of Thy grace the milk which Thou hast stored in the essence of the camphor of Thy concealment. This is a fish that hopeth to plunge into the depths of the seas of Thy glorious exaltation, a dove that seeketh to perch upon the branches of the Lote-Tree of Thy might, an ember that must be kindled from the fire of Thy love, a star that is fit to shine in the heaven of the generosity of Thy mercy, a thirsty one who hath come unto the seas of Thy greatness, a lowly one who hath sought refuge with Thee that Thou mightest admit him into the garden of Thy might, an ailing one who desireth to drink from the rivers of Thy healing, and an ignorant one who hath come before the manifestations of the treasuries of Thy knowledge at the dawning-places of Thy glory and the aspects of Thy holiness.</p>
<p>For my heart will not be content with aught else, even wert Thou to give it all that Thou hast numbered in Thy heaven and earth, for from the wellspring of Thy riches hast Thou caused me to spring forth, and from the seas of Thy generosity hast Thou made me to flow, and from the mount of Thy greatness hast Thou cleft me, and with the flames of the light of Thy countenance hast Thou illumined me, and from the brands of the fire of Thine eternity hast Thou made me to appear. This is a station that no other station in Thy kingdom can equal, a bounty that no other bounty in Thy realm can match, and no matter in Thy lands can compare with it. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. None can reverse Thy decree, none can alter Thy judgment, none can prevent Thy doing, and none can oppose Thy command. Verily, Thou art the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O God, O my God, at this moment, by Him Whom Thou hast made a treasure for all created things, a shelter for all existence, and a fortress for all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, to send down upon our hearts the love of Thy loved ones and the affection of Thy chosen ones, that we may become pure mirrors, holy crystals, and luminous lamps, reflecting the wonders of the pure camphor of Thy countenance and proclaiming the gleamings of the cloud of might of Thy presence, that we may be as one servant and one soul in the earth, all prostrating before the sovereign of Thy majesty and submitting to the king of Thy beauty, for we are all Thy servants and within Thy grasp. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Luminous, the Beloved.</p>

<p>In the name of Him Who speaketh the manifest truth!</p>
<p>We have become on this day one who extolleth My praise and remembereth the ocean of My bounty, and counselleth My loved ones who have held fast to the cord of My grace and clung to the hem of the robe of […] detached from all who are in the heavens and the earth. Blessed is the ear that hath attained unto the Call when it was raised from the Most Exalted Horizon, and the eye that hath beheld the Dawning-Place of the Revelation of God, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned before the Throne! We have desired to make mention of thee through a remembrance whereby the hearts of the servants have been attracted, and through an utterance whereby the inhabitants of the graves, of ancient times and more recent, have arisen. This is a Day wherein all things proclaim: By God! The Hidden One, Who was treasured in the knowledge of God, hath come, and that which was concealed from the eyes of the mystics hath appeared. This is a Day wherein the Cry hath been raised and the Rock hath cried out, yet the people are in manifest error. They have cast the Command of God behind their backs, clinging to the whisperings of the satans.</p>
<p>Say: O people! This is the Day of God, were ye of them that know, and this is a Day wherein He Who conversed with God hath been established upon the throne of Revelation, as a bounty from God, the Lord of this manifest Day. O people! Fear God, and follow not them who have denied the proof of God and His Cause, who have disputed His signs and have uttered that which hath caused the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise and the inmates of the Tabernacle of Glory to lament in this exalted station.</p>
<p>O Fakhr-ud-Din! The Lord of the Day of Judgment hath turned toward thee with such turning as hath caused the realities of existence, of ancient times and more recent, to turn unto God, the Mighty, the Most Praised. He hath made mention of thee with such mention as hath caused the tongues of the kingdom to speak forth the praise of God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Beware lest the affairs of men grieve thee. Cast away what the people possess and take what We have sent down for thee at this time, wherein the door of the kingdom of thy Lord’s utterance, the Speaking, the Trustworthy One, hath been opened.</p>
<p>Say: O Concourse of the Bayan! The All-Merciful hath come, and there hath been raised on His right hand the banner “He is God” and on His left the standard “He doeth whatsoever He willeth.” Blessed is the hand that hath taken this Tablet with such power as the hosts of the world and the tyranny of them that have denied the right of God and His sovereignty cannot weaken, and have perpetrated that which hath caused the tears of the mystics to flow.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Za! Hearken unto My most sweet call from the direction of Akka, then remember Him Who hath borne hardships and tribulations in the path of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have mentioned you before through verses which the books of the past cannot rival, and We have sent down for you at this time that which hath caused the lips of the sincere ones to smile. When ye have attained unto My Tablet and have drunk the choice wine of utterance from the cup of My bounty, turn with radiant faces toward the Most Exalted Horizon and say:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O God of the seen and the unseen, and glory be unto Thee, O Lord of bounty and existence! We beseech Thee by the mysteries of Thy Book and the fruits of the Tree of Thy utterance, and by the waves of the ocean of Thy Most Great Name, and by the lights of the morn of Thy Revelation, O Lord of Eternity, to make us steadfast in Thee and in that which hath appeared from Thee. O Lord! Leave us not to ourselves. Take the hands of Thy servants with the hands of Thy power, then preserve them from Thine enemies. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all that are in the heavens and on earth. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Strong, the All-Conquering, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O Fakhru’d-Din! Today the Most Luminous Pen hath been manifested with such power that should all the hosts of the world and all peoples oppose it, they would find themselves impotent. Stand firm in the Cause of God and say: “O people! The Day which ye were promised in the Books, the Torah, the Psalms, the Gospel and in the mighty Qur’an hath come.” Beseech God that He may assist the friends in that land and its surroundings to champion His Cause through the hosts mentioned in the divine Tablets. We hope that you and the teachers will arise to serve the Cause as befitteth and behooveth you. The conditions of service are manifest and visible from the horizons of the heavens of divine Tablets. Blessed is he who heareth and acteth, and woe unto the heedless!</p>
<p>We have been informed that Jinab-i-Varqa, upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness, hath turned towards those regions. We beseech God that He may assist him with such detachment as shall cause the detachment of the world, and with such utterances as have been sent down and recorded in the Book of God from the Pen of His eternal Will. Take hold of the Book with the strength bestowed by Us, then speak that whereby the hearts of the servants may be attracted. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make thy deeds adorned with the embroidery of acceptance and illumined with the light of His good-pleasure. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His binding and wise command. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon those who hear thy words concerning this momentous News.</p>

<p>He is the All-Knowing Expounder! The days of joy and delight have passed, and days of sorrow have come since the Star of Certitude has vanished from the heaven of mystic knowledge. Therefore have the pebbles cried out, the hearts of the Concourse on High melted, all things wept, the pillars of existence trembled, the foundations of the House were shaken, and those brought nigh lamented in their lofty station. Verily, Hasan sacrificed his spirit and Husayn all he possessed in the path of God, the Sovereign of the Kingdom and the Realms, the Lord of all existence and might. And before them, My Name, the All-Forbearing, who was martyred in this Cause, at whose tragedy the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing and the dwellers of Paradise lamented at eventide and at dawn.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Turn thy face from Sad to Kha and visit My martyrs. By God! Shouldst thou observe any land, thou wouldst find therein a limb of My limbs, severed in My path and for love of My Beauty. Therefore did My Pen cry out, the Temple of My grandeur lament, the eyes of My loving-kindness weep, My sighs ascend, My tears fall, the hearts of My chosen ones burn, and the hearts of My loved ones yearn.</p>
<p>O My Pen! This is a day whereon thy scratching and thy plaintive cry should be raised by reason of what hath befallen the Wronged One and His loved ones at the hands of the manifestations of tyranny and oppression and the dawning-places of heedlessness who attained not unto the choice wine of justice on this Day wherein the horizons were illumined by this effulgence. Lament, O My Pen, My loneliness and tribulation, and cry out for My wrong and the wrong of My loved ones.</p>
<p>When thou approachest the land of Kha, drawest nigh unto it and perceivest its fragrance, arise before the tomb of the Glorious One and visit it with that which the Mighty, the All-Praised hath mentioned, and say:</p>
<p>The essence of fragrance that hath been diffused from the garment of the mercy of our Lord, the Most High, the All-Glorious, be upon thee, O thou who hast turned unto the Most Exalted Horizon and who hast spoken in praise of the Lord of Names in the kingdom of creation! I testify that thou didst rend asunder the veil, didst take hold of the Book, and didst believe in the Mighty, the All-Bountiful, on a Day wherein every pregnant one laid down her burden and the people stood before the Lord of the Throne and of the dust. Thou art he whom the veils hindered not from the Seat of Signs, nor did idle fancies prevent thee from this Cause before which the clear proofs have bowed down. Thou art he whom no censure of any censurer deterred for the sake of God, nor the gloating of any malicious one. Thou didst cast away the world and take what the Lord of Eternity and Sovereign of nations had revealed. I testify that thou didst soar on the wings of certitude to the horizon of the All-Merciful until thou didst enter the prison of the Wronged One and visit thy Lord, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting, and didst behold what was veiled from Moses, and didst hear what the Friend had heard, and didst drink the choice wine of reunion, and didst attain unto the station of sanctity, nearness, and beauty. Thou art he who found the sweetness of the Call and heard the murmuring of the River of Everlasting Life and the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, when thou wert standing before the face of thy Lord, the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven. Blessed art thou, O Abu-Badi’, and blessed is thy son through whom the pillars of the idol were made to quake and the back of the idols was broken - they who walk in the garments of the learned ones among the people of creation.</p>
<p>The Sublime Truth hath testified for thee, O thou who art wondrous, to thy recognition, thy steadfastness, thy support, thy firmness, thy certitude, and thy assurance. Thou art he whom thousands frightened not, whom the clashing of swords deterred not on a Day wherein ranks were drawn up to extinguish the light of Revelation, the tribes of the earth lamented, and the great terror appeared amongst men.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou and thy son! How excellent is your attainment of God’s testimony in this Tablet from whose heaven’s horizon hath shone the Sun of the Word “Verily, I am God, the Lord of the worlds.”</p>
<p>O Ancient Beauty! The Pen hath been bidden to make mention of thy noble one who was with Thee in the pavilion of Thy abasement and the canopy of Thy glory, who was present before Thy countenance morn and eve, prostrating himself before Thy beauty, submissive to Thy sovereignty, swayed by Thy will and moved by Thy purpose. He it was who heard Thy call and beheld Thy countenance, who dwelt in the precincts of Thy mercy, who drank from the Kawthar of Thy revelation, who was honored by the manifestations of Thy grace and the expressions of Thy mercy, and to whom Thou didst entrust the custodianship of Thy Sacred House among the people. Blessed is he who hath turned toward Thee, and the pilgrim who hath sought Thy resting-place and visited Thee through what the Most Merciful hath revealed concerning Thee. Thou art the one who surrendered thy spirit for the sake of thy Lord’s Face, who wast with Him aforetime in the Land of Mystery, who chose exile for love of His Self, and who didst migrate with Him until thou didst enter this Prison - this noble station which hath been illumined by the lights of the mighty Throne. Glorified art Thou, O Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy knowledge and the heaven of Thy wisdom to ordain for them that visit Thy loved ones the reward of those who have attained unto Thy service. Purify them from whatsoever is unseemly for Thy Cause, then forgive them through Thy bounty and favor, and ordain for them, by Thy Most Exalted Pen, the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust below, and verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful.</p>

<p>He is God, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>The Tongue of Grandeur speaks that which shall suffice the physicians in the absence of doctors. Say: O people! Eat not save when hungry, and drink not after retiring to sleep. Exercise in the open air strengthens the body’s members, while eating to excess is a grave calamity. Abandon not treatment when it is needed, but cease it when health is restored. Begin not a meal until digestion is complete, and eat not before thorough mastication. Treat an ailment first through diet, before resorting to medicine. When thou hast found a simple remedy, turn not to compound medicines. Set aside medicine when in good health, but take it when needed. When two contrary foods are served, mix them not but be content with one. Begin with the light food before the heavy, and with liquid before solid. The introduction of food upon food is dangerous - be thou cautious of this. When thou beginnest to eat, start with My Most Glorious Name and end with the name of thy Lord, the Possessor of the throne above and the earth below. When thou hast eaten, walk a little that the food may settle. That which is difficult to masticate is forbidden by the discerning ones. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen command thee.</p>
<p>Eating little in the morning is as a light unto the body. Abandon harmful habits, for they are a calamity unto mankind. Meet illnesses with their remedies - this utterance is the decisive word in this regard. Practice contentment in all conditions; through it the soul is preserved from lassitude and ill condition. Avoid anxiety and grief, for through them comes a dire affliction. Say: Envy consumeth the body and anger burneth the liver. Shun these two as ye would a lion. The elimination of superfluities is essential, but at moderate seasons. He who exceeds in eating, his sickness shall increase. We have ordained a cause for all things and bestowed upon each an effect. All this is through the revelation of My Name, the Influencer, upon all things. Verily thy Lord is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth.</p>
<p>Say: Through what We have set forth, the humors shall not exceed their balance, nor their measures depart from their state. The original nature remains in its purity, and the sixth and the sixth of the sixth remain in their condition. The two active and the two passive elements are preserved, and in God do we trust. There is no God but Him, the Healer, the All-Knowing, the Helper.</p>
<p>The Most Exalted Pen hath not flowed with such words except for My love for thee, that thou mayest know that grief hath not seized the Ancient Beauty, nor hath He been saddened by what hath befallen Him from the nations. Sorrow is for him who hath lost something, but nothing escapeth His grasp in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>O Physician! Heal the sick, first through the remembrance of thy Lord, the Lord of the Day of Mutual Calling, then through that which We have ordained for the health of the constitutions of the servants. By My life! The physician who hath drunk the wine of My love - his visit is healing, his breath is mercy and hope. Say: Hold fast unto him for the restoration of health. He is confirmed by God for treatment. Say: This science is the most noble of all sciences. Verily it is the greatest means from God, the Quickener of moldering bones, for preserving the bodies of nations. He hath given it precedence over all sciences and wisdoms. However, this is the day wherein thou shouldst arise to help My Cause, detached from all the worlds.</p>
<p>Say: O my God! Thy Name is my healing, Thy remembrance is my remedy, Thy nearness is my hope, Thy love is my companion, Thy mercy is my physician and helper in both this world and the world to come. Thou, verily, art the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Convey greetings from God to all the loved ones. Say: Today two matters are beloved and desired: first, wisdom and utterance, and second, steadfastness in the Cause of your Lord, the Merciful. Whosoever attaineth unto these two things is accounted before God as being among the people of the City of Immortality, for by these two matters hath the divine Cause been and shall be established amongst His servants. For if wisdom and utterance were not present, all would be afflicted. In such case, none would remain to guide the people to the Divine Law. And if steadfastness be lacking, the one who maketh mention will have no effect. Say: O friends! Fear and anxiety befit women. If the friends of God were to reflect even briefly upon the world and the differences manifest therein, the might of the oppressors would not frighten them and they would soar upon the wings of longing to the Daystar of the horizons. This servant hath desired for all the friends of Truth what He hath desired for Himself. And the reason that wisdom and protection of the Cause have been and are enjoined is that those who make mention may remain on earth to occupy themselves with the remembrance of the Lord of all worlds. Therefore, it is obligatory and essential for all to protect themselves and their brethren for the sake of God’s Cause. Had the friends acted in accordance with what they were commanded, most of those on earth would now be adorned with the robe of faith. Blessed is he who guideth a soul to the eternal Law and leadeth him to everlasting life. This is among the greatest of deeds in the sight of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Exalted. And the Spirit be upon thee, and Glory be upon thee.</p>

<p>He is the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>Your letter which you sent to this servant, who circles round the Throne, was forwarded from the great city and was witnessed, and its contents were understood. God willing, may you ever drink from the incomparable sweet waters of the Lord of Majesty and be sanctified from all who dwell in the heavens and the earth. O thou Phoenix of fire! Conquer hearts through the remembrance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Then give the contingent beings to drink from the chalice of divine verses through the hands of maidens who dwell in the chambers of the words of the Revealer of mysteries, whom no strangers or evil ones have touched, and whose presence God has made exclusive to those among His servants possessed of insight, who were among the choicest of creation and held fast to the cord of God, the Almighty, the Compelling. Soon shall We send down unto thee what We have ordained for thee. Be thou, therefore, at peace within thyself and be of them that are at rest.</p>
<p>For each person mentioned in your letter, a Tablet was revealed and sent down as a token of Our grace upon thee and upon Our devoted servants. Now observe the condition of the people and what proceeds from their mouths. They acknowledge that every light is darkened before His splendor, as was revealed in the Bayan and testified to by the Tongue of the All-Merciful. Likewise do they say that He transforms light into darkness, as was revealed in the prayers by God, the Mighty, the Gracious, the Bestower. Yet when the meaning of what they have confessed and acknowledged becomes manifest, they flee from the Lion of inner meanings and join Satan’s hosts, even though they have not understood him whom they have taken as lord instead of God, nor his true nature, nor the origin of his cause - to this do they who are endued with understanding bear witness.</p>
<p>Strange indeed that these people, though they behold with their outward eyes the inexhaustible Kawthar, have nevertheless contented themselves with a mirage. Such hath ever been the way of creation, even as among the peoples of old there are today those who worship the calf instead of God and rejoice in their idol. He Who hath arisen by His own Self would be ashamed to be known by such servants, and were it not for His grace and mercy, He would never have revealed His Cause. But the decree hath been fulfilled, for He is the Almighty, the All-Choosing. And after the manifestation of God and the establishment of His Temple upon the throne of His Most Great Name, the All-Glorious, these people still make mention of Imamate, succession, and vicegerency. Such is the condition of the leaders of this people, let alone those souls who have followed these insects of the earth. In truth, all are today seen as immature. If a soul attaineth unto this wondrous Cause, by God! the dust of his sandal is, in God’s sight, more exalted and distinguished than all who have turned aside among the people of the Bayan, and ever shall be. None shall enter this everlasting City of Oneness save holy souls who are detached from all save God. This cup is not the portion of every heedless ignorant one, nor is this pure wine the share of every stubborn infidel. They who drink from the Abha cup are of another essence and from another realm. Thus hath the matter been decreed, but the people understand not. God willing, may ye ever be present in the court of the All-Glorious, the Majestic, and be gazers unto His most pure horizon. Convey God’s greetings unto the faces of them that are settled upon the cushions of detachment and abstraction among His triumphant servants, then unto thy wife and sister and thy kinsmen and the handmaidens of God, then unto those two women who emigrated unto God and whom the hand of grace returned to their abode. Say unto them: By God! We were with you and walked above your heads and witnessed your love and heard what ye uttered, and We are the Best of hearers. Blessed are ye, and God hath accepted from you and shall surely reward you, for He is the Best of rewarders. And if thou seest the servant before the Merciful, convey unto his face the greetings from Us, then give him the glad tidings of Our mention of him in this wondrous Tablet. Say: We have heard what thou hast composed in remembrance of thy Lord. God shall soon reward thee with the best of rewards, for He bestoweth upon His remembering servants, and We had sent him a tablet before wherein was recorded that which was a guidance and remembrance for all the worlds. Then convey greetings unto the face of Nasir, that he may rejoice within himself through God’s grace and mercy and be of the assured ones. We have indeed sent down unto him from the heaven of holiness verses of the Cause and sent them to him before, that he may rejoice in God’s remembrance, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. And likewise unto the face of Hasan who hath attained unto God’s tablet and its effect, that he may be of the thankful ones. And if thou seest Dhabi?, remind him from Us, saying: Beware lest thou be patient in God’s Cause. Rend asunder the veils of glory in their entirety in such wise that the denizens of the Supreme Paradise shall hear the sound of their rending. This is better for thee than clinging to the hems of the ascetics. And say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

By God, We have indeed informed you aforetime and testified with Our truthful tongue that I have ever existed through the eternity of God and shall manifest Myself unto you through My Most Great, Most Glorious Name. Beware lest ye object thereunto and be counted among the idolaters. By God, this is a mystery more manifest than the sun at high noon, yet when We bestowed the Name apart from Our Self, the servants knew Us not. This mystery was veiled within mystery upon mystery, shrouded by yet another mystery, which none among all created things could fathom.</p>
<p>When the idolaters persisted and thy Lord’s appointed time was fulfilled, then did the Hand of Power lift from the face of mystery a veil of mystery. Thereupon all who dwell in the heavens and earth were struck with terror, save those whom God preserved within the fortress of His protection and numbered among the secure ones.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! By God the Truth, whatsoever thou hast heard concerning this Cause hath proceeded from Me, and God knoweth that none besides Me was aware of aught, and this is a wisdom known to none save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. When the opposers found assurance within themselves and the breezes of security wafted from this holy, wondrous and blessed right hand side, they came forth with arrows, then spears, then swords of hatred, smiting Me at every moment with all their might. Thus were they recorded among the oppressors in tablets of ancient glory.</p>
<p>Thou knowest well that one who harbors deceit within himself and practices deception in God’s Cause can never stand before the enemies between the heavens and earth, nor can he speak God’s praise amidst adversaries, nor can he face the opposers in days when all religious sects united against him while he, by himself alone, championed his Lord’s Cause, detached from all else. Thus didst thou hear, and they who were in Iraq witnessed with their own eyes and do now testify thereto, if they be among the fair-minded.</p>
<p>By God, wert thou to ponder within thyself, thou wouldst find My deeds sufficient witness to that which issueth from My mouth and floweth from My pen, requiring no further testimony from these people or from all the worlds.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Every deed hath its trace and every existence its fragrance. Therefore inhale from all that hath appeared from this Youth and flowed from His pen. If thou perceivest therein the fragrance of the Beloved, then detach thyself from all else and turn thy face toward His holy, transcendent, mighty and wondrous countenance. God’s Cause cannot be confounded with aught else. It standeth manifest above all things, shining with the lights of beauty in the heaven of grandeur. None but every remote transgressor shall deny it.</p>
<p>By God, all that hath appeared from Me is proof conclusive for all created things, yet people have confused the matter for themselves. Apart from this, verily thy Lord’s Cause is more manifest than can be concealed, and God is witness to what I say. Sufficient is their abasement that they worship one whom We named with a name among names and mentioned among the servants, making him a veil before their eyes through Our wisdom, lest they recognize this luminous and noble Manifestation. When he returned unto God […]</p>
<p>He hath waged war against Our Cause by his own self. We commanded the people to rend asunder the veils, whereupon all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck, except for certain letters that were manifestations of My Name, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful. If thou wouldst ponder My Cause and the veiling of My countenance after My manifestation at the axis of all horizons, thou wouldst, by God, become acquainted with a mystery wherewith even the realities of mysteries have not been acquainted - how much less these hypocrites! Thereby will mystery after mystery be unveiled unto thee, then treasure after treasure, then store after store, and thou wilt find thyself enriched through thy Lord’s bounty beyond all that hath been created between the heavens and the earth. This, verily, is certain truth. Know thou, moreover, that We loved thee aforetime and have not forgotten thee, and now We bid thee rend asunder the veils through the sovereignty of thy Lord’s Name, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent, and emerge from behind them with a radiant and shining face. Take heed that thou fear no one. Then make mention of thy Lord amongst those in whose hearts thou findest the sweet savors of divine good-pleasure. Verily thy Lord will guard thee from the harm of every harmful one. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Thus have We inspired thee and made mention of thee on this night out of Our love for thee, that thou mayest be of those who remember this lonely Wronged One. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee on this path wherefrom the feet of most of the servants have slipped, save those whom God hath singled out for the recognition of His exalted, His hallowed, His gracious Self.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most Powerful!</p>
<p>O My Name! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. The letter from the honored Attar which he sent to thee was read before the Presence. Praise be to God that from it wafted the fragrance of love for the Desired One of all worlds. That household hath ever been engaged and occupied in serving the Cause, and mention of each one hath repeatedly flowed from the Most Exalted Pen in such wise that its effects are manifest and evident to those possessed of insight.</p>
<p>As to their mention of the honored Aqa Siyyid Muhammad-i-Sahhaf, he hath been granted permission to enter. Let him give thanks unto God for this manifest bounty. However, taking up residence in this land is another matter. Repeatedly hath this exalted word flowed from the Most Exalted Pen: though outwardly at rest, the Prison Land is inwardly turbulent. We beseech God to ordain for His loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Him and assist them in such wise that nothing shall prevent them from His remembrance and praise. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. From this spot We send Our greetings upon him and upon Attar and all who dwell in that household. Thy Lord is verily the All-Merciful, the All-Bountiful. The glory from Us be upon his mother, upon him, upon his brother who emigrated and attained, upon the other who attained the presence of the Countenance, and upon all who are steadfast and firm. We beseech God to ordain for them that which shall profit them in all the worlds of His worlds. He is verily the All-Hearing, the All-Answering.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Abu’l-Fadl, upon him be the glory of God. In these days mention of him hath repeatedly been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen. He hath once again been afflicted with trials. We beseech God first to adorn him with the ornament of patience, then to deliver him through His power and sovereignty. He is verily potent over all things. Blessed are they who have remembered and do remember such souls, and who strive and endeavor to the extent of their capacity in the Cause of God.</p>
<p>O My Name! The mention of Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali from the people of Sad was made in thy letter. In these days We have repeatedly made mention of him, especially when Khalil from the people of Qaf attained the presence of the Countenance. In truth he is firm in his attachment to the cord of love and steadfast in service. We beseech God to strengthen him, to prosper him, and to send down upon him from the heaven of grace and bounty that which will gladden his heart and solace his eyes. He is verily the Protector of the sincere ones. We counsel him to observe wisdom, for in that land there are both tale-bearers and spies. Wisdom is necessary for the time being. The people of the world have not yet discovered the purpose of this Wronged One. Each faction among the factions hath imagined vain things. By the life of God! Were they to discover the purpose, all would circle round it and would be content and grateful with what God hath willed. Then would the loved ones of God be freed from the need for wisdom, concealment, and the like. Say: O my God, my God! Make known to Thy servants what lieth with Thee, teach them what Thou hast intended for them, and draw them nigh unto Thee, that they may acknowledge that which Thy tongue hath uttered. Thou art verily the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Merciful, the All-Bountiful. O my Lord! Wert Thou to remove the veil from them, Thou wouldst find them hastening to the horizon of Thy grace and bounty. To this beareth witness every fair-minded and perceiving one.</p>
<p>[…] You have mentioned Siyyid-i-Tuyserkani. We beseech God not to deprive him of the lights of the Sun of Truth and deny him his portion of the ocean of inner meanings. Several Tablets have been revealed specifically for those souls whose names Jinab-i-Ghulam-’Ali had sent to the Most Holy Court. O My Name! The Most Exalted Pen is ever flowing, pervading, speaking and moving without cessation. Time and season do not suffice. We beseech God to aid all and enable them on the Day of God to engage in mention, praise and service to His Cause. The letter of Jinab-i-Asad, upon him be My Baha, was considered. What they have written concerning wisdom is the truth, in which there is no doubt. All the people of God must hold fast unto it, and this matter hath been repeatedly revealed in the divine Tablets. O My Name! Convey to all the friends in those regions the greetings of the Wronged One. Each one is mentioned before the Throne and hath attained the favor of God, exalted be His glory. Today all must hold fast unto unity and act in concert, that perchance the horizons may be illumined and perfumed by the breezes of revelation. All things bear witness that God, exalted be His glory, hath remembered and continueth to remember His loved ones in the Most Great Prison. Blessed are they who have attained unto the Divine Word. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty be upon thee and upon those whose names thou hast mentioned and whose letters thou hast sent, and upon all who have remained firm and attained unto the most great steadfastness in this mighty Cause.</p>

<p>O Ali! Upon thee be My Glory! The Mother Book hath been revealed and the rains of grace pour forth. The path is manifest and the signs of Truth are evident, yet all are heedless save whom God willeth. The breezes of divine revelation have encompassed the world and the manifestations of the power of the Eternal have appeared like unto the sun. The people of Persia, one and all, awaited this Day, yet when by God’s will the world was illumined with the lights of His countenance, all arose in opposition. These earthly fragments were and are unworthy of this Call. This Wronged One hath had no purpose except the reformation of the world and the refinement of all nations. The Pen of the All-Merciful desireth to purify all who dwell within the realm of possibility from rancor and hatred through the living waters of utterance, and to enable all to attain true unity, that the whole world might become detached and free. O Haydar! Beseech God that He may sanctify all horizons from discord through the wine of unity, that perchance souls may be found worthy to hearken unto this Call which is raised at all times from the Supreme Horizon. The Most Exalted Pen is ever in motion and the gaze of God is watchful and attentive. Blessed is he who hath attained unto His signs and quaffed the choice sealed wine through His Self-Subsisting Name. The Name of Munificence, upon him be My Glory, forwarded thy letter to the Most Holy Court, and it attained unto Our notice. Praise be to God that thou hast been successful and art steadfast in serving the Cause.</p>
<p>[…] We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist them all that they may behold with their own eyes the horizon of the Most Exalted Pen and become blessed with hearing His call with their own ears. The entire Shi’ih sect for one thousand two hundred years and more has been occupied with vain imaginings and idle fancies. Not a single one of the divines of that sect attained unto true knowledge; nay, they did not even partake of the outward meaning, inasmuch as they all pronounced their verdict against the Lord of all beings and cursed the deniers of Jabulqa. The clouds of vain desires and imaginings have prevented their eyes from beholding the Day-Star of truth. Beseech God not to deprive His servants of the ornament of justice and fairness, that they may, with the finger of equity, rend asunder the veils and attain unto the light of the Sun.</p>
<p>The deniers of the Bayan have not, until now, comprehended what caused the waywardness and misery of the previous sect. These people too cling to that sect; if they do not acknowledge this with their tongues, their very deeds bear witness to it. This Wronged One careth not whether His words be accepted or rejected. From the beginning of days until now, whatsoever needed to be said hath been uttered openly and in the most exalted call before the faces of all men. Every fair-minded person testifieth to what hath been mentioned. Now too We have fallen into the hands of Our enemies and have suffered what no eye hath seen nor ear heard. We have manifested the Cause in such wise that anything beyond it would be impossible. Neither the might of princes deterred Us nor the clamor of divines. We chose not silence in the face of tribulations and afflictions. We bore, in the path of God, what most have heard. Now from every direction arise the cawing of the ravens and manifest signs of rancor and hatred. It would be a great pity were the hem of sanctity to be sullied by the dust of understanding of such souls.</p>
<p>Say: O heedless ones! The Truth is manifest and the standard ‘Verily He is God’ hath been hoisted upon the most sublime station, and the Most Exalted Pen from the highest summit hath sent down the blessed word ‘The Kingdom is God’s’, clear and evident. By God’s life! The ears of the world are not capable of hearing this melody. Beseech God that He may, perchance, raise up a new people in the earth who, detached from all that false tongues have uttered and purified from what is current amongst men, may turn toward the horizon of the Revelation and hearken unto the voice of Him Who conversed upon Sinai.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Haydar! This Tablet hath shown forth from the Dayspring of divine knowledge. Its fragrance is wafting and diffusing, and its mention is all-embracing. Blessed are they who observe it with illumined breasts, pure hearts, penetrating vision, and attentive ears. Convey My greetings to the loved ones in that land. Say: Preserve your stations through the power of the name of God, glorified be His mention, and occupy yourselves with exalting His blessed and goodly Word. Great is the Cause and great is the Day, while the idolaters and the treacherous lie in wait. The Truth hath ever been and shall remain distinct from all else. His utterance is different from the utterance of the world’s people, His mention different from their mentions, and His way different from their ways. Verily He speaketh the truth and guideth to the Path. He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the Beautiful.</p>

<p>In the name of Him Who hath been exalted in His majesty and glory - 19 Safar 1303</p>
<p>He is God - exalted be His glory, to Whom belongeth greatness and grandeur</p>
<p>Through but one letter of His glorious Name did the universe and all within it become manifest and evident. All that exists hath been and shall ever be through the effulgence of His bounty. Should any soul in all creation draw a breath contrary to that which hath been mentioned, every atom in existence would testify to his heedlessness. The heaven is a sign of His loftiness and the seas are tokens of His grandeur. Whatever we may say, the seeing eye beholdeth in but a single leaf among the leaves of the divine Lote-Tree His majesty, power, exaltation and favor. All came into being through His will, that it might tell of its Fashioner, its Creator, and its Originator. Neither reckoning nor comprehension hath any place in this realm, until the hand of grace bestoweth what it will and conferreth what it pleaseth. His might can raise a straw to the galaxies and elevate dust to the Pleiades. How many among the possessors of sovereignty, dominion and palaces hath His controlling hand returned to their graves in utter abasement. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>The prayers and salutations of all peoples are befitting the most holy and exalted court of the Beloved, through Whose advent the heavens were adorned and through Whose presence the Night Journey was blessed. He is the source of the life-giving Kawthar amongst all possibility, through Whom the horizon of utterance was illumined, the ocean of inner meanings surged, and the decree of the All-Merciful was established amongst all religions. And upon His family and companions, who are the stars in the heavens of wisdom and the fish in the sea of power - they who aided and endured with patience, and theirs is the final abode.</p>
<p>The letter of that honored brother, which was in itself a new gift, arrived at the right place and the right time, for it came just as this evanescent one was intending to attain the presence. I took it, opened it, saw it and read it, then hastened until I reached the spot. When I arrived, the countenance of the Master smiled and He said - may my soul be sacrificed for Him - “What is in thy right hand?” I presented the letter, saying it had come from the direction of A. and S. When permission was granted, I read it. When the poem was finished, the countenance of the Master smiled again and He said - may my soul be sacrificed for Him - “O thou who art present! How beloved before God is the unity and harmony of the friends. Most often doth the word ‘unity’ flow from the Pen and tongue. We beseech God to confirm him and in every moment make him successful in remembrance. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.”</p>
<p>That you mentioned each of the loved ones individually in verse was most acceptable. Praise be to God that you were assisted to achieve that which is pleasing before the Friend. He said that its poetry is joy-inducing and its prose even more so, for the fragrance of love emanates from it. This quality keepeth the world alive and enduring. Love is like an essence - whatever remains after it is extracted from anything neither nourishes nor avails. We beseech God not to deprive the whole world from the lights of the Sun of His love.</p>
<p>Your verses have been mentioned repeatedly and became the cause and reason for your remembrance. Time and again they commanded me to convey to you that they should consult on matters and then, trusting in God, act accordingly. And they said the good of the world and its benevolence and kindness are directed toward you. Be not grieved, and be assured of the favors of God, exalted be His glory. His favor has been and is with you. In all conditions maintain the utmost joy and fragrance, such that whoever associates and companions with you becomes happy and delighted. Praise be to God, the carpet of gladness has been spread and the sun of God’s favor has risen. Speak in His remembrance, drink in His mention. Never let go of wisdom in any situation. It is not permissible to acknowledge matters which the ignorant are incapable of comprehending. Walk in the footsteps of the Wronged One. [End]</p>
<p>This servant conveys greetings, praise and gracious mention to all the friends of that land, and begs confirmation from God, exalted be His station, for each one. I ask God that His name be exalted through the unity, accord and sincerity of those noble souls. May their intention be the reformation of the world and the tranquility of all peoples. He is the Hearer, the Answerer, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The whole world has been and is specially for the friends of God, manifested according to the requirements of consummate wisdom. This is the evident truth, there is no doubt in it. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon the friends of God, the people of unity and the companions of detachment, whom God has described in His Manifest Book: “They speak not until He hath spoken, and they do His bidding.” And praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what will be.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who sent down the heavenly table, made manifest His bounty, and brought forth that which lay hidden in the treasuries of knowledge and wisdom, and gave utterance to that which drew the hearts of those who have cast away all else besides Him and turned with their hearts toward His most exalted horizon. Exalted is our Lord, the Master of all beings, Who hath caused His servants to recognize His clear verses according to His will and desire. He is verily the Sovereign of creation and the Lord of the Day of Return. And peace and blessings be upon God’s ambassadors, His Prophets, His chosen ones and His loved ones, and upon the Seal of His Messengers through whom God distinguished between His servants. My spirit be a sacrifice for your remembrance!</p>
<p>The breezes of your love stirred me when I read what was inscribed in your luminous letter mentioning God, the Lord of all names and Creator of heaven. I presented what I read before His Countenance, and He–sweet are His words–said: “Verily, he hath been under the glances of My loving-kindness and beneath the canopy of My grace. I have mentioned him with My tongue, turned toward him with My face, beckoned to him with My finger, and indicated to him with My brow, unto a station that changeth not and hath no end. He must preserve this precious pearl in the name of God, the Lord of all worlds. He is verily the Protector, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. And We remember My loved ones in that place who have held fast to what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Book.”</p>
<p>That which was sent from the land of Shin in the name of ?a and Sin, upon him be the glory of God, hath arrived. I presented it before His Countenance, and this evanescent servant hath responded and sent it to your presence that you may forward it to him. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Best of Senders. And concerning what you wrote about Sheikh Salman, upon him be the glory of God, and the imprisoned one, upon him be the glory of God, I beseech the Exalted One to assist all to do what He loveth and is pleased with, to strengthen them in showing kindness to their brethren, and to aid them in achieving unity and harmony. He is verily the Master of His servants and the Inspirer of right conduct.</p>
<p>I presented your mention before His Countenance, and this is what the Kingdom of Utterance proclaimed: “O Salman! The Wronged One hath heard thy mention and thy cry, both before and after, and hath answered thee with that which hath diffused the fragrance of loving-kindness. We beseech the Exalted One to assist thee to be patient and forbearing in all conditions, and to ordain for thee the best in this world and the next. Say: Glory be to Thee, O my God, my Purpose, and Master of my being, Who beholdeth my outer and inner self! I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou hast guided the sincere ones to Thy straight path and made known to those near unto Thee Thy abounding grace, to write down for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen what Thou hast written for Thy chosen servants. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp is the kingdom of names. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.”</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Should there be any delay in answering your noble letter, this is due to my many occupations and writings, and my trust in you, my reliance upon you, and my confidence in your love. My Lord and your Lord beareth witness to this. Glory be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who are there among God’s sincere loved ones. And concerning what you mentioned about ’Abdu’l-Ghani, upon him be the glory of God, let him rejoice in what hath befallen him. How many servants have been martyred in God’s path, how many breasts have been pierced through love of God, how many heads have been raised upon spears for God’s Cause, and how much blood hath been shed in God’s path! He must rejoice in all conditions and praise God, his Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>It behooveth us to look to God’s will and purpose, and to what He loveth and is pleased with, not to what our desires crave, our wills desire, and our hearts delight in. The whole matter is in His hands. It is for us to thank Him, praise Him, glorify Him, sanctify Him, mention Him, and extol Him in hardship and ease, in adversity and tribulation, and in all that cometh upon His servants in this world. He knoweth and understandeth; we have no knowledge of the outcome of our affairs, nor of what will benefit us, preserve us, and deliver us. Our Creator, our Maker, our Provider, our Life-Giver, and our Death-Bringer beareth witness to this, as He hath testified in His gracious Book which He revealed unto him who adorned the Night Journey, and in the Books of the Messengers. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

We taught thee My remembrance and praise, and loosened thy tongue to make mention of this Remembrance through which the limbs of them that have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds, have quaked. We shall be with thee under all conditions and shall aid thee as a token of Our grace. Be thou assured and numbered among the thankful. Blessed art thou for having been faithful to My Covenant, cast away vain imaginings, and embraced this Cause whereby the horizon of certitude hath shone forth by the command of the One Who is the Powerful, the Ancient of Days. Convey My greetings unto thyself and unto those who have turned to God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. The glory be upon you, O My loved ones!

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who is one in His grandeur and power, Who is peerless in His glory and authority. He doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty, and none in the kingdom of creation can prevent Him from that which He desireth. He giveth to drink unto them that have recognized His oneness from the Kawthar of bounty, and unto the sincere that which causeth them to turn toward the Most Exalted Horizon. These are servants who speak not except by His leave, and breathe not except by His permission. They recite the verses of God and seek their meanings from their Revealer Who speaketh betwixt earth and heaven. Verily, there is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. How excellent is he who hath found the fragrance of that which God hath willed and hath followed that which He hath ordained in His perspicuous Book.</p>

For division hath ever been and shall ever be the cause of disgrace, while unity is the source of exaltation. Hold fast unto that which the Wronged One commandeth thee from this mighty prison. Verily He remembereth thee as He hath remembered thee before. Thou hast a station with thy Lord - preserve it and be of the thankful ones. You have always been remembered in the presence of the Wronged One and, God willing, shall continue to be so. The glance of His loving-kindness hath been directed toward you. You must occupy yourself with utmost determination in serving the Cause so that all may soar on the wings of unity in the heaven of the love of the Lord of creation. And should there arise any difference regarding the meaning of any of the divine utterances or verses that have been sent down, inquire so that the purpose may become clear to all.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant submitteth that your responsibilities have now increased, for permission hath been granted to Aqa Muhammad Javad to proceed to that quarter. In truth, in that land you and Jinab-i-Samandar must be engaged in the promotion of the Cause of God with perfect fellowship and unity, with such steadfastness that none among the peoples of the world shall be able to prevent it. For this is the day of service, this is the day of remembrance and praise, this is the day of deeds in the path of God. Assuredly any word that appeareth today for the sake of God and His love shall influence hearts and cause all to be set ablaze. God willing, I hope that the light of unity may shine forth in that land and all may occupy themselves with the remembrance of God upon the carpet of love, fellowship, affection and unity. The very unity of the friends of God hath been and shall ever be the cause of guiding mankind.</p>
<p>If you wish news of this land, although all regions are disturbed and shaken, as has been detailed in the blessed Surih of Ra’is and elsewhere, yet this land is outwardly tranquil at present. Although it has been said that the land of prison has not yet become tranquil, and within its mystery lies concealed a disturbance - its knowledge is with God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. All the friends in this land send their greetings, and request that on behalf of this evanescent one you convey my greetings to those who drink from the Kawthar of inner meanings who reside in that land. This time there was no opportunity to write anything to Jinab-i-Samandar, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], as the work of writing has reached such a point that this servant is occupied day and night. God willing, he and his brother must forgive me. In closing, we beseech God to grant you success and assist you in serving His Cause, and to protect you from those who have turned away from His sovereignty and disputed His verses. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the All-Hearing, the Answerer. The Glory be upon you and upon His loved ones in that place, both young and old.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who created man and taught him utterance, and made him a sign of His dominion in all creation. And blessings and peace be upon the Lord of the Messengers, the Ordainer of paths, the Manifestation of Names, the Banner of Eternity in the Kingdom of Creation, and upon His family and companions who held fast to divine assistance and attained to the Dayspring of dawn.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this evanescent servant was honored by your exalted letter which was truly the essence of joy and gladness, bestowing complete delight and opening the gates of reunion, for the yearning ones perceive from the book the fragrance of reunion. However, from what you wrote about the tribulations that had befallen, infinite grief was experienced - one word brought joy while another brought sorrow. Praise be to God in both conditions. Your honor has no news from this land. What has befallen it is the universal cause of the world’s grief. A few days ago, while at the mansion, one night as this servant was engaged in writing in His presence, suddenly an uproar arose. Later it became known that a group of Christians had, with utmost tyranny and aggression, beaten and abused some friends who were engaged in service, to such an extent that two souls nearly perished. Until now the physicians are occupied with their treatment.</p>
<p>After these abhorrent acts, they entered Akka and began complaining to the Pasha and others, claiming “Three of us were sent to another place by the Persians who attacked us,” whereas no one had molested those souls. It seems they were raised in the school of falsehood and grew up in the college of calumny. In brief, there were several days of dispute, and every soul said something, until finally it became clear and evident to the government that these prisoners and captives had not molested those heedless souls.</p>
<p>Tribulations and hardships have ever been and continue to be - sometimes the imprisonment of the friends in various lands, and at times the heedlessness of the people of this city. From the day they seized the beloved of hearts, Haji Seyyed Ali Akbar - upon him be the peace of God - in the land of Ta, verbal incidents also occurred in this land. Your honor is aware of the favor, grace and mercy of the Lord. Nevertheless, every day, nay every moment, they are engaged in deception and plotting, although all know that the world and all that is therein belongs to none but returns to God. Yet for a single dirham they cast themselves into peril and make themselves deserving of eternal punishment.</p>
<p>This servant beseeches God - exalted be His glory - to protect these servants and assist them in that which pleases Him. Verily, He has power over all things.</p>
<p>Your letter was presented before His countenance. He said: “We beseech God to protect him and ordain for him the good of the hereafter and this world. Verily, He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth.” End quote.</p>
<p>The souls present in service, the son and the honored lady - upon them both be the glory of God - send their greetings, and please convey greetings to those who are absent as well. We beseech divine confirmation for each one. We implore and beseech the Exalted Truth to assist all in that which He loves and is pleased with, and to increase your honor’s elevation and exaltation at every moment. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote that his honor, my master - may my spirit and being be a sacrifice for the dust of his footsteps - has not shown any kindness for some time, this much is submitted: Your honor has ever been and continues to be mentioned before all. This is the truth of what was submitted. Otherwise, it is the multitude of occupations that sometimes prevents mention. Now matters have reached such a point that this servant is even prevented from responding to the letters of the friends in various regions. I beseech God to assist this evanescent one to serve His friends. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer, and worthy to respond.</p>
<p>The people of the pavilion of grandeur and glory each send their greetings to your honor and the honored lady and those absent, and they beseech God for your honor’s confirmation, success, glory and elevation of station. Peace, spirit and mercy be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, our Goal and your Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the Single, the One, the Unique, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Powerful, Who has taken unto Himself no partner nor likeness. He has manifested the Messengers to reveal His bounty and to demonstrate His grace - they through whom were opened the gates of knowledge and through whom were revealed the mysteries of His Self-Subsisting Name. He adorned the beginning with the ornament of the seal, and We made him the sovereign of existence and named him Ahmad and Muhammad, the Praised One, the radiant and effulgent Light shining from the heaven of God’s loving-kindness. Upon him and upon his family and companions, through whom the servants were humbled and the lands were conquered, be the glory of God.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose Name the choice wine did flow and the clear stream did run and the proof was made manifest! I beseech Thee by the Mother Book and by the Manifestations of Thy names in the beginning and the end, that Thou write down for Thy Afnan, by Thy Most Exalted Pen in the crimson scroll, that which shall cause their mention to endure through the perpetuity of Thy Most Exalted Word, Thy sweetest remembrance and Thy Most Exalted Name. O my Lord! Thou seest the one whom Thou didst single out for Thy loving-kindness and compassion, and didst aid him in such wise that he traversed land and sea until he entered the Valley of the Noble One and heard Thy sweetest call when he entered through the gate before Thy face, O Thou Lord of Names and Creator of heaven! Praise be unto Thee, the Ancient of Days and the Desire of the nations, in that Thou didst call him to attain Thy presence and caused him to hear Thy call and to behold Thy beauty, and gave him to drink, from the hand of Thy bounty, the Kawthar of Thy presence. When the appointed time of reunion was fulfilled, he migrated once again by Thy leave and command, and desired to circumambulate Thy House which was built in Thy name by the hands of Thy chosen ones. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen, to render all his deeds acceptable and all his efforts praiseworthy. Moreover, make his past works a treasure for him in the repositories of Thy protection and Thy preservation. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>May my spirit be a sacrifice unto your honor! The servant has been blessed by the scratching of your pen and the trace of your ink. It was as if the thirsty one had attained the water of life, or the afflicted one the healing remedy of utterance. When I read and understood, I praised God, my Goal and your Goal, my Beloved and your Beloved, for the steadfastness of your temperament and health. And afterward, with utmost lamentation while you were in the bath, standing outside the bath, your prayer was offered. This is what the Kingdom of Utterance did speak […]</p>
<p>O Afnan! Upon thee be My Baha, My mercy and My loving-kindness! We have indeed found from every word of thy letter that was presented before the Face the fragrance of sanctity and sincerity, purified from the realm of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Blessed art thou, and blessed is the father who raised thee, and the mother who suckled thee, and the leaf who won thy good-pleasure, and the son who obeyed thee, and the servant who found solace in thy company.</p>
<p>Rest assured through the grace of the True One, exalted be His glory. That which is beneficial for the Afnan shall be made manifest and apparent. Special means have appeared and been made manifest this year particularly for the Afnan, but the eyes of the servants have been prevented from witnessing and perceiving them, save those whom God willeth. Whatever means become apparent, hold fast unto them and act with trust in God. Whatever means of excuse and severance become evident are specifically for the Afnan, for in no other year have such matters occurred. Verily, He is with thee in all conditions, and He is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Convey to all the Afnan and Leaves, one after another, greetings from the Wronged One, and show them kindness. They have been and are in Our sight. If the reward of this journey were to become manifest even to the extent of a needle’s eye, all would be adorned with such joy that the dust of sorrows of contingent beings and their peoples would not dim it nor prevent its radiance. Upon you be the Glory, upon you be Peace, upon you be the Mercy.</p>
<p>All things bear witness to the loving-kindness of the True One, exalted be His glory. Whatever else this servant might submit to your presence would be superfluous. In the nights and days, I beseech the Exalted True One to increase at every moment the success granted to you and the Afnan. Verily, He is the Answerer, the Kind, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>This evanescent non-entity further submits his utter nothingness to the presence of the noble Afnan and the Leaves of the Sacred Tree - upon them and upon them be all the most glorious Baha. Similarly, those souls who are engaged in service at this time have attained the honor of visiting through your presence, but this was witnessed and acted upon directly. This is yet another bounty from God, our Lord, our Goal, our Beloved, and the One worshipped by all in the heavens and earths. The Peace that is manifest, resplendent, and shining forth from the horizon of loving-kindness be upon you and upon those with you.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, His greatness and His power!</p>
<p>Praise be unto Him by Whose name the valley flowed and by Whose light the Hijaz was illumined. Through His remembrance the sincere ones have proclaimed: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting,” and those near unto Him have declared: “There is none other God but He, the Omnipotent over what was and what shall be.” Blessed is he who hath attained unto His Revelation, been illumined by His lights, drawn knowledge from the ocean of His wisdom, been enlightened by the Sun of His utterance and been raised up by His exaltation. He, verily, is the Dawning-Place of God’s signs and His proof, and the Day-Spring of His evidences and His favors. Through Him the path of God was made manifest in the world and His judgment established amongst the peoples. Upon Him rest God’s blessings, His peace, His light, His glory, His honor, His power, and upon His family and companions through whom the rains of justice poured forth from the clouds of grace and the dove of the Cause warbled upon the branches: “The Kingdom is God’s, the One, the Mighty, the Bountiful!”</p>
<p>Thereafter, the servant received your letter and became acquainted with what was inscribed by the pen of your love. When I found therein the fragrance of your turning unto God, I approached the Lord and presented before His presence that which your tongue had uttered in remembrance. He - may my spirit be sacrificed for Him - said:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing Witness!</p>
<p>Today is the day of lowliness, supplication and return, for the armies of polytheism have encompassed the world of unity, as hath been and is now witnessed. Each day the fire of hatred is kindled. By the life of God, the clash of arms shall not be silenced except through turning unto God. The people of unity must all, in the nights and days, beseech abundance from the Self-Sufficient and implore victory, that perchance the people of unity and the inhabited cities and regions may be preserved from the flames of the blazing fire. The world was not and is not worthy of mention. Blessed is the soul whom the veils and clouds of the world and all therein have not debarred from the Dayspring of the names and attributes of God, exalted be His glory. Soon shall all that is visible vanish, and sovereignty, might and power shall remain with God, the One, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>My God, my God! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have desired the wonders of Thy bounty and the manifestations of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Kingdom and Dominion, by Thy Prophets and Thy chosen ones and Thy Messengers, and by the tears of the sincere ones and the sighs of them that are nigh unto Thee, to assist me in Thy remembrance and Thy praise and in acting according to that which Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book. This lost one beareth witness to Thy existence, this poor one to Thy wealth, this ignorant one to the ocean of Thy knowledge, and this weak one to Thy power. His tongue, both outward and inward, testifieth to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and that Thou art God and there is none other God but Thee. Thou hast ever been the Goal and Object of the world’s worship and will continue to be what Thou hast been from time immemorial. There is none other God but Thee, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the Dawning-Places of Thy Revelation and the Day-Springs of Thy Command and the Manifestations of Thy Self and the Repositories of Thy knowledge, to ordain for me the good of what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Thou, verily, art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! His light is resplendent, His Cause manifest, His decree [evident, His path clear, and His proof luminous. Blessed is the soul that hath clung to the cord of His bounty and hath acted in accordance with the] precepts revealed in His Book. Deeds bear witness to words and aid those who turn to Him. I beseech Him, exalted be His glory, to aid that honoured person to do that which He loveth and which pleaseth Him. I likewise implore Him to grant all a portion and share from the ocean of His good-pleasure and not to deprive them thereof. He is the Giver, He is the All-Bountiful, and He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Peace be upon you and upon God’s sincere, righteous, active and successful servants. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the name of Him Who warbleth upon the branches!</p>
<p>O My name! Hearken unto My call from around My throne that I may acquaint thee with an ocean that hath no shore and whose depths no swimmer hath reached. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Bountiful. We have willed to bestow upon thee a remembrance of what We have seen, that thou mayest behold the luminous world within this world of darkness and be assured that We have worlds within this world, and that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the All-Informed. Verily, were He to desire to manifest from an atom the lights of the sun, and from a drop the waves of the sea, He is able to do so, even as He hath detailed from the Point the knowledge of what hath been and what shall be.</p>
<p>While We were seated upon the throne, there entered a radiant leaf, clad in fine white raiment, appearing as the full moon rising from the horizon of heaven. Exalted be God Who created her! No eye hath ever seen her like. When she lifted her veil, the heavens and earth were illumined as though the Ancient Essence had shed upon her its splendors. Exalted be God Who created her! No eye hath ever seen her like. She smiled and swayed like a willow branch in the vision of the All-Merciful. Exalted be He Who manifested her! No eye hath ever seen her like. Then she walked and circled about, without intention or will of her own, as though love’s needle were drawn by the magnet of Beauty shining before her face. Exalted be He Who created her! No eye hath ever seen her like.</p>
<p>She walked while Glory served her, and the Kingdom of Beauty sang her praise from behind her, such was her wondrous beauty, her allurement, and the perfection of her form. Exalted be He Who created her! No eye hath ever seen her like. Then We beheld her black tresses upon her white neck, as though night and day had embraced in this Most Glorious Spot and Ultimate Goal. Exalted be He Who created her! No eye hath ever seen her like.</p>
<p>How sweet was her nectar! Whoso tasted it testified that the stream of life flowed from the point of her mouth. Exalted be He Who created her! No eye hath ever seen her like. When We gazed upon her face, We found the Point that was concealed beneath the veil of Oneness shining from the horizon of her brow, as though through it were detailed the tablets of the love of the All-Merciful throughout creation and the scrolls of lovers throughout all regions. Exalted be He Who created her! No eye hath ever seen her like.</p>
<p>And that Point was reflected by another point above her right breast. Exalted be the Lord of the hidden and manifest, Who created her! No eye hath ever seen her like. And the Temple of God arose and walked, and she walked behind Him, hearing, moving, drawn by the verses of her Lord. Blessed be He Who created her! No eye hath ever seen her like.</p>
<p>Then her joy, delight and longing increased until she was transformed and swooned. When she recovered, she drew near and said: “May my soul be a sacrifice for Thy prison, O Mystery of the Unseen in the kingdom of creation!” Exalted be He Who created her! No eye hath ever seen her like. And she gazed upon the Dayspring of the throne like one intoxicated and bewildered, until she placed her hand around her Lord’s neck and drew Him to her. When she drew near and We drew near, We found from her what had been sent down in the Hidden Crimson Scroll by My Most Exalted Pen. Exalted be He Who created her! No eye hath ever seen her like.</p>
<p>Then she inclined her head and rested her face upon her two fingers, as though the crescent moon had conjoined with the full moon. Exalted be He Who created her! No eye hath ever seen her like. At that moment she cried out, saying: “May all existence be a sacrifice for Thy tribulations, O King of earth and heaven! How long wilt Thou confine Thyself among these people in the city of ’Akka? Repair to Thy other realms, to places whereupon the eyes of the people of names have never fallen.” Thereupon We smiled. Know ye this most sweet remembrance and what We intended by this most hidden Secret, manifest yet most concealed […] O men of wisdom among the companions of My crimson Ark! This Remembrance hath fallen upon a day whereon My Herald - He Who hath proclaimed My sovereignty and heralded unto the people the heaven of My Will, the ocean of My Purpose and the sun of My Manifestation - was born. We have further glorified it through another day whereon was manifested the Hidden Mystery, the Treasured Secret, the Well-Guarded Symbol, by which the dwellers of the Kingdom of Names were seized with perturbation, and they that dwell on earth and in heaven were thunderstruck, save those whom We delivered through a sovereignty and power proceeding from Us. Verily, I am the All-Powerful over whatsoever I will. There is no God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Blessed is he who hath inhaled the fragrance of God on this Day which is the Dawning-Place of the Manifestation and the Dayspring of My Name, the All-Forgiving - a Day whereon the Divine Breathing wafted, and the Breeze stirred, and the attraction of the Manifestation quickened them that lay in their graves, and the Mountain cried out: “The Kingdom is God’s, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed!” And whereon every seeker attained his heart’s desire, every mystic found the Object of his recognition, and every wayfarer discovered His straight path.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! Bless Thy loved ones and send down upon them from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will cause them to be detached from all else save Thee, and to turn toward the horizon whence the sun of Thy grace hath shone forth. Ordain, O my God, for them that which will profit them in this world and the world to come. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Bestower, the Bountiful, the Self-Sufficient, the All-Generous.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who is sanctified above all created things, in His Most Exalted Name</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Thy letter hath been presented before the Divine Throne, and We have taken note of the words contained therein, and We have witnessed that thou hast associated God, thy Lord, with another in the beginning of thy tablet. Beware, beware lest thou associate His mention with the mention of anyone else, or His name with the name of aught else that hath been created between the heavens and the earth, and make no allusion to Him, for He is sanctified above the mention of all created things and exalted above being associated with His creation. He hath ever been, and there hath been nothing beside Him, and He shall ever continue to be even as He hath been, if thou be of them that know. All else besides Him is created by His command and brought into being by His will, and is held within the grasp of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
<p>Verily, He cannot be known except through Himself, nor can He be described save by Himself. Whoso claimeth to know Him through any other than Him hath indeed borne a grievous calumny and sin, and hath followed his own desires, and what he imagineth in his knowledge is but a fancy that hath encompassed him and veiled him from the knowledge of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say: He is one in His essence, one in His attributes, and one in His deeds, and whatsoever proceedeth from Him and appeareth from His presence is that which proceedeth from the Manifestation of His glorious and wise Self. Beyond this, there is no way for anyone to know Him, exalted be He. Thus have We revealed aforetime and now, if thou be of them that know.</p>
<p>They who worship names instead of Me, these are indeed idolaters in the sight of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. Say: Do ye take names as lords for yourselves besides God and forsake the Most Excellent of Creators? Fear ye God, then sanctify yourselves from the veils of fancy and be ye of them who take none besides God as their helper or protector. Thus doth the Mighty Cause instruct thee through this holy and luminous Pen.</p>
<p>Purify thy soul, thy spirit, and thy heart through My Name, then speak forth My praise and proclaim My Cause. Then will the Spirit strengthen thee and all things will circle round thee, and this is of God’s grace upon thee, if thou be of them who know. Beware lest what thou possessest veil thee from the Beauty of the Ancient One Who hath appeared in truth from this resplendent and manifest Horizon. Cast aside what the people possess and take hold of the Book of God with strength and great power. Be not of them who recite the verses of God by night and day, yet when their like is revealed and their Revealer appeareth, deny both them and their Revealer. Thus do their souls entice them to evil, and they are of the idolaters.</p>
<p>Then suffice thyself with thy Lord apart from all else, and He will suffice thee against all who are in the heavens and on earth. Say: O people! Do ye deny Him through Whom the proof of God appeared among you and through Whom your faith in God, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Wise, was established? Woe unto you and unto those who follow you without permission from Our presence, for the truth is what appeareth from Me, and after truth there is naught save manifest error.</p>
<p>Say: After the Manifestation of God, no soul’s faith shall profit it except after recognizing Him, and none denieth this save every hostile and hateful denier. Whoso acknowledgeth this Cause today hath indeed attained unto all good, and all his deeds shall be accepted, and God shall clothe him with the robe of forgiveness, for He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. He heareth his call and regardeth him with the glances of mercy, and ordaineth for him the good of this world and the next in preserved tablets of glory. And whoso denieth this Cause and doubteth therein, his works shall be rendered vain, and his cry shall not ascend unto God, and naught shall be accepted from him even should he worship as heavily as both humans and jinn. That which purifieth man is the recognition of the beauty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Thus hath the Command flowed from the Pen of the All-Glorious in all tablets, if ye be of them that know.</p>
<p>Whoso maketh mention of God today without being certain of God, his mention shall be struck upon his head while he perceiveth it not, and he shall be of the heedless. And whoso writeth the verses of God without being drawn unto Him, his very fingers curse him, nay, all atoms, if ye be of them that hear. O thou servant! Arise and remind the people of the verses of thy Lord that they may become aware within themselves and seek forgiveness for what they have committed against God, and be of the penitent. Thus have We commanded thee. Follow what thou art commanded, and this is better for thee than the kingdom of the heavens and earth. And glory be upon thee and upon those who have placed their trust in God and have detached themselves from all else. And praise be to God, thy Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who is Mighty to do as He willeth!</p>
<p>O ’Ali! The Most Great Ocean hath surged, and from each drop thereof is heard: “There is no God but Him, the One, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful!” The fragrance of divine favors hath wafted when thy letter reached the Throne. This is of His grace upon thee. Be thou grateful and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the dominion of all things!” We found thy letter purified from the mention of aught else but Me, and adorned with the remembrance of the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Therefore hath the Lord of Destiny turned toward thee from the direction of His Most Sublime Vision, speaking unto thee through these verses, before which every proof and evidence must needs bow down in prostration. Rend asunder the veils of all created things through My Name and My sovereignty, then illumine the horizons with My remembrance. This is a Day whose station, were We to describe it, could not be encompassed by all the Tablets of heaven and earth, and all pens would be powerless to recount it.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! How many of the chosen ones have beseeched and attained not, have turned toward and reached not, have lamented and heard not - yet thou hearest the Call from the horizon of eternity, the Outlook of thy Most Glorious Lord, in the voice of grandeur and majesty: “There is no God but I, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting.” By God! The Interlocutor of Moses calleth from this Prison while in the hands of the wicked ones, and the Beloved of the Beloved mentioneth thee with verses that have caused the very rocks to quake, how much more the hearts of the righteous! The Father of the Son calleth thee from this station and addresseth thee with decisive utterance.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Were We to reveal unto thee what lieth concealed in the treasuries of infallibility, by God, the heaven would be cleft asunder, the earth would be rent, and the hearts of all servants would be convulsed, save whom thy Lord willeth, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Hadst thou been present at the time of the revelation of this Tablet, thou wouldst have soared on the wings of longing, transcending all stations of knowledge and all heights of names, and wouldst have witnessed thy Lord’s all-encompassing power over all who dwell in earth and heaven. Through My sweetest remembrance hath the sun risen from the horizon of eternity, and through My Most Glorious Name have the dead been raised.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Despite such majesty, before which all matters have been subdued, the hosts of the oppressors have encompassed Me from every direction. Consider how, in the midst of ultimate tribulation, He speaketh and summoneth all unto God, the Lord of all names, in such wise that neither the might of the oppressors nor the armies of the infidels can hinder Him. Thus have We bestowed Our favor upon thee time and again. When thou hast attained, recite and turn with an illumined heart toward the Dawning-Place of thy Lord’s revelation, the Mighty, the Bountiful. God hath forgiven those whom thou didst mention in thy letter. Verily, He forgiveth whomsoever He willeth through His sovereignty. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Rejoice in that thou art under the gaze of thy Lord, and He hath made thee know the Dawning-Place of His verses, while the people were in doubt and schism. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, then make mention of those who are there, by the leave of the Revealer of verses.</p>
<p>Look not to the words of the past and what hath been mentioned, O thou who gazeth toward God, for most of it was either pure falsehood or intermingled therewith. And even if there was a word of truth, they comprehended not its meaning and distorted it. Consider what was written in the Book concerning the signs of resurrection, gathering, raising of the dead, the Hour, the Calamity, the Inevitable Event, the Cry, the Trump, Paradise and Fire, and the like, and likewise concerning the Qa’im and His appearance - not a letter thereof did they comprehend, and from its purpose they remained wholly veiled. That which was revealed in God’s Book, the Furqan, is truth wherein there is no doubt, and none hath understood its true meaning save whom thy Lord willeth. Apart from this, most of the traditions and tales had no foundation, even as in this most great Revelation some such vain imaginings have been rent asunder and their meaning made clear and evident, while others remain between the fingers of the All-Merciful, that He may rend them asunder through His sovereignty. In any case, purify thine ears from that which is with the people. That which is now raised up sufficeth for hearkening. Verily He is the Enricher of the worlds. The divine confirmations were the Teacher of Him Who conversed with God, which are none other than the divine revelatory effulgences that now speak forth, and which in every world are known by one of His names, and in God’s Book are named [Khidr]. Most of the mysteries of this Revelation have remained concealed. Verily it cannot be compared with aught else. Should one reflect upon the Bayan, God will open unto his heart such gates of understanding for recognizing this Revelation as have never been opened unto any among His servants. Thus doth the Lord of all beings decree. Know thou, then conceal, and the glory be upon thee.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Wondrous, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>The first splendor that appeared and shone forth from the Dayspring of eternity, and the first light that gleamed from the Horizon of glory, and the first mercy that descended from the clouds of grandeur be upon thee, O thou whom God hath sanctified from the allusions of the people of creation, and associated with the Manifestation of His own Self, the Most Exalted, the Most High, and the Dawning-Place of His Cause between earth and heaven, and aided thee with the Most Great Spirit in days wherein the hearts of the men of wisdom were sorely shaken, and the cries of all things ascended to the most remote sanctuaries and the Divine Lote-Tree. I bear witness before God and the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Paradise of Refuge and those who abide within the crimson chambers behind the veils of destiny, that thou didst drink the choice wine of faith from the hands of grace vouchsafed by thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and didst enter the precincts of paradise, the spot wherein shone forth the lights of glory, and didst attain unto the bounties of God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Bestower. And I testify that thou didst believe in God and wert assured of His signs, and didst submit to His sovereignty and acknowledge His oneness and confess His unity and bow before His Cause and humble thyself before the Manifestation of His Self and the Dayspring of His Beauty and the Rising-Place of His Revelation and the Treasury of His inspiration and the Repository of His verses. And I bear witness that thy spirit ascended to the Supreme Companion, purified from the veils of the people of creation, and entered the most great vision. May God’s curse be upon those who wronged thee and invaded thy resting-place and dispersed those who were around thee and violated thy sanctity and took thy kindred captive and were among the oppressors. And I testify that at thy calamity there flowed the tears of the monotheists and the faces of those near to God turned pale and the hearts of the sincere were consumed.</p>
<p>[This is the Tablet of Visitation which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of Eternity for the Name of God Who was called Hasan and was related to His Self, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed are they who visit him and are among the visitors and draw nigh through him unto God, the Mighty, the Beloved.]</p>
<p>I bear witness before Thee, O my God, from this station - and those who are seated upon the thrones of eternity, and the angels that circle round the throne of Thy Most Exalted Beauty bear witness likewise - that I have believed in Thee and in Thy greatest signs at the hour when the heaven of destiny was cleft asunder and the Manifestation of Thy Self appeared in the kingdom of names. And I believe in those who preceded Him before the creation of earth and heaven, who entered beneath the shadow of His grace and drank from the chalice of His mercy, who acknowledged His sovereignty and confessed His grandeur and power, who prostrated themselves at the dawning of the lights of His countenance and were recorded among those who turned unto Him in the tablets of glory by the Pen of Command. I bear witness, O my God and my Lord, that He Who appeared in those days is indeed Thy Glory, Thy Manifestation, Thy Revelation, Thy Power, and Thy Sovereignty unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. Blessed is he who hath recognized Him, hearkened to His call, responded to His command, circled around Him and sought His gate. Woe unto him who wronged Him, denied His Cause, disputed His signs, warred against His Self, gave the lie to His proof, arose in opposition before His face, waxed proud against Him, and was recorded among the opposers in the Book.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O my God, in this noble station, by Thy Most Exalted Self and by this Most Manifest, Most Glorious Revelation whereby the earth and heaven were illumined and the sun of destiny rose from the horizon of beginning, to make firm, O my God, my feet upon this path whereon most feet have slipped. Then cause me to gaze toward the direction of His good-pleasure, to turn unto the sanctuary of His holy grandeur, to remain steadfast in His love, to be certain of whatsoever proceedeth from Him, to be upright in what He willeth. Verily Thou doest what Thou pleasest, and Thou art powerful over all things.</p>
<p>O my God, I adjure Thee by the lights of Thy countenance which have encompassed all created things, and by Thy mercy which hath preceded all existence, not to deprive me of the holy fragrances of Thy grace and favors, nor to make me despair of the outpourings of Thy mercy and gifts. Then raise me up by Thy sovereignty unto Thy love and remembrance, sever me from all else but Thee, and preserve me, O my God, lest I dispute Thy signs at the time of the Manifestations of Thy Cause, the Dawning-Places of Thy revelation, and the Daysprings of Thy grace. Then open my eyes, O my God, that I may know Thee through Thyself and not through aught else, and that I may not cling to anything that hath been created between the heavens and earth. Verily Thou hast knowledge of all things.</p>
<p>Then forgive me, O my God, and my father and mother, and those who are related to me. Then send down upon me of every good thing Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen servants. Then assign me a seat of truth in the vicinity of Thy greatest mercy. Then purify me from all that veils me from Thee. Then prepare me for meeting Thee in the next resurrection. Verily Thou art He in Whose grasp is the kingdom of earth and heaven, and Thou hast ever been merciful unto Thy servants.</p>

<p>Your spiritual friend’s letter was received, expressing devotion, acceptance, supplication and detachment. After reading and reviewing it, it was taken to the heaven of bounty and presented before the Countenance of the Lord - may the spirit of all in the kingdoms of command and creation be a sacrifice for His advent. After full permission was granted, the letter was presented. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, as a grace from Him, for He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Encompassing over all names</p>
<p>O Ghulam-‘Ali! This is a day wherein the Primal Point calls out, the Mother Book cries aloud, and all things lament for what has befallen the friends of God in the land of Ya. The wolves have surrounded the dawning-places of divine gifts and favors, and have committed that which has caused My heart, My pen, My outer being and My inner being to weep. The oppressor has denied God’s proof, His evidence, His greatness and His sovereignty. Now he has been seized from all directions with such a seizure that has taken from him sleep and rest. He is deprived and cut off from bounty. The bearer of the Divine Tablet, namely Badi’, proceeded by the command of God, exalted be His glory. Due to the guidance of the fearful traitor, he did not take the Tablet and was not blessed to read and recite it. Now letters like deadly poison are sent to him from all directions, and there is no choice but to read them. Thus, he involuntarily and forcibly drinks the cup of pus. Glory be to God! Can any fair-minded one, any just one, any well-wisher of state and nation be found who would acknowledge the bounties mentioned in the Tablet, that perchance he might arise to compensate for what he has lost? But alas, alas, for falsehood and vanity have prevented and continue to prevent him from submitting to the Divine Cause. We testify that he is in evident veiling. Yet this Wronged One utters these exalted words:</p>
<p>My God, My God! Prevent not the Sultan from turning to the ocean of Thy knowledge, and deprive him not from the depths of the sea of Thy oneness which was the bearer of Thy mysteries and the treasury of Thy wisdom and knowledge. O Lord! Aid him to return unto Thy court and to acknowledge his errors before the gate of Thy forgiveness. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-Qabil-’Ali! The servant present before Me hath presented thy letter, and after permission was granted, We have answered thee with this clear remembrance, that thou mayest read and be of the thankful ones. Two most wondrous, most mighty, most holy and most glorious Tablets, specifically for those who have turned unto God, were sent in the handwriting of the Most Great Branch, that they may bring forth from the ocean of My words the pearls of My knowledge, as a grace from Me unto thee and unto those who have turned and have said: “The Kingdom and the Dominion, and the Glory and the Might belong unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.” Make mention of the loved ones on behalf of the Wronged One, then recite unto them what We have sent down from the heaven of My will that encompasseth all who are in the heavens and the earth. Thus endeth the matter. Praise be to God that in this divine springtime the flowers of wisdom and inner meanings have sprouted from the soil of hearts. Blessed is he who hath recognized, and woe unto the deniers! In truth, there hath been sent down from the heaven of divine favor, specifically for thee and the two souls mentioned - upon them be 96 [Baha’u’llah] - that which hath had and shall have no likeness, and shall endure for as long as His most beautiful names endure. This servant conveyeth greetings and glorification to each one. It is hoped that at all times they will arise to serve the Cause and engage, with the utmost endeavor, in teaching with wisdom and utterance. Verily our Lord assisteth His loved ones to serve Him and enableth them to make mention of Him, to praise Him, and to exalt His Word. He, verily, is the Answerer of prayers and the Lord of all the worlds. Should ye meet the friends of God, convey on behalf of this servant greetings and glorification. We beseech God to gather His loved ones beneath the canopies of His grace and to grant them His presence, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who have attained unto the Most Great Steadfastness in the Cause of God, our Lord and the Lord of all who are in earth and heaven. There is no God but Him, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.</p>

<p>In the name of the One Incomparable Knower!</p>
<p>The waves of praise and glorification befit those servants who, through the power of God’s Name, have rent asunder the veils of self and turned toward the highest horizon. Neither the grandeur and majesty of idols deterred them from the Lord of all beings, nor did the tyranny and rebellion of the iniquitous deprive these souls of the Salsabil of immortality. Exalted, exalted is He Who created them, caused them to know Him, gave them utterance, taught them, and honored them. He, verily, is the Single One, the Powerful, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>The letter thou didst send to Nabil-i-’Ali, upon him be the glory of God, reached the Most Holy Court, and this servant presented its contents in their entirety. As to what thou didst mention concerning the unity of My loved ones and their occupation with My remembrance and praise, give them from Me the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness, My grace, and My mercy that have encompassed all who dwell in My dominion and kingdom. Thy Lord is, verily, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! If the friends of God who have quaffed the mystic wine and attained recognition of God, exalted be His glory, would manifest fellowship and unity in all lands and regions, assuredly would the Sun of the Cause and its effulgences encompass all created things. Blessed are My loved ones, then blessed are My loved ones who have drunk the wine of steadfastness from the chalice of My bounty and have taken My Book and acted in accordance with what is contained therein of My commandments and My laws. Upon them rest My remembrance, My praise, and My mercy. By My life! The Most Exalted Pen hath testified for them to that whereby their names, their mentions, and their deeds shall endure throughout the eternity of My most excellent names. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Convey to all My greetings, and with the utmost wisdom recite unto them this most mighty, most holy Tablet, that all may rejoice in God’s infinite bounties and observe themselves sanctified and purified from the world’s defilements. Whosoever hath today attained recognition of the Dayspring of verses is recorded among the near ones in the perspicuous Book. This is a Day wherein whatsoever occureth shall never be effaced. O ’Ali! Today is the Day for action. Blessed is the soul that draweth a breath for the sake of God and taketh a step in His path. God willing, all must occupy themselves with the mention of God with complete wisdom and steadfastness, and stand firm in His Cause.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention concerning Mu??afa, who migrated in the path of God and turned toward that place, verily his is the reward of those who aided the Cause of God with their wealth and their souls. To this hath My Most Exalted Pen testified in My Great Tablet. We have sent him a Tablet that he may find therefrom the sweet savors of the bounties of his Lord and be among the patient ones.</p>
<p>And as to what thou didst mention concerning the handmaiden of God who heard My call, turned to the horizon of My grace, drank the choice wine of My love, was exiled in My path, and bore hardships for My Name, verily We have mentioned her in the Tablets and do mention her as a bounty from Our presence, and I am the All-Seeing Witness. O ’Ali! It is incumbent upon all to assist her. My loved ones must honor her dwelling place and show her respect, by My firm and mighty command. God hath seized those who wronged her and will seize those who denied her. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>In regard to what you wrote about the uprising of the souls who have turned towards God and remained steadfast during the days of Ridvan in the gatherings and feasts, it was mentioned and accepted in the Most Holy Court. Blessed is the deed that attaineth His acceptance, blessed the soul that ascendeth unto My Kingdom, blessed the countenance that turneth toward My horizon, blessed the heart that is adorned with My love, and blessed the tongue that uttereth My beautiful praise. The service of all is evident and manifest, and assuredly it hath not been and will never be lost in the sight of God. Blessed are they that act!</p>
<p>Blessed be the people of Baha who have arisen to serve the Cause during the days of Ridvan. Verily their Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing. Blessed are they and the people of Faran whose names were mentioned before the Wronged One in this remote prison. And We make mention of the people of Qaf who have cast aside all else save Me and have clung to the hem of their Lord’s grace, the All-Informed. The fire of oppression was kindled therein. We have left it, in Our wisdom. Verily, He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. By God! He who hath sacrificed himself in My path dwelleth within the precincts of My mercy, witnessing and beholding. The Pen of God, the Lord of all worlds, beareth witness to this.</p>
<p>We make mention of everyone who hath turned unto My horizon, who hath attained the Kawthar of My love and hath held fast unto the cord of My mighty Cause. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee that thou mayest rejoice and be of those who are thankful.</p>
<p>Those souls who have newly turned toward the Realm of Oneness and have drunk from the wine of mystic knowledge are all remembered before His Countenance. We beseech the Most High to assist them, to aid them in His remembrance and praise, and to give them to drink that which will attract their hearts in His days. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>May the glorified and honored master, his eminence Samandar, upon him be the most pure and luminous Glory of God, take note.</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Invincible, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>After praise to Him Who is independent of me and my like, I submit that all the noble letters which were sent to his eminence Jud, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, were presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and answers descended from the heaven of grace and were dispatched. God willing, they will attain unto them.</p>
<p>This servant wrote a letter to his eminence Ibn-i-Asdaq the Most Holy, upon them both be the Glory of God. His honor should make a copy of it, but in such a way that the original letter does not change, meaning it should not become blackened, and they should compare it with utmost care. If his holiness the Name of God Jamal, upon him be the Glory of God, is present, send one copy to him, otherwise send it to his eminence ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of Power, for certain matters have been written therein which today will cause some to become informed.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant has, in most of his petitions, mentioned to the extent possible that which he knew would cause steadfastness and assurance of the friends, and has not, nor will he, fall short to the extent of his capacity. Since in this letter some verses and expressions of the Primal Point, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, have been mentioned, therefore it will not be fruitless if the friends of God take note of it. The assured, steadfast, content and well-pleasing souls must, with perfect kindness and wisdom, convey that which causes the exaltation and ascendancy of the steadfastness of souls.</p>
<p>I beseech God that the servants may, with attentive ears, hearken unto what is contained therein and attain unto the station of the Most Great Martyrdom in such wise that they shall see naught but God, indeed, shall regard all else as non-existent. However, in making the copy they must exercise great care that it matches exactly, and they should send the original letter quickly, for until now six letters have been received from his eminence Ibn-i-Asdaq, upon them both be the Glory of God, and now this one letter has been sent in reply. This servant is ever remiss and has hoped and hopes for forgiveness from all.</p>
<p>Another submission is that you had mentioned Aqa Faraj’u’llah. This was presented in the Most Holy Court, and a special Tablet was revealed and sent. Deliver it to him.</p>
<p>Another submission: A packet arrived from his eminence Ibn-i-Abhar, upon them both be the Glory of God, with several petitions. It is hoped that, God willing, their reply will be sent later. There was one petition from the leaf who is the sister of Sultanu’sh-Shuhada. Its reply was revealed and sent. Deliver it to his eminence Ibn-i-Abhar that he may deliver it.</p>
<p>Another submission: Convey pure greetings on behalf of this evanescent servant to the friends and the gentlemen. This servant hopes that all will arise to serve and make mention and praise of the Beloved of all horizons with perfect unity and harmony. Out of intense love, this servant wishes to mention one by one the gentlemen of that land and the friends of God, but the petition is that he finds no opportunity. For a long time I have wanted to send a mention to the honored master, his eminence Kadkhuda, upon him be the Glory of God, but have not yet been successful. However, since at all times I am occupied with transcribing divine verses and the affairs of the friends in this land, surely all will overlook this evanescent one’s shortcomings.</p>
<p>Further, in service to his eminence the master Aqa Muhammad-Javad, upon him be the Glory of God, even if I submit numerous petitions, I still consider myself remiss. In all conditions the eye of hope is open and the hand of supplication raised.</p>
<p>Another submission from this evanescent one is that I convey with a hundred thousand tongues and utterances pure greetings to the spiritual beloved, namely his eminence my brother, upon him be the Glory of God. All the friends of this land send greetings.</p>
<p>Glory be upon your honor and upon those who have attained to the mention of God, our Beloved and your Beloved and the Beloved of all the worlds. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>Another submission is that the packet of the honored master, his eminence Aqa Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God, also arrived. God willing, may they be blessed by divine grace in all conditions. Some time ago, in the letter of his holiness Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory, mention of them was made by the Tongue of Grandeur, and this servant wrote and sent it, and a Tablet was also specifically revealed for them from the heaven of will, but it has been delayed for some time. God willing, it will be sent in these days, and this servant also hopes to be enabled to submit a reply. The purpose is that if that beloved one writes anything there, convey this evanescent one’s greetings and pure regards.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>Praise be sanctified above the ways of the peoples of the world and the intimations of all who dwell within the realm of possibility, befitting that omnipotent Sovereign Who, through the blessed Word “Pilgrimage to the House is incumbent upon men for the sake of God,” hath in every year so attracted and drawn vast multitudes that they forsake their children, their offspring, their wealth and all they possess, and with a hundred thousand longings and yearnings endure the hardships and calamities of land and sea, of desert and mountain, that they might attain to that Spot which is the object of that blessed Word. Glory be to God! Such is the power of a single Word - how much greater, then, the power of the Lord of the Word, the Sovereign of the Word, the Revealer of the Word, and the Source of the Word! The majesty of God’s Cause hath reached such heights that He hath made a mere stone the point of adoration and the dawning-place of the world’s glory, as all have witnessed and continue to witness. God grant that these acts be founded upon true understanding, for if they proceed from mere imitation, it would be difficult for them to yield their full fruit. For these means, in the eyes of the Manifestations of God, exist so that man might be reminded at all times and be made ready, that should the Divine Will decree, on any day, to send forth one of His Manifestations - that is, one of the Manifestations of His names - none would object or show pride, but would rather reflect upon the power of God and know with absolute certainty that He Who through one exalted Word made a house or stone the object of the world’s adoration, is able to exalt man, who is the greatest talisman and the supreme sign and the source of names, to this most lofty and exalted station.</p>
<p>Now we must reflect with fairness and speak: if today someone were to appear with this station, or one even more exalted, what would the turbaned ones of Persia say, and how would they behave? Would they acknowledge in that blessed Being even the station accorded to a stone, or not? God is My witness that this servant declares with absolute certainty that they would rise in opposition and denial, and ultimately pronounce the sentence of his death, just as was done before, as all have heard. This is not the first flask to be broken, nor the first oppression, nor the first denial to appear on earth. What has been shall be again. The Cause belongs to God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the kingdom of names and before Whose might the limbs of all things tremble! I beseech Thee by the Name which Thou hast made the sovereign of names in the kingdom of eternity, to aid Thy servants to rend asunder the veils. O my Lord! They are Thy servants and Thy creation; they possess nothing of their own except through Thy permission and will. Write down for them, therefore, with Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will draw them nigh unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Creator of the heavens! There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Blessings and peace be upon Thy Prophets, Thy chosen ones, and Thy friends, and upon Him through Whom Thou didst seal the books of laws and the scriptures of religions. May the glory that shineth from the horizon of eternity rest upon those who have cast away the ordinances of self and taken fast hold of that which they were commanded by God, the Lord of all mankind. These are the gems of creation in the sight of the Truth. Upon them rest His blessings, His bounties, and His mercy, which have preceded the worlds. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant has been honored to receive your letter and the trace of your pen, and was thereby gladdened and filled with joy and delight, for it was adorned with the mention of God, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection. God willing, may your honor ever gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon and act according to that which God loves. His honor Haji Muhammad ?adiq, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], arrived in perfect health and well-being, and when the appointed time for the standing was concluded, he received permission to return. He has truly been and continues to be among the steadfast souls. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to strengthen him in steadfastness in His Cause. Praise be to God, he arrived, heard, saw, and attained. Blessed is he, and blessed are those who have attained what he has attained. For each is a portion in the Book.</p>
<p>The conveyance of this lowly one’s greetings to the friends of God depends upon your honor’s wish. I send greetings to the honored master, His honor Haji Muhammad Husayn, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah]. God willing, may he ever drink from the cup of love and be illumined by the lights of His countenance. Glory be upon your honor, upon him, and upon the loved ones of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>Praise and glory befit those immersed in the ocean of detachment who, in the darkness of these days, the oppression of the people, and amidst sorrows descending and griefs and troubles overwhelming, remained not deprived of turning towards the Ocean of Oneness and the Eternal Sun. The veils of names withheld them not from the Lord of all things. They left behind all names and turned to the ocean of inner meanings. These are servants who have drunk, in My Name the Self-Subsisting, of My choice-sealed wine. All else besides God hath ever been and remaineth in their sight as a handful of dust and ashes. Through His Name they were not debarred from its Possessor. They have arisen to champion His Cause with such steadfastness as hath caused the limbs of the opposers of the Bayan to quake. Glorified be His power, exalted be His majesty, and there is none other God but Him.</p>
<p>O thou who gazeth toward My horizon and unfurleth the banner of My victory through wisdom and utterance! I testify that thou hast sought to promote righteousness in all circumstances and hast counseled the servants unto piety and salvation. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath loved thee for My sake and hearkened unto thy word concerning My Cause. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid thee with the hosts of the seen and the unseen. Verily, He is the Protector of those who do good. His mercy hath preceded and His loving-kindness hath encompassed all. Blessed is he who hath been just in His Cause, and blessed is he who hath spoken with equity concerning that which hath been manifested from His presence.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Fadl! Upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy. That which hath come to pass in that land is known and evident. Blessed is He Who hath prevented His chosen ones from corruption, tyranny and unseemly deeds, and hath commanded them to righteousness, uprightness and the fear of God. Praise be to God that ye were slain in His path but slew not. Counsel the loved ones in all circumstances to remain serene and tranquil, to improve the affairs of men, to refine souls, and to be characterized by trustworthiness, faith, chastity and virtue. Verily, We were with thee in Ha and Mim, and thy deeds therein gained the glory of My acceptance and the honor of My good-pleasure, and in the land of Ya in accordance with that which befitteth thee in the Cause of thy Lord, the Inspirer, the Compassionate, the Trustworthy.</p>
<p>Say: O servants! In truth it is spoken and in truth hear ye! God, exalted be His glory, hath ever gazed and continueth to gaze upon the hearts of His servants. All else - whether of land or sea, ornaments or colors - He hath relinquished to kings, sovereigns and rulers, for the banner of “He doeth what He willeth” hath ever shone resplendent before His Manifestation. That which is necessary today is obedience to government and adherence to wisdom. In truth, the reins of preservation, tranquility and assurance outwardly lie within the grasp of governmental authority. Thus hath God willed it and thus hath He ordained it. I swear by the Sun of Truth which shineth from the horizon of the Most Great Prison: One government official is, in the sight of God, more distinguished, more excellent and more merciful than a host of divines. For that soul is occupied day and night in a service conducive to the peace and comfort of the people, while that host is engaged night and day in corruption, rejection, vilification, murder and pillage. For some time now in Iran, His Majesty the Shah - may God, the Blessed, the Most High, assist him - hath protected and continueth to protect these oppressed ones of the world from the evil of such souls. Nevertheless, they have not rested; each day they stir up some sedition and each day some tumult appeareth. It is hoped that one of the kings will, for the sake of God, arise to aid this oppressed community and thereby attain unto everlasting remembrance and eternal praise. God hath prescribed for this community the aid of those who help them, service to them, and faithfulness to their covenant. This community must arise under all conditions to serve their helper and ever hold fast to the cord of fidelity. Blessed is he who heareth and acteth, and woe unto those who forsake.</p>
<p>O Pen! Leave off all mention, trusting in God, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal. Then make mention of him who ascended to the Supreme Companion with a crimson visage and was consumed by the fire of love in the City of Love, and say:</p>
<p>The first fragrance wafting from the musk of inner meanings and utterance be upon thee, O thou who didst sacrifice thy soul in the path of the All-Merciful! I testify that thou didst cast away idle fancies and didst turn with the light of certitude to the Dawning-Place of inspiration, and the attraction of the Call drew thee to the supreme horizon in days wherein the fire of hatred blazed in the breasts of those who cast away godliness and denied God’s proof, the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below. I beseech Thee, O Thou the Desire of the world, by this blood which was shed in Thy love, to forgive Thy servants who have been faithful to Thy Covenant and Testament and have acknowledged that which Thou didst reveal in Thy perspicuous Book. Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds!</p>

The comprehension of the peoples of the world cannot attain unto Him, and the thoughts of nations cannot reach His presence. He is sanctified from whatsoever is bounded by limits and from the existent Word. Glory be unto God! The possessors of knowledge, arts, wisdom and learning are powerless and incapable of comprehending His Word, how much less His Essence, blessed and exalted is He! It hath been proven with certainty that His Essence is sanctified from all knowledge and His Being is exalted above all mention. He is the Single, the One, the Unique, the Self-Subsisting Who cannot be described by utterance. He is the All-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>O loved ones of the All-Merciful! Over the years mention of you and your letters repeatedly reached this Wronged One, but there was delay in responding, for from every direction the fire of hatred was ablaze. One Who hath borne all tribulations for the reformation of the world hath been called a mischief-maker. God is My witness and all things testify that My tongue hath not spoken save in His remembrance, My will hath not sought save His Will, and My purpose hath not clung save to His Purpose. His Will hath been beloved of My soul and still is. This verse was well-spoken aforetime:</p>
<p>If He bestoweth the pearl of grace, behold, hearts are Its shell;</p>
<p>If He sendeth the arrow of affliction, behold, souls are Its target.</p>
<p>In all conditions We seek His good-pleasure and beseech His favors.</p>
<p>At this time his honor ’Aziz forwarded the letter of his honor Mashhadi Javad and sought the Wronged One’s bounty on behalf of the friends in that land. We therefore make mention of all of them in this Tablet and beseech God, exalted be His Glory, to aid each one to such deeds as may be recorded and preserved in the Book of divine knowledge. Say: O God, O Self-Sufficient One, O Generous One, O Merciful One, O King, O Sovereign! All are Thy servants, and through Thy Word they have been brought from nothingness into being. They acknowledge their poverty before Thy wealth, their ignorance before Thy knowledge, their weakness before Thy power, and their impotence before Thy sovereignty. O Generous One! Deprive us not of the showers from the heaven of Thy mercy, and withhold us not from the waves of the ocean of Thy grace. These saplings of existence have been planted by the hand of Thy providence. Now is the time for growth and development, awaiting the April showers of Thy bounty and the springtime of Thy generosity - now and forever. Deny us not the water, from which all things are made alive. The signs of Thy generosity were witnessed before, and are now manifest and visible, in both the near and far, the obedient and the rebellious. Thus it is proven that Thy generosity hath no bounds, Thy forgiveness no pause, and Thy bounty is never withheld from created things. At all times the signs of Thy infinite grace have been and are witnessed by the eyes of justice and fairness. Before the ocean of forgiveness, the transgressions of these servants are not mentioned, and in the realm of wealth and abundance, the poverty and need of these servants count as naught. We beseech the wonders of Thy gifts and have raised the hands of supplication to the court of Thy majesty. O Forgiving One! Pardon us through Thy bounty. O Concealer! Cover us through Thy grace. O All-Bountiful! Withhold not Thy favors. We are sinners, yet we are Thine - deprive us not. We are remote, yet we yearn for the carpet of Thy nearness and are suppliants - reject us not. Thou art the Guide and the Bestower of gifts. There is none other God but Thee, the Lord of the throne and earth, the Ruler of the hereafter and this world.</p>
<p>O Generous One! Upon Thee be my glory! The friends in that land have each been blessed with the traces of the Wronged One’s Pen. Convey to all My greetings and remind them of the recorded mentions, that perchance the seed that hath been sown by the hand of divine providence in that land may bear fruit and be blessed with the holy words “Blessed be God, the Best of Creators.” And those souls who have been newly illumined by the lights of the Sun of Divine Unity have ever been and shall ever be remembered. We beseech from God, exalted be His glory, confirmation for all. Verily, He is the Confirmer, the All-Knowing, and He is the Powerful, the Generous. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Great.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station! Glory and majesty! My spirit and soul be a sacrifice unto thee! According to the words of him who said: “The heart is before Thee; ask it about its condition.” The All-Knowing, the All-Informed beareth witness that in most times I am occupied with thy remembrance and am gladdened and rejoiced by thy soul-refreshing utterances. We beseech God to aid thee in all conditions and assist thee in His remembrance and praise and the promotion of His Cause amongst His servants.</p>
<p>My utmost care, from its very source, towards thee is evident and manifest and needeth no mention or explanation. God willing, thou shouldst adorn the loved ones of God and the seekers of the path of unity and detachment with the ornament of divine remembrance. Be not grieved by separation. A nearness hath been ordained for thee which no remoteness can affect. Verily, He is the Friend of him who hath detached himself in His love and turned to Him with a luminous countenance.</p>
<p>Convey greetings from this evanescent servant to all the loved ones of God. Those who circle round the sanctuary of mystic knowledge all send their greetings. I send boundless greetings to thy honored son. I hope that through divine grace and favor he may be assisted and confirmed in his youth to serve the Cause and to serve thee, for the rights of parents are most great in the sight of the Beloved, especially in this matter wherein they have placed great emphasis. We beseech God to record him among those who circle round His Cause and gaze upon His countenance throughout the duration of His kingdom and dominion. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.</p>
<p>They have bidden me write to thee that, God willing, thou shouldst, with complete reliance upon God and detachment from all else, through His might and power, proceed with the utmost joy and fragrance. I beseech God to grant thee such confirmation that thou mayest, through divine assistance, gladden and rejoice those who thirst in the desert of separation with the pure waters of the Friend’s remembrance. The Friend is ever occupied with the mention of the friends of the All-Merciful and the seekers of the heaven of the All-Glorious, to such extent that in the extremity of hardship and affliction, or joy and ease, their remembrance is never cut off from His tongue.</p>
<p>All must walk among men with goodly attributes and praiseworthy character, holding fast with complete sincerity and perfect piety. The best garment hath ever been and will ever be the garment of piety. Blessed is the soul that hath attained thereunto and is numbered among the God-fearing. Reprehensible deeds have ever been and will ever be rejected. All must conduct themselves in such wise as to become trusted and reliable to all on earth. This is the station of the people of truth, and after truth there is naught but error.</p>
<p>Say: O friends! Occupy yourselves with the reformation of the world through wisdom and utterance. This is the station of man. Corruption, conflict and contention have never been and are not the station of the people of truth. Rather, ye should purify and illumine hearts with the burnishing of the Beloved’s remembrance. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and transgress not His counsels. I swear by the Most Great Name that He hath never desired and will never desire for you aught save that which will endure with God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, prevent the friends from turning towards this spot, for the situation in this land is difficult and arduous. Let all be occupied at all times with the service of the Truth. This is the fruit of existence in this promised and appointed Day. Praise the Beloved of the worlds that through His grace and favor He did not deprive thee, and thou didst drink from the waters of nearness and reunion. Thou art among those souls who have ever been and will ever be in His sight. Therefore give thanks and be of the grateful ones.</p>
<p>Say: O My loved ones! Hearken unto My call. Beware lest ye associate partners with God, and beware lest ye follow the cawing of those who are heedless of the Truth and claim what God hath not permitted them. And beware lest ye commit that whereby the sanctity of His Cause would be diminished among His servants. This is the essence and greatest of counsels - that ye follow God’s command and follow not the heedless ones.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is incumbent upon each of the loved ones to read the Tablet of Malla?u’l-Quds, which was revealed before the migration from Iraq, and to reflect upon it, that they may understand what hath appeared or will appear thereafter from what was recorded beforehand. Blessed are they who understand. All the tribulations that have befallen were inscribed in that blessed Tablet beforehand. Read it and reflect upon it, O ye who are endued with understanding.</p>
<p>I beseech the True One, exalted be He, not to deprive thee of His eternal holy realms and to ordain for thee in all worlds that which beseemeth His generosity and befitteth His sovereignty. By My life and thine, this is not difficult for God. Therefore praise and be of those who render thanks, and say: All praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the Manifest, the Speaker, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!</p>
<p>Glorified be He Who hath appeared with the truth and hath come from the heaven of utterance with a mighty proof, and hath spoken before the faces of the world. The hidden hath been revealed and that which was concealed hath come with a luminous light. He hath aided His Cause through the movement of His Most Exalted Pen and hath taken no helper unto Himself. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful. Blessed is he who hath heard the Call and answered his Lord, and woe unto him who hath clung to vain imaginings, turning away from the certain Truth.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! There hath come before the Wronged One the letter thou didst send to Asad, who circled round Me and sought My presence and took for himself a station in My prison. Majdu’d-Din read it before My face. We have answered thee with a Tablet that calleth out with the most exalted call: “O concourse of creation! There hath appeared that which hath rolled up the carpet of every learned one and hath caused the hearts of every remote ignorant one to quake.” Verily, he who hath heard the Call is among the people of Baha in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. We have mentioned thee before with a mention which God hath made a treasure for thee in the Kingdom, to which the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, doth testify. Grieve not over the incidents and affairs of the world. There hath been ordained for thee from My Most Exalted Pen that which hath brought joy to the hearts of them that are nigh. Had the world any worth before God, the Wronged One would not have been imprisoned in this mighty fortress, nor would the Point of the Bayan have been suspended in the air, nor would the Spirit have been afflicted among the Jews. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken as a favor from Him unto thee. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! We were in the land of Ta [Tihran] under chains and fetters for successive months, and in the abode of Mar [Mazindaran] in the hands of the oppressors. Were I to recount to thee what befell Me, thou wouldst lament with the lamentation of the bereft. We have concealed what hath befallen Us lest the cry of them that are nigh and the wailing of the sincere should be raised. When thou hast drunk the choice wine of My utterance from the cup of My bounty and art seized by the rapture of My call, say: My God, my God! I have longed for Thy nearness, and desired to appear before Thy face, to hearken to the scratching of Thy Pen, to behold Thy most exalted horizon and the seat of Thy Most Glorious Throne. Days and nights have passed, yet mine eyes have not been gladdened, mine ears have not been blessed, and my heart hath not rejoiced. My God, my God! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, turning away from all else. Hast Thou ordained, O my Best-Beloved, my drawing nigh unto the court of Thy oneness and my presence before Thy face, or dost Thou desire to record for me the reward of meeting Thee as a bounty from Thee and a mercy from Thy presence? O Lord! Thou seest what is in my heart and hearest my sighing, my crying and my lamentation in Thy days. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds and Goal of the nations, to ordain for me that which shall be a light unto me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. I testify, O my God, to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and to that which hath descended from the heaven of Thy Will in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures, Thy Scrolls and Thy Tablets. I bear witness that through Thy Most Exalted Word the near ones have soared to the atmosphere of Thy nearness and the sincere ones to the horizon of Thy grace, and through it the river of mercy hath flowed between Thy servants and the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen hath been raised among Thy creation. I beseech Thee by the blood of the lovers and the cry of the yearning ones and the rapture of the hearts of the unitarians to ordain for me in every world of Thy worlds that which shall benefit me and draw me nigh unto Thee. By Thy glory, O Goal of the world! I desire naught but what Thou desirest, and I love naught but what Thou lovest, for I know not what shall profit me and bring me near to Thee. Thou art verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O Lord! Ordain for me through Thy grace and bounty the best of the hereafter and the former life. Verily Thou art the Lord of all mankind and the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Thus hath the Wronged One spoken and mentioned God, thy Lord, with the tongue of thy heart. This is naught but a great favor from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And We make mention of Muhammad who hath attained unto My remembrance and heard My call and held fast unto the cord of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Give him the glad-tidings of My mention of him, then recite unto him what hath been sent down from the heaven of the bounty of his Lord, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful. We have mentioned every name that was in thy letter. We beseech God to aid them in that which He loveth and is pleased with, to remind them of His signs, and to grant them what hath been sent down from the heaven of His bounty. He is verily the Most Merciful of the merciful. And We make mention of My handmaiden whom thou didst mention in thy letter, who desired to be remembered in the court of My glory and the pavilion of My majesty and the tabernacles of My grandeur. We have mentioned her as a bounty from Our presence and given her the glad-tidings of My tender mercy which hath encompassed the world. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have heard the call and responded, and upon those women who have heard and believed in God, the Single, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Great.</p>

<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou knowest and seest what hath befallen Thy chosen ones in the days of Thy Manifestation, and Thou beholdest what they have borne for love of Thee and for Thy good-pleasure. O Lord! The chronicles of the world proclaim the abasement of Thy loved ones and the might of Thy enemies, and the books of nations testify to the weakness of Thy chosen ones and the strength of those who have denied Thy signs. Thou hearest, O my God, in this hour my prayers and my remembrance and my supplications through those who are nigh unto Thee among Thy creation and the sincere ones among Thy creatures. By Thy glory, O Sovereign of the Kingdom of Might and Dominion! I am certain that abasement in Thy path is a glory that cannot be compared with the glory of those in the world, and that the fire of Thy love is a light that cannot be obscured by the veils of nations. Even should I, O my God, at every hour drink from the hands of the enemies the cup of destiny, the thirst of my longing and my yearning would not be quenched. Verily, he who hath drunk the choice wine of Thy love and hath been seized with the intoxication of the wine of Thy knowledge, nothing on earth can dismay him, nor can any matter distract him from gazing toward the horizon of Thy manifestation, Thy Most Glorious Beauty, and Thy most exalted and sublime station. My Most Exalted Pen desireth at all times to raise its whispering and its cry and its lamentation in this calamity by which the denizens of Paradise and the dwellers of the highest Paradise have wailed, and it hath reached such a state that the tongue of the Manifestation of Thy Cause, and the Ocean of Thy knowledge, and the Dawning-Place of Thy revelation bewaileth it, in manifestation of His grace and mercy and faithfulness.</p>
<p>O Letter ?a! Thou art in the most exalted Paradise, thy head adorned with the crown of thy Lord’s favor, the Lord of all names, while Thy loved ones are in such grief that the clouds weep for them night and day. Wilt thou unveil the face of Thy Cause, or conceal it as thy Lord hath concealed it, in His wisdom? Verily thy Lord is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing. Thou art the one through whom the Most Great Sacrifice was manifested and its decree established among the nations. O Letter ?a! By God, through thee the horizon of faithfulness dawned and that was manifested whereby the Cause of God, Creator of the heavens, was spread abroad. Blessed is the eye that hath wept for thy calamities, and the ear that hath heard thy praise, and the face that hath turned toward thee, and the soul that hath hastened until it reached thy resting-place - the spot honored by thy noble body and thy sacred and glorious temple. By the life of God! Hearts have melted at thy calamity and livers have been rent asunder at thy tribulation.</p>
<p>O Land of ?ad! I adjure thee by the Beloved to tell me whether the fragrance of the Beloved One hath been cut off from thee - that fragrance whereby the scent of the garment was diffused among the people of holiness - and whether He lieth cast down beneath the talons of every oppressor who hath denied God and His signs and turned away from His countenance and His sovereignty. O Breeze of ?ad! Hast thou come from the Beloved to the loved ones with tidings whereby spirits are gladdened, or with news whereby hearts are melted? O breeze of my land and my soul! I find not in thee the fragrance of one who loved Me, as though he hath soared from the branch of the world to the Most Exalted Companion and the Most Glorious Horizon. O My Name! Blessed is the eye that hath wept for thy calamities, whereby the Letter ?a crieth out in the land of ?aff saying: “O Letter ?a! By thy life, through thy calamity my calamities and my sorrows and my grief and my tribulation have been renewed.”</p>
<p>O Land of the City! Remember what befell him and his brother when they appeared before the gathering of the oppressors who found not the fragrance of justice and rose up in tyranny. By God! Through them was established the Word of God which issued from the mouth of the Divine Will upon the throne of manifestation. He spoke, and His word is the truth: “I and those in Paradise, by the Most Great Truth, yearn for a soul that hath been slain in His path.” Thus did the Truth speak, and that which was hidden in God’s knowledge was revealed. My tongue beareth witness in the kingdom of Mine utterance that they were martyred in My path, and for them did My heart and My Pen lament, as did those who circle round My throne and soar in the atmosphere of My nearness and drink the choice wine of My favors from the hand of My bounty. O My Name and My Name! Though the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Glorious Pavilion have lamented your tragedy, yet doth the Wronged One praise and thank God for having aided you to recognize the Dawning-Place of His Cause and for having elevated your station to such a degree that His Most Exalted Pen grieveth for you in this Most Sublime Station. Blessed is the soul that hath turned unto you, and the heart that hath won your love, and the seeker who hath sought your abode, and the one who hath entered your land and held fast unto your cord and visited your resting-place. By the life of God! They are among the triumphant and they are among those who are near unto God in His mighty and exalted Book. Praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Verily we are God’s, and verily unto Him shall we return.</p>

<p>O Muhammad! The Wronged One beareth witness to that which the Books of God have testified before and after, that there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He hath sent down the Books and dispatched the Messengers for the guidance of His creation. Verily, He is the Powerful over what He willeth, and He is the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>Thy letter reached the presence of the Wronged One and attained the honor of being presented. We read it until We came upon the mention of one of God’s loved ones, whereupon the ocean of forgiveness surged and the fragrance of the Most Merciful’s loving-kindness was diffused. We arose, turning toward the Kaaba of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, and We took hold of the hem of His mercy with hands of supplication, and beseeched from the ocean of His grace and the heaven of His bestowal that He admit him into the highest Paradise and send down upon him, at all times, mercy from His presence and grace from His own Self. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O My Pen! Say: O ’Ali, blessed art thou, for My Most Exalted Pen hath moved to make mention of thee on this morn which reflecteth the light of the countenance of God, the Lord of the worlds. I bear witness that thou didst hear the Call and didst turn to the Supreme Companion, and didst acknowledge that which was sent down from God in His Books, His Scriptures, and His Tablets. We bear witness that thou didst drink the cup of meeting from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the Lord of all beings and the King of the Kingdom of Names, and didst attain to that which the near ones and the sincere ones have attained.</p>
<p>We beseech God to aid His servants and His loved ones to remember thee and to remember thy days and what was manifested from thee in thy love for God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Blessed is he who draweth nigh unto thy resting-place and visiteth thee, by virtue of what hath been sent down for thee from the heaven of thy Lord’s gracious will.</p>
<p>O Mustafa! Upon thee be the peace of God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Names. We have turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison and have mentioned thee in such wise that all remembrance hath bowed down before it. We bear witness once again unto him who hath ascended to the Supreme Companion that he is indeed of the people of Baha and among the companions of the Crimson Ark.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Thou art in the highest Paradise while the Wronged One remembereth thee in the prison of ’Akka, and remembereth the days of thy presence and thy meeting, and the love which took from thy grasp the reins of patience and forbearance, and brought thee time and again to this place wherein the Call hath been raised morning and evening. Blessed art thou, O ’Ali, and joy be unto thee, O ’Ali! By My life, My Pen loveth to make mention of thee throughout the nights and days, and to recount what befell thee and what was manifested from thee in these days wherein sorrows have encompassed Us through what the hands of the oppressors have wrought in the land of Ya and in the land of Ta.</p>
<p>O Mustafa! Upon thee be the glory of the Lord of Names. Read what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an. Mighty is His utterance and exalted His proof: “Until, when they rejoiced in that which they were given, We seized them unawares, and lo, thy Lord is ever watchful.” Convey My greetings unto the faces of My loved ones and remind them of what hath appeared from My presence. We testify that they stand before My face, praising and thanking God for having guided them to His straight path and His mighty Message.</p>
<p>We desired to console and comfort him who was named ’Ali and who was with him during the days and nights. It behooveth Us to mention what befell Muhammad, the Apostle of God, aforetime. When his sons Qasim and Ibrahim ascended unto God, the deniers arose in derision and mockery. Thereupon Gabriel came from his Lord, the Glorious, and recited this blessed verse: “Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of this world. But the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lord’s sight for reward, and better in respect of hope.”</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Upon thee be My peace and My glory. Praise be to God that he hath ascended to a station beyond the reach of the hands of limitation and reckoning. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having raised him to the Supreme Companion and caused him to enter the Most Exalted Paradise, and for having sent down for him that which the treasuries of the kingdom of creation cannot equal. I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of the Kingdom of Names and the Creator of heaven, to grant me and Thy servants the ability to remember Thee and to praise Thee, and to aid me in Thy love and Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Mustafa! O thou who hast dawned from the horizon of faithfulness! Upon thee be the peace of God, the Lord of Names. It behooveth Us and thee and the loved ones to beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect His Majesty the Sul?an and to aid him with the hosts of the unseen and the visible.

Through Him the Sun hath shone forth from the horizon of glory and the Moon of the Cause hath appeared from this sanctified and luminous heaven. Through Him God’s appointed time hath been fulfilled, His proof perfected, His evidence made manifest, and His countenance hath appeared from behind the veil with clear authority.</p>
<p>Say: By God, the Truth is illumined by Him even as the day is illumined by the sun, if ye be of them that know. The Holy Spirit hath circled round Him, and the Tree hath cried out within His breast that He, verily, is God; there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. Through Him paradise and hell-fire have appeared for those who draw nigh and those who turn away.</p>
<p>Say: By God, through but one letter from Him the Balance hath been established, the Path laid down, and the Ancient Beauty hath appeared from the City of God, the Most High, the All-Knowing. Through Him the distant one hath been guided to the fountain of nearness, and every sick and ailing one made whole.</p>
<p>Say: He is the Sovereign of kings and the Merciful to the downtrodden. He giveth dominion to whom He willeth and taketh it from whom He willeth, and He, verily, is the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>Say: We have believed in God and in what hath been sent down unto us and what hath been sent down unto His Messengers and His chosen ones, if ye be of them that bear witness, and in what was sent down aforetime unto ’Ali of wondrous and glorious verses. To all this my Pen, my tongue, my outward being and my inward reality bear witness before God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear God and look not to the world and its ornaments, but look unto this glorious and radiant Scene. Know ye that the world and all that is therein shall perish, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the King, the Mighty, the Peerless, the Beauteous.</p>
<p>O my companion! Bear thou witness to that whereunto God hath testified for His Own Self, and be not of the doubters. Hold fast unto the cord of God and His love, then detach thyself from those who have disbelieved and turned away after the clear proofs came unto them from every near direction.</p>
<p>Know thou that the idolaters desired to change God’s Cause through my imprisonment in this distant land. Say: By God, evil is that which ye have imagined within yourselves. God shall, through this, exalt His Cause and manifest His sovereignty and elevate His power between the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Say: Nations like unto you imagined as ye have imagined aforetime, and God cut off their roots with justice and raised up His Cause with truth to such a station that the hands of the idolaters were powerless to reach it. By God, were the idolaters to put Us to death at every moment with a torment unprecedented and unparalleled in all creation, yet would they find Us patient and thankful through God’s might and power. He bestoweth patience upon whomsoever He willeth among His believing servants.</p>
<p>If people would but ponder what hath passed of God’s ways with His near-serving ones, they would recognize the mysteries of the Cause in these days. But they have been veiled therefrom by the misery that hath overcome them in these fleeting days.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear God Who created you by His command, and deny not the signs of God when they are sent down unto you with truth, and be not of the idolaters. Say: If ye deny these verses, by what proof did ye establish your faith in Muhammad, the Apostle of God, aforetime, if ye be of the just? Is one who standeth upon clear proof from God like unto one who hath turned away and disbelieved? What aileth you, O company of the remote ones?</p>
<p>Hearken then, O people, unto that wherewith this servant doth remind you. Be not veiled from God, your Creator, and deprive not yourselves of His grace and mercy, and be not of the losers.</p>
<p>Say: God is the Creator of all things, and He, verily, hath power over all things. Say: God is the Provider of all things, and all return unto Him. Say: God is the Helper of all things, and all are directed unto Him. Say: God is the Revealer of all things, and all are looking unto Him. In His hand is the dominion of all things and the empire of creation and command, and He, verily, is wise concerning all things. In His hand are the measures of all things. He ordereth the matter as He pleaseth and sendeth down mercy upon whomsoever He willeth of His creation, and He, verily, doeth what He willeth.</p>
<p>Thus have We cast upon thee in truth from the verses of God, the Mighty, the Peerless, and We have sent unto thee this luminous and pearly Shirt that thou mayest inhale from it the fragrance of love, that thy eyes may be solaced, thy heart gladdened, thy soul assured, and that thou mayest abide in manifest love.</p>

Say: O people, fear God and contend not with His servant, and be not of the wrongdoers. And whoso disputeth with God and His signs, him do all who dwell in the heavens and earth curse. O people, answer the call of God among you and cast not His proof behind your backs. Fear ye the Day whereon all creatures shall be shaken, save those who have entered beneath the shadow of His countenance - these shall be of those that are secure. By God the Truth! Whoso wavereth in this Cause, his faith shall not be accepted though he bring the worship of both worlds. Whoso worshippeth God in these days while remaining heedless of His Manifestation and His sovereignty, upon him shall be pronounced the judgment passed upon the followers of former religions, for they made mention of God and worshipped Him yet knew Him not, and thereby their works were rendered vain and they were among the losers. Nay, this is an even greater heedlessness, for he hath recognized God’s bounty, then denied it. Thus do We impart unto thee that whereby thou mayest in these days distinguish between the two parties, and choose for thyself that which is best for thee, and be possessed of clear insight. Purify thy heart for the knowledge of thy Lord, thine ear for hearkening unto that which is sent down from Him, and thine eyes for that which appeareth from the direction of a mighty throne. Were anyone today to possess all the treasures of the heavens and earth and expend them in the path of God, it would not equal a single letter of that which hath been sent down in truth on this day, for by it doth God create creation as He willeth, even as He created in former ages. And when this Tablet reacheth thee, receive it with hands of contentment, then read it in those times wherein thou findest thyself detached from all that hath been created between the heavens and earth. Thus have We commanded thee through Our grace, that thou mayest be of them that act. Know thou moreover that in these days, when intoxication hath seized all who dwell in the heavens and earth, it beseemeth not them who have believed to remain seated in their places. Rather, it behooveth every soul to convey the Cause of his Lord unto His servants. Thus hath the sun of divine command dawned from the horizon of wisdom from One Who is knowing, wise. Say: O people, convey God’s Cause with wisdom, not disputation, that the people may become aware of that which hath appeared and shone forth from the direction of the Throne. Whoso believeth, it shall be to his own benefit; and whoso turneth away shall return to his abode - evil indeed is the abode of them that turn away. O servant! Guard thyself at all times from the arrows of them who have disbelieved in the All-Merciful and were among the idolaters.</p>
<p>Say: Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst cause me to hear Thy Call, and didst make known unto me the Manifestation of Thyself, and didst inspire me with Thy remembrance, and didst strengthen me through Thy Cause, that Thou leave me not to myself in these days, for I have clung to Thy Name, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. O my God! Look upon me, then, with the glances of the eyes of Thy favors, and deprive me not of the wonders of Thy grace and bounties, and make me not of those who believed in Thee one day and disbelieved another day and were among the perished ones. O Lord! I am he who hath raised the hands of hope toward the heaven of Thy mercy and bounty, and hath fled from all directions and entered beneath the shadow of Thy Cause and Thy generosity. Therefore, O my God, leave me not disappointed of the wonders of Thy grace, nor deprived of the manifestations of Thy tenderness. Verily, Thou hast power over all things. Then make me steadfast, O my God, in Thy Cause wherein none can stand firm save him who hath detached himself from all else except Thee. Then preserve me, O my God, lest I associate any partners with Thee, or dispute Thy signs, or contend against Thy Self. Verily, Thou art the Bestower, the Forgiver, the Merciful. Then open Thou my eyes, O my God, that I may know Thee through Thyself, not through aught else of what hath been created between the heavens and earth. Thus have We commanded thee and taught thee that thou mayest remember thy Lord thereby and be of them that remember. And glory be upon thee and upon those who have turned with all their being unto God and have detached themselves from all the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Songster upon the Branch of Eternity!</p>
<p>This is a Book which calleth aloud in the world and summoneth all peoples to the Most Great Name, whereby the hearts of the Concourse on High were attracted and the hearts of them that denied God, the Creator of heaven, were perturbed. O thou who art present before the Countenance! Recount unto the people of cities and lands that which thou hast witnessed and heard, when thou didst take for thyself in the Pavilions of Grandeur a station that was exalted in the name of God. Say: O people of the Furqan! The All-Merciful hath come with a sovereignty before which the hosts of earth and heaven cannot stand. This is attested by the Mother Book which speaketh in the final abode and proclaimeth: The appointed time hath come, and the Revealer of verses hath come from the horizon of might with a Cause before which have bowed the necks of those who established for themselves beneath the shadow of vain imaginings a station that was, from time immemorial, rejected through justice. Beware lest the contingencies of idle fancies withhold you from His Name, the Self-Subsisting. Cast away vain imaginings! The Lord of all beings hath appeared with a sovereignty that was witnessed in truth. The Fire speaketh from the Lote-Tree, and the Light hath shone forth from this Horizon which was known by the name of God. This is a Day wherein the divine Hill hath attained the presence of God and the call hath been raised from all things: The Spot hath been adorned through the advent of the Lord of all beings. Blessed art thou, O Land of Syria! The Morn of Manifestation hath breathed within thee, and thereby hath the fragrance of God been diffused throughout all else. Blessed is he who hath cast away that which the people possess and hath taken for himself a path unto Him. In this moment the cry of Zion hath been raised and Mount Carmel rejoiceth at the sea of attainment. Thus hath the matter been decreed through grace. O Carmel! Thou didst taste the poison of separation through ages and centuries; now the honey of reunion hath come unto thee, inasmuch as the Countenance of the Ancient of Days hath turned toward thee from this direction which was recorded in the Mother Book by the Pen of the All-Merciful. The rapture of the utterance hath seized all created things. Blessed is the one whom neither the might of any oppressor nor the ascendancy of any aggressor hath weakened. He is of the people of Baha who were mentioned by the tongue of God in the Qayyumu’l-Asma’. This is a Tablet that hath been sent down in truth and hath given the world the glad-tidings of the manifestation of the Ancient of Days. Blessed is he who hath hearkened and hastened to a station that was illumined by the lights of His countenance. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken, and there hath appeared that which was hidden from the people, save whom God willeth. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>O Abdul-Baqi! The countenance of the Ever-Abiding hath at this moment turned towards thee and maketh mention of that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of all worlds. We bear witness that thou didst attain unto His presence on this Day and didst turn unto God at a time when every heedless and remote soul had turned away from Him. And We testify that thou didst seek after the Ultimate Goal and the Most Exalted End, and God aided thee through the agencies of the heavens and earth until thou didst arrive upon the shore of the ocean of grandeur and didst attain unto that which had been recorded by the Pen of Revelation in the Books of the Messengers. Thou art he whom the clamour of the people did not frighten, nor did the might of those who denied the Day of Judgment hold thee back. Thou didst purpose, depart, and hasten until thou didst attain unto a place wherein the call of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, was raised. Blessed be thine eye for what it beheld and thine ear for what it heard. When thou didst arrive in the Land of Ta, it was the hope of them that are nigh unto God that thou wouldst stand before the Hands of the Cause of God, convey My glorification unto them on My behalf, and give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness, My grace and My mercy that have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. We have not mentioned their names, in accordance with the wisdom from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Then make mention of My loved ones in that place, who have cast away what the people possess and taken hold of that which they were bidden in the Book of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Say: This is the Day of Victory, did ye but know it, and this is the Day of remembrance and praise. Blessed is he who hath uttered that which he was commanded in My Preserved Tablet, wherein have been sent down the mysteries of what hath been and what will be. Say: This is the Day whereon the Temple of Revelation was established upon the throne of Sinai, yet most of the people do not understand. Say: This is the Day of Utterance, did ye but comprehend it, and this is the Day of distinction, would ye but judge with fairness. This is the Day whereon the Ark of the Bayan sailed upon the ocean of divine knowledge through this blessed, mighty and beloved Name. Say: O people of the earth! Beware lest the veils of glory hold you back from My Name, the Self-Subsisting, and beware lest names hold you back from God, the Possessor of this manifest station. Aid your Lord through the wisdom wherewith ye have been commanded in the Tablets of God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Beloved. Then make mention of My greetings unto thy family and those who are with thee, and recount unto them what thou hast heard from the tongue of God, the Possessor of the unseen and the seen. Thus hath the fragrance of utterance been wafted when the Tongue spoke forth from this praiseworthy station. The glory from Our presence be upon thee and upon those who have quaffed the choice wine of divine knowledge from the chalice of the bounty of God, the Lord of dominion and the Kingdom.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted! This is the Shore of Immortality - hearken thou unto that which is revealed from the Most Sublime Retreat. Verily, there is none other God but Him. He hath created all contingent beings through His pre-existent knowledge of what was and what shall be, and taught them the ways of righteousness by sending unto them the Messengers of the Cause with a mighty revealed Book wherein He ordained holy laws and determined the destinies of all who dwell in the heavens and on earth according to a fixed measure.</p>
<p>Among them was Moses, whom He sent with the truth, with nine clear signs, to herald unto the people a station of glorious dignity. He returned with his kindred until he entered the wilderness of Sinai, where he heard the call from the Most Sublime Retreat: “O Moses! Cast off the two sandals of desire, then walk upon the holy, beloved carpet. This is the Land of Immortality, the Valley of Paradise near Iraq, wherein that which was kindled from the Tree of God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting, was blessed.” And he called the people unto God, the Most High, and drew them nigh unto the Shore whereat melted the hearts of those who dwelt in the pavilions of eternity in the blessed spot, entering therein by God’s leave.</p>
<p>When Moses cast off the sandals of allusion and detached himself unto God, then did God call unto him from the holy Tree amidst the flames of fire: “O Moses! Verily, I am God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” “Cast down thy staff!” He cast it down and lo! by God’s command it became a serpent that sought to devour all in the heavens and earth. Thus was it decreed for him in holy Paran, that perchance the people might be mindful in the days of their Lord. Then did the Hand of Power emerge from the Bosom of Knowledge, whereupon the light shone forth and illumined all who dwell in the dominion of command and creation, would ye but understand.</p>
<p>“Go forth, O Moses, with My proof unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, remind them of the lights of divine unity, and give them glad tidings of the paradise of immortality, that they may incline toward the direction of the Throne. Say: This is My path, walk ye therein, O ye who stand still!” When he came unto Pharaoh, he said: “I am God’s Messenger, I have come to you from the cities of immortality with the tidings of the Spirit, would ye but perceive.” Pharaoh said: “O Moses! Who is thy Lord?” He replied: “He Who created the heavens and earth, and brought you forth from a handful of aged clay.” Pharaoh turned to his chiefs and said: “Verily, the messenger sent unto you is surely mad, and he desireth naught but to cause corruption in the land and to scatter you asunder, would ye but know.” They denied God’s signs and turned away from them until the flood overtook them, and they were drowned.</p>
<p>And among them was Jesus, whom God strengthened with the Spirit and sent with the truth. He said: “O people! Fear God and follow not the ways of those who transgressed against God, and walk not in the paths of those who are oppressors. O people! Follow him who calleth you unto God and asketh no recompense or thanks from you. O people! Believe in God and associate not anything with Him, this is better for you, would ye but know.” They said: “We will not follow one who knoweth not God” - these were the lies that issued from their mouths, would ye but understand. They denied him without right and desired to slay him; then did he depart from them and migrate unto God, as ye read in the Book. His days were fulfilled until Muhammad, the Messenger of God, came with beloved signs.</p>
<p>Say: “O people! Fear God and follow not those who disbelieved and associated partners with God, and took idols as protectors besides God, would ye but know. O people! I am but a bearer of glad tidings of God’s good-pleasure unto you, that I might bring you nigh unto Him. O people of the earth, fear ye God! O people! Recognize the worth of these days and answer God’s Caller amongst you, divide not the signs, and enter beneath the shadow of the Divine Countenance.” But his people denied him and believed not in him, saying: “Thou art but a madman.” Thus do We relate unto thee from the true stories that thou mayest be steadfast in thy love for thy Lord and firm in the religion of God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>His days were fulfilled until ’Ali before Muhammad came, whereupon all who were on earth arose and disputed with him without right, and warred against him such that they visited upon him and his companions that which they could not bear to hear. Thus know thou those who were aforetime and those who today persist in oppression. The curse of God be upon the curse of God be upon those who did wrong and upon those who wrong on that day. The Spirit, the Light, and Glory be upon thee and upon those who at all times place their trust in their Lord.</p>
<p>Then glorify thou the countenances of those women who are with thee and convey unto them the glad tidings of God, the Mighty, the Holy.</p>

<p>This is a Book from God, the All-Governing, the Self-Subsisting, unto him through whom was manifested supreme steadfastness on a Day wherein the hearts of the men of understanding were troubled and souls and minds were thunderstruck. Blessed art thou, for thou hast cast behind thee all else save God and hast spoken forth the truth when the idolaters had encompassed thee round about. Thou hast fulfilled God’s Covenant and His Testament, and discharged that which was incumbent upon thee. Verily, thou art with Me in the Most Glorious Pavilion. Thy Lord is, in truth, the Mighty, the All-Loving. It behooveth the people of Iraq to glory in thee. They shall glory, but today they comprehend not. Let not the words of the unbelievers grieve thee. They are a people who perceive not. A glorious station hath been ordained for thee. Soon shalt thou behold that which thy Lord hath preserved, while all mankind shall pass away. Do they imagine they stand secure, and do they suppose they do good? Nay, by thy Lord, the All-Merciful! But today they know not. Say: Be fair, O people! Can any among your divines compete with the Knight of inner meanings in the arena of wisdom and utterance, or race his swift steed in the field of mystic knowledge and vision at the time of the revelation of the sign of the All-Merciful? Nay, by thy Lord, the Mighty, the Forgiving! O people, stay your pens, for the Most Great Pen hath been raised by the Ancient King. Then be silent, for the call of the All-Glorious God hath been raised in the wilderness of guidance: “There is none other God but Me, the All-Governing, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>
<p>O Amin! Thou hast delivered what We commanded thee in thy dream and informed thee in the Tablet. Thy Lord is, verily, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Say: O people of the Furqan! Muhammad, the Apostle of God, weepeth because of your wrongdoing. Ye are they who followed vain desires and turned away from guidance. Soon shall ye see what ye have wrought. Verily, my Lord lieth in wait. Ye have pronounced judgment against him who hath believed in God on a Day wherein faces were darkened and eyes were dimmed. Have ye not heard the voice of the Summoner who called betwixt earth and heaven and gave you glad tidings of this Revelation whereby the horizons were illumined? Ye turned away from Him as did those before you when the Sun of Knowledge dawned above the horizon of Hijaz. God seized them for their sins and made them a sign for men of understanding. Doth their leader imagine he guideth the people? Nay, by the Lord of Lords! Woe unto them for having denied God and violated the Covenant through their iniquity. The Holy Spirit lamenteth, the thunder crieth out, and the clouds weep. Say: Fear ye God and wax not proud before Him Who created you by His command. Return unto Him, for He is the Mighty, the Ever-Forgiving. Say: Do ye rejoice in the tribulations that have befallen Us? By God! We have accepted them in God’s path, and from beneath the sword We summon mankind unto the Lord of the Day of Judgment. None on earth can deter Us from that whereunto We were bidden by thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Choosing. Can the power of creation prevent Us? Nay, by My true Self, even should every possessor of might and dominion rise against Us. Hearken ye unto the words of him who counseleth you for the sake of God. If ye hear, it shall be for your own good, and if ye turn away, verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Tell the tale of the Trustworthy One concerning him who writhed in agony when the stupor of death overtook him and the stern angels surrounded him. An angel called to him from the right of the Throne: “O heart! These are stern angels - seest thou any way of escape?” He replied: “Nay, by the Lord of creation, save into the fire wherein hearts are made to boil! He it is Who hath decreed this fate for us in this return. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.” We seized him even as We seized the factions before him. Verily He is powerful when He willeth, and He is severe in punishment. How many were the houses We left to the spider, and how many were the kings We brought down from their palaces to their graves, making them a lesson for those possessed of vision.</p>
<p>Know then that We took a handful of dust and kneaded it with the waters of might and power, and breathed into it the spirit of assurance. And when he reached maturity, We sent him to the chief of the oppressors with a luminous Book wherein We conveyed to the two kings that which thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wise, desired. Say: Verily this is another sign from God, the Lord of all names. We sent it forth in truth and dispatched it with manifest authority. We strengthened his heart with a word from Us to such extent that were We to command him, he would face all who are in the heavens and on earth. Verily thy Lord is the Omnipotent, the Almighty. Let them know that neither their might nor anyone in the heavens and earth can intimidate Us. Be thou as thy Lord was, yet We enjoin thee to wisdom before utterance. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Thus do We set forth the verses and send them down in truth, and We have sent them to thee that thou mayest glory in them among the worlds. God shall soon exalt thee in truth and bring low those who have denied His signs. Be thou assured and say: Praise be to Thee, O God of the worlds!</p>

<p>By God’s might! O beloved of my heart! Were I to say “may my spirit be a sacrifice unto thee,” I would be ashamed of these words, for they befit not one who is evanescent, much less as a sacrifice for God’s chosen ones and His trustees. Yet in this shame, which none save God alone knoweth, I beseech from the ocean of His bounty and the heaven of His generosity that He ordain, manifest and send down unto your presence, and upon you, that which befitteth His munificence, exalted be He, in such wise that your heart and soul may rejoice therein, and every tongue in existence may speak forth in praise of His glorious and beauteous Self. Despite my shame, agitation, powerlessness and shortcomings, I declare and say: may my spirit be a sacrifice unto your presence.</p>
<p>The sealed packet containing the letter from Muhammad Mustafa–upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God–and from Mirza Muhammad, one of God’s captives, was received. This servant was blessed to read the most luminous and pure handwriting, praise and thanks be unto Him, whereby I drank what the near ones drink. Likewise, two other letters were perused. Praise and glory be unto Him for having aided him to attain a station wherein he arose wholly to serve his Lord, detached from all else, such that every week there emanates from him the fragrance of the garment of the love of God among His devoted servants.</p>
<p>I beseech your beloved self to convey my expressions of sincerity, self-effacement and nothingness to them. Their letter and that of Aqa Mirza Muhammad were presented in their entirety before the Most Holy and Exalted Presence. This is what was revealed in reply:</p>
<p>“O My name Mahdi! A servant present submitted a letter from Aqa Mirza Muhammad of the land of Sad before the Most Holy Court. God hath ordained all matters to be resolved through consultation. Although the loved ones of the land of Hadba have permission to travel in various directions, except toward the Prison and its surroundings, they must consult before undertaking their journey. Their going was not advisable. Moreover, meeting with the letters Mim and Vav was necessary due to prior and subsequent rights–one meeting sufficed. Multiple meetings occurred outside the bounds of wisdom and contrary to dignity. Let them not be saddened by what transpired. They wrote that they were indebted thirty tumans from the funds of Hadba. Let Jinab-i-Zayn settle that debt. We beseech God, exalted be He, to send down for him and them that which will gladden their hearts and bring joy to their breasts. Verily, He is their Protector in this world and the next. There is no God but Him, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>God’s favors have been and will continue to be directed toward the captives. It behooveth them not to be remiss or negligent in preserving the station and dignity of the Cause and their own selves. Verily, He is the Counselor, the Admonisher, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>As for what Muhammad Mustafa–upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God–had written regarding the Prisoner–upon Him be the Glory of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting–having written that at the request of several who drink the wine of the love of the All-Merciful, they intended to journey toward the Most Great Prison, write to them that this matter was and is not in accordance with wisdom. Be patient, O My loved ones and friends! By My life, that which your Beloved commandeth you is better for you, did ye but know. We have written for the prisoner the reward of one who hath turned toward My court, entered My prison, stood before My gate, and heard My call; and for those who desired to attain the presence, let them ask their Lord, the All-Merciful, to inscribe for them, by the Pen of Revelation, the reward of one who hastened, attained, and won the victory. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth through His word ‘Be’ and it is.” End quote.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of taking fifty majidis and giving them to Jinab-i-Haji Ali–upon him be the Glory of God–for his claim, what was done was both beloved and desired. And concerning what was written about not yet having given to Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Ali Kabir–upon him be the Glory of God–and intending to give later, this matter is not necessary at present, as it would delay the work of that honored one. Let them wait for now; perhaps on a future day this servant himself will attend to your beloved presence.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, at all times you have been and continue to be specially favored with the manifest and hidden bounties and the concealed and visible favors of the Beloved of the worlds, and mention of your beloved self is made in the most excellent and beautiful manner in all remembrances. Upon you be the remembrance of God and the remembrance of those in the Supreme Concourse, and the glory of God and the glory of those in the Divine Throne and Heaven, and the praise of God and the praise of those in all the worlds.</p>

<p>O Attar, upon thee be the Glory of God and His favors! Asma’i, upon him be the Glory of God, forwarded thy letter to the Most Holy Court where it gained the honor of being heard by the Lord of Names in the Most Great Prison. We have heard thy call and what thy tongue hath uttered in remembrance and praise of God. Blessed art thou for having turned towards Him on a day when the princes and divines of the earth have turned away from the Horizon of God, the All-Possessing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>This is a great bounty and a mighty favor. The whole world hath been brought into being to serve the Ancient King. The sun and moon, heaven and earth, all bear witness to this. Nevertheless, when the Horizon of Revelation was illumined with the lights of the countenance of Him Who conversed on Sinai, all turned away and perpetrated that which caused all created things to prefer non-existence to existence. Every hearing ear perceived these words from the tongue of all things: “Would that I had never been created and had not witnessed what the hosts of the oppressors inflicted upon the Dayspring of God’s Cause!”</p>
<p>Praise be to God that the people of that household have attained unto this supreme honor and this most exalted station. We beseech God to aid all to preserve this lofty rank and mighty gift. In all conditions, profit hath been and shall be with you, while loss shall be the portion of those who turn away, who hesitate, and who deny.</p>
<p>Soon shall the peoples of the world witness with their outward eyes that which hath flowed from the Supreme Pen. Convey My greetings to all the kindred, and likewise say to the friends of God: O people of God! This is a day wherein if a single pure deed is performed for the sake of God, it cannot be equated with the deeds of centuries and ages. Among goodly deeds it is as the sun among the stars. Blessed is he who hath recognized the station of the Day of God and hath arisen as befitteth it.</p>
<p>Today is the day of virtuous conduct and deeds. We counsel all to fear God, for the friends of God have ever championed His Cause through godliness. This banner and standard take precedence over all other banners and standards. Blessed are they that understand, and blessed are they that have attained. We beseech God to aid His people that all may advance in unity and harmony towards the Supreme Horizon. He is, verily, powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst mention about Husayn-i-Ardistani, upon him be the Glory of God, the servant present before Us hath made mention of it. Convey greetings to him from the Wronged One. He hath spoken the truth. O Husayn! The Wronged One of the world maketh mention of thee from the Most Great Prison that thou mayest rejoice and be of those who are thankful. Praise the Desired One of all worlds Who made His path clear to thee, Who manifested His Cause which thou didst witness, Who enabled thee to attain His presence and drink from the Kawthar of reunion.</p>
<p>He bestowed bounty, showed favor, and granted success. By the Luminary of proof which shineth from the horizon of the heaven of utterance! Every word that hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen is the choice wine for the Concourse on High, the Kawthar of immortality for the denizens of the most exalted Paradise, and the Salsabil of the spirit for the dwellers of the supreme Heaven. Should the peoples of earth inhale the fragrance of but one word of God’s words and truly perceive it, they would all sacrifice their lives, rend asunder the veils of idle fancy with the fingers of power, and soar in the subtle atmosphere of inner meanings.</p>
<p>O Attar! The fragrance of God hath caused intoxication. Ask God that the intoxication of the choice wine of utterance may seize the world and lead it to the Most Great Paradise. Say: O Husayn! Hearken unto the rustling of the Supreme Pen, for verily it maketh mention of thee and counseleth thee with that which beseemeth His days and His Great Announcement. We beseech God to aid thee at all times to perform deeds whose mention shall endure forever. O Attar! Convey that which thou hast been bidden, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>Each of the souls mentioned in thy letter hath been illumined by the splendors of the Sun of God’s loving-kindness, exalted be His glory. Give them glad tidings of My favor, remind them of My verses, and illumine them with the Sun of My utterance. Thy Lord is verily the All-Merciful, the Bountiful. The two honored souls who have attained the hearing of the call of the Lord of Names and the cup of meeting - each hath been and still is mentioned by the Wronged One. They have attained the blessing of nearness and reunion. Give them glad tidings from the Wronged One, then recite unto them what hath been revealed from My Most Exalted Pen at this moment. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have held fast to the Strong Cord of God, the Firm, the Mighty.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath manifested Himself from the Most Exalted Horizon and hath spoken the Most Sublime Word, and when His sweetest call was raised between earth and heaven, all things were attracted and seized by the wine of reunion in such wise that they were moved and hastened and turned their faces. Then came the decisive Word and distinguished between them on the Day of Return at the appearance of the Lord of the Beginning and the End. Thereupon the doubters retreated, those who had hastened halted, the ignorant turned away, the heedless learned ones objected, while the unitarians hastened, the near ones drew nigh, and the sincere achieved victory. These are servants who accepted every tribulation in the path of God, the Lord of Names. Among them were those who bore their cross in their own hands, and among them were those who hastened to the place of sacrifice with a longing known to none in the kingdom of creation save those whom God, the Lord of all beings and the Sovereign of earth and heaven, hath willed.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou in Whose hands are the reins of all created things and the controls of all possible beings! How can I make mention of Thee after Thou hast made me know that my praise cannot reach Thee and the bird of my utterance cannot soar in the atmosphere of Thy knowledge? Yet, O my God, since Thou hast permitted me to make mention of Thee, I therefore cling to the cord of Thy bounty and favor, and I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the ocean of Thy generosity surged and the fragrance of Thy bounty was wafted among Thy creatures, that Thou aid Thine Afnan to celebrate Thy praise and glorification, and ordain for them that which befitteth the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy grace. Praise be to Thee, O Beloved of the world and Desire of the nations, for having called him unto Thee and brought him into Thy presence and given him to drink the Kawthar of reunion by the hand of Thy giving, and caused him to hear Thy call which was the hope of those near unto Thee among Thy chosen ones and the unitarians among Thy loved ones, and shown him Thy beauty, and ordained for him through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall not be effaced throughout the eternity of Thy kingdom and dominion. Verily Thou art the Almighty, to Whose power and sovereignty all things have testified, and the Concourse on High to Thy greatness and might. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! May my soul be a sacrifice for your love! This evanescent servant has been honored by the trace of your pen which moved in remembrance of our Beloved and your Beloved, our Goal and your Goal. When I read and understood it, I ascended through His Mighty Name to a station which God has made the dawning-place of the light of unity and the dayspring of the manifestation of oneness. When I attained His presence, I presented what was therein and what I had communed with God, the Lord of all worlds. When it concluded, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which I am unable to mention and which no pen in the world can define, until He said - exalted be His utterance and glorified His grandeur - “Take up the pen.” When I took it up, there was sent down from the Kingdom of Utterance that which diffused its fragrance throughout all regions. We praise Him for the wonders of His favors and the manifestation of His grace. May my soul be a sacrifice for His bounty and loving-kindness! By His life, it behooveth the world to sacrifice itself in His path, and all peoples in His love and good-pleasure. This servant is amazed to see how the servants are veiled from the Sun and its effulgence, from the Sea and its waves, and from the heaven and its stars and moons. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to remove the veil from their faces, show them His most exalted horizon, attract them to the Most Great Sign and the Most Glorious Vision. Verily, He is the Single One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>That which was revealed from the heaven of favor, mercy and kindness was, according to His command, given to the Most Great Branch - may my spirit and being be a sacrifice for the dust of His footsteps - to write in His blessed hand, and God willing, they will attain unto it. Some time has passed since this Tablet dawned from the horizon of grace, but circumstances caused its dispatch to be delayed. God willing, His Holiness will not forget this evanescent servant during the nights and days. The glory be upon your honor and upon those who love you and hear your word concerning the Cause of God, the Exalted, the Great, and praise be to God, the Goal of the mystics. The request is that from this evanescent servant, greetings of the Most Exalted, Most Mighty, Most Wondrous, Most High be conveyed to the kinsmen - that is, to each one deemed appropriate - and express the nothingness of this ephemeral one. Further submission: what was sent of rice, tea, and vessels has arrived. The Servant. 28 Rabi’u’th-Thani 1297. The Most Great Branch and the Most Great Branch - may my spirit and being be a sacrifice for the dust of their footsteps - remember and glorify His Honor with the lights shining from the horizon of the heaven of the Most Great Throne.</p>

<p>He is God–exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most High!</p>
<p>All praise be to God, Who warbleth the melody of utterance, Who standeth alone in His bounty, and Who hath chosen man from among all created things to sing His praise. He it is by Whose command the Supreme Pen was moved to write, whereupon all the denizens of the kingdom of creation were thunderstruck by its shrill cry, save those whom God preserved through His sovereignty and delivered through His power. He it is through Whom the sincere ones hastened to the Kawthar of meeting, while the idolaters remained in their lowly station; through Whom the bird of mystical understanding soared in the atmosphere of certitude, and the hearts of the people of Paradise were attracted. Exalted be the All-Merciful Who hath taught me that He cannot be described by my mention nor characterized by the traces of my pen. Rather, all that proceedeth from me is but heedlessness upon heedlessness, and sin upon sin. Yet despite my knowledge, conviction and certitude of this, I bear witness that through His remembrance the heavens and earth were perfumed, and through His praise the fragrance of love was diffused throughout the kingdoms of command and creation. Exalted, exalted be His measure! Exalted, exalted be His power! Exalted, exalted be His sovereignty! Exalted, exalted be His might! Exalted, exalted be His glory! Exalted, exalted be His command! Exalted, exalted be His remembrance! Exalted, exalted be His praise!</p>
<p>I testify that He hath not been described by any description, though His attributes have been inscribed by the Pen of Creation upon the tablets of all created things. And I testify that He hath not been mentioned, though His mention hath been raised up from all things between earth and heaven. How can the pen of ignorance describe that Knowledge at Whose manifestation all seas of knowledge were obliterated, and before Whose exaltation the exaltation of every existing and known thing hath prostrated itself? I seek His forgiveness at all times and in all conditions for what I have said and say, for what hath occurred to my mind, for what my tongue hath uttered, and for what my limbs have committed. He is verily the Forgiver, the Kind, the Generous.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter was heard with loving-kindness and affection, and since it bore witness to and was indicative of praise for the Beloved of the seen and unseen, it brought the utmost joy. God willing, thou shalt ever be occupied with the remembrance of God and renowned throughout the earth for thy love of God. After the letter was read, at a certain time it was presented in detail at the Most Holy Court, whereupon He spoke–and His word is the truth:</p>
<p>“O Hasan! We make mention of thee when thou wert in the Land of Mystery, circling round the will of thy Lord and acting in accordance with that which thou wert commanded by God, the Lord of the worlds. Thou art he who attained unto the presence of thy Lord and quaffed the choice wine from the hands of the bounty of thy Ancient Lord. Rejoice thou in this Most Great Remembrance, and proclaim on My behalf unto those who are with thee, and give them the glad tidings of that grace to which every tongue hath testified and which every discerning mystic hath mentioned. That which thou didst send aforetime hath been presented before the Throne, as well as in these days. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He shall assist thee under all conditions and hath recorded thy name with the Supreme Pen as among those who circled round about Him and arose to serve Him. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Bestower, the Generous.”</p>
<p>Concerning Ustad Husayn you wrote that he has intended, with the permission of the Beloved of the world, to turn towards the Most Holy Court. This much is submitted: the trials in this land have exceeded all bounds and all the loved ones of God have been afflicted with the utmost hardship. Therefore the friends must occupy themselves with service to the Cause. If in these divine days a cherished deed becomes manifest from any soul, the decree of attainment unto His presence will be issued from the Supreme Pen for him. This servant repeatedly heard these words from the tongue of Grandeur. God willing, may he be successful in serving the Cause. This servant mentioned him in the presence of His Countenance. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid us and him to serve Him, to obey Him, and to do that which will exalt His wise and irrevocable Cause.</p>
<p>Concerning Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Habibullah that you wrote about, it was submitted in the Most Holy Court. He expressed favor, and we beseech God to aid him as He aided him before. In truth, that family has rendered many services, especially Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Sadiq and his other brother who was occupied in service in Iraq. He said that souls who have attained to this station must walk among people with the utmost sanctity and detachment so that their station may be made manifest in both the Supreme Kingdom and in the world of creation. Convey greetings to all the friends on behalf of this evanescent one.</p>
<p>Concerning Jinab-i-Ustad Ali-Akbar they wrote, God willing may he ever be and continue to be gladdened by divine favors and occupied with His mention and praise. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to answer my prayer on their behalf and their prayers on my behalf. Verily He is the Protector of the lowly, and praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station in greatness and power</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath spoken the truth and called the people to the Supreme Horizon, the station wherein the Divine Lote Tree speaketh: “There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Alone, the Self-Subsisting, Who hath taken neither partner nor counsellor unto Himself. He hath ever been in the heights of might and majesty, and will forever remain as He hath been from time immemorial. All atoms testify that there is none other God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.”</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified from the understanding of all created things, beseemeth the Beloved of the Worlds, Who through the scratching of the Pen hath attracted the gems of the world and guided them to the Most Great Ocean. Holy and sanctified is His mention above the mentions of the people of the earth; exalted and glorified is His description above the descriptions of creation. Through a single Word He hath made manifest the mysteries of origin and return. Glorified be He Who hath revealed the beginning and the end through a Word from His presence. The servant beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Most High, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And now, this servant submitteth that thy letter was received some time ago by this evanescent one, and as it was adorned with the praise and glorification of the Goal of all desire, the utmost joy and gladness was derived therefrom. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist thee to praise and glorify Him and to achieve that which will cause the exaltation of thy station and thy ascendancy. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>And concerning thy desire to attain unto His presence in Ridvan, it was submitted, and this is what the Beloved hath spoken in reply:</p>
<p>In His Name, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise</p>
<p>Glorified be He Who hath manifested what He desired through His command. Verily, He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is. O thou who hast turned thy face towards His countenance! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He testifieth to that which God testified before the creation of the heavens and earth: There is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed art thou for having drunk the choice wine of utterance from the hands of the favors of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Be thou thankful and say:</p>
<p>“O my God, my Lord, my Support and my Hope! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned unto the Daysprings of Thy Revelation and the Dawning-Places of Thy inspiration, and have set my face towards Thy Face that abideth after the perishing of all things, hoping for Thy mercy that hath preceded the world and Thy grace that hath encompassed the nations. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Thy Most Excellent Names and Thy Most Exalted Attributes, to ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit me in the world to come and in this world. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. O my Lord! Accept from me, through Thy grace and bounty, what I have desired in Thy path, and deprive me not of meeting Thee, which Thou hast mentioned in Thy Mighty Book and wherewith Thou hast gladdened Thy servants in Thy verses. I testify, and all things testify, to Thy power and Thy sovereignty. Thou dost ordain for whomsoever Thou willest the reward of that which the Embodiments of Thy Revelation and the Treasuries of Thy knowledge have uttered. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.”</p>
<p>All friends have been commanded to wisdom, and this has been and will be due to divine grace. Thus, if that honored one had given attention, it surely would have caused spread and fame, and this would have been far from the requirements of wisdom. The heedless people are very distant and are immersed in their own suspicions and vain imaginings. Without thought they speak, and without cause they rise in opposition. Soon will the true Omnipotent One purify the earth and cause the sun of justice to appear to all the world from behind the clouds of oppression. Praise be to God that your honor attained to the nobility of what you intended, for this intention was accepted in the presence of the Beloved of the world. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. Verily, He is the Single One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the honored friend Haji ?-S, upon him be the Glory of God, graced us with his presence and on your behalf, this evanescent servant was enabled to accomplish what was intended and acted accordingly. This servant praises the Beloved of the world that your request was fulfilled in the most excellent manner, for the gathering was convened and that which was the hope and aspiration of all those near and sincere ones illumined that precious assembly. The aforementioned person, upon him be the Glory of God, will relate the details. Blessed art thou, and the other partakers of the cup of divine love send their greetings. The Glory be upon you.</p>

<p>He is God - exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who spoke the Most Exalted Word in the Kingdom of Creation. When His sweetest call was raised, all in the Kingdom of Names were drawn to it. Then did all faces from every direction turn toward Him. Thereupon He spoke another word whereby He tested all, for He is verily the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. At that moment every doubter retreated, every hesitant one drew back, and every proud one turned away. Verily, He is the One Who tested the Names through tribulation. When the heaven came with smoke, all in the realm of possibility turned away save those who were embraced by God’s favors - the King, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>This evanescent one makes known that the exalted letter arrived and bestowed infinite joy. At dawn on the Day of the Fast it was presented in its entirety before the Lord of all beings, and an answer descended from the heaven of our Lord, the All-Merciful. He spoke, and His Word is the Truth:</p>
<p>God willing, may you be blessed with divine favors, be turned toward His direction, and speak His praise. However, with wisdom convey My greetings to the friends in that land and say: The praise of God is like the Water of Life for the people of possibility. All must attain unto new, eternal life through this Kawthar of the All-Merciful which flows from the fountainhead of the Pen of the Beloved of all possibility, so that the names of all may shine like brilliant stars in the heaven of God’s Kingdom and endure through the perpetuity of names. O friends! The clouds of generosity are not always lifted up, nor is the ocean of bounty always surging. Know ye the value of these divine days and be steadfast in His Cause. Know ye also the worth of your stations, for most of the divines, rulers and philosophers did not attain to this exalted, most high station and its recognition, nor did they taste the choice wine of the Word. You have been quickened by the fragrance of God’s Word and the choice wine of the Eternal Beloved. You have recognized the Sun of Truth and comprehended the days of the Beloved Lord. Know ye the value of these bounties and in all days speak His praise.</p>
<p>And concerning your mention of Mirza Sami’ Khan and Muhammad-’Ali Khan, it was presented in the Most Holy Court. He said: “O Sami’, today one must turn with complete devotion and see oneself sanctified and purified from all save God. I swear by the Sovereign of Names that if the people of the world were to find the sweetness of but one word from the words and one verse from the verses that have been and are being sent down from the heaven of Will, all would turn to the Water of Life. Look not at the people - ponder the conflicts of every age and cycle. Consider what befell Noah, Hud, Salih, Zachariah and his son, the Spirit (Jesus), and the Seal of the Prophets (Muhammad) - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - who brought it about and for what purpose. By My life, this blessed word suffices all who are on earth, were they to reflect and ponder in the garden of fairness. Strive to become today the possessor of a word that shall not perish, and that word is contentment, which flows from the Supreme Pen. Glory be upon him who hath cast away the world and turned wholly unto the Ancient of Days and the Sovereign of Nations. O My servant, O Razzaq, rejoice in this word, for they have said before ‘if thou sayest once “My servant”’ and so forth, and now thou hast attained unto it and unto its recognition. Convey My greetings to Muhammad-‘Ali Khan. He and Sami’ should read what hath flowed from the Most Pure Ink by My Most Exalted Command.”</p>
<p>“Glory be unto Thee, O God, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of names and in Whose grasp is the dominion of eternity. I beseech Thee to make us among those who have been drawn by Thy verses and have detached themselves from all else but Thee and have taken complete refuge at Thy threshold and sought full protection in Thy Beauty. O Lord! We have sought the ocean of Thy grace and the heaven of Thy bounty and the depths of Thy favor. I beseech Thee not to withhold from us that which Thou hast ordained in Thy days. O Lord! Ordain for us what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, then grant us the Kawthar of steadfastness in this Cause wherein the feet of Thy creatures have slipped and the hearts of those in Thy realms were shaken, save those who dwelt beneath the canopies of Thy mercy. Verily Thou art He Who hath been powerful and will continue to be as Thou hast been from time immemorial. There is no God but Thee, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.”</p>

<p>He is the Everlasting One upon the Throne of Command, in His Most Glorious Name!</p>
<p>In this day that which is acceptable before the Throne is the teaching of God’s Cause, and thus hath the Command been ordained by the One Who is the All-Choosing. However, teaching through goodly utterance and exalted mention is acceptable, not through disputation and conflict. Do good even as God hath done good unto you. The triumph of the Cause hath been made to depend upon utterance and mention by the tongue. Thus hath the Command been ordained by the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>O loved ones of Truth! Conduct yourselves in such wise upon the earth that His signs may be made manifest through you, in such manner that all souls may witness the signs of Truth in your deeds, acts and words, and hasten unto the everlasting goal of glory. You have ever been remembered before the Throne. Blessed art thou for having attained unto that which most of the servants have failed to attain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, be it known unto you that ere long Satan will appear in that land in the guise of man, seeking to cause the loved ones of the Glory of the All-Glorious to deviate from the straight path through base suggestions and satanic promptings, and to deprive them of the holy shores of the Divine Unity. This is one of the hidden tidings wherewith We have acquainted the chosen ones, lest they be debarred from the praiseworthy station through association with such embodiments of hatred.</p>
<p>It therefore behooveth all the loved ones of God to shun any soul from whom they perceive the fragrance of hatred for the Most Glorious Beauty, even should that soul speak forth all the verses and lay claim to all the Books, for the purpose of verses and books hath ever been and shall ever be the recognition of the All-Merciful. Let them therefore guard themselves with the utmost vigilance lest they fall into the snare of guile and craftiness. This is the counsel of the Pen of Destiny which hath been set down. Whoso obeyeth, it shall be for his own good; and whoso turneth away, verily God loveth not those who turn away.</p>
<p>These satans are seen to be of several kinds. Some are souls who appear forthwith in that same land in a satanic spirit in human form. Others come from the lowest hell in the guise of seekers. Yet others are dispatched in utter darkness in the form of a tablet. In short, Satan hath in this day appeared and shall appear in all forms, that perchance he may, through some aspect or another means, veil the people from the Source of the Cause, even as he hath already veiled most through this veil. Were there to be found a penetrating and keen sight, it would perceive the fire of hell in the outward form of the enemies of God.</p>
<p>Strive diligently to safeguard your souls, for the satans shall appear in diverse garments and shall approach each soul in his own way, until having perceived him to be like unto themselves, they shall then leave him to his own devices. And in this day it is inevitable that from among the enemies of the All-Glorious One some shall arise from among the people of the Bayan, for the pure essences of this people who are adorned with the most exalted garment and have quaffed from the Most Glorious Wine have been and shall ever be accounted as the best of creation in the sight of God, while the base elements of this people are recorded before God as the most evil of all created things and the most remote of all souls. Therefore must the evil ones of this people rise up to wage war against this manifest, all-encompassing and perspicuous Revelation, for the more luminous the Revelation, the thicker the veils that are witnessed, and the more radiantly the Sun of the Glory of the All-Glorious shineth forth, the stronger grow those who turn away in their opposition.</p>
<p>Thus have We sent down the Command unto you and related that which was hidden from you, that ye may be informed thereof before and after its occurrence, and may be among those who are aware, that perchance ye may not be touched by the abasement of souls and their falsehoods in the words and traces that proceed from them, and that ye may be among those who are mindful and steadfast in the Cause of your Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore must the loved ones of God in this day manifest themselves in such wise that were all who are in the world to assemble against them with drawn swords, they would pay no heed whatsoever and would, through the power of their Lord, regard them all as a thing unworthy of mention.</p>
<p>Therefore, O faithful servant, hearken unto that which hath been mentioned in this exalted Tablet and convey these revealed Persian words to all the loved ones of God and teach them, that all may become aware. Thus do We counsel you with truth, that ye may be of them that act.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath tasted the sweetness of communing with his Lord and hath remembered his Master with wondrous breaths of love, whose letters of his words testify to his love for his Lord, and from whose heart waft the sublime breaths of the spirit. And thou, O Pen, if thou art saddened in thyself, We counsel thee to be patient lest there appear from thee that which would cause all created things to be overthrown and all existence to cease. And if thou desirest to make mention of the tribulations of the Ancient Beauty, make mention in the secret of secrets, and if thou wouldst hear from Me, conceal it lest thereby be saddened he who hath loved his Lord. Thus doth the tongue of thy Lord command thee that thou mayest exercise goodly patience.</p>
<p>Then make mention of the servant who desired to attain the presence in those days when all were forbidden from turning to Him, save those who had shattered the chains of idle fancy and had detached themselves from all who dwell on earth. O servant who hast ascended to the atmosphere of nearness! Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from all directions - that which God hath proclaimed in every age, dispensation and epoch: that there is none other God but Him, and that this is indeed His servant who hath sacrificed his spirit in His path and feared no one in proclaiming God’s Cause until the pavilion of the Cause was raised aloft through His sovereignty which hath encompassed the worlds. When he opened his eye, the eyes of all created things were opened; when he raised his hand, the hands of all beings were raised; when he unloosed, through the power of might and strength, the tongue of the Divine Will and brought it forth, then did all things speak out, saying: “By God! This is indeed the Tongue of God which hath appeared from its treasury and speaketh in all atoms that there is none other God but Him, and that He is the Ever-Watchful over all things.”</p>
<p>Know thou that We have read thy letter and have turned toward that which was contained therein, and We have recognized how the fragrances of thy Lord’s love stirred within thee. Blessed art thou for having attained unto that which most of the people have been deprived of. Thou hast taken hold of the Book of God with the hand of strength and cast behind thee the intimations of the idolaters, and soared in an atmosphere wherein no wings have soared save those who have detached themselves wholly from all that is on earth and have taken their seat upon the cushions of transcendent glory. Arise to aid the Cause of God and His Command, and pay no heed to those who have taken Satan as their protector.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Do ye doubt God, or His might which hath encompassed all created things? Fear ye God, and deny not Him by Whose command the seas were set in motion, the trees yielded their fruits, the lights shone forth, the winds blew, and the earth was made firm. Then did it shine with the lights of its Lord, if ye be among those who know. O people! Dispute not concerning the Cause of God. By God! He hath appeared with all His signs, and none deny Him save every proud one who is far astray. Then know thou that thy Lord will aid thee in all matters and will support thee in what He desireth, and verily His favor upon thee is great. Cast beneath thy feet those babblers whose deeds belie their words and whose words belie their deeds, who comprehend not what issueth from their lying tongues, and who imagine themselves to be virtuous and well-pleasing in the religion of God. Say: O people! If ye believed in Ali aforetime, by God, this is his very Self; and if ye believed in Muhammad, this is His Messenger; and if ye believed in the Spirit, by God, this is He Who caused him to ascend unto heaven; and if ye believed in Him Who conversed with God, this is verily His Manifestation on Sinai; and if ye believed in the Most Hidden Mystery, behold, He hath appeared in truth in human temple, and now doth the tongue of the All-Merciful proclaim in the highest paradise concerning Him: “This is the Beauty whereby Mine eye is consoled, My spirit is refreshed, and My signs are made manifest.” Beware, O people! Draw not against Him the swords of hatred. Have mercy upon yourselves and be not tyrannical and wretched. Say: O concourse of polytheists! Perish in your wrath! By God! The clouds of destiny have been rent asunder and the Beauty of God, the Most Exalted, the Most High, hath come with such an adorning as none on earth or in heaven can prevent, and He hath arisen to uphold His Cause with a sovereignty that hath been from all eternity powerful in truth. Do ye imagine that aught can withstand His Cause? Nay, by My Self, were ye to be possessed of true vision. Thou beholdest not those servants who have disbelieved save as a mirage which the thirsty one supposeth to be water, when in reality it hath no existence. Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and recite them, for verily in their recitation there is a great glad-tiding. And peace be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and upon those who hearken unto thy words concerning this Cause, from which the feet of every deceitful dissembler have slipped.</p>

<p>Verily I say, this is the Day in which mankind can behold the Face, and hear the Voice, of the Promised One. The Call of God hath been raised, and the light of His countenance hath been lifted up upon men. It behoveth every man to blot out the trace of every idle word from the tablet of his heart, and to gaze, with an open and unbiased mind, on the signs of His Revelation, the proofs of His Mission, and the tokens of His glory.</p>
<p>Great indeed is this Day! The allusions made to it in all the sacred Scriptures as the Day of God attest its greatness. The soul of every Prophet of God, of every Divine Messenger, hath thirsted for this wondrous Day. All the divers kindreds of the earth have, likewise, yearned to attain it. No sooner, however, had the Day Star of His Revelation manifested itself in the heaven of God’s Will, than all, except those whom the Almighty was pleased to guide, were found dumbfounded and heedless.</p>
<p>O thou that hast remembered Me! The most grievous veil hath shut out the peoples of the earth from His glory, and hindered them from hearkening to His call. God grant that the light of unity may envelope the whole earth, and that the seal, “the Kingdom is God’s”, may be stamped upon the brow of all its peoples.</p>
<p>Thou didst inquire about the essential truth of Him Who shall be made manifest. Glory be to God! This station cannot be encompassed by words, nor can all the pens in the world enumerate its praise. All the Prophets and chosen ones acknowledge their powerlessness, and all the holy ones confess their shortcomings. This is an arena wherein the horsemen of mystic knowledge, expression, comprehension and intellect cannot venture. He cannot be known except through Himself, nor described save by His own Self. None hath ever encompassed this hidden secret and treasured mystery, nor ever shall. Whatever hath been mentioned is but as a shadow before the lights of the Sun of Truth. However, in view of the supreme benevolence and boundless grace, the Most Exalted Pen hath spoken this most exalted Word which shineth as the sun from the horizon of the divine Tablet: “Return ye to the evidences, O ye who are endowed with insight!”</p>
<p>Should anyone contemplate with the eye of fairness the evidences, manifestations and proofs that have appeared in this Most Holy, Most Exalted Revelation, he would surely proclaim: “I believe in Thee, O Thou the Desire of the worlds!” What hath been mentioned was but a drop from the ocean of truth. By the life of God! This ocean hath no bounds, and no expert diver hath ever reached its depths. If ye were to look to the Bayan, it declareth: “He it is Who speaketh in every condition, ‘Verily I am God, there is none other God but Me.’” All the names that have been heard were and are created by the Word of this Most Great Revelation. Ponder thou, that thou mayest know and be numbered among them that comprehend.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the people of the Bayan have denied these stations and cling to their vain imaginings, like unto the rebellious and tyrannical faction who hasten unto fancy and conjecture, turning away from the light of certitude. This Wronged One arose to promote the Cause at a time when, from the tyranny of the oppressors, none dared speak, and guided all on earth to the Most Exalted Horizon. I swear by the Sun of the divine Word! We have accepted all the tribulations of the earth for the reformation and education of the world, and there befell Us in successive years that which caused the dwellers of the all-highest Paradise to weep and lament. Yet these withered and faded people were not moved by the divine breeze and the fragrance of His garment.</p>
<p>Say: Glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the kingdom of names and in Whose right hand is the dominion of all created things! I beseech Thee by the rushing of Thy winds in the Supreme Paradise and by the warbling of Thy Nightingale upon the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree, to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy Cause, speaking Thy praise, soaring in the atmosphere of Thy love, and acting in accordance with what Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book. O my Lord! I am the poor and needy one, and Thou art the All-Possessing, the All-Bountiful. Thou seest me, O my God, standing before the door of Thy grace, which Thou hast opened by the finger of Thy power unto all in Thy earth and Thy heaven. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of what is with Thee, to make known unto me what Thou hast intended through the wonders of Thy bounty and favors, and to confirm me in steadfastness unto this Cause whereby the feet of most of Thy creatures who cast away Thy Covenant, turned away from Thy Beauty, disputed Thy verses, and denied what hath appeared from Thee have slipped. Thou art He Whom nothing whatsoever hath preceded and no command hath frustrated. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. Thou art the Mighty, the Peerless, the One, the Triumphant, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>The beginning of every account is the name of God</p>
<p>O friends of God! Incline your inner ears to the voice of the peerless and self-subsisting Lord, that He may deliver you from the bonds of entanglement and the depths of darkness and enable you to attain the eternal light. Ascent and descent, stillness and motion, have come into being through the will of the Lord of all that hath been and shall be. The cause of ascent is lightness, and the cause of lightness is heat. Thus hath it been decreed by God. The cause of stillness is weight and density, which in turn are caused by cold. Thus hath it been decreed by God.</p>
<p>And since He hath ordained heat to be the source of motion and ascent and the cause of attainment to the desired goal, He hath therefore kindled with the mystic hand that Fire that dieth not and sent it forth into the world, that this divine Fire might, by the heat of the love of God, guide and attract all mankind to the abode of the incomparable Friend. This is the mystery enshrined in your Book that was sent down aforetime, a mystery which hath until now remained concealed from the eyes and hearts of men. That primal Fire hath in this Day appeared with a new radiance and with immeasurable heat. This divine Fire burneth of itself, with neither fuel nor fume, that it might draw away such excess moisture and cold as are the cause of torpor and weariness, of lethargy and despondency, and lead the entire creation to the court of the presence of the All-Merciful. Whoso hath approached this Fire hath been set aflame and attained the desired goal, and whoso hath removed himself therefrom hath remained deprived.</p>
<p>O servant of God! Turn thou away from the stranger, that thou mayest recognize the Friend. He indeed is a stranger who leadeth you away from the Friend. This is not the day whereon the high priests can command and exercise their authority. In your Book it is stated that the high priests will, on that Day, lead men far astray, and will prevent them from drawing nigh unto Him. He indeed is a high priest who hath seen the light and hastened unto the way leading to the Beloved. Such a man is a benevolent priest and a source of illumination to the whole world.</p>
<p>O servant of God! Any priest who leadeth thee away from this Fire, which is the reality of the Light and the mystery of divine Revelation, is indeed thine enemy. Suffer not the words of the foe to hold thee back from the Friend or the insinuations of the enemy to cause thee to forsake the Beloved.</p>
<p>O servant of God! The day of deeds hath come: Now is not the time for words. The Messenger of God hath appeared: Now is not the hour for hesitation. Open thine inner eye that thou mayest behold the face of the Beloved, and hearken with thine inner ear that thou mayest hear the sweet murmur of His celestial voice.</p>
<p>O servant of God! The robe of divine bestowal hath been sewn and readied. Take hold of it and attire thyself therewith. Renounce and forsake the people of the world. O wise one! Shouldst thou heed the counsel of thy Lord, thou wouldst be released from the bondage of His servants and behold thyself exalted above all men.</p>
<p>O servant of God! We have bestowed a dewdrop from the ocean of divine grace; would that men might drink therefrom! We have brought a trace of the sweet melodies of the Beloved; would that men might hearken with their inner ear! Soar upon the wings of joy in the atmosphere of the love of God. Regard the people of the world as dead and seek the fellowship of the living. Whoso hath not breathed the sweet fragrance of the Beloved at this dawntide is indeed accounted among the dead. He Who is the All-Sufficing proclaimeth aloud: “The realm of joy hath been ushered in; be not sorrowful! The hidden mystery hath been made manifest; be not disheartened!” Wert thou to apprehend the surpassing greatness of this Day, thou wouldst renounce the world and all that dwell therein and hasten unto the way that leadeth to the Lord.</p>
<p>O servants of God! Deprived souls are heedless of this triumphant Day, and chilled hearts have no share of the heat of this blazing Fire.</p>
<p>O servant of God! The Tree which We had planted with the Hand of Providence hath borne its destined fruit, and the glad-tidings We had imparted in the Book have appeared in full effect.</p>
<p>O servant of God! We revealed Ourself to thee once in thy sleep, but thou didst remain unaware. Remember now, that thou mayest perceive and hasten with heart and soul to the placeless Friend.</p>
<p>O servant of God! Say: O high priests! The Hand of Omnipotence is stretched forth from behind the clouds; behold ye it with new eyes. The tokens of His majesty and greatness are unveiled; gaze ye on them with pure eyes.</p>
<p>O servant of God! The Daystar of the everlasting realm is shining resplendent above the horizon of His will and the Oceans of divine bounty are surging. Bereft indeed is the one who hath failed to behold them, and lifeless the one who hath not attained thereunto. Close thine eyes to this nether world, open them to the countenance of the incomparable Friend, and commune intimately with His Spirit.</p>
<p>O servant of God! With a pure heart unloose thy tongue in the praise of thy Lord for having made mention of thee through His gem-scattering pen. Couldst thou but realize the greatness of this bestowal, thou wouldst find thyself invested with everlasting life.</p>
<p>O servant of God! Say: The Lord declareth: He that is afflicted seeketh not wellness and shall not arise, and he that beareth the sign shall not attain unto salvation.</p>

<p>These are verses of holiness which have been sent down in truth, and none comprehend them save those whose hearts God hath tested for faith and made to be among the successful ones. Verily they are a remembrance unto those who have been guided by the guidance of the Spirit in these days and were of those who have drawn nigh. Verily they are God’s herald amongst His servants, and by them are reminded those servants who have burned away the veils of idle fancy through the fire of the love of their Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. They are servants upon whom the Concourse on High shower their prayers, and for whose presence the denizens of Paradise yearn, and then the dwellers of the highest Paradise.</p>
<p>O Abraham! Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the court of God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful. Purify thyself from all allusions, then stand firm in thy Lord’s Cause, and be thou of the steadfast. Beware lest thou associate any partners with God, thy Lord, for verily He was one in His essence and created by His Word all who are in the heavens and the earth. Be grateful to thy Lord for having enabled thee to attain unto this most holy, most transcendent, most mighty, most luminous station, and for having caused thee to hear His melodies and granted thee the meeting with the Manifestation of His Self, and thus have We shown thee the Kingdom of the heavens that thou mayest be of the assured ones.</p>
<p>O servant! Forget not the days of meeting Me, nor standing before My presence, and be not of the heedless ones. Were thou to know and become aware of that which God hath ordained for thee as a reward for turning unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent, such joy would seize thee that thou wouldst be attracted in such wise as to turn away from the world and its ornaments, and be detached from all the worlds. Blessed be thine ears for having heard the words of God, and thine eyes for having beheld the beauty of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the Powerful, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Soar upon the wings of longing and yearning unto all regions and remind the people of what thou hast known and seen, that perchance they may be ashamed before God Who created them and fashioned them, and may become of the assured ones.</p>
<p>Verily thou art aware of what hath befallen Us in this Prison at the hands of these deniers. Say: O people, by God, We called you only unto God, your Lord, in Our previous Manifestations, and We call you now only unto Him. Fear God, O people, and be not of the prodigal. Fear God and transgress not against Him after He hath appeared with the truth, with a sovereignty that hath encompassed the worlds. Were ye to focus your vision, ye would surely witness inscribed upon the face of the sun that which hath been traced by a finger of mighty power. By God! It was created by a light from the lights of this Countenance which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Spirit with a brilliant, wondrous radiance.</p>
<p>Say: O people, be not heedless of your Lord’s Cause, and dispute not His words. By My life! God hath made them a beauty mark upon the cheek of His Books which were sent down from the heaven of grace, if ye be of the fair-minded. Say: Do ye deny Him by Whom the Holy Spirit was created? Fear God, O company of the heedless! If ye believe not, oppose Him not, and if ye help Him not, smite Him not with the swords of hatred. Thus doth your Lord admonish you, that perchance ye may be of the repentant.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan, judge fairly within yourselves: what is the difference between you and those whom ye denounce as unbelievers? If ye say they opposed ’Ali at the time of His manifestation, verily ye have opposed His very Self, His Spirit, and His Essence, and ye perceive it not. Fear God and follow not your desires. Follow the Spirit in these days and be not of the veiled ones.</p>
<p>And thou, O servant who hath migrated unto God, if thou seest My loved ones, remind them of My verses and of what hath befallen My beauty, that they may weep for Me and become partners in My sorrow and tribulation, and lament as those who have lost their beloved ones. Say: By God! The enemies of God have perpetrated that which neither Nimrod, nor Pharaoh, nor the first and second ones committed. Thus have We been afflicted, and none knoweth this save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. At every moment there befalleth Me arrow after arrow, sword after sword, and spear after spear from those who stood before My face and who used to seek blessings by standing at the threshold of My gate, which was opened unto all who are in the heavens and the earth. When they witnessed composure in themselves, they arose in opposition in such wise as hath astonished the realities of the Prophets and Messengers.</p>
<p>We thank God for what hath befallen Us of confirmed tribulations, and We praise Him in all conditions, and We show patience in His path as We showed patience aforetime, and He is the Helper of the patient ones. Thus have We detailed the verses unto thee that thou mayest be mindful of the remembrance of God, thy Lord, and stand firm in His love in such wise that the violent winds that blow from the direction of every accursed satan shall not move thee. The Spirit and glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the love of God and are of the assured ones.</p>

<p>A wondrous remembrance from the servant unto him who hath believed in God his Lord, who hath drunk from the chalice of everlasting life in the nearness of the celestial realm, and who hath become of those who have attained, that he may thereby glory in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth, that his eyes may be solaced, that he may sacrifice all that God hath given him to possess, that he may follow the Spirit in his return and his resting-place, and that he may be of those who dwell within the pavilions of holiness.</p>
<p>O Letter Ha! Be light in thy body that thou mayest walk upon the air, and be not heavy like the earth lest thou sink in water and be of them that perish. Thus doth the Spirit walk upon the face of the waters. We have set forth this similitude in the Book, and every similitude, that thou mayest know the stations of the Cause, both past and future, and be of them that are firmly grounded therein. Through the grace of the Spirit hath the Word reached its ultimate effusion, and We have sent forth meanings and gathered them within these words, that they may be clear signs unto those who have preceded in guidance and who rest today upon the elevated canopy of glory.</p>
<p>Say unto him who is remembered by Ha before Shin: Fear God and follow not the desires of thy self, and be not of the losers. Be content with what hath flowed from the Pen upon the Tablet and what God hath decreed for thee. Turn away from thyself and thy desires, and take fast hold of the Most Firm Handle and the Sure Handhold, that God may cause thee to enter the Holy Paradise wherein thou shalt abide forever. Have mercy on thyself and bar not the people from the path of God, and be not of the mischief-makers.</p>
<p>Verily, despite this Cause wherewith God hath honored me through His bounty - a Cause that hath rendered all the worlds impotent - by God, besides Whom there is no other God, I am naught but a servant of God and shall never be aught save a servant to the Manifestations of His Self, and in this do I glory amidst all created things. How then befitteth it anyone to make claims regarding his own self without permission from God or proof from God, the Great?</p>
<p>Say unto him: Gird up thy loins and strengthen thine arms to serve those who call upon God in the morn of Identity and remember Him in the eventide in the Temple of Eternity. Perchance God will forgive thee and assist thee in His Cause and make thee of those who prostrate themselves before the face of God. Follow the paths of thy Lord and be clear-sighted in the Cause lest thy feet and the feet of those who walk in God’s good-pleasure and traverse the pathways of truth should slip.</p>
<p>Remember thy Lord on earth that He may remember thee in heaven amongst the company of the chosen ones. Then love Him that He may love thee, though His love for His servants existed before the creation of the heavens and earths. Say: O servants! Turn ye unto your Lord, then turn away from your desires, remember God in His days, trust in Him, and be of those who are certain of meeting with God.</p>
<p>Hearken unto what the Spirit imparteth unto you of the melodies of eternity, free yourselves from that which calleth you unto extinction, and give thanks unto God, your Lord, at all times, and be not of the heedless ones. Grieve thou not over anything, but look upon the generations of old, how God caused them to pass away after He had sent unto them His proofs, yet they denied God’s signs and rejected His favor and were in manifest loss.</p>
<p>And unto this age which He hath filled with the grace of His mercy - all that was before hath passed away and all that thou witnesseth now shall likewise pass away, and sovereignty shall remain unto His Face. Thus hath a time been fixed for all things in the preserved Tablets of might. Therefore, seize these days and strive to enter the Paradise of eternity, lest death overtake thee and the lights draw thee to the horizon of the Cause from the presence of One All-Wise, All-Informed.</p>
<p>We have sent unto thee this garment that thou mayest find from it the fragrance of musk, but he who is afflicted with a cold cannot perceive aught therefrom; nay, rather, he increaseth in his denial. Thus hath thy Lord, God, numbered all things in a wondrous Book.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I seek forgiveness from Thee at this time for whatsoever I have committed in this station wherein I have uttered between Thy hands the verses which Thou didst make a proof of Thy Being, an evidence of Thine Own Self, and a testimony unto all who are in Thy heaven and on Thine earth, that the Cause might be established from Thy presence as a conclusive argument unto all who dwell on earth. Yet Thou knowest, O my God, that I desired naught save that there might appear a drop of that which Thou hast treasured within this Repository, [lest] anyone imagine within himself, and that all who are in the heavens and on earth might worship Thee according to the standard of unerring justice. And since I have done thus, have mercy upon me, then forgive me and turn unto me in forgiveness, for in Thy hands is the kingdom of all things and Thou art, in truth, the Most Merciful of the merciful. Then clothe with silken vestures, fashioned from the gems of glorification from Our presence, those who have believed in God and His signs, and were numbered among the sincere ones.

<p>Praise be unto the King of existence Who adorned the world of humanity with the ornament of utterance. The Guide, the Interpreter and the Manifestor, in His primary station, was the utterance of the All-Merciful. With one word from His Kingdom of utterance He created the world and showed the way. His path is clear and evident like the sun, and His proof is manifest and visible above that. Yet the blind ones of the world have ever rejected and continue to reject, regarding the oppressor as the oppressed and the corrupt as the upright. Distinction hath vanished. Glory be to God! It seems as though eyes and ears have become non-existent and have disappeared. The people of God brought forth a sapling; they planted it and it grew tall. Now its fruit must be observed. The station of the fruit is clear and known from the station of the tree. At one time this exalted word was revealed from the Divine Lote-Tree: “O servant in attendance, say to the heedless people: Fix your gaze upon the Tree and its fruits. Today the Tree of inner meanings with its wondrous, novel and subtle fruits of divine knowledge is visible. Is it permissible to abandon this and say its time has not come? O helpless one! What knowest thou of time? The Euphrates of mercy floweth from the right hand of the Throne, yet thou sayest ‘where and when is it?’ and ‘it must flow at another hour.’ Be fair, O people, and be not among the transgressors and the abased ones.”</p>
<p>The servant and the people of God must, in the nights and days, beseech the True One to guide all. And blessings and peace be upon the best of God’s creation, the most excellent, the most ancient, the most knowing, the nearest and most articulate one, through whom the rains of wisdom and knowledge were showered upon all in creation, and through whom every mention, every name and every station was exalted. With Him the Book of Creation began and with Him it ended. Every book of His Book was detailed, and God’s decree was manifested through His arising and His utterance. And upon His family and companions who aided the Cause of God with true aid and strove in God with true striving, and profound peace be upon them.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the servant found the fragrance of remembrance and praise… I beseech God the Exalted to confirm thee and make thee among those who shall have no fear nor shall they grieve. After observing and becoming informed, he proceeded to the Presence and it was presented before His face. He said: “O Ali, God willing, mayest thou be successful through divine confirmations and be assisted by the confirmations of the All-Merciful in such wise that the signs of success and confirmation become manifest and evident in the world. Thou hast been and art mentioned before the Wronged One. We beseech God the Exalted to make all your deeds as one deed and all your remembrances as one remembrance.” Deeds and remembrances that occur for God’s good-pleasure are one deed and one remembrance. This station is the station of the oneness of deeds and remembrances. The pen hath no power to speak and the rider of the fingers no room to gallop. We beseech God the Exalted to send down upon you from the heaven of His grace that which will exalt you among His servants and draw you nigh unto Him. Verily He is the Munificent, the Generous. Praise be unto Him, for He is the Goal of the knowers and the God of all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The rain of wisdom and utterance hath descended from the heaven of bounty. We were not, then we became; we were non-existent, then we existed; we were nothingness, then we became being. Whence came these bounties? They existed before our existence, and He bestowed before any request. His gift hath no end and no subsequent obligation. O God! How can we thank Thee? For whatever we say is not worthy of Thee nor befitting Thee. How can absolute nothingness describe the Ancient One? Whatever it says is worthy only of itself and from its own realm. The ant cannot equal the phoenix, and the dim-sighted hath no knowledge in this arena. When He permitted, we made mention; we received leave and hastened to the field of praise. O Generous One! The needy one, with complete need, hath clung to Thee and taken his place on the shore of the sea of bounty. Deprive not this gathering. Show unto all what is in their hearts, that they may know with clear certainty that this people know none but Thee, see none but Thee, and desire none but Thee. They have no purpose save Thy good-pleasure and no beloved save Thee. If Thou dost enable them, they will arise to serve Thy servants; otherwise the matter is in Thy hands. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou desirest. There is no God but Thee, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>

The spiritual youth, upon him be God’s everlasting grace, and his honor Ibn-i-Ta’if-i-Marfu’, upon him be God’s eternal glory, have been and are mentioned. O youth!

The eye of creation hath not seen the like of such souls, nor hath the ear of invention heard of such sacrifice. We beseech the Lord to ordain for His loved ones that which He hath ordained for them. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>

Blessed is he who remembers them and visits them, for he is among the successful ones in a mighty tablet.</p>

Happy are they both, and happy are they - meaning those souls who rendered assistance and joined in this benevolent act. Nothing whatsoever escapeth the knowledge of your Lord.

Blessed is he who hath heard and acted upon that which God, the Ancient Commander, hath ordained.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by the blessed, hallowed, and most exalted Word, through whose dawning from the heaven of Thy will the ocean of immortality surged, the fragrances of bounty wafted, and the sun of faithfulness shone forth, to aid Thy loved ones to arise to serve Thee and to stand firm in Thy Cause with such steadfastness as cannot be deterred by hosts and ranks, nor by the roaring of those who have denied God, the Lord of bounty and the Lord of hosts.

<p>The Beloved’s tongue speaks: Gird up the loins of service firmly and at all times and seasons be engaged in the remembrance of God and remind the loved ones of God. To Majid He says: O thou who art sincere, be steadfast in the Cause of God in such wise that thou shouldst reckon His opposers as non-existent and His enemies as extinct. If thou wert to become aware of My tribulations, thou wouldst surely weep blood. I will mention only this much: Consider how for twenty years I reared an individual, and by God, besides Whom there is none other God, I exerted such mighty efforts in his upbringing that none greater was possible. I prepared for him every means of comfort, even to the extent of summoning maidens from distant lands to serve him, that he might be at ease and occupied with pleasure. Yet at all times he sought to harm Me, as is evident to you, and still I concealed it. Finally he openly arose to slay Me. Then, when I departed, he attributed to My Beauty all that he had committed, that he might establish his own innocence. Yet you know that had this servant desired to harm him, it would have been possible by any means, and none would have had the right to question it, for verily He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Nevertheless, I protected him with the utmost protection. He hath written and continueth to write to all regions claiming that he was imprisoned, and whatever else he hath seen in his own self he hath attributed to this Wronged One. I swear by God that if thou wouldst reflect a little, thou wouldst melt away, for you are aware of certain matters and the abasement of the Cause when I was not among the people.</p>
<p>Hearken unto My lamentation and sighing between heaven and earth, and burn away all veils with the fire of divine love. At all times look unto Him and place thy trust in Him. You have never been absent from My sight and, God willing, never shall be. When you gather in the assembly of fellowship, remember My tribulations and sorrows, for soon fabricated letters will reach everyone. By divine might and power, pay no heed to them whatsoever; nay, touching them is not permitted.</p>
<p>Moreover, remind all other companions on My behalf and say: This is the Day of steadfastness, firmness and rootedness in God’s Cause. Speak this openly and secretly, outwardly and inwardly, and act according to this blessed verse: “Say: God; then leave them to their vain discourses.”</p>

Associate with people with perfect submission, contentment and goodly character, and be sagacious in the divine Cause, for today the deniers of the Manifest Beauty lie in ambush with utmost deceit. At all times take refuge in the Beauty of the All-Merciful and be protected in the fortress of His mercy. Say: O loved ones of God! Be so enkindled with the fire of His love that it shall never be extinguished. Purify your ears from what they have heard, that ye may comprehend the meanings of the words that are now manifest from the horizon of utterance.</p>
<p>Then remind him who asked before about the News that was indeed magnificent. Say: Verily it hath appeared in truth, so hold fast unto it and be of those who are secure. Shun all else, for this is indeed a manifest grace. Say: We have not forgotten thee, so be thou assured in thyself and be of those who rejoice. And if thou desirest to grieve for aught, then grieve for what hath befallen My wronged and sorrowful Self. And if thou lovest to weep, then weep for the sighs of My heart, for this is indeed a beauteous permission. And if thou wishest to lament on earth or cry out for any matter, then cry out for what hath befallen Me from the tyranny of these oppressors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, convey abundant greetings to Haji Abdul-Rahim. Say: We have received what thou didst see in thy dream. God shall soon grant thee victory over Mine enemies and make thee triumphant over them through a power from His presence. Verily He is the One Who hath power over what He willeth, and He is indeed the Omnipotent, the Powerful. A tablet was also sent to him before; God willing, it hath arrived by now.</p>

Thus doth the Pen of Command impart unto thee what God hath revealed in this Tablet, wherein He hath manifested Himself with an authority that is evident and true.

Nay, by My very life, if thou art possessed of true knowledge!

Thou shalt find their faces darkened by the fire of hell, uttering that which the followers of the Qur’an uttered at the hour when the heaven of the Cause was cleft asunder and God came in the shadows of the clouds. Be thou enkindled with this fire which hath been ignited in the midmost heart of eternity and which the idolaters have sought to extinguish. Say: By God! Ye shall never succeed in this, even should ye seek the aid of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Say: O people! The Primal Point crieth out in the highest Paradise, saying: Fie upon you, O people! By God! There hath appeared that which hath never appeared in creation, yet ye have turned away therefrom after We had summoned you unto it in all Our Tablets, nay in every impregnable line.</p>
<p>Then know that your letter has come before Us, and We found from it the fragrance of your love for your Lord. Therefore have We sent down upon you these verses and dispatched them to you, that you may take them and enter the dwelling-place of those who turn away, with an authority that was manifest in truth. And when you enter, say: “O people! I have come to you from the Dayspring of the Cause with a message that was mighty in the Mother Book. And if you deny what you have heard and witnessed of God’s power - your Lord - and the manifestations of His grandeur and the expressions of His might, then I bring you another proof, which is this Tablet that God has sent to this servant of His. Here I am, reciting it to you - so read what you have, that the truth may be made manifest between us.” Thus does the Pen of the Cause command you to act, and fear not, for your Lord will protect you from every sinful idolater. O for God’s sake, where is one with vision! O for God’s sake, where is one with insight! O for God’s sake, where is one with fairness who would perceive the fragrance of the Beloved in all that appears from Him, who would judge with truth and detach himself from every stubborn denier, who would purify himself from all allusions and cry out between earth and heaven: “I have become independent through God from all that has been created in existence, and I shall remain, through God’s might, steadfast in His Cause!” Thus has the Dove of Eternity spoken in the heaven of glory, out of love for you and mercy upon your being, that you might be transformed from the left of fancy to the exalted station at the right hand. Then know that We found in the heart of she whom God made your companion a sorrow, which We have changed to joy by Our command, that God might grant you the gladness of the Cause from this Tree which was planted by the hand of the All-Merciful in the highest paradise in truth. And as for what you desired regarding your presence before the Face, We love this and permit you in truth. No harm shall befall you, and what you desire shall not become known among the people. Thus has the matter been decreed from the Pen of Destiny by One who is Mighty and Wise. And should you attain Our presence, you would discover what none in all the worlds has discovered, and witness what has befallen My soul at the hands of those who were created by My word, and you would be possessed of brilliant insight. And glory be upon you and upon those who are with you on a straight path.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Friend! To God belongs the Most Exalted Similitude!</p>
<p>The spiritual rose hath appeared in the divine Ridvan at the advent of the spring of inner meanings, yet the outward nightingales remain deprived. The rose proclaimeth: “O nightingales! I am your Beloved, and I have appeared in the fullness of My hue and fragrant breath, and in My transcendent grace and freshness. Consort ye with the Friend and flee not from the Beloved.” The metaphorical nightingales respond: “We are from the people of Yathrib and are accustomed to the rose of Hijaz, while thou art of the people of Truth and hast unveiled thyself in the garden of ’Iraq.”</p>
<p>The rose replied: “It is now evident that ye have ever been deprived of the beauty of the All-Merciful and have never truly known Me. Rather, ye have known but walls and pillars and abodes. For had ye known Me, ye would not now flee from your Beloved. O nightingales! I am neither of Yathrib, nor of Ba??a, nor of ’Iraq, nor of Syria. Rather, I journey and wander through diverse lands - sometimes in Egypt, sometimes in Bethlehem and Galilee, sometimes in Hijaz, sometimes in ’Iraq and Persia, and now I have unveiled Myself in Adrianople. Ye are known for your love of Me, yet ye remain heedless of Me. It hath become clear that ye are ravens who have learned the ways of the nightingale. Ye wander in the realm of fancy and imitation, deprived of the blessed garden of unity.</p>
<p>Your example is like that owl who once said to a nightingale that the raven sang better than he. The nightingale replied: “O owl! Why hast thou abandoned justice and turned thine eyes from truth? Every claim requireth proof and every statement evidence. Here am I present, and here is the raven - let him sing that I may sing.” The owl said: “This statement is unacceptable and rejected, for once I heard a sweet melody from a garden, and when I inquired about its singer, I was told it was a raven. Moreover, I saw a raven fly from that garden, so I was convinced the speaker spoke truth.”</p>
<p>The helpless nightingale said: “O owls! That was not the raven’s song but mine, and now I shall sing for thee that very same melody, nay better and more wondrous still.” The owl replied: “I pay no heed to such words, nor do I accept such statements, for thus have I heard from my forebears and peers. Moreover, that raven is present and holds documentary evidence. If it were thee, how is it his name became renowned?” The nightingale said: “O unjust one! The hunter of malice lay in ambush for me, and the sword of tyranny pursued me from behind. Thus was the raven’s name spread abroad while I, through the very intensity of my manifestation, remained hidden, and through the very perfection of my song became known as silent. Yet those possessed of hearing can distinguish the melody of the All-Merciful from the croaking of ravens. Now observe thou the essential voice and tune, that the truth may become manifest unto thee.”</p>
<p>O ye who appear as nightingales! Ye seem like that owl who would not exchange a particle of fancy for a hundred thousand certainties, nor trade a single word of hearsay for the realm of direct vision and revelation. Hearken ye to the counsel of the Friend and gaze not upon the countenance of the Beloved through the eyes of strangers. Know Me through Myself, not through My dwelling place or abode.</p>
<p>While they were thus discoursing, suddenly from the blessed garden there appeared a new nightingale who entered in the divine garment and heavenly melody, and circling around the flower, said: “O nightingales! Though ye are nightingales in form, yet for some time ye have consorted with ravens and their ways have become manifest and evident in you. This Paradise is not your abode; fly away and depart! This spiritual flower is the trysting-place of nightingales who nest in the all-merciful realm. Therefore, O human nightingales, strive to know the Friend and cut off the autumn’s transgressing hand from this flower of the All-Merciful’s Paradise. That is, O friends of God, gird up firmly the loins of service and protect the people of the world from the deceit and hypocrisy of the people of discord. And if ye appear among the servants with humility, submissiveness, and other qualities of truth, the hem of sanctity will remain pure and unstained from the calumnies of Satan and his manifestations, and the lies of the slanderers will become manifest and evident to all the peoples of the world. But if, God forbid, unseemly deeds be witnessed from you, all will revert to the holy court, and those very deeds will confirm the calumnies of the polytheists. And this is the certain truth, and praise be to God, the Beloved of the worlds.”</p>

<p>In the name of Him from Whom proceedeth fear and hope! The first utterance of the Creator is this: Come ye forth before the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing, and the All-Powerful with hearts pure from desire and defilement, and minds cleansed from the colors of creation, and bring forth that which befitteth His Day. This is the Day of Meeting, for God hath appeared unveiled and manifest. Hasten with pure hearts that ye may attain and discover that which is befitting. Purify yourselves with the water of detachment from covetousness and unseemly deeds, that ye may discover the mystery of the Day of the Self-Subsisting. The Primal Light hath appeared in the Final Day. Through three things shall the Meeting be attained and deliverance made manifest: purity of heart, purity of sight, and purity of hearing from that which hath been heard. Say: O friends! The Guide hath come, His utterance distinguished among utterances, His path manifest among paths. His is the Path - find it! His is the Word - hear it! Today the clouds of God’s bounty are raining down, and the Sun of Knowledge shineth forth and showeth the way. The noble one is he who hath abandoned the paths of conjecture and taken to the path of God. O friends! The mighty hand of God hath rent asunder the veils of fancy that the eye might see and the ear might not be deprived of hearing. This is the Day of Hearing - hear ye the utterance of the Peerless Friend and conduct yourselves in a manner that befitteth. From Persian utterance We now turn to Arabic:</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned! Hear the Call that hath been raised from the Prison of Akka, calling the servants unto God, the Lord of Creation. Reflect upon that which hath appeared that thou mayest behold what no eye of creation hath seen. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Beware lest the things of the world withhold thee from the Lord of Eternity. Leave behind suspicions and their manifestations, and vain imaginings and their dawning-places, turning unto God, the Lord of the Beginning and the End. This is the Day of Vision, for the Greatest Scene hath been illumined by the lights of the manifestation of the Lord of Destiny, Who hath come from the heaven of utterance with proof and evidence. And this is the Day of Hearing wherein the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen hath been raised between earth and heaven. Hearken, and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Desire of the world, and glory be unto Thee, O Lord of all men.</p>
<p>O thou who asketh! Today the Light speaketh and the Fire uttereth and the Sun of Truth shineth forth. Strive that thou mayest attain unto that which befitteth the Day of God. If thou wouldst reflect upon that which hath been manifested, thou wouldst find thyself independent of questioning. God is sanctified above the doubts and fancies and will and desire of men. He hath come with “He doeth what He willeth” and the banner of “He ordaineth what He pleaseth.” He hath made manifest proof and evidence above the station of all contingent beings. His verses are found and witnessed in Books, Scriptures, Psalms and Tablets, and His evidences are manifest and clear in the Surih of the Kings and the Surih of Ra’is. None hath the right to test the Lord - verily He testeth His servants as He willeth. If thou wouldst in truth observe with the eye of fairness that which We have mentioned, and hearken with the ear of justice, thou wouldst utter “I have returned unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds,” detached from all peoples. Hear the call of the Wronged One. Remove thy step from the stations of doubt and fancy of the people of contingent being and place it in the realm of the Absolute, that thou mayest hear the warbling of the birds of the Throne and the melodies of the nightingales of knowledge upon the highest branches. We beseech God to assist thee and enable thee to do that which He loveth and pleaseth. Verily He is the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust beneath. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. When the attraction of the Call from the Supreme Horizon taketh hold of thee, say: […]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! I bear witness to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and to Thy might, Thy majesty and Thy sovereignty. I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned to Thee, detached from all else save Thee, hoping for the wonders of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the rain from the clouds of the heaven of Thy generosity and by the mysteries of Thy Book to assist me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. O my Lord! This is a servant who hath turned away from vain imaginings unto the horizon of certitude, who hath stood before the door of Thy bounty, who hath resigned all affairs unto Thee and placed his trust in Thee. Do Thou ordain for him that which befitteth the heaven of Thy generosity and the ocean of Thy grace. Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. I testify, O my God, that Thou knowest me better than I know myself. Ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and benefit me in the world to come and in this world. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all beings, and in Thy grasp are the reins of bounty and bestowal. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Glory be unto the people of Baha who were not kept back by the clamor of the nations from the Ancient Lord, who arose and proclaimed: God is our Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Exalted, the Most Luminous!</p>
<p>This is a Book that speaketh with truth, wherein is mentioned that which gladdeneth the hearts of the mystics, and through which the breezes of holiness are wafted over all created things. Say: We have ordained on this Night joy for Our chosen ones, and thereafter delight for Our near servants. Say: O people of the earth! Hearken unto the call of God from the divine Lote-Tree in this sacred and luminous Valley, that there is none other God but Him, and that ’Ali-before-Nabil is the Sovereign of existence, all are His servants and all shall return unto Him. Say: O concourse of earth! Be not grieved on this blessed, holy, eternal Night of Oneness, and be not among the sorrowing ones. Celebrate on this Night and its morn, then glorify and magnify and praise your Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Say: By God! This is the Night wherein the Temple of God was established upon a mighty holy throne, and through which were illumined the faces of all contingent beings, then the faces of the dwellers of the pavilion of eternity, then the faces of those near unto God. O concourse of earth! Deprive not yourselves of His beauty, seize ye the grace from His presence and be not of the losers. Say: Hasten ye to the paradise of God and His presence. By God! He hath appeared in such wise as to dazzle eyes from beholding His beauty, if ye be of them that see. Say: The mighty oceans have surged from this tempestuous, foam-flecked, billowing, flowing, great Sea, and the heaven hath been raised from this heaven which was elevated in this Glory. Seek ye shelter in its shade if ye be of them that know. Say: There hath appeared a grace that no grace in creation hath preceded it, if ye be of them that hear. Say: O people! Dispute not concerning Him and follow not your desires, and be not of the heedless. Follow ye the ways of God in this Cause which hath appeared in truth upon the Temple of the Youth, before whom prostrate themselves the dwellers of the heavens and earth. Say: He hath been named in the most exalted Concourse as Muhammad, then in the canopy of eternity as the Spirit, then from behind the holy pavilion as the Interlocutor, then in the celestial realm of immortality as ’Ali in truth, if ye be of the assured ones. Therefore, celebrate within yourselves, then rejoice in your souls, and say with the melody of your hearts: This is the Beauty of God which hath appeared in truth, blessed be God, the Creator of all beings. O concourse of the Bayan! Draw ye near unto this Fire which hath been kindled in this wilderness and hath appeared upon the Temple of the Square in the form of the Triangle, and which speaketh forth the truth at every moment that there is none other God but I, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful. By God! There is no escape for anyone in these days save by entering beneath My shadow, and this is what hath been inscribed by the Finger of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Sadiq! Give thanks to God, thy Lord, inasmuch as He hath singled thee out for that which none among all created things hath been singled out, and hath raised up through thee all who mention within themselves the name of their Lord, though they recognize Him not. Thus hath Our mercy preceded all things, and We are the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Bestower, the Bountiful, the All-Generous. By God! Were We to desire it, We would raise up from thee the creation of the first and the last. However, when We found the people of the Bayan more veiled than the people of the Furqan, We therefore concealed the Cause from them and covered Ourselves with a thick veil. Turn thou away from all else but the face of thy Lord, and remain under mighty protection. By God! The Sun of eternity hath dawned from the horizon of glory and the mountains have passed away like the passing of clouds, if ye be of them that perceive. Say: O concourse of the loved ones, rejoice within yourselves! Then, O concourse of the hateful ones, perish in your wrath! The Cause hath appeared in truth and there is no escape for anyone in all the worlds. Say: He hath appeared in such wise that were He to take a handful of dust and breathe into it the spirit of life, it would, by God’s leave, become everlasting - He, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing. Thus have We made manifest the Cause unto thee and sent down the verses in truth and expounded them for thee, that thine eyes may be solaced thereby and thou mayest be of them that remember. O Sadiq! We counsel thee at the end of this Tablet to read these verses and preserve them within thyself, that thou mayest be of them that guard. And when thou beholdest in anyone’s countenance the radiance of God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful, recite unto him what We have now revealed unto thee, that perchance he may arise from the couches of heedlessness and flee unto a manifest place of security. Thus doth the Dove of Holiness counsel thee and the Pen of the Command instruct thee, lest thou be grieved within thyself for less than a moment, and remember thy Lord at all times, and be of them that are assured. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who have turned toward the shore of the Cause on the coast of this surging and mighty ocean.</p>

<p>O Ahmad! Upon you be My salutation. Your letter reached the Wronged One in the Most Great Prison. According to what was mentioned, you have desired to purify your heart and breast with the Kawthar of utterance which has flowed from the Pen of Evidence, and to turn toward the Most Exalted Horizon. Recognition of this most exalted station and supreme pinnacle is a bounty from God, exalted be His glory. If you would reflect upon the previous Manifestations and enter the ocean of fairness, in accordance with this exalted word which states “Lord, cause me to enter the depths of the ocean of Thy oneness,” you would surely attain to the splendors of the Sun of Truth. This is why it has been said “and in its depths shineth the sun.” For this station is, in truth, the station of Qadar. We beseech God to grant you a portion of the Kawthar of this utterance, that you may advance from Qadar, which is the station of measure and proportion, to the manifestation of Qada, and become cognizant thereof, even as it has been said “Qada is the composition of what has been measured.”</p>
<p>This Wronged One, from the earliest days until now, has summoned all, both kings and subjects, with the loudest call to God, glorified be His majesty. The purpose was that departed glory might return and the fallen, discarded standards might be raised again. Yet until now the heedless servants have not understood the purpose and have not shown fairness. Observe how the people of divine unity appeared with such power and ascendancy in the early days, and to what weakness they are now subjected. What became of that power, and whence came this weakness? The aim was none other than the exaltation of the Word of God and likewise the salvation of humanity. Surely you have heard what they have said and what they have done. This is not the first Cause to appear in the world, nor the first flask to be broken in Islam.</p>
<p>My God, my God! This servant of Thine and son of Thy servant beareth witness to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and to that which the tongue of Thy chosen ones and Thy messengers hath spoken. I beseech Thee, O God of all beings and Goal of all things, by Him through Whom Thou hast adorned the heavens of Thy might, and by the lights of His countenance, and by the Word whereby Thou didst bring all created things into being and didst perfect Thy proof unto all who are in Thy earth and Thy heaven, to make me in all conditions steadfast in Thy Cause, firm in Thy service, and speaking forth Thy praise. I moreover beseech Thee, O God of the seen and the unseen, by Thy praised station and by Thy Name that domineth every witness and witnessed thing, to assist me to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy signs, the Dayspring of Thy revelation, the Source of Thy command, and the Fountainhead of Thy knowledge. Verily Thou art He Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate and no cause can hinder. Thy might hath transcended the might of the world and Thy will hath transcended the will of the nations. Thou art God; there is none other God but Thee, the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O My Arab! Then O My loved ones! Then O My chosen ones! Then O My hosts! Then O My manifestations! Hearken unto My call, if ye be of them that hear. Have ye forgotten the Dove of the Cause that took flight from your midst and ascended unto God, the Mighty, the Beautiful? Have ye forgotten the Mystic Dove that was with you and recited unto you from the verses of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise? Have ye veiled yourselves from this Nightingale that fell beneath the talons of the idolaters? By God! There hath befallen Me that which cannot be mentioned in words, and tears have flowed from the eyes of them that are nigh unto God. And by this the Hoopoe of the Cause hath ceased to mention Sheba, and the faces of the holy ones have been reddened with blood. By God! The Nightingale of Paradise hath shut its eyes to the beauty of the rose by reason of the sorrows that have befallen this Beauty, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. The rivers have been cut off from union with the sea, as joy hath been cut off from this radiant and luminous Sun.</p>
<p>O My loved ones! Forget not My presence in My days, deny not My loving-kindness toward you, nor My favor upon you, and be not of the heedless. By God! The tradition of God concerning the soul of Husayn hath returned, nay the traditions of the Messengers, until I arrived in this most remote Prison. And when ye gather in your homes in your days of joy, then remember Our tribulations and what hath befallen Us at the hands of the hosts of Satan. And when ye enter your gardens in springtime, then reflect upon My afflictions and My sorrow, and be of them that remember.</p>
<p>Let none wrong another, nor let any companion speak ill of his companion, nor let any brother deny his believing brother. Fear God in all that We have revealed unto you, and be among the God-fearing. Beware lest ye withhold the surplus of your means from them that are near of kin unto you, and from the poor and the needy. All this is My counsel unto you and the command of God for you and unto you, if ye be of those who understand. Thus do We impart unto you verses of divine unity and that which ye have been commanded, that ye may unite with your Creator through your inner and outer tongue in such wise that the evidence thereof may be manifest in all your limbs, and that ye may be among those who profess His unity. God is He unto Whom your souls, your hearts, your spirits, your bodies, and all that ye possess and all that pertaineth unto you shall return, and verily He is the repository of all who are in the heavens and on earth, if ye be of those who understand. The Spirit be upon you, O concourse of loved ones, young and old alike. Then glorify ye, on Our behalf, your wives and your children, for this is My command unto you: follow it, that ye may be among the rightly guided.</p>

Today the Sinai circleth round the throne of His Revelation, and the Herald of Grandeur calleth out from the horizon of the heaven of might, “Blessed art thou, O Earth,” for thou hast been honored by the footsteps of the Lord, the Self-Subsisting, and hast been illumined by the lights of the Sun of Truth.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-Ibrahim, upon thee be My glory! In these days of sorrow, grief hath encompassed the Goal of all existence from every direction, for the claimants of love have manifested such tyranny as hath had and hath no parallel. They have shackled trustworthiness, truthfulness and sincerity. By the life of God! They have wrought that which hath caused the very essence of truth to weep.</p>
<p>O Ibrahim! The horizons are afflicted in the fire of discord. Today pure deeds are the helpers of His Cause, and true fear of God is its defender and aid. Convey My greetings to the friends in that land and counsel them to fear God and to detachment, that they may attain unto that which shall endure forever in the Book of God. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath attained unto My Day and hath drunk the choice wine of My utterance from the hand of My bounty.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Mahdi! He who loveth Me hath mentioned thee, and We make mention of thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing Remembrancer. The deeds of the peoples have darkened the world. God, exalted be His glory, hath created mankind for the betterment of the world and the elevation of their stations, that all might become ready to hearken unto a Word at the mention of which both pen and ink stand powerless. However, a few have manifested such wickedness as hath had and hath no equal. Like unto wolves they have rent asunder His loved ones, hamstrung His she-camel, and caused His ark to sink. Fie upon them and their faithlessness! O friends! Hold fast unto wisdom and unto that which God hath chosen. Act in accordance with that which draweth nigh the servants and causeth the dwellers of all lands to be attracted. This is the divine counsel whose light hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of grace. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto the heedless!</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Taqi! Have not the deeds and traces of Truth been distinguished from those of others? Hath there been any doubt concerning the effulgences of the light of His Manifestation? Nay, by His own Self, the True One! Selfish desires have held men back from the most exalted horizon. Say: Have mercy upon yourselves and turn with penetrating vision and attentive ears that ye may not be deprived of witnessing and hearkening. This is the greatest counsel which the Most Great Announcement hath commanded. Blessed are they that act!</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabl-Baqir! Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto the bounty of utterance and the table of divine knowledge - the goal of all the peoples of the world. Divine forgiveness and mercy have at this hour encompassed thee and thy parents, as a grace from God, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful, and as a bounty from the Kind, the Generous One. We make mention of thy wife who hath believed and responded when she heard the call of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O My handmaiden! Praise thou the Desired One, that thou hast been granted permission to attain unto this most exalted Word. Say: Thine is the praise, O Lord of the world, and Thine is the glory, O Desire of the nations, and Thine is the splendor, O Beloved of those who dwell in the heavens and on earth. We make mention of those whom God hath related unto thee, both female and male, and We give them the glad-tidings of My remembrance through which the fragrance of the garment hath been wafted abroad and the Temple of Sanctity hath spoken forth from the most exalted Paradise: “The Kingdom and the Dominion belong unto God, the Lord of creation, the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust below.” The glory from Us be upon you, O people of Baha, and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>Honorable teacher, upon whom be all the Most Glorious Glory! He is the Most Holy, the Most Great!</p>
<p>O friend! By the life of God, the story of sacrifice has returned, and what was hidden in God’s knowledge, Lord of all worlds. The bird of faithfulness has flown from the branch of this world to the Divine Lote-Tree by what the hands of the oppressors have wrought. We testify that he is in a joy unequaled by any joy in creation, while his loved ones are in such grief that all things lament for them. Verily thy Lord is the All-Informed Expositor. By God! They have profited in their transaction while the oppressors are in manifest loss. Did Husayn, My name, lose when he sacrificed his spirit in the path of God, or did those who wronged him by following every remote transgressor? Oppression has reached a stage where the tongue is powerless to describe it, and beyond it is every numberer, all-knowing. They have kindled a fire whose flames shall not be extinguished in the world. Thus doth inform thee He with Whom is the knowledge of all things in a clear Book.</p>
<p>O friend! Observe how manifest and evident have become both the truth of Truth and the misguidance of falsehood. All testify that from that Wronged One was manifested the utmost love, kindness and care toward all peoples, and no act appeared from him that was contrary - that is, nothing that would cause sedition or corruption. And how many of the poor strangers did they assist in times of hardship! To this testifieth every truthful one, and beyond him thy Lord, the All-Informed. Should anyone reflect upon them and what appeared from his Lord’s favors toward him, he would observe with the eye of certainty that in what transpired there was and shall be great wisdom. The Most Great Sacrifice and Supreme Offering have appeared in this mighty Cause.</p>
<p>By the Sun of the horizon of power: if the world had any worth, the Ancient Beauty would not have dwelt for numbered years in the Most Great Prison. Man, so long as he is in this world, has been and is in truth in the throes of death, save for those detached hearts that behold all things with divine vision. God willing, that honored one should, according to his capacity, instill calm and assurance in illumined hearts, that tranquility may possess them after agitation, and joy after sorrow. Thus does He Who remembers you command you from this exalted station. O Khalil! A momentous matter has occurred in the world, although greater than it has appeared, as you yourself have witnessed and can testify. However, since the Hand of Power had preserved it for a long time and then suddenly this irrevocable matter appeared, it has become the cause of lamentation, mourning and trembling. Yet with thy Lord is that which will gladden hearts after this great sorrow. Say: This is a testimony whose traces have penetrated the world; God will soon make it manifest in truth. Verily He is the One with power over what He willeth. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have hearkened to thy word concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>PRAISE be unto him who is the All-Knowing Witness! O Samandar! The Most Glorious Name hath appeared in his glory, and thou wert mentioned before the Wronged One, and We have made mention of thee. He, verily, is the All-Knowing Rememberer. May the All-Merciful grant that thou mayest at all times be engaged in serving the Cause, mentioning souls, and elevating existence. The letter thou didst send to him was presented in its entirety by the servant present before Us, and that which was sent by Andalib, upon him be the Glory of God, was also heard. From some of its contents joy and gladness were obtained. Blessed is he, and again blessed is he, for having spoken the truth and prevented Satan from ascending and Gog from entering.</p>
<p>God willing, may they be occupied with the mention of the Lord of all beings in all nights and days, and stand firm in service to His Cause. Were the world to be observed free, sanctified and purified from satanic whisperings, assuredly the Cause of God would encompass the East and West of the earth. The heedless people are themselves the preventers of divine bounties, and through their impure deeds and false words have deprived themselves of God’s infinite favors. By Him through Whose Name the Bridge was erected and the Balance established! Were people to follow what they have been commanded in the Book, thou wouldst see the entire earth as a piece of Paradise.</p>
<p>God willing, may they be confirmed at all times and be watchful and turned toward the stronghold of the Cause, lest any doubtful polytheist or heedless liar enter therein. In all ages there have been such false souls, as attested by the Books of God from before and after. He, verily, is the Expositor, the True, the Trustworthy.</p>
<p>Mention was made of one of the loved ones of God named Ali. We make mention of him at this time that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones. O Ali! God willing, may thou break the idol of vain imaginings with the strength of certitude - that is, hold fast to proof and explanation, and prevent the satans and transgressors from ascending. What is accounted today as the greatest of deeds is steadfastness in the Cause of God, for the cawing ones have been and are lying in wait for the friends of the Beloved of all possibility. Ask God, exalted be His glory, to preserve the garden of inner meanings from the foul winds of falsehood and ignorance and from the poisonous breaths of the whisperers. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>The Glory be upon thee and upon those who spoke the truth in the Days of God, the Lord of the worlds. Likewise, the petition of Muhammad-Aqa, upon him be the Glory of God, was sent. A Tablet hath been revealed for him from the heaven of Divine Will. God willing, may they attain unto the pearls of the ocean of the Most Merciful’s utterance and be detached from all save the Friend.</p>
<p>O Samandar! God willing, mayest thou be engaged in all conditions in aiding the Truth through wisdom and utterance. An expounder and counselor is necessary, and there hath already flowed from the Pen of the Most Merciful concerning the conditions of utterance that which causeth the fire of divine love to be kindled in the hearts of the servants. How many are the words that cause the exaltation, ascension and enkindling of the people, and how many cause coldness and apathy. One word kindleth the fire of love while another extinguisheth it.</p>
<p>God willing, may ye be confirmed. Say: O friends! Observe all things with penetrating vision and hear the verses of the Revealer of verses with attentive ears. In all conditions ye must be vigilant, and the banners of justice and wisdom must be raised before all faces. This word is like unto the sun that hath shone forth from the horizon of the Divine Tablet. Blessed are they that behold it.</p>
<p>Jinab-i-’Abdu’l-Baqi hath proceeded to that region with wondrous and sublime Tablets, and special Tablets have also been revealed and sent for certain souls mentioned in the letter of Aqa ’Ali. All the souls mentioned, before and after, living and dead, have attained unto divine favors. God willing, may the utterances of Truth become the cause and means of warming cold souls. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have held fast to the wisdom of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O Samandar! A most mighty and holy Tablet hath been revealed and sent from the heaven of Will in the name of Nabil ibn Nabil. God willing, may they attain unto it. Likewise a Tablet specifically for Mulla ?adiq. All that hath been mentioned and is being mentioned - wondrous and sublime Tablets have been and are being revealed and sent from the heaven of the Most Merciful’s mercy. Ask God to confirm them all and cause them to attain unto the pearls of the ocean of the Most Merciful’s utterance. He, verily, is the Hearing, the Answering.</p>
<p>Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the friends in that land. God willing, may all be observed as firm and steadfast in the Cause of the Luminary of the horizons in perfect unity and harmony. The Glory be upon them from the presence of the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Most Great, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>The servant testifieth at the beginning of this epistle to the oneness and singleness of his Lord - He Who hath ever been One, Single, Alone, and Self-Subsisting. He hath taken unto Himself no likeness, no partner, no helper, and no peer. He created the Supreme Pen and caused it to speak forth the Most Exalted Word, whereupon all contingent things were shaken to their foundation, all created things appeared, the tongue of utterance spoke forth in the kingdom of knowledge, and the dove of the Cause cooed upon the branches. Verily, there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been powerful over whatsoever He willeth and supreme over His servants. He doeth what He pleaseth through His sovereignty and ordaineth what He desireth through His command. He is the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>And the prayer that hath shone forth from the Most Sublime Horizon, and the light that hath beamed from the Most Exalted Paradise, be upon the Essence of existence and the Sovereign of the unseen and the seen, through Whom all created things were brought into being and all existing things appeared, through Whom the ocean of divine knowledge surged in the contingent world and the sweet fragrance of the All-Merciful was wafted throughout all lands. And upon His family and companions, through whom countries were conquered and the hearts of servants were set ablaze, through whom the necks of the mighty were brought low and the fortresses of kings were taken, and through whom divine power seized all creation save those who clung to their mountains, grasped their hems, hastened to their shadow, and acknowledged that which their tongues had uttered. The servant beseecheth God, his Lord, through Him and through them, to exalt His Cause and manifest His Faith, though the idolaters be averse thereto.</p>
<p>And now, O my beloved one who art mentioned in my heart, my ears have been blessed by the melodies of the doves of thy noble utterance and mine eyes by beholding thy words. When I read and understood them, I sought the ultimate goal and presented them before His Face. Thereupon the River of Life overflowed in such wise that none could draw nigh unto it, for its waves appeared as mountains. By the life of the Desired One! The servant acknowledgeth his powerlessness and inability to express that which flowed from the mouth of grace - rivers of knowledge and wisdom. Yet I shall mention what was impressed upon the mirror of my memory. He spoke, and His sweetest words were these:</p>
<p>“O servant who art present before the Wronged One! Know thou that I love the H and S who was imprisoned in the path of God and bore hardships in His love and good-pleasure. We send Our greetings and glorification upon him and upon those who are with him, both male and female, young and old. We make mention of them in such wise as to kindle within their hearts the lights of the love of God, and We counsel them with that which will elevate the station of man in the contingent world, and We give them glad-tidings of My remembrance of them and My turning towards them.</p>
<p>O friends! Be not grieved by the upheavals of the world, for that which endureth not is unworthy. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of utterance that ere long all that is seen shall return to nothingness, and that which hath been and forever shall be the cause of life and eternal remembrance is the good-pleasure of God, exalted be His glory. Blessed is the soul that hath been illumined by this light and hath attained unto this station. In the nights and days, this Wronged One seeketh the protection of the friends from all that God abhorreth.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Upon thee be My glory and My peace. Exert mighty efforts in training the souls that are with you. Convey to your family and children the greetings from the Wronged One and say: Grieve not and be not sorrowful. God shall soon open before your faces the gates of grace and mercy. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The cause and source of divine outpourings today is steadfastness in the love of God and the preservation of whatsoever hath been revealed in the Book from the Supreme Pen. Should all who are on earth attain unto that which God desireth, they would achieve true tranquility. He is the All-Loving, He is the All-Giving. There is none other God but He, the Forgiving, the Generous.”</p>
<p>Thus endeth His words. From this evanescent one, convey greetings to all. God is my witness and testifier that they have not departed from my sight. God willing, may they be adorned with that which God loveth and be embellished with the ornament of piety. You had mentioned that his honor Aqa Mirza ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God, is now occupied. This matter was the cause of greatest joy, for all are commanded to engage in a craft, which is indeed accounted as worship before God. The members of the pavilion of chastity send their greetings and glorification to all the honored women, saying: “God willing, may all be protected, and may the mother of Mirza ’Ali-Akbar be adorned with the ornament of health and well-being.” Each of the friends sendeth greetings and offereth glorification. Peace and glory, shining from the horizon of the heaven of grace, be upon you and upon those with you, and upon those who act in accordance with that which they have been commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise be to our Lord, the All-Merciful, Who created man and taught him utterance, and deposited within him a sign from among His greatest signs, and made known to him the path that leadeth unto Him and the way to turn toward the lights shining from the horizon of His bounty. And blessings and peace be upon the best of His creation, and His mystery, and the mystery of His mystery, and the concealer of His mystery, and the one invested with His mystery, through whom the door of divine knowledge was opened to all who dwell in the realm of possibility, and the fragrance of the All-Merciful was diffused among all religions, and upon His family and His companions, whom no blame of any blamer, nor the assault of any oppressor, nor the doubts of any learned one could deter from God. They stood with supreme steadfastness among all peoples and declared: “God is our Lord, and the Lord of the throne and the earth, and the Master of the hereafter and this world.” These are servants who aided the Cause of God with true aid, in such wise that neither armies nor ranks could hold them back, until the light of unity encompassed all and that which God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, had purposed was made manifest.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter of your honor was received and the fragrance of sincerity and devotion was detected therefrom. When I found it and read it and understood it, I approached the Presence and presented it before the Lord. He–may my spirit be offered up for His sake–said: “O Lutf-’Ali! Upon thee be My peace! The Wronged One hath heard thy call and hath answered thee with that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Say:</p>
<p>“O my God, my Lord, my Support, my Purpose, my Object of worship and my Hope! I testify to that which Thy Prophets and Messengers have testified, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Thou hast ever been sanctified beyond the mention of aught else but Thee, and exalted above the description of aught besides Thee. Every possessor of hearing and sight hath testified to Thy oneness and singleness, and to that which the tongue of Thy grandeur testified before the creation of Thy earth and heaven. O Lord! Thou beholdest me turning unto Thee, directing myself toward the lights of Thy manifestation, clinging to the cord of Thy bounty, and holding fast to the hem of the robe of Thy generosity and favor. O Lord! This is one of Thy servants who hath desired to drink, from the hands of Thy bounty, the Kawthar of Thy knowledge, and to draw near, through Thy generosity, to the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Dawning-Place of Thy clear tokens. O Lord! Deprive him not of Thy outpourings and gifts, then send down upon him from the heaven of Thy mercy that which will purify him from the mention of any save Thee and strengthen him to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee. O Lord! Thou seest me turning away from all else but Thee and advancing toward the gate of Thy grace, hoping for that which Thy Most Exalted Pen hath ordained for such of Thy servants as are detached and such of Thy creation as are sincere, whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from turning toward Thy horizon and drawing nigh unto the tabernacle of Thy glory. I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of existence and King of the seen and unseen, by Thy Name through which Thou hast guided Thy servants to the shore of the ocean of Thy nearness and hast manifested that which lay hidden in Thy knowledge, to number me among such as are in Thy Cause, upon whom no fear shall come, nor shall they grieve. O Lord! Adorn my head with the crown of Thy favor, my heart with the light of Thy knowledge, my tongue with Thy remembrance, and my ear with the hearing of Thy verses. O Lord! Forgive my transgressions which have prevented me from turning toward Thee, and my sins which have kept me far from the station of Thy nearness. Verily Thou art He Who hath ever been praised in His deeds, obeyed in His command, and sovereign in His will. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the world and Educator of the nations, by Thy Most Great Name, to assist me to perform such deeds as will cause the fragrance of Thy good-pleasure to be diffused, and that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. There is no God but Thee, the One, the Single, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth the Ever-Abiding Truth to strengthen your honor to drink from the hidden seas contained within the manifest, shining words, and to be illumined by their lights. The world hath been deprived of the lights of the Orb of Certitude by vain imaginings. They speak but comprehend not; they talk but perceive not. In these days the blessed verse “they have eyes wherewith they see not” hath been and is manifested. However, this servant beseecheth and imploreth the Truth not to withhold from your honor the rain of His mercy, and to grant a portion from the ocean of His grace. He is the Lord of the kingdom of bounty and generosity, and He is the All-Bountiful One Whom the world and all that is therein cannot prevent from His grace and favor. His mercy hath ever preceded, and His bounty hath ever taken precedence. His is the praise in all conditions. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Peace be upon you and upon God’s sincere servants, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>Praise be to God, thou hast drunk from the ocean of divine bounty and turned thy face to the Most Exalted Horizon. All the diverse peoples of the earth were waiting, yet when the Sun of Truth dawned from the horizon of the world, all turned away save whom God willed. Were the stations of the souls of the assured to be mentioned today, there would be fear that some might perish from excessive joy. The Point of the Bayan hath said that a one-year old seed of the Day of His Revelation is mightier than all who are in the Bayan. And likewise He hath said: “I have written a gem concerning His remembrance: He shall not be indicated by My indication, nor by what hath been revealed in the Bayan.” Should a soul ponder the hidden oceans within this most exalted Word, he would become somewhat aware of the station of this Most Great, Most Holy, Most Exalted Cause. When the station of the Manifestation is understood, the station of them that circle round Him becomes clear and evident. By God! The breath that proceedeth from a soul in this Cause cannot be equaled by all the treasures of the earth. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto the heedless! Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto this station. God willing, thou art confirmed in preserving it. The servant present read thy letter. Blessed art thou for having acknowledged that which God hath acknowledged and that which was inscribed in His Books, His Scriptures and His Tablets. Concerning the gathering of souls which thou didst mention, verily We make mention of each one of them as a token of Our grace. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>He is the Most Ancient, the Most Great</p>
<p>O son of My Name! My Most Exalted Pen beareth witness that thou didst migrate for the sake of God until thou didst attain the presence at the Gate and didst hear His sweetest call and didst drink the choice wine of His bounty, detached from all else but Him, and didst traverse the lands to exalt His Word and elevate His remembrance among the concourse of creation. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath heard thy words concerning this Cause, through which, when it was manifested, the foundations of them that disbelieved in God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, were shaken.</p>
<p>He is the Manifest, the Hidden</p>
<p>O Lion! The Wronged One Who hath appeared through His Name, the Self-Subsisting, maketh mention of thee and calleth all to the Most Exalted Horizon, the Station from which the lights of the Countenance have shone forth after the passing away of all things. I testify that thou hast attained unto that which most of the servants have not attained. Thou hast journeyed in My path, aided My Cause, and chosen exile for love of My Beauty and desire to exalt My Word. We testify that thou art beneath the glances of the tender mercy of the Lord of all beings and art guarded by the eye of God that slumbereth not.</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed</p>
<p>O Friend! We have made mention of thee before and make mention of thee at this time, that the attraction of thy Lord’s verses may so seize thee that neither the affairs of the world nor the veils of the peoples shall hold thee back. Blessed art thou and blessed is the house wherein My remembrance hath been raised and wherein My chosen ones who have turned to My horizon, spoken My praise, and arisen to serve My Cause, the Mighty, the Wondrous, have gathered.</p>
<p>He is the Witness, the Enduring, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O Hassan! The Lord of the hidden and the manifest maketh mention of thee and counseleth thee with that whereby the Cause of God may be exalted amongst His servants and His creation. Hold fast unto that which thou hast been commanded and say:</p>
<p>O my God! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the signs of Thy grandeur to aid me in all conditions to remember Thee, to praise Thee and to serve Thy loved ones. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>He is the One Who speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Speaking, the All-Wise</p>
<p>O Nasru’llah! By My life, he who hath known Me hath, from time immemorial, helped God, and this is the true meaning of help, as attested by the Tongue of Grandeur and confirmed by the realities of all things. Yet most men remain behind a mighty veil.</p>
<p>The Sovereign of Creation maketh mention of thee in such wise as to resurrect the dead through the perpetuity of His dominion, and giveth thee glad tidings of that which hath been inscribed for thee by the Pen of His Will – that whereby the eyes of the dwellers of the Kingdom of Names are solaced – and commandeth thee to observe that which beseemeth this Day, which was remembered in the hearts of the chosen ones and recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of all men.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that souls who were mentioned in the Book – souls who were sincere, assured and content – have each become the recipients of His special favors. Be thou thankful to God for this manifest grace and say:</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God and the God of all things, my Beloved and the Beloved of the hearts of the chosen ones! I beseech Thee by the hearts that have melted in their love and ardor for Thee, and by the hearts that have been consumed in their separation from Thee, to ordain for me that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. O Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and clinging to the cord of Thy bounty. I entreat Thee not to deny me the wonders of Thy generosity and the evidences of Thy grace. Thou art He before Whose Name the necks of them that are nigh unto Thee have bowed down, and before Whom the voices of them that have recognized Thy unity have been humbled. There is none other God but Thee, the Beloved of them that know Thee and the Desire of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who is the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Sacred, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath manifested in the kingdom whatsoever He desired and decreed for His servants in the hereafter that which draweth them nigh unto the Kingdom of Guidance, in such wise that neither the might of the mighty nor the power of princes could frustrate it. He raised His call from the Prison of ’Akka and summoned all creation unto His most sublime horizon. Among the people some attained, and others turned away from this supreme gift. Exalted is God, the Lord of all beings, above the acceptance of those who have turned towards Him and the rejection of those who have turned away. The faith of all created things profiteth Him not, nor doth the denial of all existence harm Him. He hath ever been, through His name the Self-Sufficient, independent of the worlds, and through His name the Sovereign, supreme over all nations. Every possessor of dominion is possessed before His presence, and every man of learning is ignorant before the manifestations of His knowledge. Eyes are dazzled by the effulgent splendors of His countenance, and vision is bewildered before the dawning rays of the Sun of His Cause. Every possessor of knowledge hath confessed his powerlessness to know Him, and every possessor of understanding his perplexity in comprehending His Essence. I bear witness that there is none other God but Him. He hath distinguished between the worlds through His Most Great Name, and made those who have turned to the horizon of Revelation to become the dawning-places of love and concord and the daysprings of mercy and unity. He then chose from among them servants whom He raised up to champion His Cause and exalt His Word throughout creation, sheltering them beneath His loving care and causing them to abide under the shadow of His bounty. These are they who have aided His Cause under all conditions. Upon them rest the Glory of God, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice for your standing firm in the Cause of the Self-Subsisting Lord of the heavens and earth. Though this servant hath repeatedly [undertaken that which] hath caused you trouble, several things have prompted this ephemeral pen to move and emboldened it. First is the intoxication of that blessed Countenance - may the Glory of God rest upon Him - with the wine of oneness, for in truth the heart by its nature and the pen by its character have regarded and continue to regard the mention of your honor as a blessing, and it is evident to those possessed of insight that whosoever in this day ariseth to serve God’s Cause is mentioned before the Divine Throne and in the presence of the Concourse on High. After establishing this station, though mention by this servant neither nourishes nor enriches, yet as the purpose is to express sincerity, God willing it shall not cause trouble but rather shall prove acceptable. Another reason is the burning of this ephemeral one’s heart, for he observes that while the Sun of loving-kindness is shining, the ocean of mercy is manifest, and the heaven of grace is raised high, most people remain heedless thereof and persist in hypocrisy, regarding mercy as vengeance and glory as abasement. With a hundred thousand deceits and schemes they have sought and continue to seek to harm the Lord of all causes. However, in His hand is the kingdom of all things; He will cause to flow whatsoever He willeth, and the word “God will perfect His light though the unbelievers are averse” hath been and shall remain fulfilled, despite them and those who cleave to idols. Each morn and eve they witness some souls pass away and observe the instability and faithlessness of the world, yet these unaware people remain submerged to their throats in the clay of hopes and desires. We beseech our Lord, the All-Merciful, to deliver them through His grace and save them from this overwhelming calamity, to cause them to hear His sweetest call and to behold His most sublime horizon. Verily He is the Almighty in both the beginning and the end.</p>
<p>So it was that in these days, as Shaykh Salman was preparing to attain the presence of His Holiness, this brief attempt was made. The petitions which had been with him were sent beforehand, and after a delay of two years, whatsoever reached the Most Holy Court received its answer from the heaven of grace. This time most of the petitions were adorned with the crown of mention by the Lord of Names, that it might serve as a testimony for those souls - that is to say, above the petitions was inscribed a gracious reply. Though much delayed, yet the authors thereof, whether living or dead, have attained to the traces of God, for it hath been repeatedly heard from the Tongue of Grandeur that the living and the dead among the loved ones have one and the same station at the Most Holy Court. Well is it with them! And for some, even though the beginning of their petitions was adorned with divine verses, a separate Tablet was also specifically revealed for them. God willing, his honor Shaykh will be enabled to deliver them, for most had sent petitions from various regions. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the One Who causeth to reach, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O beloved of my heart and thou who art mentioned in my soul! Thy letter arrived, and in truth it was like a trade yielding the profit of two or three years in ’Akka. Among the profits that neither change nor alter is the mention of the Master concerning that spiritual beloved, and another profit is thy submission and contentment in all matters, and yet another is thy turning to the heaven of the favors of God, exalted be His glory. Were anyone to count the profits of these days, he could not reckon them, for these days possess endless mercy. I beseech the one true God to bestow upon thee from the heaven of bestowal countless blessings. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>After reading and reciting, it was presented before the Master’s presence. He said: “O ’Ali, upon thee be the peace of God and His grace. Thou hast ever been and will continue to be mentioned in the gathering of the unitarians. Thy letter arrived and the servant present mentioned it before His face. Praise be to God, from all its letters and words wafted the fragrance of faithfulness and sincerity. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist thee and aid thee in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to send down upon thee from the heaven of His generosity and the clouds of His grace a blessing from Him, a gift from His presence, and a mercy from His side. Verily, He is the One through Whose Name the gates of generosity were opened to the world and the fragrance of divine knowledge was diffused among the nations. The oppression of the oppressors cannot prevent Him from that which He willeth. Verily, He is the Almighty in the beginning and in the end. We make mention of My loved ones there who were with Me in all conditions. We beseech God to open through them the gates of grace and bounty unto all beings and to aid them in that which will draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.”</p>
<p>This servant, in the nights and days, hath besought and continues to beseech relief for that beloved one, and God willing, his relief is near, for His loved ones and friends have no purpose save Him. In this land of exile, they have chosen their abode in His path. In such circumstances, His grace will surely not abandon them. This matter hath been recorded and inscribed in all books, both of old and recent times.</p>
<p>Regarding the funds that were mentioned, according to thy arrangement and by the command of the Beloved of hearts, his honor Aqa Rida (upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty) hath acted accordingly. We hope that in these days we may all attain the honor of presence and meeting. With the All-Bountiful Lord, no matter is difficult. We beseech Him to aid thee in His service, to exalt you through His Name, and to ordain for you that which will set right all your affairs. Verily, He is the Answerer of those who supplicate and the Beloved of sincere hearts.</p>
<p>As for the matter of consultation regarding the distribution of goods in those parts, after it was presented, He said: “Last year too they intended to distribute for the payment of debts and relief from difficulties, and We did not approve. However, afterwards it was observed that distribution is closer to piety and deliverance, for that honored one hath endured much hardship and left his home and dwelling. This is not acceptable to Us. Therefore, if action is taken according to last year’s intention, it would be good, both for thy relief and for the manifestation of the love and affection of the companions.”</p>
<p>This servant, in all conditions, beseecheth and imploreth God, exalted be His glory, for the relief of that beloved of the heart and for tranquility in the shade of the pavilion of glory, namely the Mansion of Bahji. I cling to the hem of His generosity that He may open a new door and protect and purify that beloved one from all sorrows. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Salutations, praise, mercy, and glory be upon you and upon the companions of guidance.</p>

<p>Thereafter, in these days a letter was received wherein this matter was mentioned: that his honor Aqa Muhammad Big had purchased a mule from his honor the Trustee, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], for thirty tumans, and a letter had arrived from the servant requesting that the sum be forwarded. Glory be to God! How could this evanescent servant write such a thing? This sum had no connection to the Most Holy Court. The details of this matter are that his honor Haji Mirza Abu’l-Hasan, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], wrote that a mule belonging to his honor the Afnan, upon him be all the Most Glorious Beauty, was in the possession of his honor the elevated Trustee, upon him be the glory of God, His might, His light, His radiance and His favors, who sold it to his honor Aqa Muhammad Big, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah]. Now what should be done? This servant wrote that it should be forwarded, meaning delivered to its owner. And since this matter pertains to rights, it was written thus. Otherwise, if this sum had belonged to the Most Holy Court, it would never have been mentioned, much less requested. Now, since they have written that the sum is not available with his honor the Big, according to the command his honor Haji Mirza Abu’l-Hasan must settle this debt. His honor Muhammad Big, upon him be the glory of God, has always been and continues to be mentioned in the Most Holy Court. His services and labors are likewise remembered and witnessed before the Truth. No reward has been nor shall ever be lost. All is recorded in the Book by the Supreme Pen. The servant beseecheth his Lord to assist him and make him successful as He made him successful before, and to send down upon him from the heaven of His bounty that which will cool his eyes, gladden his heart and tranquilize his soul. Verily, He is the Answerer, the Generous. Mention of him was made in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what was sent down for him from the heaven of loving-kindness and favors.</p>
<p>Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God, has been and continues to be under the gaze of divine favor. God, exalted be His glory, Himself bears witness to his service in the divine path. Most of the friends of Truth, in ages past and present, possessed no earthly treasures, and this has never been and is not now a defect, but rather is a manifest glory. We make mention of him in this station that he may rejoice in the favors of his Lord, the Generous. O Muhammad! We have mentioned thee before and mention thee at this hour, and We bear witness that thou hast believed in God and turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon when every learned one turned away from it, every mystic denied it, every person of understanding was perturbed, and every mighty foundation was shaken. Take heed that the affairs of the world grieve thee not. The Most Great Joy calleth out to thee from the precincts of its mighty Prison. Blessed art thou and those who have voiced the remembrance and praise of God and have arisen to serve His wondrous Cause. Thou art he who hath shown kindness to the friends and loved ones of God. He Who speaketh that there is none other God but He, the Single, the All-Informed, beareth witness to this. Convey My greetings to My loved ones in thy region and remind them of My beauteous remembrance. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, who have cast the world behind their backs and have turned to the Most Great Name–at Whose appearance the atoms of existence proclaimed: “The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Lord of all worlds!”</p>
<p>From the revealed verses, the grace and bounty of God are evident and manifest. No deed hath been or ever shall be concealed, and whatsoever hath transpired in the path of God, exalted be His glory, hath not been and shall never be lost. All are recorded and inscribed in the Divine Book by the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is the eye that hath seen, blessed the ear that hath heard, and blessed the tongue that hath acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered. Woe unto those who have turned away and denied! The Glory be upon God’s chosen ones and His friends, and upon those who have attained unto this mighty Cause.</p>

<p>He is God - exalted be His glory, majesty and power!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath adorned these lands with His Most Great Remembrance in His Book, which He hath made a light, an honor and a guidance for all peoples. These lands have been designated by the Most Exalted Pen as the Holy Land, and God hath exalted them through this remembrance among His cities and domains. He hath manifested from them His bounties and favors, which hearts and minds are powerless to reckon. Exalted is the Generous One, the Revealer of this mighty grace! And blessings and peace be upon His unlettered Prophet, the Eternal Light and Everlasting Manifestation, through Whom the ocean of knowledge surged and the nightingale of remembrance warbled upon the highest branches. And upon His family and companions, whom God made the manifestations of His most beautiful names and the dawning-places of His most exalted attributes. Through them appeared God’s might, and His all-encompassing power and everlasting sovereignty held sway. Through them the countenance of knowledge smiled and the manifestations of Satan wailed - blessings that are sanctified from all else and befitting the court of His chosen ones.</p>
<p>And thereafter, your letters and writings - those pages of love and joy - were received, and each was a key to unlock the gates of gladness, delight, happiness and elation, for they were adorned with the mention of God, exalted be His glory, and likewise embellished with glad tidings of the health and well-being of the friends in that land and of your honor. In all conditions, it behooveth man to render, with a hundred thousand tongues, a hundred thousand thanks and praises. You mentioned some of the outward bounties, such as the power of hearing and sight and other physical senses. Yet even this outward sight hath an inner sight, and that sight hath yet another sight. Were the bounties of God and the signs that evidence His outward favor to reveal their true stations, man would observe with clear certainty that even if all the atoms of the universe were to become tongues and attempt to render thanks for His bounties bestowed in but a single moment, they would fail to do so. Sheikh Saadi, may God’s mercy rest upon him, hath well said - yet it is evident that the hidden, established stations are far beyond what the bird of utterance can reach in its flight or what the faculty of comprehension can grasp and know. He said that in every breath that goeth in, life is sustained, and when it cometh out, it refresheth the soul. Thus in every breath lie two bounties, and for every bounty thanksgiving is due […] Yet in truth, in every breath a hundred thousand bounties exist and are manifest, and each bounty deserveth a hundred thousand praises and thanks. Who can soar in this atmosphere or open his tongue in His mention and praise? In all conditions, the fair-minded observe themselves to be powerless and wanting. Yet this hath yielded one great blessing, namely that the Intended One hath accepted these expressions of powerlessness and confession of shortcoming, and hath reckoned them as worship. This bounty itself requireth a hundred thousand million thanks. The knowledge is with God. In any case, the letter of that beloved of the heart, your verbal and written mentions, and other remembrances - all were repeatedly read and mentioned, and the palate of hope was sweetened. God willing, may the sweetness of these repetitions take hold of all. It was said before that whatever is repeated becomes more fragrant. Indeed, each of your mentions was like repeated sugar, Indian sugar, Egyptian candy, and royal grapes. Nay, your grapes, which are your mentions, excel those grapes a hundred thousand times. God willing, may they be aided in all conditions and assisted in that which causeth the manifestation of the stations of truth, purity, generosity and bounty. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Helper, the Supporter, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. As to your mention of His Eminence Effendi, may God, blessed and exalted be He, strengthen him, and your recording of his known virtues - this was noted. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, and hope that He will aid each one to preserve the resplendent Law and the glory of the station of “were it not for thee,” concerning which was revealed “were it not for thee, I would not have created the celestial spheres.” In any case, that land is blessed. Surely divine treasures have appeared and will appear from it, and it has been and is the repository of God’s friends. We beseech God to make the people of divine unity the standards of His guidance and […]</p>
<p>Praised be His remembrance among His lands and His servants. Verily He heareth and seeth and answereth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. The relatives of that beloved of hearts - praise be to God - are well and safe. The blessed Branches and the people of the pavilion of infallibility all send their greetings, make mention of you, and express their loving-kindness. Peace and mercy and glory rest upon you and upon the righteous servants of God.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath opened the doors of His knowledge before His servants through the key of utterance, and hath sent down unto them that which draweth them nigh unto Him and preserveth them from the evil of satans. Verily, He is the One Who, through His mighty and wise command, hath power over whatsoever He willeth. And peace and blessings be upon the Sovereign of the kingdoms of wisdom and utterance, through Whom were revealed the mysteries of what hath been and what shall be, by the command of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, and upon His family and companions who aided the Cause of God with their wealth and their souls, and strove in His path with their might and their strength, until the light of the Cause shone forth throughout all lands. There is no God but Him, the Lord of creation. My spirit be a sacrifice for your remembrance, your praise, and your steadfastness.</p>
<p>The blessed and exalted letter arrived. Praise be to God, it was adorned with the mention of the Truth and trust in Him, and from each of its letters wafted the fragrance of love. The servant beseecheth God, his Lord, to exalt your honor through His Name and to render you mighty through His might. After its reading and perusal, it was brought to the presence of the Master, Who said: “O Afnan, O ’Ali, upon thee be the peace of God, His mercy and His grace.” Your letter was mentioned by this servant before His countenance. Praise be to God, they are illumined by the light of love and enkindled with the fire of affection. We beseech God to spread His signs through thee and to open before thy face the door of grace and bounty. Verily, He hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>We implore the Truth to assist your honor in all conditions and to grant success in that which causeth the elevation and advancement of existence. O my God, O my God! Aid Thy Afnan in that which Thou lovest and approvest, and ordain for them that which shall protect them from Thine enemies, and assist them in their commerce through Thy generosity and bounty. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the glad-tidings of well-being arrive like heavenly light. By God’s grace, all are well there, and here too they are blessed by His favors. The letter from his honor the Trustee, upon him be God’s peace, arrived and was the cause of joy and gladness. However, regarding their movement, entry into the great city is not permitted. There is no objection to the journey of his honor the Afnan and Aqa Nasru’llah. They said, God willing, may they arrive safely and attain the divine blessings ordained for them. And they said to convey greetings to Mirza ’Abdu’l-Husayn. Praise be to God, he has been and continues to be mentioned and is blessed with favors. We beseech God to manifest through him in His path that which shall endure as long as His names endure. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Likewise, we mention the loved ones of that land and send them greetings, and we seek for each one that which is the cause and means of the perpetuation of name and remembrance. This lowly one also conveys greetings to the beloved of the heart and solace of loving eyes, his honor the Afnan, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to ordain for them that which brings joy to the friends. Verily, He hath power over all things. Similarly, I convey greetings to his honor the Trustee and other travelers, each one, and I seek for them enduring blessing from the heaven of divine generosity. He is the Giver, He is the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>The loved ones of that land, praise be to God, are ever before our sight and are mentioned in the presence of the Master. Blessed are they. Today, in truth, the souls that are assured, steadfast, content and pleasing are sanctified beyond description and praise. In view of outward means and their continuance among the people, these remembrances flow from tongue and pen. For the rest, the matter is in the hand of the Mighty, the Powerful, and the Lord of grace and bounty. He doeth and judgeth as He pleaseth, and He is the Commander, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Regarding the salary of the late ?akim Musa, upon him be God’s mercy and forgiveness, assuredly what his honor the Afnan hath written is correct. God willing, their reply will also be sent from this quarter, as well as the reply to Haji Husayn and the Persian gentlemen, which will be sent to your honor for collection upon arrival. The receipts will also be sent. May light, mercy, glory and splendor be upon your honor and upon those with you, and those who love you and hear your word in this manifest Cause, and glory be upon you. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath spoken that whereby all things were attracted, and through Whom His path and His balance were made manifest, and whatsoever was recorded in the Books, the Scriptures, the Psalms and the Tablets. He, verily, is the Cleaver of the daybreak and the Sender of winds. There is none other God but Him, the One, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing. And may blessings and peace, shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of His grace, rest upon His loved ones and His chosen ones who have cast aside the ways of the world, holding fast to His straight path. These are servants unto whom God’s Book hath testified, both before and after, and the tongue of the All-Merciful hath spoken their praise in the Qur’an: “They speak not until He hath spoken, and they do His bidding.”</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the pearls of utterance appeared and the fountain of Thy knowledge flowed amidst Thy creatures, to ordain for Thy loved ones, by Thy Most Exalted Pen, that which will draw them nigh unto Thee. Thou art He Who hath ever been, in the heights of bounty, mercy, loving-kindness and beneficence, and will ever continue to be even as Thou hast been from all eternity. There is none other God but Thee, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice unto your remembrance! Your letter arrived and from its horizon shone forth the light of recognition. When I opened and read it, I found the fragrance of your words in the mention of our Lord, the All-Merciful. Then was I taken up until I entered the Most Exalted Paradise, the Station whereon the Ancient Beauty was established upon the throne of His Most Glorious Name. When I presented what was therein before His Countenance, the Ancient Lord turned toward me and spoke that which caused the ocean of knowledge to surge in creation and the light of recognition to shine from the heaven of proof. He said, exalted be His majesty and mighty be His utterance:</p>
<p>“O Zein! Blessed art thou that My Most Exalted Pen hath moved to make mention of thee morning and evening. By My life! The glances of My favor are directed toward thee and the showers of My loving-kindness are raining upon thee. Blessed be thine ear, for it hath heard My sweetest call in the earliest days; and blessed be thine eye, for it hath beheld My most exalted horizon; and blessed be thy heart, for it hath turned toward the Dayspring of My most beautiful Names; and blessed be thy hand, for it hath taken hold of My Book; and blessed be thy tongue, for it hath spoken My praise and glorification.” Thus doth the Lord of the worlds make mention of thee in the Most Great Prison with that which diffuseth the fragrance of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>The portion of that honored one from the treasury of the grace of God, exalted be His glory, hath been and is beyond measure. Thou hast partaken of one ocean of supreme bounty, one city of greatest favor, and one world of praise and glorification. No tongue is capable of uttering “well done,” nay rather, the Kingdom of utterance is needed to speak forth “well done and blessed be it,” inasmuch as the station of the manifestation of grace from the direction of Truth is such that this evanescent servant and his like are powerless and fall short of describing it. Exalted be His generosity, exalted be His bounty, and exalted be His loving-kindness and mercy!</p>
<p>When Jinab-i-Safar-’Ali (upon him be 96) attained the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, they promised that a Tablet would be specially revealed and sent for him. This time it was sent. I beseech God to assist him and all servants in that which is the good of all. It is most regrettable that lives should be wasted and pass fruitlessly. It is hoped that God, exalted be His glory, will make all aware and deliver them from this heedlessness, for had we not been heedless, cities opened in the name of Truth and wherein His mention was raised would not have fallen into the hands of the idolaters and enemies of the manifest religion. This is truth, there is no doubt therein.</p>
<p>Now must the sincere ones and the pure in heart, with utmost lowliness, beseech God, exalted be His glory, for the protection of the radiant Faith. The recompense of deeds is evident and manifest in all days, but where is the soul who will take heed, and where is the one who will be awakened? The sleep of heedlessness and the intoxication of pride have seized all and cast them like uprooted stones upon the earth.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that the blessed month of fasting became a cause of joy and gladness, though its end brought endless sorrow. Through divine confirmations and heavenly assistance, deeds were manifest according to our capacity, but it is difficult for such minor acts to efface or compensate for major transgressions. In any case, we seek forgiveness through goodly character and praiseworthy deeds - how much more so without them! Never have the deeds of a servant been worthy of the court of the Lord, unless His grace should take hold and His favor should assist.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory! Majesty and grandeur belong unto Him.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath spoken and caused all things to speak in praise of Him Who was wronged throughout all regions. He, verily, is the Single One, the One, the Unique, the Self-Subsisting, Whom none of His servants can comprehend and none of His creatures can describe. He, verily, is sanctified above all mention. My spirit be a sacrifice for the fragrances of Thy love.</p>
<p>I have been honored by the first ornament of your letter, which was adorned with praise of God, the Sovereign of all peoples and the Manifestor of causes. Joy seized me in such wise that tongues are powerless to describe. For this we praise our Lord, the All-Merciful, Who created us by a word from His presence, made us among His loved ones, caused us to speak His praise, taught us the path of His guidance, and instructed us in that which profiteth us in all His worlds. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>It is submitted that regarding what you wrote about Sasoon, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah], this servant was likewise perplexed as to what thought prompted this mention. The Holy Land is much disturbed these days, as His Holiness the Name has incurred a debt of one thousand liras and has nothing to show for it, and this sum belongs to the poor Khawaja and his partner. In such circumstances, it is evident what has happened and what will happen. We beseech God to assist us in that which will exalt His mention among His creation and His Cause among His servants. Indeed, this matter has been and continues to be a source of great humiliation, although it remains concealed for now. But after people become aware of it, it is unknown what will transpire. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>A letter was observed from the honored Surur, Aqa Mirza Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah], which he had written to Aqa Muhammad-Rida, mentioning his hardships. Since all these matters have been endured for God’s sake, God willing, they are sweeter than honey to his taste. This servant was present before the Face when instructions were given to send a telegram for them to come by steamer on Friday. Had they departed, it would have been most excellent, as the steamer arrived in Haifa in perfect comfort. However, according to their letter, the telegram arrived late and they were not properly informed that the steamer would arrive in Haifa. In any case, all that has occurred is for the best.</p>
<p>The conveying of greetings from this servant to him and his son, upon them both be the glory of the All-Merciful, depends upon your grace. Furthermore, it was repeatedly heard from the blessed Tongue that you should be informed to strive as much as possible to keep matters concealed, meaning it is preferable that the friends in Iraq know as little as possible about the affairs of the Prison. For if it becomes known among people that news of the Holy Land reaches those dwelling in Iraq, it has been and will be harmful. Let them consider this matter in whatever way is wise. The glory be upon you and those with you, and upon the two who arrived unto you, and upon the loved ones of God in those parts.</p>

<p>Then, may my spirit be sacrificed for you. Your second letter, from which wafted the fragrance of inner meanings, this evanescent servant was blessed to receive. Praise be to God for having opened the gates of the heaven of His bounty with the water of His Cause and made His chosen loved ones the bearers of this resplendent Kawthar.</p>
<p>The matters written were observed. Regarding His Holiness Mirza, his deliverance remains in that same word which shone forth from the Dayspring of utterance. Regarding His Holiness Amin Effendi, upon him be from all 9 [Baha] His Most Glorious, praise be to God that most often his mention has been made in the Most Great Scene and the face of favor has been turned toward him. Regarding what was written about His Excellency the aforementioned Pasha, may God assist him, no news has been received from him for some time, therefore sending a letter was not permitted. In any case, divine favor has been and is with him, and its effects, whenever they appear, will be manifested in the visible world. What is incumbent upon him is to hold fast to wisdom and also to visit His Excellency the Pasha. His affairs will proceed in a manner that will gladden his inner heart and rejoice his soul. Convey to him the most wondrous, most impregnable, most holy greetings from this evanescent one. Glory be upon him from his Lord, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>

<p>Praise be to God! The bounty of utterance flows forth and the feast of love descends. Joy is manifest from every direction, for the traces of the pen of the chosen ones appear continuously and successively. In truth, what a wondrous remedy it is for the malady of sorrow, anxiety and grief. Mighty is the arm of the Physician Who compounded this remedy, and the will that was connected with it. Were there justice, we should, throughout our lives, be engaged in thanksgiving, be occupied in praise, and be characterized by humility. This is the truth of what was submitted. However, the excesses of the transgressors and the calumnies of the atheists have deprived the world of most bounties. They utter that which hath no likeness in the world, let alone its essence, and whose branch hath not been seen, let alone its root. I beseech God to assist the unitarians with the hosts of His grace, to bring forth the vanished standards, and to raise high the lowered banners. He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! The ignorance and folly of the servants have become the cause and reason for abasement. We must, with the utmost lowliness and supplication, beseech the Self-Sufficing Lord for that which is the cause of victory and joy. The unitarians are in utmost weakness, the polytheists in utmost strength, and the decree is in none other than God’s hand, our Lord and your Lord. The cause of weakness is evident, and likewise the reason for power.</p>
<p>After praise and glorification of God, exalted be His glory, and mention of the Most Great Book of His Holiness the Seal, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake, I submit that your esteemed letter arrived. Glory be to God! It was crowned with the crown of joy and adorned with the ornament of favor, for its reading reminded the spirit and its perusal refreshed the soul. After reading and observing it, I proceeded to the presence, and it was presented before His face. He said: “O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of love and affection! Hear the call of the Wronged One. He remembereth thee even as He remembered thee before with a remembrance whereby the hearts of them that are endued with understanding were attracted.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God, thou art mentioned in the court of the Wronged One. We beseech God to open before thy face the gate of bounty and to make thee succeed to infinite favors. The servant present mentioned thy letter. From every word was heard that which testified to love, fellowship, devotion and humility. A truthful and trustworthy one spoke. We beseech God to make thee in all circumstances a cause for the exaltation of His Word and the manifestation of His Cause, and to grant thee the best of what He hath revealed in His perspicuous Book. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>From these radiant utterances, the stations of favor are clear and manifest, visible before the face without veil or covering. The interpreters have no path to this station, and the translators of the world no standing. Concerning what thou didst write about thine own affairs, after it was presented to the Lord, He spoke this word: This Wronged One beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to manifest that which is the cause of steadfastness, bounty, blessing and tranquility. Verily, He heareth the call of them that beseech Him. Outwardly, these matters depend upon consultation. In truth, let several souls gather together for the sake of God, and whatsoever appeareth from consultation, whether there or here, let them hold fast unto it. The principle of consultation hath ever been and is acceptable before God, and in the Books of both past and present this firm decree hath been revealed from the Presence of the All-Wise. His is the command, and ours is submission and obedience. His is the decree, and ours is acceptance and compliance. He is the Ruler in the beginning and in the end.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant hopeth that the gate may be opened and joy and bounty may descend. With utmost humility and submissiveness, I convey greetings to all the loved ones of that land, and I beseech the Goal of the world to confirm each one in unity, harmony and steadfastness. This is a great bounty and a mighty favor.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Deprive us not of that whereby the stations of Thy loved ones are elevated among Thy servants and Thy chosen ones in Thy lands. O Lord! Thou seest them clinging to the cord of Thy grace. Aid them to hear that which will profit them through Thy bounty and exalt them through Thy generosity and bestowal. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Salutations, praise, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those who are with you, who love you and who hearken to your words for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord.</p>

<p>At times like captives of Europe from Ray, we hastened without delay to Baghdad.</p>
<p>At times toward Rum like a prisoner did I proceed, though I am sovereign of the heavens.</p>
<p>Sometimes Adrianople, sometimes Akka was My dwelling, like prisoners ever without rest.</p>
<p>Seven years have passed that for the sake of the world, the Most Great Prison became My abode.</p>
<p>Neither did I seek help from anyone, nor did a request pass My lips.</p>
<p>Rather, day and night with a hundred sighs and cries, I sent forth emissaries to My loved ones -</p>
<p>The revealed Word of Truth and Tablets of Truth, from each of which was kindled the Lamp of Truth.</p>
<p>O My beloved ones who are related to Me! You are all cherished and desired by Me.</p>
<p>For your sake I have submitted to tribulation, I have opened the gates that were closed.</p>
<p>How much pure blood was spilled! How many heads were sacrificed without fear or care,</p>
<p>Until this Tree grew tall and the adversary could no longer cast stones at it.</p>
<p>Yet those associated with it, from left and right, cast stones without fear or restraint.</p>
<p>This Tree is like a harp from the heart, saying: “O group of accomplished friends!</p>
<p>Though for a time I am safe from the adversary, yet from the friends My body finds no rest.”</p>
<p>Be aware, O friends, be aware! Open wide your eyes of wisdom.</p>
<p>I have been patient until now with your parsimony, like a father I have circled round your smoke.</p>
<p>I saw and gave you counsel of unity, freed you from a thousand bonds.</p>
<p>Your words were taken as unheard, I closed My eyes to your deeds,</p>
<p>That you might arise from heavy sleep, and take the hand of others in faithfulness.</p>
<p>Another year and patience reaches its end, another wine fills the cup.</p>
<p>Not everyone deserves this feast - let each take his own way with joy,</p>
<p>That God’s Cause be not clouded by his deeds, for that Tree has reached the end of its forbearance.</p>
<p>After this, whoever deals crookedly with it, and through ignorance plucks a leaf from it,</p>
<p>Such a fire will be kindled in his soul that no trace of his foundation will remain.</p>
<p>Let those present tell the absent ones, that they may repent of their deeds.</p>
<p>May they be characterized by the Most Glorious countenance,</p>
<p>Becoming divine confirmations through their deeds, though silent in speech.</p>
<p>May they seek naught but the glory of the Cause of Baha,</p>
<p>And pursue His good pleasure, and that alone.</p>
<p>If for a time they follow this path,</p>
<p>They shall attain everlasting glory.</p>
<p>If in this way they seek the Friend,</p>
<p>They shall soon triumph over all existence.</p>
<p>The message of the Beloved has been proclaimed to the lovers:</p>
<p>Each soul possesses free will.</p>

<p>The beginning of speech and the end of conclusion is the mention of the Sovereign of the heavenly realm and the King of Glory - exalted be His grace and magnificent His favor. There is no God but Him. And then it is submitted that one such as yourself, who has appeared as a leaf of the divine Tree and as a fruit of the Pre-existent Lote Tree, and who has been nourished from the chalices of light and has drunk from the crimson cups - why should you be veiled from the divine mysteries and the manifest words of the Eternal, and become distant from the ultimate purpose and spiritual desire?</p>
<p>Let it not be thought that some ulterior motive lies hidden in the essence of these words, or that some fancy is concealed in the secret of these allusions. I swear by the God Who caused this servant to be seated upon the carpet of love and to repose upon the cushions of affection, that whatsoever has been mentioned stems from the gems of grace and the manifestations of generosity, sanctified from the consideration of otherness and holy beyond the witness of qualities.</p>
<p>Look to the previous centuries and reflect upon what God revealed therein to their peoples. Why did discord arise among them, and for what reason did they turn away from His countenance, stray from His path, cause corruption in His Cause, associate partners with the Sovereign of His oneness, and become among the perishing ones? Have you heard that God’s religion could be effaced before being established, or His decree annulled before being revealed? Say: What ails you? How is it that you neither know nor perceive?</p>
<p>Nay, by my Lord, the Lord of the heavens and earth! No one can alter a single letter of what was revealed in the Bayan by God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He has bound Himself to establish all that was ordained in the Book by His command, but the people know not and understand not.</p>
<p>O friend! Be fair in God’s presence, then place yourself before Him. Did you write the Bayan as God, your Beloved, the Beloved of the mystics, commanded you? Nay, by your life, you neither wrote it nor obeyed what you were commanded by Him, and became of the hesitating ones. Rather, you desired to keep people away from His command and prohibition, and to be among those who distance others.</p>
<p>Are you content with one who mocked God, turned away from His presence, strayed from His path, was heedless of His remembrance, and became of the opposing ones? Say: Are you not ashamed before God Who created you, reared you, and made you a king that you might remind people of God’s days and be among those who remember? Yet you followed your own desires and turned away from the decree of God, my Lord and your Lord, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Read unto them what was revealed before you and all on earth deny it. Verily God is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy. By the Lord of the heavens and earth! If all who are in the heavens were to gather claiming divinity, and all who are on earth claiming lordship, they would neither be able nor capable of revealing a single letter of what God has revealed in the Book. Say: What ails you? How is it that you neither awaken nor recognize?</p>
<p>By Him Who holds my soul in His hand! I desire nothing in these words except my love for you and my affection for your person. Otherwise, what concern have I to mention one who was the best of those remembered? But when I witnessed your forgetfulness of your covenant, I cast upon you what none in all the worlds would cast, that you might recognize God’s right in these days, make up for what escaped you, and be of the doers of good. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>In any case, in these days His good-pleasure is beloved, and all are captive in the grip of power. There is no escape for anyone. Do not regard the Cause of God as something trivial wherein anyone might express their fancy. Now several persons from various quarters have made this same claim. Soon you shall witness that the Tree of Independence shall endure forever through its own glorious and beauteous Sovereign, while all these others shall perish and vanish, nay rather, become as nothing remembered, as scattered dust. Then indeed we belong to God and to Him do we return.</p>
<p>If you deem it advisable, convey greetings from this servant to Mirza, and then submit: Have not the standards of discord been raised from all directions, and has not the corruption of these companions not corrupted the world? Is this not enough? How can these be reconciled? This is what has been written and established in all books and by all Messengers: “Associate not anyone with the worship of thy Lord.” One like yourself should be observant of all degrees. The choice is yours. I am but a faithful counselor. And peace be upon the assured ones.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful!</p>
<p>How wonderful are the bestowals of the True One, exalted be His glory! He granted His gifts unasked, and bestowed understanding undeserved, that every soul might attain unto the recognition of the Lord of “were it not for Thee.” And the recognition of Him is identical with the recognition of God, for the True One, exalted be His glory, hath ever been and shall ever remain unknowable, indescribable, and incomprehensible. “No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision: He is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things.” When He desired to adorn the realm of recognition, He created the intellect. It is the administrator and minister in that realm. Exalted be His bounty, exalted be His grace, exalted be His favor, exalted be His beneficence! The seen and the unseen, the visible and invisible, all are illumined and adorned by the effulgence of the Most Great Light, namely His Holiness the Seal, may our souls be a sacrifice for all else but Him.</p>
<p>O God, O All-Bountiful, O All-Merciful, O Self-Sufficing, O Peerless One! What can we say when all our utterances arise from vain imaginings, unworthy of Thy threshold and court? If Thou regardest justice, we are nothing and worthy of nothing, but if Thou lookest upon Thy grace, we are and have ever been worthy of every bounty. Thy name, the Concealer, hath ever concealed, and Thy generosity hath brought to naught the consequences of disobedience. Should Thy bounty bestow attention less than the eye of a needle, we would all become people of insight and knowledge, but should it turn away–God forbid–we would deserve a hundred thousand stings. O my God, have mercy on Thy weak ones, grant awareness to the heedless, and bestow steadfastness and constancy upon the aware ones. O Lord, deprive not Thy loved ones of the heaven of Thy grace and bounty. Grant that which befitteth Thy Most Generous Name, and bestow that which beseemeth Thy Name, the All-Bountiful. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Great. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>The letter of that honored friend arrived, dispelling grief and bringing joy. In truth, it bestowed the blessing of reunion and entirely erased the hardship of separation. Praise be upon his hand and arm! If this servant should be remiss in responding to your correspondence, I hope to be forgiven, as I am occupied with numerous tasks and countless affairs–sometimes writing, sometimes planting trees, and at times engaged in various services. Surely the friends can testify to what has been mentioned, and certainly these services, being for the sake of God, are hoped to bring joy to the hearts of the friends and earn their good pleasure. However, the absence of a reply or its delay has never been and is not evidence of lack of love. God Almighty is witness that you have ever been and remain in my thoughts. Praise be to God that the affairs of the land of Kaf, according to what has been written, have been and are being resolved. God willing, may it transpire according to your wishes.</p>
<p>As for the [lambs] sent by the honored master, Sabri Efendi, upon him be the Glory of God, they arrived with the same mark and sign as mentioned. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to confirm him in all conditions and grant him success. He is mentioned; this is what matters and, praise be to God, is present. On behalf of this evanescent one, convey greetings, praise, and glory to him. Likewise, I send greetings and glory to the honored friend, Aqa ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, and I beseech God, exalted be His station, that they may be engaged in the mention and praise of the One True Friend in perfect health and well-being. The spiritual friend, Aqa ’Ali-Muhammad, came, but as there was no one to accompany him to Iran, the command for his return was issued. Whenever someone is found, we shall inform you. Convey greetings on behalf of this evanescent one. God willing, may they ever be successful.</p>
<p>As for the item sent by Aqa ’Abdu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God, it has not arrived, but they said, “We have accepted what has not arrived.” May God, exalted be His glory, grant reward, and they said, “From these that Sabri Efendi, upon him be peace, has sent, we shall use some with his intention in mind. Let him not trouble himself further. What we seek and desire has been and is goodly words, righteous deeds, and praiseworthy character,” and God willing, he has attained unto these. This evanescent servant also sends greetings and glory to him and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, for confirmation and support. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearing, the Answering One. I entrust Qurratu’l-’Ayn and Qurratu’l-’Ayn ’Inayatu’llah and ’Ata’iyyih Khanum, both of them, to God and seek their protection. It is hoped they will attain the highest degrees of grace and knowledge and be successful in serving the Cause. Verily, He is the Forgiver, the Bestower, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Peace, spirit, and mercy be upon you and upon those with you and upon God’s righteous servants. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>Praise be to God that the gates of attainment unto His presence are opened wide, their outward key being the pen and ink, and their inner key being the grace of God, the Lord of all creation. We praise Him and thank Him for having guided us in days wherein the fire of oppression hath been kindled in all regions through the doings of the manifestations of tyranny. And blessings and peace be upon the Dayspring of existence, the Lord of Revelation, and the Dawning-Place and Rising-Point of God’s most excellent names, and upon His kindred and companions who were the lamps of grace amidst all creation and the suns of bounty unto all beings - eternal blessings whose fragrance shall never cease throughout the duration of the manifestations of His attributes. My spirit be a sacrifice unto your honour.</p>
<p>Your blessed letter was received and after it was read before the countenance of the Lord, He said: O ’Ali-Akbar! The smoke of tyranny hath darkened the world of justice and veiled the light of equity. The heedless souls are encompassed by the hosts of transgression, wickedness, self and passion, to such extent that they have no purpose save their own desires and no beloved save this world. Veils of denial have prevented their eyes from recognizing what is right, and the lusts of passion have obscured their faculty of understanding, to such degree that they count loss as profit and abasement as glory. Heedlessness hath reached such a point that they slay their own Lord with their own hands and abandon their friend to the enemy. Glory be to God! The oppressors of the earth have reached such a state of tyranny that the Pharaohs and tyrants of the world seek refuge in God from their deeds.</p>
<p>O Mahdi, upon thee be My glory! In the early dawn the breezes passed over those pure and holy bodies, and from their whispers these exalted words were heard: “Woe unto you! Woe unto you! Woe unto you! Woe unto you! O people of Ya! Ye have martyred your own masters with the swords of tyranny and transgression, and ye perceive it not. Soon shall the recompense of your deeds encompass you. At that time ye shall find neither helper nor supporter, neither protector nor friend. Have ye grown heedless of the power of divine justice, or have ye obtained a letter of immunity from His might? By God’s life! All the concourse of the near angels and the cherubim lament and shed tears of blood. O Mahdi! Who hath assisted the families and children of the martyrs? Who hath consoled them? Who hath cared for them? Who hath given them bread and water? The Pen lamenteth, the Most Great Name weepeth.”</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! Thou seest what hath befallen Thy chosen ones and loved ones at the hands of the oppressors among Thy creatures. I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty which hath encompassed all existence, and by Thy Name whereby Thou hast subdued both the seen and the unseen, to assist the oppressors in achieving justice and equity, and to make known to them what hath proceeded from them throughout the nights and days. O Lord! Take the hands of the oppressed ones through Thy power and might, then protect them from the evil of Thine enemies. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Convey greetings and glorification from this Wronged One to the people of that household. The glory from Us be upon them and upon those who love them for the sake of God, the Lord of the mighty throne. Praise be to God, all are mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and are illumined by the light of His utterance.</p>
<p>In these nights and days, mention of the martyrs of the land of Ya hath been and is being heard from the tongue of Grandeur. Thus far, they have been mentioned several times and recorded in Tablets. Blessed are they, and joy and delight be unto them, for they have attained unto that which hath been the ultimate desire of the sincere ones and the ultimate will of those near unto God. Although the oppression is beyond reckoning, yet such bounty hath been manifested toward them that no knowledgeable recorder could ever describe it. We praise God, blessed and exalted be He, for the wonders of His generosity, His favors, His grace and His gifts. Verily He is the Helper of those in distress and the Succourer of the oppressed. There is none other God but Him, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>I beseech God to preserve your honour forever and adorn you with the ornament of health. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I convey greetings and glorification to those related to your honour, and I beseech infinite favors and boundless grace for each one of them. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about mentioning the petition, it is known that your honour deliberately does not open the trusts, and moreover, the favors of God, exalted be His glory, toward your honour are beyond mention and reckoning. Therefore, what occurred was submitted and was accepted.</p>
<p>And concerning what you asked about the oil, the amount that was commanded was two rotls. Peace and praise and remembrance and glory be upon your honour and upon those who are with you and love you, and upon those who are assured and unified, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Teacher, the Expositor, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful!</p>
<p>Praise be worthy and befitting the Most Great Cause, Who adorned the dead in the valleys of heedlessness and ignorance with the ornament of awareness and knowledge, and bestowed upon those thirsting in the desert of error a portion from the Kawthar of guidance. Exalted, exalted be His bounty, and exalted, exalted be His bestowal, and glorious is His utterance, and mighty is His proof, and there is no God but Him.</p>
<p>O Husayn, upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness! This day is the day for the diffusion of divine traces and the springtime of utterance. The people of God must each, through wisdom and exposition, illumine the world of being with the light of recognition, and bestow from the sealed wine which hath been unsealed in the name of the Self-Subsisting, that all may, through this most glorious wine, turn unto the supreme horizon and attain unto the greatest steadfastness. Thou hast ever been and art still remembered. Say: O people! This is the Day of God - turn ye unto Him and be not of the heedless ones. This is the Cause through whose appearance the trumpet of utterance was sounded, and they that slumbered in the graves of idle fancies arose, and through it the cry was raised and the divine fragrances were diffused, and the Herald called out from the direction of divine unity: “The sovereignty of earth and heaven, and glory and dominion belong to the Speaker on Sinai Who hath come from the heaven of bounty bearing the banner of ‘He doeth what He willeth.’” Blessed is he who hath recognized and attained, and woe unto the heedless ones.</p>
<p>Say: O friends! Today is the day of service and assistance. Arise, that perchance ye may adorn the people of the world with the lights of the Most Great Name. Today grace hath encompassed all, and the bounty of wisdom and the feast of utterance have been sent down from the heaven of will. By the life of God! Neither centuries nor ages can be compared with this Day, nay with this moment. Whatever hath occurred in the land, although the idolaters imagine that the light of God’s Cause will be obscured through the rejected deeds of evil souls, yet [He will transform] oppression into victory. Soon shall they see the recompense of their deeds, and they shall find for themselves neither helper nor supporter.</p>
<p>O Husayn! We desire to make mention of him who migrated in the path of God and whose spirit ascended in the land of exile, after his hope and endeavor had been to attain the presence of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. O Shukru’llah! Thou art in the Most Exalted Paradise, and the Wronged One mentioneth thee in the prison of ’Akka. We beseech God to send down upon thee a mercy from His presence and a light from His own Self. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. He loveth His friends and remembereth them before and after their ascension, holding in His grasp the reins of grace, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He is with His loved ones in whatever land they may be. He heareth their remembrances and witnesseth their deeds, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing One. And We make mention of thy son in this most exalted station, who was named with the Most Beautiful Names. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, possessed of great grace. The glory from Us be upon thee, O Shukru’llah, and upon those who read what hath been sent down for thee from the Most Exalted Pen in this luminous spot.</p>
<p>[…] If anyone asks you about the Ship, say: It rides amidst the waves. Thus has spoken the Tongue of the Wronged One. He is verily the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. It is hoped that in that land the loved ones will become so intoxicated and joyous with the Kawthar of the utterance of the Desired One of the worlds that the ranks and multitudes of the world will be powerless to prevent them. Convey to each one greetings from the Wronged One and give them the glad-tidings of the pearls of wisdom and utterance which have been revealed from the Treasury of the Supreme Pen. Mention of that group has been and continues to be made in the Most Holy Court. Blessed are they and joy be unto them. Verily they have a station with God, the Powerful, the Compassionate, the Mighty, the All-Informed. At the close of this discourse We make mention of the Afnan, upon them be My Glory and My Loving-kindness. Praise be to God, they have been and continue to be the recipients of divine favors from the beginning of days until now. We beseech God to assist them to exalt His Word, to serve His Cause and to hold fast unto His Cord in such wise that neither the affairs of the world nor the events of nations will hinder them. In truth, they were brought from nothingness into being for the service of the Cause, and their mention shall forever endure in God’s Book and flow from the Pen of bounty. Blessed are they and joy be unto them and unto those who love them for the sake of God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. The Glory which proceedeth from Us rest upon you, O My loved ones, and upon those who have shattered the idols of vain imaginings with the hands of certitude. They are truly among those who are nigh unto God in the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>

<p>And now, the letter from that light of mine eyes arrived. Praise be to God, the news of health and well-being and the arrival of each was the source of joy and delight. Likewise, after your petition was presented before Him, He spoke thus: “Verily, the Wronged One implores God, the Lord of the Throne and earth, the Master of the hereafter and this world, to assist you with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, to confirm you in that which will exalt the station of man, and to aid you in achieving that which He loves and is pleased with.” Perchance the friends of God may become the cause of humanity’s salvation and the means of extinguishing the fire of hatred that has ever been and continues to be ablaze in the hearts of the world’s peoples.</p>
<p>We beseech God to confirm you. We make mention of Nabil-ibn-Nabil, upon whom rest God’s peace and grace. God is aware and bears witness that this Wronged One has ever desired for him that which has no equal, and none of what was said concerning him was confirmed. We mentioned to ’Abdu’l-Husayn, upon whom be peace: let them not be saddened, for none of what people have said has been accepted. From the earliest days until now, both S.M. and Nabil-ibn-Nabil have arisen to serve, having surpassed their peers and companions. They have ever been and continue to be confirmed. What We desired was that all tongues should speak in praise and glorification of their trustworthiness and piety. This is a great bounty and a mighty favor.</p>
<p>If one or two souls should speak ill out of personal motives, it is unworthy of mention. Truth has been and will be distinguished from falsehood. Say: God, then leave them to their vain imaginings. We beseech God to grant such confirmation that its effects shall become manifest throughout all regions. No slanderer’s word is acceptable, and no mischief-maker’s mention is worthy of attention. If certain matters appear dubious to some, they are clear and evident before God. They must arise to serve humanity with perfect wisdom and engage in their work with the utmost joy and fragrance, in such wise that they neither become distressed by the vexing words of the world’s heedless ones nor be hindered from their own affairs. They have taken hold of the Cause and are occupied with it. Deeds must be for God’s sake. Not an atom’s weight of good works has been or will ever be left unrewarded.</p>
<p>O Nabil-i-’Ali! Be assured of thy Lord’s grace, seek His mercy, call upon Him for help, rely upon His favors, hold fast to His cord, and cling to His robe. Can that which is done for God’s sake remain concealed or be altered? Nay, by His very Self! He verily witnesses and sees, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. In all conditions, we seek His aid and assistance. This Wronged One has ever been among the fangs of wolves, yet the tongue remains eloquent and the Pen in motion. The knowledge thereof is with God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>The Glory be upon thee, O Nabil-ibn-Nabil, and upon thy son, and upon whosoever unites with thee in God’s Cause, assists thee, and stands with thee in all conditions. Can one imagine a greater favor than this? Nay, by His very Self! The mention testifies, the utterance bears witness, and the Word identifies, speaks, and proclaims. Every possessor of hearing and sight beholds the light of favor dawning from the horizon of these words. Blessed are they that behold! Blessed are they that hear!</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseeches God to confirm that beloved one in such wise that none shall have cause for words. Assuredly this prayer has been and will be answered. Verily, He does not suffer to be lost the reward of the doers of good, the reward of those who act, the reward of those who turned to Him in the early days when most of the servants in all lands turned away. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Witness, the Beholder, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>I remember that light of mine eyes, Aqa Shaykh Ahmad, upon whom be God’s peace, and I beseech God for his health, well-being, elevation, and exaltation. Peace, praise, remembrance, and glory be upon you and upon God’s friends and loved ones.</p>

<p>LXVI Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Thou seest me dwelling in this prison-house that lieth behind the seas and the mountains, and knowest full well what I have endured for love of Thee and for the sake of Thy Cause. Thou art He, O my God, Who hath raised me up at Thy behest, and bidden me to occupy Thy seat, and to summon all men to the court of Thy mercy. It is Thou Who hast commanded me to tell out the things Thou didst destine for them in the Tablet of Thy decree and didst inscribe with the pen of Thy Revelation, and Who hast enjoined on me the duty of kindling the fire of Thy love in the hearts of Thy servants, and of drawing all the peoples of the earth nearer to the habitation of Thy throne.</p>
<p>And when, as bidden by Thee, I arose and called out, by Thy leave, all Thy creatures, the wayward among Thy servants opposed me. Some turned away from me, others disowned my claim, a few hesitated, while others were sore perplexed, notwithstanding that Thy testimony was set forth before the followers of all religions, and Thy proof demonstrated unto all the peoples of the earth, and the signs of Thy might so powerfully manifested as to encompass the entire creation.</p>
<p>I was, moreover, opposed by mine own kindred, although, as Thou knowest, they were dear to me and I had desired for them that which I had desired for mine own self. These are the ones who, when learning that I had been cast into prison, perpetrated against me what no man else on earth had perpetrated.</p>
<p>I entreat Thee, therefore, O my God, by Thy name by which Thou hast separated between truth and denial, to purify their hearts of all evil suggestions, and to enable them to draw nigh unto Him Who is the Day-Spring of Thy names and Thine attributes.</p>
<p>Thou knowest, O my God, that I have severed every tie that bindeth me to any of Thy creatures except that most exalted tie that uniteth me with whosoever cleaveth unto Thee, in this the day of the revelation of Thy most august Self, that hath appeared in Thy name, the All-Glorious. Thou knowest that I have dissolved every bond that knitteth me to any one of my kindred except such as have enjoyed near access to Thy most effulgent face.</p>
<p>I have no will but Thy will, O my Lord, and cherish no desire except Thy desire. From my pen floweth only the summons which Thine own exalted pen hath voiced, and my tongue uttereth naught save what the Most Great Spirit hath itself proclaimed in the kingdom of Thine eternity. I am stirred by nothing else except the winds of Thy will, and breathe no word except the words which, by Thy leave and Thine inspiration, I am led to pronounce.</p>
<p>Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art the Well-Beloved of all that have known Thee, and the Desire of the hearts of such as are devoted to Thee, inasmuch as Thou hast made me a target for the ills that I suffer in my love for Thee, and the object of the assaults launched against me in Thy path. Thy glory beareth me witness! I can, on no account, feel impatient of the adversities that I have borne in my love for Thee. From the very day Thou didst reveal Thyself unto me, I have accepted for myself every manner of tribulation. Every moment of my life my head crieth out to Thee and saith: “Would, O my Lord, that I could be raised on the spear-point in Thy path!” while my blood entreateth Thee saying: “Dye the earth with me, O my God, for the sake of Thy love and Thy pleasure!” Thou knowest that I have, at no time, sought to guard my body against any affliction, nay rather I have continually anticipated the things Thou didst ordain for me in the Tablet of Thy decree.</p>
<p>Behold, then, O my God, my loneliness among Thy servants and my remoteness from Thy friends and Thy chosen ones. I beseech Thee, by the showers of the clouds of Thy mercy, whereby Thou hast caused the blossoms of Thy praise and utterance and the flowers of Thy wisdom and testimony to spring forth in the hearts of all them that have recognized Thy oneness, to supply Thy servants and my kindred with the fruits of the tree of Thy unity, in these days when Thou hast been established upon the throne of Thy mercy. Hinder them not, O my Lord, from attaining unto the things Thou dost possess, and write down for them that which will aid them to scale the heights of Thy grace and favor. Give them, moreover, to drink of the living waters of Thy knowledge, and ordain for them the good of this world and of the world to come.</p>
<p>Thou art, verily, the Lord of Baha, and the Beloved of his heart, and the Object of his desire, and the Inspirer of his tongue, and the Source of his soul. No God is there but Thee, the Inaccessible, the Most High. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>

Blessed is he who hath attained unto Him in the days of his Lord, the All-Forgiving, and woe betide them who have kept themselves remote from the grace of God, the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who is single in grandeur, might and majesty, and peerless in glory, loftiness and grace. He hath created the Most Exalted Pen and made it the Primal Cause for the unity of the manifestations of names. Through it hath the Dove cooed upon the Ultimate Tree that there is none other God but the Lord of the Beginning and the End, and through it hath the Nightingale of praise warbled upon the Branch of eternity that there is none other God but the Sovereign of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath attracted hearts through His Best-Beloved Name and unified all created things through His Name that transcendeth all names and attributes, Who is established upon the throne of ‘He doeth what He willeth’ and ruleth over all who are in earth and heaven through His sovereignty that encompasseth the worlds.</p>
<p>O ye Daysprings of names and Manifestations of might in the Kingdom of creation! O ye who dwell in the depths of grandeur and who inhabit the Most Exalted Paradise! Rejoice ye in this Most Great Joy wherein the Lord of Eternity addresseth and speaketh amidst the peoples. Then draw ye nigh with radiant faces and illumined hearts, and take ye the crimson cup from the hand of bounty of the Creator of earth and heaven. Then drink ye thereof once in His Name that domineth all names, and again in His Name whereby all things are attracted. To him that drinketh thereof We say: “Well is it with thee, O thou who hast turned to God, the Lord of all men, through Whom the faces of the sincere ones have been gladdened and the hearts of them that are nigh unto God have been illumined!”</p>
<p>O people of the world! This is a day wherein the Countenance of God hath smiled like unto one bewildered and amazed, for He seeth Himself forsaken by the peoples and imprisoned in this Most Great Prison. Yet He beholdeth the joy which they who are around Him have established by His binding command. Thereupon did all things cry out, and the very essence of being declared: “May our souls be a sacrifice for Thy bewilderment! We testify that Thou art the Ruler over whatsoever Thou willest. The opposition of Thine enemies hath not prevented Thee from that which Thou hast purposed in creation. At one time Thou makest hardship the very essence of ease, and each day Thou transformest the prison land according to Thy Will that hath preceded and Thy Purpose that hath prevailed, even as Thou hast this day, through Thy conquering power, spread the carpet of joy and gladness that the people of the Manifestation might rejoice therein, and hast adorned the House of Him Who conversed with God with the light that hath shone forth and beamed from the horizon of Thy Name, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous.”</p>
<p>Blessed is he who hath pondered this Day and what hath been revealed therein from the command of his Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Wise, the Ancient of Days. Again, blessed is he who hath remembered this Day and hath recited what hath been sent down therein from God, the Lord of the worlds. We have abbreviated the remembrance, for verily the Day requireth no more than this. To this testifieth the Tongue of Grandeur and Glory, and those who glorify their Lord, the Omnipotent, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy imprisonment and tribulation, by Thy oppression and affliction, to purify the people with the waters of Thy bounty and favors, and the streams of Thy generosity and gifts, that from them may be diffused naught but the fragrance of the garment of detachment in the kingdom of creation. O Lord! Sanctify the hearts of those who circle round me from whatsoever is unworthy of Thy sanctification and glorification. Then make their hearts horizons for the lights of Thy knowledge and dawning-places for the manifestations of the Sun of Thy loving-kindness. O Lord! Thy grace hath encompassed all contingent things and Thy bounty hath pervaded all created things. Take the hands of the weak with the arms of Thy might, then deliver them through Thy power and sovereignty. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest, and this is a word to which all things bear witness. There is none other God but Thee, the Counselor, the Manifest, the Compassionate, the Generous. Then send down, O my God, upon Thy loved ones in this day a blessing from Thy presence, and grant them the good of this world and the world to come. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. O Lord! Even as Thou hast this day transformed the earth of Thy prison wherein Thou hast permitted joy and gladness for the people of Thy unity and the repositories of Thy oneness, do Thou transform the hearts of Thy servants that there may appear from them that which Thou lovest and approvest. There is none other God but Thee, the Munificent, the Helper.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>May this servant of the loved ones be a sacrifice unto your honor! Your blessed letter reached this evanescent atom, as did another letter, and before that yet another letter. From each one fresh joy and boundless delight were obtained, for they were perfumed with the fragrant scents of the garment of the mention of the Most Great Name and the spiritual breezes of the Lord of nations. Blessed be they who inhale them! And all that was mentioned concerning the stations and ranks of the sanctification, purification, exaltation and transcendence of that Most Holy, Most Glorious Being–exalted be the sovereignty of His grandeur and His glory–was observed with the eye of the head and of the heart. Blessed be thy tongue, thy utterance, and thy pen in having flowed in praise of Him Whose Being of Eternity hath testified to the eternality of His Essence and the oneness of His Self, and hath acknowledged the essential Identity through the uniqueness of His reality and the transcendence of His remembrance.</p>
<p>We beseech God to make thee among those who, when they drink from the chalice of divine unity and taste from the Kawthar of oneness and detachment, stand firm in His Cause, and are not prevented by any in creation from turning to the Most Glorious Horizon and beholding the Most Exalted, Most Glorious Outlook, whose gaze is ever fixed upon the court of their Beloved, whose hearts are turned to the countenance of their Goal, whose souls are forever stirred by the breezes that waft from the direction of the Beloved, and whose spirits are suspended upon the Name of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Praise be to the Beloved of all horizons and the Slayer of lovers, that your honor is numbered among those who drink from the Most Wondrous, Most Glorious chalice and the most delicate, most pure wine at the Most Exalted Horizon, and are reckoned among the people of Baha. I beseech Him, exalted be His glory, to adorn all with the ornament of steadfastness and to preserve them from the whisperings that arise from heedless souls, for the Cause is mighty, mighty indeed, and steadfastness is even mightier than that. Blessed are they who are steadfast! Blessed are they who are firm! Blessed are they who are immovable!</p>
<p>Furthermore, this evanescent servant was present before the Throne, and whatsoever you had submitted in your letter to the Most Holy, Most Glorious Court was presented. This is what shone forth from the horizon of the utterance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. His words, exalted be His might: “Grieve not over anything if thou remainest steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord. This will render thee independent of all that hath been created in the heavens and on earth. Those who have hurt thee have followed their desires and walked in the ways of the wrongdoers. We have protected thee in truth, and We shall protect thee as a favor from Us. Verily, thy Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful. However, it behooveth thee not to turn to those from whom thou perceivest the fragrance of aversion, nor to draw near unto them, nor to associate with them. Thus have We commanded Our servants who have believed in God, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the All-Wise. And should association occur, turn thy heart’s gaze toward God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forebears of old. Say: O my Lord! Protect me from those on whose faces is seen the dust of hell-fire. Then aid me in Thy remembrance and praise, and make me steadfast in such wise that neither the veils of the peoples of creation nor the whisperings of the evil ones shall prevent me. O my Lord! Thou hast guided me to the Dayspring of Thy Cause and the Dawning-Place of Thy inspiration. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name, whereby Thou hast distinguished between the nations, to protect me beneath the pavilion of Thy mercy and the tabernacle of Thy glory. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Dost thou grieve over this world? It shall pass away, by the Lord of the worlds! Rejoice in My love, which nothing created in all existence can equal. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Be thou assured of thy Lord’s favor. He is with those who love Him. He is, verily, the Most Merciful of the merciful.” Thus ended His words. Blessed art thou, for the Tongue of Eternity hath spoken in thy praise and revealed unto thee the verses of His holiness and His beauty, the Beloved. This is a bounty that nothing in the worlds can equal.</p>
<p>Moreover, I conveyed your mention of glorification and praise to the service of the Branches and Twigs of the Divine Lote-Tree–exalted be their praise–and they especially conveyed most wondrous, most glorious greetings. Regarding what you had written about the receipts for the House, emphatic instructions have been given for their dispatch; God willing, they will arrive. The mentioned person feels utmost embarrassment toward your honor and offers endless greetings. And concerning your request for the most blessed and holy photograph of His Holiness, the Most Great Branch–may the spirit of the worlds be sacrificed for Him–it is known to your honor that in this land there is no access to that person who took the blessed photograph. At present, obtaining it is not possible. Perhaps in the future matters will proceed differently. The Command is in God’s hands. And the glory be upon thee and thy family.</p>

<p>O physician, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>In the name of God, the Ever-Abiding, Who perisheth not!</p>
<p>This is a Tablet from Us unto him who hath stood firm in the Cause of his Lord, and through whom the robe of certitude hath been adorned, and who hath been so attracted by the Divine Call that he hath detached himself from all things and turned unto the face of his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Wise, and hath spoken that which his Lord desired. He is the One through Whom the idols were shaken and the hearts of the polytheists melted. We were with thee when thou didst speak forth from the presence of the Truth amidst the company of the wrongdoers, and We heard thy call and whatsoever thou didst utter in the gathering of the people. Verily thy Lord is witness unto all things. They who have wronged thee shall soon be turned back on their heels, and theirs shall be the torment of hell-fire.</p>
<p>Know thou then, O thou who speaketh My praise and glorification, that We have sent forth one of Our servants after We had raised him up with power from Our presence and dispatched him unto the mouth of the serpent, that all may be assured that thy Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Protector of all worlds. He is verily the Almighty, the Powerful. With him is a Book wherein We have manifested the Cause and perfected the proof unto all who dwell on earth. We have stripped from him the garment of fear and trepidation, and adorned him with the robe of strength and assurance, and kindled him with a word from Our presence, and sent him forth like a sphere of fire in the love of thy Chosen Lord, that he might deliver the Book of his Lord. He shall soon deliver it with a sovereignty from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>By My life! Tribulations have not prevented Us from the remembrance of the Lord of Names. We summon the people in all conditions unto God, the Mighty, the Most High. Follow thou the example of thy Lord. He will verily assist thee with the truth and be thy Guardian in this world and the next. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Know thou that those who have entered this City have been afflicted with exhausting air, a troubled life, and tormenting water, such that gladness hath been transformed into sorrow. They have become, in relation to their former state, finer than a needle’s thread and more delicate than embroidered silk. On the right is heard naught but the moaning of those who tremble from the thunder’s fury through what the hands of the malicious have wrought, and on the left the groaning of those whom persistent affliction hath touched through what hath flowed from the pen of the reckoner. We testify that naught hath been ordained from the Pen of Destiny for His loved ones save that which is best for them. We beseech Him to grant them strength to be patient and steadfast, lest tribulations should debar them from the path of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, O thou who gazeth upon the Countenance, for having drunk the cup of tribulation in the love of the Lord of Names. Ye shall soon find yourselves in the heights of glory and wealth. Verily, He is the Ruler over what He willeth. There is none other God but He, the Most High, the Most Glorious.</p>
<p>Should any Christian ask thee about the Beloved, say: It behooveth us not to speak of what is past. Leave what hath been said and hearken unto the call of thy Lord from the direction of the Kingdom, that it may attract thee to the seat of the Throne and sanctify thee from all peoples. By God! A matter hath appeared which, wert thou to become aware of it, would cause thee to soar heavenward in thy longing. Verily, He Who ascended hath come in His great glory, if thou be of them who know.</p>
<p>Be thou sharp of tongue yet sweet of speech in remembering thy Lord, the All-Merciful, amidst the concourse of all worlds. Thus doth the Pen of Destiny teach thee from the presence of One mighty and powerful. Thou art the star of steadfastness, and through thee We have adorned the heaven of certitude for the followers of all religions. Woe unto them who have wronged thee! God shall soon transform thy abasement into glory for those who are nigh unto Him.</p>
<p>The mercy and glory be upon thee and upon those who have hearkened unto thy word concerning the Cause of thy Lord, the Master of the Day of Judgment. Finally, gather thou My loved ones unto the Cause, lest there should occur among them that which would divide their hearts and minds. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>[…] The purpose of mentioning the Christians is that the divines of that community are far removed from the Muhammadan Law–may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake–and in their deficient understanding they have written refutations attempting to invalidate the truth. Therefore, the hearts and ears of that people are filled with unworthy and rejected utterances. Today it is advisable that if someone from that community should question you about Him, one should not become entangled in yes and no in reply. It is more in keeping with piety to say in response that today is not the time for such discussions. A Cause hath appeared which, shouldst thou become aware of it, would cause thee to soar to heaven out of longing. One must investigate and examine this wondrous Cause, and after turning to the holy court, one will become convinced of and acknowledge the Qur’an, even as some in these parts have, after attaining certitude, affirmed the truth of the Qur’an. Thus doth thy Lord teach thee, and none can inform thee like Him Who is all-aware.</p>

<p>In the name of the Most High, the Most Exalted, this is a Book from the Prisoner to him who hath desired his Lord, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, that he may cast away what he hath and hold fast unto the Handle which God hath manifested in the temple of man. Blessed is He Who sent Him with the truth and made Him the Manifestation of His Cause for what hath been and what shall be. Blessed is he who hath turned unto the All-Knowing, detached from idle fancies. He is assuredly among those who have attained the lights of guidance and followed that which they were commanded by the All-Knowing, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>Verily, I am God’s servant among you. He hath sent Me with the truth to manifest His Cause. Every atom beareth witness to this, as doth this hidden Pillar Who hath borne afflictions in manifesting God’s Cause and hath cast behind Him all creation. The Lord of Names beareth witness to this, but the people comprehend not.</p>
<p>Let not the idle fancies that have issued from the mouths of men disturb thee. Be thou assured through the grace of thy Lord, with a heart sanctified from the allusions of those who disbelieved in the All-Merciful when He came with clear proof. Thus hath it been sent down unto thee this day from the presence of the Lord of existence.</p>
<p>Verily, those who slumber today and are kept back from the ocean are the dead. They rejoice in what they possess, but soon shall they find themselves in unrelenting torment. It behooveth him who hath drawn nigh unto the Light to forget darkness and all that is therein. By My life! He soareth above hearts and minds. Didst thou know the station thou hast attained, thou wouldst cast away idle fancies and proclaim unto all peoples this treasured Name.</p>
<p>Those who bear burdens and by them weigh the Self-Sufficient, the Most High - these are people who understand not. Leave what they possess, by the sovereignty of thy Lord, the Creator of the heavens. Say: O my Lord! I have turned with my whole being unto Thee, detached from all else but Thee. Write down for me that which shall profit me in this world and the hereafter. With Thee is the knowledge of all things in a preserved tablet, for I know nothing. I have abandoned my desire in what Thou hast desired, so make me steadfast in Thy Cause and a servant to Thy Self. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>Consider the generations of old when We sent unto them the Manifestations of the Cause. Why did they turn away and deny? Thus doth command thee He Whom sorrows have encompassed in the days of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Reflect, that thou mayest find the fragrance of musk from this Sent Garment.</p>
<p>Place thy trust in all things in God, thy Lord. Verily, He aideth whom He willeth through His sovereignty and ordaineth for him that which maketh him soar in the atmosphere of revelation and witnessing. Should thou return to thy place and someone ask thee whither thou wentest and what thou sawest, say: I moved for the sake of God until I entered the place wherein was raised the mention of my Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, and I heard the call of Him Who was immersed in the ocean of tribulation in God’s path, the Originator of all things, and Who summoneth all unto God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Weigh what thou hast against what hath appeared from Him, that thou mayest be assured that His proof is sovereign over all proofs and His evidence shineth from the horizon of grace. Thus doth the Pen of Revelation speak, and the angels and the Spirit glorify. Thy Lord hath ordained for thee what thou knowest not. Wouldst thou reflect, thou wouldst be certain that at the time thou wert present before the Face, all thy needs were fulfilled, and to this the Self itself beareth witness.</p>
<p>Be thou steadfast in such wise that the whisperings of the people move thee not. Thus hast thou been commanded by the Truth. Blessed is he who followeth his Lord, detached from those who are heedless. Witness naught save what God hath witnessed, and see naught save what We have shown thee in truth. Thus have We broken the seal, and this is the sealed wine.</p>
<p>When thou didst turn unto the Path, this inscribed Tablet was sent down unto thee. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou knowest that I turned toward the direction of Thy grace and the horizon of Thy bounties until I reached the shore of the sea which was surging with Thy Name and remembrance. By Thy might! Were I to thank Thee for as long as Thy Self endureth and Thy Essence abideth, I would be powerless to render thanks for what Thou hast bestowed upon me through Thy grace, though I deserve it not.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee by Thy Self, the Sovereign over all things, that Thou deprive me not of Thy knowledge. Then assist me in all conditions to serve the Wronged One Who is imprisoned in the hands of the oppressors among Thy creation and the heedless among Thy servants. O my Lord! Thou art the Generous, Thou art the Great. I beseech Thee by Thy greatness and Thy power that Thou leave me not to myself and my desires. Draw me unto Thee, even if by chains and fetters. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>Then I beseech Thee, O my God, to consume what I possess with the fire of attraction, then cause me to dwell in the Garden of Eternity, the station of those among Thy servants who are at peace and those among Thy chosen ones who are steadfast, who have no will save what Thou hast willed and no purpose save what Thou hast decreed. Thus doth Thy servant beseech Thee in his final call. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Answerer, and Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful.</p>

<p>This is a Book sent down in truth unto one of God’s near-serving servants. Verily it hath been sent down in truth, and it is a revelation from an ancient Revealer. Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the Holy Court, the seat of thy Lord’s mighty throne, that there is no God but Him, and He Who hath appeared in truth is God’s Cause and His Manifestation amongst all created things. Everything proclaimeth that there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>O servant! Blessed art thou for having attained unto the recognition of God and detached thyself from those who disbelieved and associated partners with Him Who came again with clear sovereignty. Say: O people! I know not toward what countenance ye turn, nor toward what direction ye are among those who turn. Verily He hath appeared with the sovereignty of grandeur and majesty, while ye are occupied with your vain imaginings, O company of transgressors. Ye have clung to your conjectures and turned away from the Beauty of certitude, devoted yourselves to your desires and disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Say: Should ye worship God at every spot on earth for seventy thousand years and weep throughout the duration of God’s kingdom, the Mighty, the Beautiful, it shall profit you not except through love for this Youth, upon Whose brow hath been inscribed in crimson gold by the Pen of God, the Most High, that this is the Beloved of the worlds and the Desire of them that have recognized Him.</p>
<p>Say: O people! If ye were to turn with the ear of innate nature unto all things created between the heavens and the earth, ye would hear from them the description of this eternal, everlasting, divine Youth, concerning Whom God hath taken a covenant with Himself in all the Tablets, were ye of them that know. Say: This is He but for Whom the Bayan would not have been revealed, nor would the verses of God, the Mighty King, the All-Knowing, have been sent down.</p>
<p>O My Name! Hearken unto that which issueth from the mouths of the idolaters. They say: “We have believed in God and His verses,” yet when He appeared in truth with a Cause greater than what appeared before, they disbelieved in Him. Say: God’s curse be upon the liars! They recite My verses that were revealed in My previous Manifestation, yet they have disbelieved in My All-Knowing, All-Informed Self, and have clung to that which the followers of religions before them clung. Woe unto them from the punishment of a mighty day!</p>
<p>Be thou assured in thyself and fear no one. Place thy trust in God, thy Lord, and He shall suffice thee against all the worlds. We are aware of what hath befallen thee and We were with thee. What hath been decreed for thee is what hath been decreed for Us, and with thy Lord is the knowledge of the heavens and earth. Grieve not, for thou art with Us in this world and the next. Soon shall We cause thee to journey through realms wherein all on earth shall seek thy shadow. Thus have We distinguished thee and preferred thee above most of Our servants, and this is indeed a great bounty.</p>
<p>Know thou that when this Revelation was established upon the throne of His Most Great Name, the Most Great, this verse was revealed from the heaven of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, addressing the Pen: “O Pen! Write upon the Tablet and inform the people that the Manifestations have ended with this luminous, resplendent Manifestation. Whosoever claims this most mighty, most great, and most precious station before the completion of a thousand years hath indeed fabricated a lie against God and is of the mischief-makers, for thereby the Cause of God would be corrupted and His command would not be established among His believing servants.”</p>
<p>O My Name! By God! Whosoever possesseth vision and a heart will testify that the eye of time hath never witnessed the like of this Manifestation and shall never witness its like throughout the eternity of thy Lord. Then did the Sun of Mysteries shine forth from the horizon of thy Lord’s Will, and that which was hidden from the sight of the peoples of the worlds and concealed within the treasuries of thy Lord’s protection, the All-Knowing, the Wise, was made manifest.</p>
<p>Rejoice thou in this, then render thanks unto Him. Such gratitude behooveth thee and all things, such praise behooveth thee and all things, such mention behooveth thee and those who have recognized Him. Gather together the loved ones of God and give them the glad-tidings of the Spirit, that they may drink the water of everlasting life from the chalice of thy Lord’s utterance, the Mighty, the Bestower, and be among the thankful ones.</p>
<p>Then forbid them from turning toward this direction, for thereby harm would return to the root of the Cause, except after permission from Us. Thus have We commanded thee that thou mayest command them from One mighty and beautiful. Convey Our greetings unto the faces of those who have believed in God and His verses, both men and women, young and old. We have sent thee Tablets which were revealed in answer to those who opposed God and were among the idolaters. Read them! By God! Therein hath been revealed that which would suffice all the worlds. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

It commandeth you to righteousness and piety, and forbiddeth you transgression and wickedness. This is what hath been sent down in preserved Tablets of holiness.</p>
<p>Say: By God! The hand of God hath emerged from the sleeve of His power, and the sovereignty of the Cause hath appeared with mighty authority over the truth. Say: O people! Fear God and dispute not His verses after they have been sent down in truth from the Dayspring of the Most Exalted Name. Deny not God’s favor, and reject not Him through Whom His beauty hath been manifested, His names exalted, His verses perfected, and His words completed unto all the worlds.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Do ye take as your protector other than God, after He hath come upon the clouds of the Cause with clear signs, created you, sustained you, made known unto you the paths of holiness and guidance, and taught you wondrous and impregnable knowledge? Say: Beware, O people of the Bayan! Have mercy upon yourselves and upon the souls of the servants, and be not like the people of the Furqan when the Most High came unto them with luminous Tablets of holiness.</p>
<p>By God! I fear not for Myself, but for him who shall come after Me with mighty and impregnable sovereignty. By God! Whoso objecteth unto Me shall object unto him. Thus doth the Dove of the Cause warble with wondrous and novel verses. Guard thyself from drawing nigh unto the idolaters, then convey unto the people that which God hath conveyed unto thee. This is better for thee than all the worlds.</p>
<p>If thou art seated when God’s Tablet reacheth thee, arise from thy seat and be not sluggish upon the earth. When thou art in remembrance, be silent that thou mayest hear what the Spirit reciteth in this Paradise, which appeareth in the form of a visible Tablet. When thou hast heard and recognized what is treasured in thy Lord’s melodies of self-knowledge, then aid Him with thyself and with thy tongue, and tarry not even for the twinkling of an eye. This is what thou hast been commanded in the Book wherein falsehood cannot approach, which speaketh the truth that there is no God but Him, and He encompasseth all things.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Aid ye the Youth and fear no one. Know that God guardeth you with mighty unseen hosts. If ye aid Him not, God hath indeed aided Him in many circumstances when He strengthened Him with the Holy Spirit and sent down upon Him hosts ye saw not, when governments and peoples rose against Him. He protected Him in truth and brought Him forth from the city with mighty sovereignty. The necks of Pharaohs were humbled before Him, and the heads of every proud and wretched one were brought low.</p>
<p>Say: God shall soon raise up a people possessed of mighty strength, and through them will He aid the Youth as He aided Him the first time. These shall not be hindered by veils nor withheld by allusions, for this is not difficult for God. Their hearts are as blocks of iron, such that nothing in the heavens or earth shall cause them fear. Thus doth He aid whom He willeth through His grace, and His help is nigh unto the believers.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Do ye deny him who hath believed in God and His verses and in all that hath been sent down in manifest and mighty Tablets? He hath strived with his soul to such a degree that through him God’s Cause was raised up between earth and heaven, His Word was exalted, His proof was perfected, His signs became renowned, and His traces filled the East and the West. The Cause through him reached a station that no just and trustworthy one can deny. Those who deny this bounty - their hearts have hardened and Satan hath inspired in them the lowest word. Say: The Word of God is the most exalted, were ye but aware of it.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Do ye deny the favor that is visible upon the temple of the Youth? He reciteth unto you at every moment novel verses of attraction, bestoweth upon you the fruits of the Lote-Tree of Paradise, and draweth you nigh unto an impregnable station of nearness. If ye deny this, by what evidence did ye believe in the Manifestations of old and in Ali before Nabil? Say: The Youth hath come upon clouds of fire with holy and beauteous myriads. Therefore be fair within yourselves and ponder upon the creation of the heavens and the earth, that ye may find a path unto God in this Throne.</p>
<p>Say: Do ye deny God while ye read His verses? What aileth these people that they scarcely understand any discourse? Thus hath the Nightingale of the Cause sung unto thee and inspired thee with the word of piety, that thou mayest arise for thy Lord’s Cause and aid Him according to thy capacity. Aid cometh from none but Him, and He is indeed independent of all worlds.</p>

In truth, some among the people have, by their own hands, purchased divine wrath. Some He hath seized, and others He will seize. Verily, He hath power over all things. All things have bewailed the oppression of the people of truth, and sorrow hath encompassed all.

Guide me, then, in all mine affairs unto that which profiteth me for the glory of Thy Cause and the loftiness of the station of thy loved ones.” Let him then reflect upon the matter and undertake whatever cometh to mind. This vehement opposition of the enemies will indeed give way to supreme prosperity.</p>

The call of the Two Alifs and Shin hath been raised from the Prison. As for the first, he is the Nightingale, upon him be My glory, from the direction of Ra and Shin. There hath befallen him what befell My Herald in the prison. They imprisoned the Exalted One - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - in the land of Ta with a group of others, and the might of oppression so seized the loved ones that they outwardly turned away from Him, save one soul who declared: “O my Lord! I desire to be with Thee in the Supreme Companion and the Most Glorious Horizon.” Those same souls, after the passing of certain months, returned with the utmost lowliness and supplication, and their repentance was accepted, and they attained His supreme bounty. Happy are they! He knoweth how they returned and how He sanctified them and wrote for them with His Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>O Name of Bounty! Were it not for a decree that hath gone forth from Us, We would have shown the heedless and the oppressors which of us is more exalted and powerful. In this Most Great Revelation, ye have observed how many enemies He seized with mighty power; yet none became aware, all being intoxicated with the wine of heedlessness and far removed from the court of divine mercy. However, the world is pregnant with oppression. Soon shall the oppressors behold what they have wrought in the days of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>O My Nightingale! Thou wert warbling openly upon the branches in the springtime of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Now thou mayest warble in prison secretly, until God shall bring thee His relief, His mercy, His bounty, His grace, His generosity, and His favor.</p>
<p>As for the second Alif and Shin, upon him be My glory, his call hath reached Us from the land of Alif and Ba. The oppressors have seized him and cast him into prison. Know ye that they are in manifest loss. The heedlessness of these ignorant ones hath reached such a pass that they reflect not upon the former and latter generations. They follow their vain desires and imagine themselves to be among those possessed of knowledge. All things testify to their fabrications, and beyond them the Tongue of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Name of Bounty! His honor Sin Mim, upon him be My grace and mercy, standeth at the door. Say: Lord! Pour forth patience upon him who loveth Thee and whom Thou lovest. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful. Although, praise be to God, he is adorned with the ornament of patience, yet this mention is a token of the Wronged One’s loving-kindness toward him. For some time, they must conceal the sending of correspondence from both directions, such that even the household members remain unaware. And should they wish to write details to his honor the Nightingale, they should likewise command him to maintain secrecy. Blessed is he who acteth in accordance with what hath been commanded by the Wronged One, and joy be to him who hath attained unto obedience to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O Name of Bounty! His honor the Shaykh, upon him be My mercy, hath fallen into hardship. However, since his purpose was for God’s sake and occurred with acceptance and acquiescence, it hath been and shall remain blessed. Write to him what We commanded thee in person. God willing, they shall be assisted. In all matters, what is necessary today is that they exercise care in the sending and receiving of letters, and never let go of wisdom. This is what We counseled before, and in this most exalted and impregnable station.</p>

<p>He is the Almighty</p>
<p>O ye My Arab friends, and My loved ones, My chosen ones, My hosts and My Manifestation. Hearken to My call if ye art amongst them who possess a hearing ear. Have ye forgotten the Bird of Revelation that flew away from amongst you and ascended to the Lord, the Almighty, the Beneficent? Have ye forgotten the Nightingale that was in your midst and proclaimed unto you the verses of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise? Art ye shut out as by a veil from this Dove that hath fallen under the clutches of the infidels?</p>
<p>By the righteousness of God! The tribulations We have sustained are such that no tongue can adequately recount, and have caused the tears of them who have near access to God to flow from their eyes. Thus did the Bird of Revelation cease Its mention of Sheba and the countenance of the holy ones were reddened with blood. By God! The Nightingale of Paradise hath shut Its eyes from beholding the beauty of the rose inasmuch as sorrows have befallen this gracious and sublime Beauty, and rivers were denied reunion with the ocean inasmuch as joy hath left this resplendent and luminous Sun.</p>
<p>O ye My loved ones! Forget not to attain My presence during My days, and deny not My loving kindness towards you, neither forget my mercy upon you and be not of the heedless. By the righteousness of God! The path of God, nay the path of all His messengers, was returned in the person of Husayn, and He then arrived at this far and remote prison. And when ye gather in your houses in days of celebration, remember Our sufferings and that which befell Us at the hands of the hosts of the evil ones. And when ye visit your gardens during springtime, ponder My woes and My anguish and be of them that reflect.</p>
<p>Remember then that We were amidst you for some years and you did not recognize Me inasmuch as We had veiled Our Face from you and from all creation. Thus wert ye deprived from recognizing God and His Beauty, His testimony and His glory and His proofs and His signs and His Servant, if ye but know it. Say: the Ancient Beauty was amongst you, adorned in the beauty of the Lord, the Almighty, the Supreme, the All-Wise, and the King of all creation appeared in the raiment of His subjects and you did not perceive it. And when all came to pass and the promise was fulfilled, He appeared from the dayspring of the Divine Essence with great sovereignty.</p>
<p>And you, O loved ones of God and His hosts, strive earnestly towards God and His Beauty and when you hear His verses, render thanks unto the Lord, your Creator, that He hath enabled you to recognize Him when you were oblivious of Him. Bow down your faces and your hearts before God and be thankful to Him for this ancient mercy bestowed upon you.</p>
<p>Take heed. Dispute not in the Cause of God and cast not away the ordinances of God which have been revealed in the Bayan from the Almighty, the Generous One. Gather in love and reconcile the discords that arise amongst you. Be as one soul seated upon the exalted seat of truth. Beware lest ye transgress and overstep the bounds which the Almighty hath fixed and be counted amongst the mischief-makers. If there are poor amidst you, expend on him from that which God hath bestowed upon you and deprive not others from that which you possess. And if you find a suffering soul, treat him with mercy and befriend him with forbearance, and if you encounter a soul of weak faith, remonstrate him not and exhort him with kindness and with a sweet and gentle tongue so that he may recognize the Faith of God in his inmost heart and comprehend that which he was bidden by the All-knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Take heed that ye create not discord and dissention with one another, and that no soul harmeth another soul, and none acteth treacherously towards others, and no friend slandereth his friend, and no believer denieth the rights of his brother in faith. Fear ye God in all that We revealed unto ye and be among the righteous. Beware lest ye deprive your relatives, or the poor and needy from the excess of your possessions. This is my council unto ye and the command of God for and upon ye, if ye but perceive it.</p>
<p>Thus do We announce unto you from the signs of the unity of God and from that which you were bidden so that you may declare the Oneness of God, your Creator, with your inner and outer tongues in such wise that His signs appear in all your limbs and you may be counted among them who acknowledge His Unity. He is verily, the One to whom return your beings, your hearts, your souls, your bodies, all that you possess and all that you owe. He is the one unto Whom must return all that are in the heavens and on earth, if ye but know it.</p>
<p>My joy and blessings rest upon all, whether young or old, O ye concourse of my loved ones. Convey Our greetings to your spouses and your offspring. This verily is my command unto you; follow it then so that you may be among them who are guided aright.</p>

<p>O Husayn! Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, inasmuch as thy name hath been mentioned before the Wronged One in His Most Great Prison, and He hath remembered thee with verses wherewith God hath adorned the cities of knowledge and wisdom, as a token of His grace - and He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>That which thou didst send unto him who circled round the Cause and took for himself a station beneath the pavilion of the mercy of his Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful, hath been received. O Husayn! Hearken unto the call from the direction of ’Akka. He hath remembered thee with that which no remembrance can equal, and whereby the eyes of them who have not broken God’s Covenant and His Testament, and who have voiced His praise before the faces of all who are in the heavens and the earth, have been solaced.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention concerning thy wife and her ascension to the Supreme Companion - We beseech God to send down upon her from the heaven of His bounty a mercy from His presence, and to cause her to enter the Most Exalted Paradise. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. And We beseech Him, exalted be He, to forgive her and purify her, and to grant her from His everlasting and eternal favors. He is verily the All-Bountiful, possessed of surpassing generosity.</p>
<p>O Mahmud! Thy name was present in this praiseworthy station, and the Pen of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, hath remembered thee. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of Names, and glory be unto Thee, O Creator of the heavens, for having remembered me in Thy days with that wherefrom the near ones perceive the fragrance of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art God, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>O ?abibu’llah! We counsel thee and them that have believed to be trustworthy and chaste, and to that wherefrom the detached ones perceive the fragrance of detachment, and the sincere ones the sweet savour of My glorious and beloved garment.</p>
<p>O Hasan! Upon thee be My glory! Thou hast attained unto the traces of My Most Exalted Pen and My remembrance in the Scriptures, the Books and the Tablets. We have desired to remember thee at this time once again as a token of Our grace - and I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Thou didst turn thy face toward My horizon when My servants turned away therefrom, save whom God, the Lord of the Return, did will. We counsel thee to act with goodliness in all conditions, that there may be diffused from thee that which beseemeth the days of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. We beseech God, exalted be He, to make thee a standard of His name and to give thee to drink of the Kawthar of life from the hand of His bounty. He is verily the Lord of Generosity and the Master of Munificence in private and in public.</p>
<p>O Zaynu’l-’Abidin! At this moment there hath come unto thee from His presence the Mother Book. Blessed art thou for having turned unto Him from Whom most of the servants have turned away. At this moment My Most Exalted Pen hath been moved to remember thee. Rejoice thou and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Revealer of the verses! Convey My greetings unto thy brother and thy family and those who are with thee, and give them the glad-tidings of that which hath been sent down unto them from God, the Revealer of clear evidence. Say: By God! The proof hath been perfected, the heavenly table hath been sent down, and there hath appeared that which was recorded in the Books and Tablets. We make mention of My loved ones there and give them the glad-tidings of My mercy which hath encompassed all regions. O Pen! Turn thy face toward the Land of Qaf and Mim, then make mention of the Friend who hath broken the idols and vain imaginings by the strength of the power of his Lord, the Mighty, the Compelling. Blessed is he and blessed is he who hath heard his call and remembered him in this Remembrance before which all remembrances have bowed down. We have remembered him in the Crimson Scroll from the Most Exalted Pen with that which shall endure as long as the Kingdom endureth, that he may rejoice and stand firm in service to the Cause during the days of God, the Lord of all men. Then make mention of him who was named ’Abdu’r-Rahim with a remembrance wherewith God hath subdued the horizons. Hearken unto My call from the direction of My loving-kindness. Verily He remembered thee before and in this time before which ages and centuries have bowed down. Say: […]</p>
<p>Praise and glory be unto Thee, O Lord of Names, for having enabled me to hearken unto Thy call and witness Thy signs and Thy power which hath encompassed all regions. I beseech Thee to assist me in all conditions to attain unto such steadfastness as no vain imaginations can deter, and to remember him who hath ascended unto the Most Exalted Companion, through that which caused the ocean of forgiveness to surge before the faces of all religions.</p>
<p>O Mir! Glorify on my behalf thyself and those who are with thee, and My loved ones there who have not been deterred by the oppression of any oppressor nor the might of any denying infidel. Verily the wolf hath seized My sheep, the oppressor hath slain My she-camel, and the serpent hath swallowed its prey. Thus was the matter decreed and thus did all things proclaim that which caused the mountains to take flight. By God’s life! At his ascension the people of Paradise came forth, and the companions of Heaven and the Concourse on High welcomed him with the lights of their Lord, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. By My life! The Pen is powerless to make mention of him - to this doth the Tongue of Grace bear witness in this station. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those whom God hath adorned with the ornament of strength, might and power.</p>

<p>All things testify to their impotence to mention and describe Him, and the Kingdom of Names bears witness to its inadequacy to know Him. In a station where the Kingdom of Utterance stands powerless and wanting to describe Him, how can the limping steed of this evanescent servant gallop in that vast arena? My outward and inward tongue, and the inward of the inward confess that His chosen ones cannot be described by my descriptions nor mentioned by my mentions - how much more so He Who created them, raised them up, and sent them forth! Allah is the Most Great! This is a station wherein every tongue of utterance falls short of His mention, and the Kingdom of Knowledge of His praise. This servant testifies that there is none other God but Him, acknowledging His oneness and confessing His sovereignty, His transcendence, His exaltation and His power - a testimony that neither the might of them that are in the world can prevent, nor the chains of those who have turned away from God, the Lord of all nations.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose Name and Will the four rivers did flow, and by Whose tongues the world hath spoken of Thy unity and oneness! I beseech Thee by the fruits of the Tree of Thy oneness and the mysteries of the Manifestations of Thy uniqueness, to aid Thy chosen ones in their love and praise of Thee. O Lord! Thou beholdest them turning to Thee, clinging to the cord of Thy favors, and holding fast to the hem of the robe of Thy bounty and grace. Send down upon them from the heaven of Thy loving-kindness that which will preserve them from the oppression of the transgressors among Thy servants and the deniers among Thy creation. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Dominant, the Powerful, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>The world hath been encompassed by the winds of discord and oppression, and though appearing to ascend, is in constant descent. Countless trials have become manifest and evident, all stemming from the heedlessness of the people. Strange indeed that the great ones of state and nation have not arisen to discover the cause and reason thereof. What they possess hath deluded them from what is with God, the One, the Munificent, the Bountiful, and their affairs, manifestations, appearances and ornaments have occupied them - their words and deeds bear witness to this, as doth every person of insight. At all times we beseech God, exalted be His glory, to protect His Faith through the hosts of the seen and unseen, and to guard it from the oppression of the various factions. He verily hath power over all things.</p>
<p>In regards to what you had written about proceeding to Egypt, your attention to that direction is in accordance with the wisdom with which all are charged. God willing, you shall be divinely assisted in all matters. Concerning what you wrote about the trees and flowers and their arrangements, God willing, may their fruits be eternally remembered by the names of those beloved ones and masters, even as His Most Beautiful Names endure. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Prayer from this evanescent servant and its acceptance from the Eternal Truth is assured. The glances of His loving-kindness shall turn toward you and make manifest the fruits of the Tree of humanity. Verily, He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful, and He is the Kind, the Merciful. To the beloved of heart and soul, Aqa Siyyid ’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God - since a petition was previously submitted to his presence, this time I shall not add to the burden. His letter brought strength to heart and sight. God willing, may he ever abide beneath the shade of the favor of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, dwelling in peace, speaking, remembering and praising.</p>

<p>152 He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power</p>
<p>Praise be to the Lord of Names, Who hath made tribulation to be a herald from His presence that perchance the people of the realm of creation might be awakened - they who have violated His Covenant, denied His signs, disputed His proof, turned away from His traces, opposed His loved ones, and shed the blood of His chosen ones, for whom His Paradise and the dwellers of the pavilion of His glory have lamented. Exalted is He, the King of Kings and the Merciful to the possessed, Who hath sent down the Books and dispatched the Messengers to guide His servants to His straight path and His mighty Command, and to explain to creation His commandments, His laws, and that which profiteth them in His lands. Exalted be God, the Single, the One, Who sent forth him who was named Muhammad, through whom He adorned the world and revived the nations. Through him the dust proclaimed: “The Manifestation of the Lord of Lords hath come!” The trees spoke: “He Who relateth from God concerning the beginning and the end hath appeared!” The pebbles in his hand bore witness, the date-stone cried out in His name, the atoms circled round Him, and all created things circumambulated a House that God had made blessed for His servants, a point of pilgrimage for His creation, and a refuge for His creatures.</p>
<p>Prayers and peace be upon him and upon his family, through whom the Euphrates of divine knowledge hath flowed throughout all possibility, and the nightingale of eternity warbled upon the branches. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Help in Peril. And upon his companions, through whom God’s Cause was established throughout all regions and His traces spread throughout all lands, through whom the hearts of the idolaters were disturbed and the hearts of the doubtful ones yearned, and through whom God cut off the last remnant of the wrongdoers who violated God’s Covenant and His pledge, and who followed what their own desires commanded them. These are they who took what they had and cast aside what was with God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Thus did God seize them for their sin and set upon them servants possessed of terrible might who ravaged the lands.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Creator of spirits and bodies, and Protector of all beings! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, whereby the Concourse on High rejoiced and the worshippers of idols lamented, to assist Thy servants to turn to Thee, to hold fast to Thy cord, and to cling to Thy robe. Then preserve, O my God, by Thy binding command and Thy Most Great Name, Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones from the evil of Thine enemies. Then grant them every good thing sent down in Thy Book. O Lord! They are the poor and Thou art the Rich; they are the weak and Thou art the Strong, the Powerful. Nothing escapeth Thy knowledge and no decree is impossible for Thee. The atoms have testified to Thy power and might. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the traces of your pen have gladdened me with news of your health, which is mentioned in the Book of Divine Favors as among the greatest bounties. When joy and delight took hold of me, I turned to the Ultimate Goal and called upon God, the Lord of all beings, to preserve you from every tribulation and calamity. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Preserver, the Helper, the Supporter, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Praise be to God that the Truth, through the blessing of His loved ones, preserved that city from the darkest tribulation, and the many were transformed into few, and this is naught but from His grace upon us. And in Beirut it was reduced to very little, as a token of kindness to His Afnan. Praise be to God, those beloved ones have ever been and continue to be mentioned. With a hundred thousand tongues must one thank the True Object of Worship, Who hath granted His loved ones an abundant share of the wine of utterance. May it be pleasant and wholesome unto you!</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about his honor, the elevated and blessed Haji Mulla ’Ali - upon him be God’s peace, remembrance, praise, care and favors - through God’s grace, exalted be His glory, during his life he drank what was to be drunk, and after his ascension he attained unto that which none save God can properly comprehend. Blessed is he, and his is a goodly beginning and end.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this evanescent servant maketh mention of his nothingness and evanescence to each and every one of the friends and loved ones in that land, and requesteth all to beseech the exalted Truth to assist this servant in that which is acceptable before Him. He is the Helper and the Powerful, and He is the Mighty and the All-Knowing. There is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Peace be upon you, and God’s mercy and His blessings.</p>

<p>This servant desires to adorn the head of his letter with that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an, which He made the characteristic of them that are nigh unto Him, the ultimate station of the mystics, and the testament of the sincere ones, from which the fragrance of detachment hath been wafted throughout creation. He - and His word is the truth - hath said: “Say: ‘God!’ then leave them to their vain disputes.”</p>
<p>Its fragrance bestoweth a hundred thousand lives and createth a hundred thousand souls. By the life of our Lord! Were it to shed its radiance upon the limbs and members of God’s servants, each would find a tongue and utter the blessed words “Praise be unto Thee for having freed me from all else but Thee and made me independent of all except Thyself.” This is that Word from whose horizon the sun of freedom hath dawned forth.</p>
<p>This servant beseecheth his Lord to honor us with it and to grant us the blessing of uttering it in all conditions. Before this exalted Word, the world becometh as nothing and all else but God appeareth finite. Glorified be our Sovereign, and magnified be our Lord! He hath bestowed that which the world with all its revelations cannot equal. But who can render thanks for this bounty and from whom can gratitude appear? Where is the capacity, where is the worthiness? Vain imaginings have become the cause of loss. The power of the favored community hath been changed to weakness, its standing to sitting, its speech to silence.</p>
<p>But what is the cause of this weakness, and what is the reason for this impotence? On behalf of the believers I present this verse:</p>
<p>“Each dawn I press my face against the dust of helplessness when I remember</p>
<p>That though I never forget Thee, dost Thou ever remember Thy servant?”</p>
<p>Nay, by God! We are not the forgetful ones, and He is the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing. His hand hath ever granted deliverance, His generosity hath ever bestowed gifts, and His power hath ever preserved us. Yet they met this blessing with betrayal and followed this grace with ingratitude. I swear by the Sun of Truth that these weaknesses and incapacities, these humiliations and inabilities, are the result of our own deeds. His Holiness Muhammad bears witness to these words, and His Holiness the First One (Ali) testifies to this utterance and exposition.</p>
<p>There is fear that excessive speech may cause weariness and constrict the realm of comfort, therefore brevity is preferable.</p>
<p>The exalted letter arrived repeatedly with gifts. One of its gifts was the cause of remembrance, and finally the source of awakening. With each word were arrayed the hosts of love, and the ranks of divine favor bore witness. After awareness and understanding were gained, intention was made to approach the Presence, and when presented before His countenance, He said:</p>
<p>The mention of Ali (upon him be peace) is like a tree planted in the soil of love, which has reached the most exalted station through the Kawthar of favor and grace. It is so firm and steadfast that the most violent winds cannot prevail against its might, finding themselves weak before it. Glorious is its planting place, glorious its Cultivator, and magnificent its Creator! Its leaves are goodly character and its fruits are praiseworthy deeds. Blessed is he who attains to visit it and witnesses the power of its Creator and Builder.</p>
<p>O Ali! May you dwell beneath the sun of divine grace, clinging to the hem of His favor and holding fast to the cord of His generosity. Verily He is with you in all conditions, hearing your call and your prayers, and seeing what proceeds from you. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>Convey greetings to the loved ones from the Wronged One. Each has been and is mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. We beseech God to aid them to unity, that through them the horizons may be illumined. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Munificent, the Glorious, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The ocean is surging and the sun of favor is shining. Mention has reached such a station that each of its letters is a mighty book in the sight of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne.</p>
<p>I convey greetings to all the loved ones. Although these greetings which are expressed in letters appear outwardly to be of one form, yet in effect and fruit each is distinct. Though the greenness of tree leaves may appear outwardly to be of one hue, yet in their effects and qualities they are so distinct that none save God can enumerate their characteristics. Know that each leaf of every tree has its own effect, and another has a different effect - who has been able to enumerate them and who has encompassed them? The essence of impotence and ignorance has been and remains unable to enumerate the infinite sciences and arts. Verily our Lord is He Who enumerates all things in His perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>Peace, remembrance, and praise be upon you, upon those with you, and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>

<p>O Ali! Give thanks to God for having enabled thee to attain the presence of thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, at His Throne, and to drink the choice wine of revelation from the cup of the utterance of the All-Merciful when the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimed: “There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Generous.” Thou hast been honored to attain the presence of the Self-Subsisting when He appeared with His Name “the Wronged One” in this mighty prison. We bear witness that thou didst turn to Him, enter His presence, arise, behold, and hear, and didst attain that which thy Ancient Lord desired for thee in these days wherein the sun of grace hath dawned and the moon of bounty hath shone upon all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>It behooveth thee to soar on the wings of yearning in the atmosphere of inner meanings and utterance, and to speak amongst all created things of this wondrous Name. O Akbar! Hearken once again unto the call from this Blessed Divine Lote-Tree, the Primal Unity, planted in the soil of grandeur, to the melodies of thy Most Glorious Lord, Who speaketh betwixt earth and heaven: “There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Wise.” Thou hast entered the precincts of the All-Merciful by My leave. Now return by My command to thy home, that through thee might be wafted the sweet savors of the Desired One amongst His assured servants.</p>
<p>We speak naught except by God’s command, and breathe naught save that which returneth unto Him, and We command no one save that through which are manifested the attributes of his Lord’s Cause, the Mighty, the Impregnable. We have never desired aught for Ourselves, but rather the Self of God, yet the people remain behind a thick veil. Say: We have forsaken that which would give rest to Our bodies, and have desired that which would cause hearts to burn in the path of the Beloved. This is the way of Baha, which He hath chosen for Himself, were ye to know. What thou hast known of My tribulations is as nothing in thy Lord’s sight. We have concealed most matters, in view of Our mercy that hath encompassed the worlds.</p>
<p>O Akbar! Blessed art thou for having turned to the Most Great Prospect and been among the successful ones. Thus doth God assist whom He willeth among His servants; He is the Protector of those who draw nigh unto Him. How many servants have sought yet reached not their goal, and how many have attained, succeeded, heard, and said: “Praise be to Thee, O Thou Beloved of them that know!” And how many a servant who attained not Our presence - We have written for him the reward of one who hath attained the presence of God, for he is indeed of those whom the All-Merciful hath testified are among those who have attained.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who moveth by God’s leave and command, and blessed is he who remaineth still through God’s Will and decree. We bear witness that he is among those who draw nigh. O Ali! Thou art in thy place, yet the Tongue of the Most High speaketh thy praise. Dost thou see any bounty greater than this? Nay, by thy Lord, We have ever been mindful. The Finger of loving-kindness hath moved the Most Exalted Pen to make mention of thee purely for the sake of God; He is indeed the Most Merciful of the merciful.</p>
<p>Be thou of such character that whosoever approacheth thee may be drawn by the mention of thy Lord, the Ancient of Days. Thus it behooveth one who hath turned to the Countenance and attained His mighty throne. Convey My greetings to My loved ones who soar in the atmosphere of My love and speak My Name, make mention of Me, and sing My praise. Then recount to them what thou hast learned of the story of the Youth, that they may arise to render assistance as We have commanded them in the Tablets We have sent through those who sought Us.</p>
<p>This is not the day for stillness and patience. The Lote-Tree of Fire proclaimeth: “There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Praised.” O My loved ones! Grieve not over the world and what hath befallen you in My path. By God! Your reward lieth within the treasuries of My power and the repositories of My protection. He is indeed the Bestower, the Mighty, the Trusted One.</p>
<p>Make mention of your Lord with wisdom and utterance, then stand firm in such wise that the hearts of the unbelievers may be troubled and the backs of the idolaters be broken. Thus have We inspired thee and taught thee that thou mayest thank thy Lord at all times and be of those who remember. Go forth with God’s Tablet and its influence to those who have attained to the love of God and His Cause, and are among the steadfast ones, that they may hear the call of the Beloved time and again, and be assured that He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Giver, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the radiant faces among the people of Baha, who, when they heard the call, responded: “Yea, O Thou Wronged One of the worlds!” Say: O My loved ones! This is the day of triumph and victory. Arise to serve the Cause by leave of your Lord, the All-Choosing. Beware lest anything prevent you from making mention of this All-Wise Remembrance. Ye are the gems of the earth. We have taken you through Our sovereignty and raised you to the dome of true knowledge. Preserve ye this exalted station, the mighty, the impregnable. Thus have ye been commanded by the Lord of Pre-existence, Who is imprisoned through what the hands of the nations who denied God, the Lord of all worlds, have wrought.</p>

<p>He is the Mighty! O Kamalu’d-Din! Bear thou witness within thyself that there is none other God but Him, the Originator, the Wondrous. Say: Verily He is exalted in the Book of God, the King, the Most High, the Mighty, the Beauteous. In His grasp are the keys of the heavens which were raised up in the Bayan, and in His right hand is the dominion of Command and Creation, and verily He is powerful over all things. Say: Knowledge is that which hath appeared from His presence in a holy, preserved Book. Then know thou that He hath appeared in truth with manifest sovereignty and from Him hath been detailed the Book of God, the Powerful, the Munificent. He hath counseled the servants in every line of the Tablets concerning this sacred, luminous Beauty, Whom no one’s understanding hath encompassed and the hands of the peoples of the heavens and earth have not attained unto the hem of His knowledge.</p>
<p>Say: Verily the Truth is in itself God’s proof unto all creation and hath no need of aught else to demonstrate His Cause, if ye be of them that know. Say: O people of the Bayan! Do ye imagine that He needeth anything to establish His Cause? Nay, by the Lord of the worlds! Say: All proof is established by His Command and evidence appeareth by His leave, if ye be of the assured ones. And verily that which appeareth from Him of clear signs and that which is sent down from His presence of verses - this is a bounty from Him unto them that profess His unity.</p>
<p>Say: O people, fear ye God and make not His Cause limited by the limitations of your own selves. Fear God and be not of the transgressors. Say: Verily He cannot be limited by any limit and cannot be veiled by any veil. He manifesteth as He pleaseth, and verily He is the All-Choosing, the Powerful, the Wise. Nothing can prevent Him from His Command and His sovereignty, and the schemes of the schemers and the might of monarchs cannot frustrate Him. Those who would limit God’s Manifestation by a command or a sign or by what they possess of satanic imaginings - these have turned away from the Truth and disbelieved in the verses of the All-Merciful and are in manifest error.</p>
<p>Say: Verily We were among you for months and years, in but a moment of which God hath reckoned up the centuries of the first and the last ones. And We were, in every instant thereof, reciting unto you from the verses of God, the Single, the Most High, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And We were manifesting in every moment with a mighty, glorious Beauty and a novel, holy dignity and an exalted, mighty majesty, yet none among you recognized Me, for ye were walking in the paths of thick delusion. Thus did We seize the sight of those who beheld not the Beauty of God with their own eyes and were among the heedless ones.</p>
<p>Say: By God! This is a Beauty wherein is kindled and shineth the light of God, the Mighty, the Luminous. From Him hath appeared every wondrous command, and from Him have been detailed the Tablets of God, and from Him hath appeared the embroidered vesture of this mighty News. Say: The Beauty of the Ancient One hath shone forth from His collar - blessed be God, the Sovereign of the worlds!</p>
<p>And thou - remind the people in thy days and fear no one, even if these deniers oppose thee. Verily thy Lord will guard thee from those who have disbelieved and from these polytheists. Say: By God! We desired not to reveal Our Cause to anyone, and thus were We in mighty concealment. But when the polytheists imprisoned Us in this prison, We therefore revealed Our countenance in spite of them and in spite of those who denied these wondrous, revealed verses.</p>
<p>Say: Those who have turned away from this Countenance, these are in the torment of the blazing fire, and neither their faith nor their deeds shall be accepted, even if they prostrate themselves to God in their days or spend the fullness of the heavens and earth in precious pearls. Say: O companions of God! Fear God and be steadfast in your love, such that your feet slip not from the breaths of those who are far removed. Know ye that the Balance today is My love, and if ye desire to weigh anyone, recite unto him from the verses which have been sent down from My presence. If his eyes overflow with tears, know ye that he is upon the truth from God and is possessed of manifest certitude. And he whose face darkeneth, verily he is in grievous unbelief. And beware lest thou approach one whose breast’s rancor is as manifest as the sun in the midst of heaven, such that none among creation could mistake it, if ye be of them that witness.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of the beloved! Ye helped Us not in that, but God will help Me in truth and will raise up in truth one who shall smite upon his mouth through the power of God, the Most High, the Powerful, the Wise. Say: Verily God is powerful over His creation. He seizeth whom He willeth with sovereignty from His presence and power from His court, and verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Potent. Thus do We cast upon thee from the verses of the Spirit that thou mayest be among the steadfast ones.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!</p>
<p>We have taught men that which profiteth them and have laid down for them the laws of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Among men are those who have recognized the fruits of what hath been sent down in the Tablets, and among them are those who have taken it in vain and disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the All-Loving. Blessed are ye, O people of Baha, for ye are they who have turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon and have heard the call of God, the Lord of Names. Through you hath circulated the wine of unity, and through you hath flowed the Salsabil, and through you was broken the seal of the choice sealed wine. Rejoice ye in that ye have known the Beloved and no veil of any heedless soul hath hindered you.</p>
<p>Consider those who claim to belong to the Bayan. They have turned away from the All-Merciful and speak that which causeth the heavens and earth to laugh at them. Among them is he who hath said that He hath claimed Divinity, and that we must not believe in this exalted station. Say: He Who gave you glad tidings of His Own Self hath said that He speaketh in all things, “there is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.” We see them to be more lost in understanding than the people of the Furqan, nay than those of all religions. Well is it with the people who understand.</p>
<p>Ponder, O people of Baha, upon their words, then remember when We delivered you from the wilderness of idle fancies and sanctified you from the imaginings of men, and brought you nigh unto the Horizon wherefrom was raised the call between earth and heaven: “There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Witnessed One.”</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Come, then tell Me truthfully: Who was it that spoke on Sinai to the Manifestation of the Revelation whom We named with Our name “He Who conversed with God” and sent unto him who disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Unseen and the Seen? If ye say the Tree spoke of its own accord, how then do ye deny this Call which hath been raised in truth? And if ye say He spoke in it, then He it is Who now speaketh: “There is no God but Me, the Forgiving, the Generous.” By My life! Were they to reflect for less than a moment, they would abandon what they have heard and taken, and would turn unto God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Say: This is a Revelation the like of which hath never appeared in creation. The Tongue of Revelation beareth witness to this, yet the people are in an evident veil. We have veiled Our Self, and what We have explained to the servants is but a drop from this mighty Ocean. Reflect on that which the tongue of Muhammad, the Apostle of God, spoke aforetime: “I am He and He is I, except that I am that I am and He is that He is.” Thus was the matter decreed, and ye are of them that hear.</p>
<p>And in the station of “I am He,” the Tree proclaimeth: “Verily, I am God, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Praised One.” And in the station of “He is I,” the Tongue of Grandeur speaketh among creation: “He is God, there is no God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” And in the station of “Verily He is He,” He speaketh and saith: “There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great.” And in the station of “I am I,” He speaketh: “Verily, I am the first to turn unto Him, and speak His praise, and hear His call, and arise to His Cause, and drink the Kawthar of His bounty, and be illumined by the Sun of His manifestation, and be adorned with His knowledge. Whoso hath known Me hath known Him, and whoso hath acknowledged My sovereignty hath acknowledged His sovereignty, and whoso hath confessed My Revelation hath confessed the Revelation of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.”</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Ye have reached a station wherein We impart unto you that which was revealed in the cycle of the Furqan, that haply ye may turn unto the All-Merciful Who hath appeared in truth with manifest sovereignty. Say: Ye have imagined within yourselves that ye have attained the ultimate goal in the knowledge of your Lord, the Lord of all beings, yet ye deny that which the people of the Furqan have acknowledged. Woe unto you, then destruction be upon you, O company of the heedless! Say: Die in your wrath! Verily, the Hidden Mystery hath appeared through this Name, the Manifest, the Speaking, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Were it not for Him, the Hidden would not have been revealed, nor would the tradition of the Treasury have come forth, were ye of the fair-minded.</p>
<p>By My Self! The atoms have spoken in remembrance of the Revealer of verses, and by My Name have the pebbles glorified and all things have testified that there is no God but Me, the Almighty, the Powerful. Thus have We recounted unto thee that which the rejecters have spoken, they who have turned away from the Countenance, that thou mayest be acquainted with them and what they possess, and that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Say: O my God and the God of the worlds, my Goal and the Goal of the mystics! Praise be unto Thee for having made the people of Baha sanctified from these ones and purified from their mentions and their knowledge. I testify through Thee that the Sun of Wisdom hath dawned and the Ocean of Knowledge hath surged among creatures. Thou doest what Thou willest by Thy sovereignty, and teachest Thy servants what Thou desirest through Thy grace and bounty. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Manifest, the Ordainer, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>We make mention of him who hath turned towards the Ocean and attained that which was intended in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Wise. He hath turned once before and again in these days wherein the gates of the Prison were opened and the Wronged One went forth by a command before which neither the heavens nor the earth can stand. He, verily, is the Omnipotent, the Powerful. Blessed art thou for having attained His presence, and heard, and gained that which was intended. We bid thee return to the lands and regions of God, and give glad tidings to those who have believed in My Remembrance, through which the ocean of bounty hath surged, and the Lord of Eternity hath testified that there is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Beware lest the affairs of the world sadden thee. Take what thou hast been commanded by God and remind the people of My beauteous remembrance. Say: O people of Baha! By God, the gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of Names hath come with mighty sovereignty. Beware lest the mention of the servants prevent you from the Most Great Remembrance, or the hosts of the earth frighten you from the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. Cast aside what the people possess. By God, the Self-Subsisting hath come and commandeth you through His Most Exalted Pen with that which attracteth the earth and heaven. Draw nigh with your hearts and be not of the heedless. Say: If ye desire the Book, by God, it hath been inscribed by My Most Glorious Pen upon the face of all things. The Lord of Names hath come, and I am the Manifest Book. Bear ye witness to His appearance, His manifestation and His sovereignty, even if ye be among the heedless ones. Thus hath the tongue of the Wronged One spoken that which hath caused the Concourse on High to burn, for He seeth Himself in evident sorrow. Say: Rejoice in My remembrance, soar in My atmosphere, and hold fast unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Beware lest ye follow the people of the Bayan who have disbelieved in the All-Merciful and deviated from My straight path.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! God willing, mayest thou be assisted through divine grace and remain firm and steadfast in service to the Cause. The glance of loving-kindness hath been and will continue to be upon thee. Convey My greetings to those who drink from the cup of inner meanings and gladden them with divine favors. All creation hath been brought from non-existence into being that their mention might be made in the presence of God. Praise be to God that they have attained this most great bounty and most exalted station. They must at all times fix their gaze upon the horizon of steadfastness, lest the foul winds prevent pure souls from inhaling the fragrance of inner meanings. Say: Today the fragrance of the garment is diffused and the world is illumined by the lights of the Sun of Truth. The mention of aught else but God is not permissible, for this Day hath been mentioned and recorded in the divine Books as the Day of God. Naught is befitting therein save the remembrance of God and His sovereignty which encompasses the worlds.</p>
<p>The deeds of those who have arisen in God’s path are recorded before the Throne and have been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. God will soon reward them with the best of rewards. He, verily, is the Bestower, the Generous. Although no command was issued from the Source of Command, each soul hath rendered service according to his capacity. God hath ever been and will continue to be independent and self-sufficient. Were a single drop from the ocean of His riches to be sprinkled upon the world of poverty, it would adorn all with the ornament of wealth. Every soul beareth witness to His wealth, His sovereignty, His grandeur and His power.</p>
<p>Last year there flowed from the Most Exalted Pen concerning the payment of the Rights of God that which is recorded in the Tablets. These are the Rights which have been prescribed for everyone by God and were formerly ordained. He, verily, is the Expositor, the All-Knowing, the Wise. Blessed is he who hath held fast unto the Book and acted according to that which was commanded by the All-Wise Ruler.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! Thou must be so enkindled with the fire of God’s love that all lands may be ignited by its heat. However, in all matters be mindful of wisdom, lest something occur that might cause the weak ones to be disturbed. The divine Tablets have been revealed specifically for accepted souls and will gradually reach them. Let all rejoice, for their mention hath been made in the presence of God. If some have not received Tablets in this instance, let them not be saddened, for they shall receive them later. For every matter there is an appointed time. When it cometh, it shall come. He, verily, is the True Herald, the Truthful Informer, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>The glory be upon thee and upon My loved ones whom God hath aided to achieve the Greater Steadfastness. By My life, they are the firm ones, they are the sincere ones. Praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory!</p>
<p>O Salman! In all matters follow the example of God and be content with His divine decrees. Observe how this Servant, though from all directions outwardly beset with hardships and though all outer doors are shut, and though at every moment the demons are busy extinguishing the lamp of God and quenching His fire, is yet so radiant and illumined that “the heavens and earth are lit up thereby,” and is so manifest among men as though no harm had ever touched Him. Complain not of the heights and depths, the glory and abasement of this world. In all conditions, keep your gaze fixed upon the end, for all that is visible shall pass away.</p>
<p>That thou witnessest some among men who are gladdened by worldly glory and made proud by its elevation–this stems from the heedlessness of such souls. Every person of insight and vision testifies that these words are true and that this utterance hath shone forth from the Dayspring of exposition. For all know that these matters are neither worthy nor lasting, and when the messenger of death arrives, all things change. Thus it is evident and established that souls who have set their hearts upon such things are heedless, and it is due to heedlessness that they occupy themselves with these outward means.</p>
<p>In one of the Tablets it was revealed that among the signs of the world’s maturity is that no one will accept to bear alone the weight of kingship. Sovereignty will remain, but none will be willing to bear alone its burden. Those will be the days when wisdom will be manifest among mankind, save for him who may take on this mighty weight for the sake of propagating God’s Cause and spreading His Faith. How blessed is his state who, for the love of God and His Cause, and for His sake and the demonstration of His Faith, casteth himself into such great peril and accepteth such hardships and troubles. Thus hath it been revealed in the Tablets that prayer for and love of such a sovereign is incumbent.</p>
<p>O Salman! The world is passing away, and ere long all who dwell on earth shall return to dust from what thou now beholdest. We beseech God to assist all His loved ones to inhale the sweet fragrances of the divine rose-garden. Whosoever attaineth unto this will never gaze upon aught save God, and will remain content, patient and thankful in face of His decrees. Grieve not that thou didst not attain His presence. God hath written down for thee the reward of those who attained His presence. Strive, God willing, that righteous deeds may be manifested from thee and that thou mayest be as a fire from which all may derive warmth.</p>
<p>Turn to God with a pure heart, a sanctified soul, a truthful tongue and a hallowed sight, then call upon Him in all conditions. Verily, He is the Helper of those who turn unto Him, and He is indeed the Forgiving, the Merciful. We have heard the cry of the prisoners from among My kindred and loved ones. Praise be to God for having made Me and My kindred and loved ones captives in His path. Though the sun may set, this mention shall not set. God will soon manifest what He willeth. He is verily the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>No Tablet was revealed for any of the prisoners except for the name of God, Mim, upon him be the Glory of God, this being due to wisdom, but convey greetings to them all. The affairs of all are evident. One Tablet was revealed specifically for Abdul-Wahhab–deliver it to him. Though it was revealed in the language of the people and their outward rules, yet it sufficeth all on earth, would they but understand. In the Tablets for various regions no specific name was mentioned, yet all are known and evident before God, and each of the Tablets was revealed according to necessity. Blessed is he who understandeth and is among the thankful ones.</p>
<p>A box of sweets was given for the honoured ones of Mosul–deliver it to them. We beseech Thee, O my God, by those whom the wicked have made captives from Zawra to Hadba, and by the connection that existed between them and the Manifestation of Thy Cause, to make firm Thy loved ones in Thy love and to establish them in that whereon they were in spreading Thy Cause. O my God! Thou seest and knowest what hath befallen them in Thy love and good-pleasure, such that the eyes of Thy chosen ones and the dwellers of the pavilion of Thy glory have wept for them. I beseech Thee not to deprive them of Thy tender mercies and favours, and to make them abide near Thy mercy in this world and the next. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.</p>

<p>O Munib!</p>
<p>He is God–exalted be His station, the All-Holy!</p>
<p>This is an epistle from this Prisoner unto him who is illumined, and is like the garment of Joseph of Egypt divine through the word “seeing.” The garment of the Servant of Canaan bestowed outward sight, and the garment of the Servant of the All-Merciful bestowed inward vision. How blessed art thou, for God hath made thy sight keen this day! The sighs of thy heart are evident and the burning of thy soul is known, and in all this thou hast followed in My path, and there hath befallen thee in My way what befell My Beauty. On the path of the Beloved thou didst not rest for a moment nor pause for an instant. What distant journeys thou didst traverse on foot before My countenance, and what arduous deserts thou didst run through with loving feet! All this hath been and shall remain before Our sight. And now thou art afflicted with the company of dispirited souls and withered forms and veiled servants who are as dead, removed from the gathering of fellowship and the sacred dwelling place.</p>
<p>Yet since Our desire hath been what God desired, and Our purpose what He purposed, and Our will what He ordained and decreed, all hath been and shall remain beloved. God willing, throughout all days thou shalt remind the people of the remembrance of their Lord, the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing. Although the Water of Life is not allotted to the company of beasts, and the Choice Wine of the All-Merciful shall never be the portion of the people of error and loss–and the sincere ones drink of the wine that was pressed by the fingers of holiness–yet since the divine winds of mercy are blowing and the holy breezes of grace are passing by, perchance some souls shall be purified from worldly defilements through the Stream of Recognition, enter the most exalted and glorious station of certitude, and attain the presence of the Beauty of the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>In these days thou must walk among the servants with the utmost submissiveness, humility and pure servitude, for the manifestation of the Cause and the stability of weak souls depend upon these things. This is true victory, for the enemies have appeared with such craftiness that Satan himself is bewildered. Soon thou shalt know and be among those who are informed. If thou deemest it advisable to travel through the lands, it is permissible, but with utmost caution, for thy protection is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>If thou wishest to know of the calamities that have befallen this land–by God, the pen is powerless, nay all things are powerless to recount them! Would that I had not been born of a mother or drunk pure milk from the breast, or had not, after attaining maturity, proclaimed God’s Cause, for this station hath been and shall be the cause of the enemies’ hatred. By Him Who caused the Bird of Immortality to warble in My breast! I strove greatly that no Cause be manifested at all, and that I might leave the people in their realm of fancy, but the Spirit left Me not in peace, established Me in the Cause, and made Me speak between the heavens and the earth. In brief, such tyranny hath been inflicted as hath no likeness in creation, and yet they have taken up the pen of falsehood and attributed their own evil deeds to the Essence of Holiness.</p>
<p>When they observed that this manifest grace could not be veiled, and that surely not all people are blind–there must be those with penetrating vision who can distinguish between the sun and shadow, between existence and nothingness–they therefore girded up their loins to cut down the Tree. And when they found themselves disappointed and at loss, they spread all their vain imaginings around in My name, that perchance they might thereby cast rancor into hearts, for they had found all people to be without discernment or understanding. Among other things, My brother wrote to various regions that people had shunned Me for a morsel of bread. Now consider: would any base person speak thus? Moreover, such a statement about One at whose table, were all humanity to gather, they would be sustained until the end of time without showing any trace of displeasure–let alone refusing to share! It is evident to what degree they have risen up to harm Me and how determined they are to destroy the Cause. Leave them to their unbelief and their lies, to play their games. It would be a pity for the pen to be sullied with mention of his fabrications and deeds. Would that I could recount to thee in full detail the beginning of this Cause, that thou mightest know how much bounty was shown to him and to what degree he hath risen in ingratitude.</p>
<p>In any case, God willing, may thou remain firm and steadfast as a mountain of steel in the Cause of God.</p>

<p>The beloved of God must walk among humanity with divine characteristics, as issued from the Source of the Cause. As can be observed, the greater the tribulations and the more severe the calamities that befell us, the more firmly we engaged in teaching the Cause, even as We sent forth the Call in the form of a Tablet and dispatched it to the center of the lands of Iran, and all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck save whom thy Lord willed. However, in all circumstances wisdom must be observed, and one must deal with people with kindness and compassion, for they are weak - had they known, they would have circled round the Countenance. The heedless people need wise counselors. This is God’s decree. All must be seen in complete humility and must, in truth, gird up the loins of service firmly.</p>
<p>Had people hearkened to the counsels of the Pen of the Cause, you would have beheld all who are on earth illumined with the lights of guidance and adorned with the Most Glorious ornament. As soon as a measure of security was established in the land, certain ignorant ones in every city laid claim to divinity. Thus from the year of the rising of the Most Great Light from the horizon of Iraq until now, numerous souls have abandoned piety and raised the standards of wickedness and rebellion, and these souls have caused upheaval and revolution in the lands. Soon you will witness that again from every land a calf will raise its call.</p>
<p>All this We foretold at the time of Our departure from Iraq. Observe how the previous Manifestation informed all peoples of this Most Great Manifestation, even as the Son of Zachariah heralded the Son of Mary to the people, and they emphasized it to such a degree that they said if anyone should speak a verse, none should deny it. It is most evident that they did not utter such words and their like except after having knowledge of this Most Great Manifestation; otherwise, such words would never have been sent down from the heaven of the Cause, for it is observed that most have uttered words and by the same have walked the path of pride and arrogance, and were not and will never be mentioned before God. They regarded the Cause of God as vain and did not reflect even to this extent: that if God’s Cause were of this nature, it would never become established.</p>
<p>In any case, the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - in view of the existence of this Manifestation and its dawning in those days, completed all the Bayan with this Most Great Remembrance, lest the people of the Bayan be debarred from the All-Merciful. Otherwise, never did a previous Manifestation announce a subsequent Manifestation in such manner. And if the intention of the Point of the Bayan were what people have understood, since most of the servants, according to their own fancy, utter verses, then all should be true. Any person of understanding perceives how far these people are from the stream of knowledge and how they have failed to comprehend the purpose. By My life! The intention of that Point of existence was none other than the exaltation of this divine Word.</p>
<p>Some time ago, the most ignorant of people came with two others like himself from Iran to the great city, and according to his fancy uttered verses and made claims. He is but in evident loss and error. God willing, the beloved of Truth must protect the House of Unity from the heedless hosts of the polytheists and counsel the pretenders. They should study extensively the Book of Badi’, which was revealed from the Source of Revelation through the tongue of one of the beloved, and impart it to the servants, that perchance they may return from passion to guidance and hold fast to humility instead of pride.</p>
<p>It is evident that this Prisoner has foregone comfort, glory, bounty, life, and the like for the life of the world and has shown no compromise with kings in the Cause of God, let alone with others. Now all must unite in raising the comprehensive Word and must, with the utmost striving and effort, engage in teaching God’s Cause with wisdom and forbearance. We beseech God to assist them in this. By My life! If they were to become aware of this Manifestation and its sovereignty, they would be thunderstruck, let alone draw near to it. Most are ignorant to this day - none has become aware of the divine Tree and its sovereignty, grandeur, and power, save whom thy Lord willed. Therefore, an expounder is needed. God willing, you must engage in serving the Cause in a manner that is befitting and appropriate. We beseech God to make you a key to the doors of hearts and minds and to assist you in the victory of His Cause. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>

<p>The esteemed friend, his honor Aqa Muhammad-Rida, upon him be 96 [Baha’u’llah’s glory], may take note. He is God, exalted be His station and magnificent His grandeur.</p>
<p>Praise be to the Ancient Beloved, Whose glances of favor have ever been directed towards His friends, and from Whom the breezes of grace from the treasury of bounty have never been cut off, and the ocean of generosity has never been restricted from outpouring. At all times the Supreme Pen hath been engaged in mentioning the loved ones and all who dwell in creation, yet the people of the world are observed to be exceedingly heedless, deprived and bereft of this mighty bounty and unmatched favor. Should one gaze with the eye of fairness and reflect, one would observe with what kindness, compassion, grace, mercy and benevolence the Truth summons these ungrateful people to that which profiteth them. I swear by the Creator of the world and its Educator that the pebbles of the desert and mountains, the heavens and earth, the seas, and whatsoever groweth from the earth - all are enraptured, stirred, melodious and joyous from the attraction of the Day of God, and are singing with a myriad tongues the verses of Truth, while these unconscious people are still asleep, nay, they are as the dead, save those who have been quickened and made steadfast by the divine spirit, and who have attained unto a wondrous, glorious, new life through the breezes of divine revelation. What benefit, when no sight can be found in the world, and no ear exists; otherwise, but a single melody from the Supreme Pen would attract all and cause them to ascend to the highest horizon. Blessed are they who have turned towards God, hearkened, responded, and attained that which most of mankind hath failed to attain.</p>
<p>Thereafter, your letter reached this servant, and the fragrances of love, affection and faithfulness were inhaled therefrom. It is evident that faithfulness hath ever been the attribute of God’s friends, and they have always been successful in achieving and practicing it. In truth, the fragrance of faithfulness wafted from your letter. This servant, though unworthy to be mentioned before God’s friends or to be the object of their attention, yet they, out of their praiseworthy characteristics and lofty qualities, make mention of the most insignificant of servants and gladden him with drops from the pen of affection. Their reward is with Him Who created them and preferred them above most of His servants. What you observed in your dream regarding this servant’s weakness and brokenness - the matter is as you saw it, and now is as it was, and praise be to God, my Lord and your Lord and the Lord of what will be and what has been. In all cases, praise be to the Self-Sufficient, the Eternal. If we are worthy of His trials, it is among His great favors and mighty bounties, but the pain is that these heads are not worthy of the noose of His trials, and these souls are not fit to be the target of His decree. His is the judgment in all conditions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I conveyed your greetings and expressions of evanescence and nothingness to the holy divine Branches - may my spirit and the spirits of all the world be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - and to the members of the pavilion of chastity and sanctity, and each one sends to you and those with you their greetings and most glorious mention. Regarding what you wrote about the children, God willing, the Truth has granted and will grant health. Convey this servant’s greetings to the honored masters, the two sons, his honor Aqa Mirza Muhammad-’Ali and his honor Aqa Lutfu’llah. A letter has been written to his honor Aqa Ghulam-’Ali which you will observe. Convey greetings from this evanescent servant to the mother of ’Inayatu’llah and the honored dear ones. The Glory be upon you. The Servant.</p>
<p>Previously, dried yogurt was ordered through his honor Aqa Lutfu’llah but was not fulfilled and they did not send it. Now it has been written to his honor Aqa Ghulam-’Ali. You or Aqa Ghulam-’Ali should look there at those who deal with Nablus, whether muleteers or others, whichever is possible, tell them to obtain ten rotls of very good pure dried yogurt from there and bring it, and you or Aqa Ghulam-’Ali should send it, and write its cost so it may be sent. In Nablus all kinds of dried yogurt can be found, better than Persian dried yogurt. His honor Haji Mirza ’Ali-Akbar the engraver sent some two years ago. If you inquire properly, surely good and inexpensive ones can be found. The Glory be upon you.</p>

<p>O Thou Who by Thy mention hast drawn unto Thee all names, and by Thy name hast subdued earth and heaven! I beseech Thee by the Crimson Scroll which hath been adorned by Thy Most Exalted Pen to assist Thy servants, Thy creation, Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones to remain steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the horsemen in the arena of heedlessness and desire, nor the allusions of those who have turned away from Thee, O Lord of all creation, shall deter them. O Lord! Thou art He Whom the hosts of the world cannot frustrate, nor can the might of nations weaken. I beseech Thee to draw those who have turned towards Thee near unto the Dayspring of the lights of Thy countenance, and the unitarians unto the Dawning-Place of Thy signs. Then protect them, O my God, from the oppressors of Thy earth. Thou art He before Whose Name the kingdom of names hath bowed down and to Whose face the Concourse on High hath prostrated itself. Thou ordainest what Thou willest for whom Thou willest, and deniest what Thou willest to whom Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Single One, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter was received. Praise be to God, it diminished grief and increased joy, for the fragrance of divine love was wafted from it. Today, every word that floweth from the pen of the friends in mention of God, exalted be His glory, is as a star in the heaven of existence. After reading and examining its contents, I approached the Most Exalted Station, and when I attained the presence, after permission was granted, I presented that which thy sincere tongue had uttered in the days of God, our Lord and your Lord, our Goal and your Goal, and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth. This is what hath been sent down from the Kingdom of might and power from God, the Lord of the worlds. His word, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One, the Unique</p>
<p>O Ibrahim! Thou hast attained unto My mention and My favors aforetime, and We make mention of thee on this night with that which shall endure as long as the kingdom and the realm endure. Thou art he who hath testified to that which God hath testified and hast acknowledged that which hath been revealed from My Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is the one who hath arisen with strength to make mention of Me and hath spoken My praise. He is indeed of the people of My wondrous Kingdom. Read thou what We have revealed unto thee. It shall draw thee nigh unto a station that perisheth not. The Lord of the seen and the unseen beareth witness to this. We have heard thy call and have answered thee that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>O Ibrahim! By night and by day the Divine Pen is in motion, its call is raised, and its horizon is luminous, yet the people of the earth are heedless and remote, save whom God willeth. All have been waiting by their own admission, and in the nights and days they have been uttering “Hasten, O God,” yet when the veil was rent asunder and the gate of heaven was opened and the Promised One appeared, all arose in opposition save the quantity of the letters of the Face. They reflected not for a moment what was the cause and reason that all sought deliverance for that Being, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake. By the life of God! The people are in manifest drunkenness and in strange slumber. Blessed art thou for having hearkened and answered thy Lord when He came with a wondrous Cause.</p>
<p>In all conditions, fix thy gaze upon the Truth and hold fast unto Him. Today it is incumbent upon all to engage in teaching the Cause with the utmost wisdom. The earth must first be made receptive through the power of utterance, and then the word must be delivered. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath guided thee to the straight path of God. He hath attained unto My presence, My favors, and My mercy which have preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth. From this station We send Our greetings upon him and upon thee and upon those who have cast away idle fancies on this glorious and wondrous Day.</p>
<p>God willing, may you ever drink from the cup of bounty and offer it to those who have turned to Him. This evanescent servant hath ever been occupied with the mention of God’s loved ones; they have not been and shall not be forgotten.</p>
<p>As for the mention made of his honor ‘Azizu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God, in these days they have sent a letter to his honor Marfu’ of Qa’in, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious. In response, a most holy, most exalted Tablet was revealed and sent. Indeed, they have clung to the service of the Cause. God willing, may their love grow warmer at all times in such wise that its traces shall remain lasting and enduring in the world. Praise be to God, they are adorned with the ornament of love for the Beloved of the worlds and are assisted in serving the Cause. The Glory that is manifest, evident, and shining from the horizon of the bounty of our Lord, the Most Merciful, be upon you and upon those whom God hath enabled to turn to His bright and luminous horizon.</p>

<p>He is the Most Manifest above every possessor of manifestation. God testifieth that there is none other God but Me, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And I bear witness that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.</p>
<p>O Pen of Command! Send down upon the Tablet from the wondrous remembrances of thy Lord, that perchance thereby hearts may be quickened, even though in these days the allusions of the people of allusions have prevented men from entering this tempestuous and surging ocean. They have risen in opposition in such wise as cannot be described in words, and God is witness to what I say, save those who have cast the idolaters behind their backs and their allusions beneath their feet. These soar with the wings of holiness in the atmosphere of God, the Mighty, the Protector, the Powerful, the All-Forgiving.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who hath rent asunder the veils through the power of the sovereignty of Names and Attributes, in such wise that the Concourse on High heard the sound of their being rent. By God! Around such as these circle the denizens of the pavilions of eternity, those whose faces God hath preserved from turning to aught else but Him and whom He hath sanctified from the doubts of every hateful idolater.</p>
<p>And among the idolaters is he who hath returned to his first step, who hath broken God’s covenant and His testament, who argueth with that wherewith the people of the Furqan argued, who holdeth fast to what they possess, and who hath grown heedless of God Who created him from clotted clay.</p>
<p>Say: O idolater! He who is enriched by God shall be rich beyond all who dwell in the heavens and the earth, even should he be the poorest of all creatures. And he who is heedless of Him is the poorest of the poor, even should he possess the treasures of all that was and shall be. And if thou seest him, say: O idolater! We know not by which of your arguments we should feel assured in your cause. Ye are those who for a thousand years argued that the Qa’im was living in a known land, yet when one of those near to God spoke of His future birth, ye denounced him as an infidel and slew him, even as blood was shed of those who were assured in the Cause of their Lord. This was a tenet established among you, and whoso confessed otherwise, ye cursed him and pronounced him an infidel. But when the Beauty of the Most High descended upon the clouds of the Spirit, then it became evident that ye were dead within the veils of your own selves, and that He was born in Persia. Glory be to Him Who hath manifested Him with the truth and made Him a sovereign over all who are in the unseen and the visible!</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of idolaters! For a thousand years ye have dwelt in the fancies of your souls, taking illusion as your leader. Ye were on the brink of the pit of fire, yet ye perceived it not in your cause, even as ye now hear from the people of the Furqan. Ye were afflicted with this only because ye followed your own desires and a number of men who fabricated lies against God and who wandered in the wilderness of fancy. When God rent asunder the veils of fancy, ye testified that He was truly born and that He was indeed the One promised in the Books of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Observe, then, those who follow these people after having discovered their falsehood and their fabrications. By God, O faithful servant of God! When these who associated partners with God and denied Him and His signs witnessed that the banners of the Cause had truly appeared and the Sun of Expression had risen from the horizon of grace, they arose to spread lies and calumnies, that they might cast doubt into the hearts of those who were gazing toward the sacred direction. They argue with the same arguments used by the divines of the Furqan, and to establish their delusion they cling to the reports of the past.</p>
<p>Say: Woe unto you! Which of your reports should we believe, after we have witnessed with our own eyes that ye were drowning in the seas of fancy? Say: O people! This is He through Whose manifestation ’Ali before Him, and before him Muhammad the Messenger of God, took pride, and from the wellspring of Whose Pen God caused to flow the Kawthar of wisdom and utterance. Fear God, and be not veiled by what ye possess, and be not of them who disbelieve. Purify your hearts from all previous reports, for ye can never know which word was sent down from the presence of the Mighty, the Best-Beloved, and which word was fabricated by the idolaters to preserve their leadership.</p>
<p>Thus doth the Cock of the Throne crow at this moment from the sacred direction, the holy and sanctified seat of God, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. And thou, keep thyself apart from such as these, then take thy seat upon the throne of certitude in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Pay no heed to those who say that which they comprehend not. If thou art able to convey the Cause of thy Lord, convey it; if not, then rest in thy place and trust in God in all matters.</p>
<p>And glory be upon thee and upon those who have been attracted by the fragrances of the All-Merciful from this glorious and manifest Paradise.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who speaketh is indeed the One Who conversed with Moses from the Burning Bush, and the Speaker on the night of the Ascension through the Hidden Mystery, and the Desired One unto Whom the Spirit ascended. He is verily the Preserved Book and the Guarded Tablet of God, the Hidden Treasure and the Concealed Mystery, and the Symbol which the Kaf and Nun have not comprehended. This is a Word which God hath made a mercy, a light and a glory from His presence unto those who have turned towards His Frequented House, and a fire and vengeance unto those who have disbelieved in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath manifested what was promised and sent down from the heaven of bounty that which caused the dwellers of the graves to be stirred up. Among them are those who have arisen and hastened to the Living Waters, and among them are those who turned away, retreated, and associated partners with God, the One, the Mighty, the Forgiving.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath spoken through the Manifestation of His Cause and the Dayspring of His Revelation, Who hath called all to His presence and to the Kawthar of His reunion, and hath made His presence identical with His Own presence, that the promise might be fulfilled concerning that which He revealed to His Beloved. God is He Who raised up the heavens without pillars that ye can see, and subjected the sun and the moon, each moving for an appointed term. He ordereth all things and expoundeth the signs that men may be assured of the meeting with their Lord. And that which was mentioned aforetime might be fulfilled: “Await ye the advent of Him Who conversed with Moses from the Tree upon the Mount.” Blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of God’s utterance and turned unto Him, and woe unto him who hath turned away and is among the dwellers of the graves.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the servant hath been honored to meet him who hath attained the Most Pure Horizon and was named ’Ali before Akbar, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of destiny, who directed himself and advanced until he entered the Luminous Spot, the Station wherein the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary proclaimeth that there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Beloved. I heard from him mention of your acceptance, your advancement, your turning unto God, your praise, your arising, your sincerity towards God your Lord, and your steadfastness in His Cause, whereby every mighty one was shaken, every learned one was confounded, every mystic swooned, every swimmer was bewildered, and every seeker retreated.</p>
<p>God willing, may ye ever be illumined by the effulgences of the Sun of Truth and remain focused upon and oriented towards the divine horizon of Revelation. Today, after the recognition of God, the greatest of all deeds is steadfastness. Your honor, having partaken of the Kawthar of utterance, must call all to this most exalted and sublime station. The people are weak and in need of remembrance. God willing, ye should strive with the utmost determination to raise up the blessed Word, that all the people of that land might be enkindled with the fire of the love of God and engage, in perfect unity and harmony, in the remembrance of the true Sovereign.</p>
<p>Consider my small effort as significant, for this evanescent servant is occupied day and night with the recording of divine verses, to such extent that he findeth no opportunity to burden the masters and friends with his letters. From all I have ever hoped for and continue to hope for forgiveness, and His honor Mulla ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory, will mention the details. I request that ye convey greetings on behalf of this servant to the loved ones of God in that land who are enkindled with the fire of the love of God and are gazing toward His direction, and say to them that this is the Day of remembrance and praise, the Day of service and obedience, for any deed that appeareth today purely for the sake of God hath no equal or likeness, as attesteth that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Tablets. Glory be upon you, upon your brother, and upon those who are with you, from God, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>

<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him and that the Point of the Bayan is His servant, His Splendor, His Glory, His Sovereignty, His Exaltation and His Grandeur. All were created by His command and all act by His command. Say: Verily He is the Path of God in the heavens and on earth, and His Light unto all who dwell in the dominions of authority and creation, and all shall return unto Him. Through Him the wayward were guided unto the guidance of God, and the near ones attained unto a station of glorious dignity.</p>
<p>O Nabil! Know thou that We have suffered at the hands of the loved ones that which We suffered not from the enemies. When We departed from Iraq, We commanded them not to leave Iraq except by Our permission, yet they violated what they were commanded, followed their desires, and were among those who trod the path of their own selves. Thereby befell Us what befell Us, and the idolaters drove Us from their lands time and again, and harm touched Us in such wise as cannot be reckoned by any reckoner. Say: O people! Seek forgiveness of God, your Lord, then turn unto Him, and follow not your desires. Follow the decree of God in all things and be not of the doubters in that which ye are commanded. Then remain steadfast upon the Path, fear God as He should be feared, and be not of those who comprehend not.</p>
<p>Say: Whether ye hear or hear not, ye shall never harm God in aught, and verily He ordaineth all things in the Book. In His hand is the dominion of the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty and decreeth what He desireth by His word “Be” and it is. Those who have been given spiritual insight from God are they who follow not the dictates of their desires, but hold fast unto that which they are commanded, and cleave to the cord of God and His Cause, and drink at all times from the cup of submission.</p>
<p>No harm hath touched Us save through that which the hands of these people have wrought, if ye bear witness. All this they did after We had taken from them a covenant and confirmed it in the name of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, that they should not turn towards the Holy Land nor depart from the Abode of Peace until the command should reach them from the Pen of Him by Whom all things were ordained in a preserved Tablet. Yet they heeded not God’s command and tarried not a day, but left the city, and thereby corrupted and caused corruption in God’s wisdom in His Cause, while they perceived it not. Each day a group of them departed from Iraq, whereby those who disbelieved and turned away were troubled, and were among those who associated partners with God.</p>
<p>Then know, O Nabil, that had they not violated God’s command, neither affliction nor adversity would have touched Us. But the matter hath been decreed and fulfilled, and We are patient and put Our trust in God, and in Him let those who profess His unity place their trust. Yet they have not awakened in themselves even to the extent of an atom, as though they had made God’s decree an object of mockery and made sport of that which they were commanded. This is their transgression against God, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>Say: O ye believers! Fear God and transgress not His bounds, nor go beyond God’s command. Seek forgiveness, then turn unto Him, for He is verily the Oft-Returning, the Generous, the Forgiving. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Take us not to task for what our hands have wrought, then forgive our sins, pardon us and have mercy upon us. Thou art verily the Lord of Bounty and Might, the Lord of Grace and Kingdom. Thou knowest the treachery of every soul, and Thou art the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Deprive us not, O our God, of the fragrances of Thy sanctity, then make us steadfast in Thy Cause, establish for us a truthful station with Thee, and grant us from Thy presence mercy, and join us with those servants of Thine who soar on the wings of glory in the atmosphere of holiness. O Lord! Deprive us not of Thy Cause, nor make us despair of Thy Spirit, then make us successful, O my God, in recognizing Thee in this concealed Word.</p>
<p>And thou, O servant who believeth in God, guard thyself with utmost vigilance. Beware lest thou be heedless of this, for this is God’s command upon thee. Associate not with those whose presence giveth rise to sedition and who are among those who cause discord. Let God, thy Lord, suffice thee, and turn unto Him with thy heart. He will suffice thee against all else and will send down upon thee of His grace as He sent down before. There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all things are with Him in a hidden Tablet.</p>

<p>May the Most Great Lord and Honored Beloved, His Holiness the Name of God the Teacher, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah], the Lord of Eternity, illumine him with His most luminous gaze. 152</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His station, to Him belong greatness and majesty</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice unto thee! This evanescent servant hath been honored by thy letter, which was a cup of longing for the lovers, and I drank from it as the sincere ones drink the water of life in the days of our Lord, the Most Merciful. We beseech God to grant every mouth a portion thereof, and every heart a share of this Euphrates which was mingled with the tears of the Beloved–nay rather, it was pure with what flowed from the heart that was a fountainhead of God’s love and favor, and a treasury of God’s remembrance and grace. When I read and perused it, I took it and ascended until I attained the presence of the Throne and presented that wherewith thou didst call upon God, the Lord of the worlds. When it was concluded, the hand of grace and favor was extended, and took it, and the most luminous gaze perused what was inscribed therein of His mighty and impregnable remembrance. Then there shone forth from the Dayspring of grace that which I am unable to mention. He is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing.</p>
<p>Then the tongue of grandeur and majesty spoke: “O thou who propagatest My Cause and standeth firm upon My path! Hearken unto My call, for it quickeneth bodies and gladdeneth the hearts of the sincere ones. We praise God for having aided thee to make mention of that which the ear of grace hath heard and which hath been accepted before the Dawning-Place of the verses of thy Lord, the Ancient of Days. By My life! This sufficeth thee, and none knoweth this station save him who hath attained unto this noble seat. Read thou what We sent before, then ponder upon it. It shall open unto thy heart the gates of knowledge and understanding, even as it opened them before. He is, verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Thou art in the letter Ha, and the Beloved remembereth thee in His manifest prison. Upon thee be the glory of God, His praise, and the praise of all who have laid hold on this firm cord. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Whose mercy hath preceded all created things!”</p>
<p>After this evanescent servant was blessed with the perusal of your letter and the petitions were presented before the Throne, the response was revealed from the Dayspring of grace and sent forth. Furthermore, two boxes of tea arrived. He said the tea was very fine, but suited for princes rather than for prisoners and the poor. Its fragrance was excellent, but as it contained white buds, its color was very light. Prison tea should be closer to commercial grade, meaning that a small measure should color multiple cups. This year God hath engaged somewhat in trade, for His glory and honor among the people, yet due to the sincerity of the sender, the lightness of its color added to its excellence, as it was special and is consumed in His presence. All this is from His grace upon His loved ones. He is, verily, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Likewise, that which was sent by those two honored souls, upon whom be the Glory of the Most Merciful, had been written about before its arrival, and likewise the response to two letters from the Afnan, upon whom be the Glory of God and His grandeur, which they had sent from the Land of Ya in the name of His Holiness the Name of God M.H., upon him be every most glorious glory. This servant presented the response which was sent. Let your honor forward it. Similarly, a brief petition was submitted to the Name of God. We beseech God to ensure its delivery. He is, verily, the Preserver, the Trustworthy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a packet arrived from His Holiness the Name of God, together with items sent by Aqa Mirza [Ali-Naqi], upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah].</p>
<p>Moreover, concerning what you had written about the Persian friends, four Tablets were revealed two years ago in response to their petitions and those of others from the Dawning-Place of God’s Command. The original exists, but a copy was sent. Should they approach it with pure hearts and eyes of fairness, they will derive from it the hidden springs contained in all the books. We hope that, God willing, these decisive words will have their effect. Were all people to contemplate these four Tablets alone, it would suffice all who dwell on earth, for they have been revealed in such wise that their like, like the existence of Truth itself, is impossible. We beseech God to assist all to recognize Him. He is, verily, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>Convey my sincere greetings and glorification to the friends in that land. Glory be upon your honor and upon those who attend your service.</p>

<p>He is the Ever-Abiding Who knoweth no decline! Thy letter was presented before the Throne and was observed by the lights of the Kingdom, and hath attained unto utterance. Praise be to the Best-Beloved of the world, that thou hast been illumined by the effulgences of the Morn of Eternity and stirred by the wafting of the Primary Word, and hast recognized the Second Six after the Upright Alif, which indicated the rolling up of the First Six. This is the station concerning which Ahmad-i-Ahsa’i, upon him be the Glory of God, gave tidings, saying: “The Vav consisteth of three letters: six and alif and six; and the Six Days have passed, and the Alif is the Completion, and there is no word; how then the Last Six Days? Otherwise the Return would not be realized, for it is the mystery of inversion for the symbol of the Chief. And if acknowledgment be obtained from others concerning the Remaining Six, the Cause will be completed with proof and the Most Great Secret will be revealed,” and so forth. The First Six referreth to the heavens of the previous Cycle which were created in six days, “and have passed,” that is, were rolled up by the Upright Alif which is the Point; then another Six were raised up through the manifestation of My Most Glorious Name. Thus doth the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, apprise thee. And thereby was manifested the mystery of inversion, for the banner of the Chief was raised above every lofty and towering standard. Thus did We make their highest to become their lowest, and their lowest to become their highest. Blessed are they that understand!</p>
<p>O thou who gazest toward God! No one until now hath comprehended the utterances which were revealed in this connection. The Question was specifically put to the Criminal of Kirman to interpret it and, upon his own inability, to inquire of the Dayspring of knowledge. Pride and vainglory so seized him that he was debarred from recognition thereof until he returned to his abode. Verily thy Lord is the Just, the Wise. The purpose of that utterance was this very matter. Every Cause hath been manifested, every secret brought forth, every hidden thing unveiled, every manifestation completed, and every perspicuous Book sealed. We beseech God to assist all in that which beseemeth this Revelation, whereby organization hath been scattered, and the fancies gathered in minds dispersed, and the feet of the steadfast have slipped.</p>
<p>We found thy letter sanctified from mention of aught else and adorned with this Great Name. Grieve thou not over anything. He hath ordained for thee in His Kingdom that which shall solace thine eyes and gladden thy heart. He is the Protector of whoso hath turned unto Him and spoken in praise of His exalted remembrance.</p>
<p>That which is necessary today is and shall be the service of the Cause. Most people are heedless. All must be educated in such wise that they will not be prevented from the straight path and the clear way by the croaking of the crows. All that was mentioned in the Tablets of the past and future hath ended in this most wondrous and most holy Revelation, and the time of all hath expired, even as the allusions of previous Books have been sent down in the glorious Tablets from the Divine Pen. Blessed are they that observe!</p>
<p>Thou must strive at all times with the utmost endeavor that perchance the trees of human souls may not be moved by every wind nor stumble at every thorn. Even as in these days an unknown person in one of the cities of God laid claim, and some heedless ones were attracted, until they recognized and returned unto God and were numbered among the penitent. If it were decreed that every day a Manifestation should appear, the Cause of God would never become established. Therefore, in this day, persons such as thyself must summon the people to the Most Great Steadfastness, and this station hath been and shall ever be the greatest of all stations, even as it hath been recorded in the Books of the past and future.</p>
<p>That which hath proceeded from thee in the path of God is accepted before the Throne, and although what thou hast written concerning this Most Holy, Most Exalted Cause hath not been presented before the Throne, yet God’s knowledge hath encompassed it. After reading this Tablet, refer back to it that it may fully accord with that which hath been sent down from the Throne. Blessed art thou for having drunk the Choice Wine and for having begun from Us and returned unto Us with sincerity and recognition. This is the testimony of the All-Merciful in thy favor. Rejoice thou and say: “Thine is the praise, O Lord of the worlds, and Thine is the gratitude, O Thou Who art wronged in the hands of the ungodly, and Thine is the glory, O Glory of those who are in the heavens and the earth!” Verily the glory be upon thee and upon thy kindred and upon those who are with thee in this Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Holy, Most Mighty Cause.</p>

<p>A Book from Our presence to those who have attained unto the lights of mystic knowledge in the days of their Lord, the Most Merciful, and who have stood firm in the Cause when most of the servants turned away from it, that the fragrances of revelation may draw them nigh unto a station wherein naught is mentioned save God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>There have come before Our presence various petitions from those who have turned towards God, and We make mention of them in this exalted Tablet. Among them is Samandar, who desired to enter the Most Great Scene. He is among those whom nothing deterred when the All-Merciful came with manifest sovereignty. O Samandar! Thy letter hath come before Us, and We have heard that wherewith thou didst call upon God, thy Lord, the Mighty, the Generous. Blessed art thou for having fulfilled God’s covenant and arisen to serve Him amidst His heedless servants. Be thou a lamp of guidance among the people and a dawning-place of utterance through this Great Name. Grieve not over anything. Verily thy Lord is with thee and will aid thee as He pleaseth. There is none other God but He, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>And among them is Dhabih, who believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. O Dhabih! Give thanks for Our having aided thee to turn towards Him when the ascetics turned away. We have read what thou didst send and heard that wherewith thou didst commune with God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. We have, of a truth, mentioned thee in the Tablets as a token of grace from Our presence. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the Loving. It behooveth thee not to grieve over anything. By God! His remembrance sufficeth thee in truth, whereunto testify honored servants.</p>
<p>And among them is Husayn, who turned towards the horizon of his Lord’s loving-kindness, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. O Husayn! Hearken unto the Call from the Dayspring of grandeur and glory. There is none other God but He, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Choosing. Thy letter hath been honored in the presence of thy Lord, and the Wronged One hath turned His gaze toward it while imprisoned among the wicked. O servant! Act in accordance with what hath been sent down in the Most Holy Book. By God! It is truly the Balance of guidance among the people and the proof of the All-Merciful to all who are in earth and heaven. Grieve not over anything. Trust in God under all conditions. Say: O my God! I beseech Thee by the Lamp which Thou hast kindled with the fire of Thy Cause between Thy heaven and earth, and by Thy Name through which Thou hast distinguished between Thy servants and Thy creatures, to assist me in Thy remembrance and praise, and preserve me from that which Thy good-pleasure abhorreth. O Lord! This transient one hath clung to the hem of Thy eternity. I beseech Thee not to deprive me of the outpourings of the ocean of Thy bounty, and ordain for me that which shall profit me in this world and the next. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>And among them is he who is named ’Ali, who attained unto the lights of faith when the horizon of certitude was illumined by the Sun of the utterance of his Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. O ’Ali! We have heard thy call and answered thee before, and in this wondrous Tablet. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the recognition of God and the Dawning-Place of His revelation when He appeared with His Name, the Protector of the worlds. The glory of God rest upon thee and upon thy brother, from God, the One, the Peerless, the All-Knowing, the Generous.</p>
<p>And among them is the Leaf of Ridvan who hath believed in God, the Lord of the worlds. We have read thy letter and understood its contents. He is, verily, the Mighty, the Generous. We have sent thee various Tablets through those who have journeyed there. Thy Lord is, verily, the True One, the Faithful. We beseech God to aid thee in His service and to make thee a sign of piety among His handmaidens who have believed in God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>In the Persian tongue it is mentioned that some days ago, specially dedicated Tablets, sublime and wondrous, were revealed and sent to most of the loved ones of God, as was done before. Therefore, this time We have sufficed with this brief message. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to give all to drink of the living waters and cause them to speak His praise. O friends! Strive to become dawning-places of divine outpourings, that is, to manifest such conduct as is beloved and praiseworthy before God, that all may be awakened by your deeds, actions, and character, and turn towards the Friend. In most Tablets it hath been revealed that the victory of the Truth hath been and shall be through goodly deeds, befitting actions, and pleasing character. Strive ye in that which ye have been commanded in the Book. By God! Through it shall your souls profit and those who are in the world. Thus doth the Wronged One counsel you as He counseled you before. To this testifieth every knowing and informed one. Blessed is he who hath attained unto that which he hath been commanded in the Tablets. He is, verily, of the people of Baha in the presence of the Lord of Names. Upon him be the glory of God and the glory of all things at all times.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great</p>
<p>The Purpose of the world is worthy of mention, but what manner of mention should it be and from whom should it come? There has never been any doubt that mention other than His own is not befitting Him as it should be. Thereby it is established that His mention is acceptable only unto Himself and His utterance is befitting only unto His Essence. According to the pronouncement of the Prophets, upon them be peace and glory, none hath ever fathomed nor will ever fathom the knowledge of His Essence. This statement is complete and every fair-minded one acknowledges it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at every moment man witnesses the successive manifestations of His grace and the effulgences of His loving-kindness. His bounty and mercy have so encompassed all things that man can attain unto His knowledge according to his capacity, inasmuch as all created things are, in one station, signs of the knowledge of Him and manifestations of His grace. Of this there is no doubt. His bestowals are countless and His favors endless. In this connection one may say “verily with difficulty cometh ease.” A hundred thousand praises, glorifications, mentions and splendors be unto His most holy Being, Who bestoweth without any worthiness on our part. He joineth the East and the West in a single moment and bringeth forth the fruits thereof. This is yet another bounty, another gift, and another favor. Through His will, remoteness appeareth adorned with the ornament of nearness, and through His decree, fire appeareth in the form of radiant light. Glory be unto Him! Glory be unto Him!</p>
<p>In these days, some of His signs have adorned the hearts and souls of a number with joy and gladness. We must arise to thank Him for His grace and open our tongues in praise. In truth, existence is for this very purpose. It would be difficult to find a wing that could soar higher. Gabriel, upon him be peace, spoke well when, according to the speaker, he said “Were I to venture a hair’s breadth higher…” Every bounty of His possesseth another bounty, and every grace of His encompasseth another grace. How can one fulfill the obligation of thankfulness save through His grace taking one by the hand and teaching one?</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Withhold not from us that which Thou lovest, and deprive us not of that which Thou hast accepted. I beseech Thee by Thy conquering power to make us content with Thy decree and to enable us to hold fast unto the cord of Thy bounty. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. My spirit be a sacrifice unto your mention and your praise.</p>
<p>The noble letter which followed the Book of Truth arrived. Its arrival was like the flowing of the Euphrates of mercy to the thirsty. Verily the Kawthar of life was evident in the chalice of its words, for it was adorned with the mention and praise of the Truth. I offered thanks and praise, and after perusing it, proceeded to the place where I was honored to hear it read.</p>
<p>O Afnan! O ’Ali! Upon thee be the peace of God, His mercy and His grace. Know thou with certain knowledge that the Best of Inheritors is the Truth, exalted be His glory, and the blessed Word that hath proceeded from the mouth of His Will is the true inheritor and the true son, for this mention in the Book of God is eternal. Neither doth extinction overtake it, nor do the manifestations of Names alter it, nor doth the passage of centuries and ages change it.</p>
<p>We beseech the Truth, exalted be His glory, to manifest unto you and send down upon you that which beseemeth the heaven of His grace and the kingdom of His bounty. Henceforth, it appears that if the Most Great Afnan, upon him be the peace of God, His mercy and His grace, would honor these lands with his presence, it would be most fitting and appropriate. If wisdom requireth it, it would be most excellent. Convey greetings to the honored Haji and all other loved ones, and on behalf of this Wronged One mention that from which the fragrance of love and affection is wafted.</p>
<p>Although the grace of the Truth, exalted be His glory, is more evident than the sun and needeth no mention, yet one loves these mentions, namely, whatsoever pertaineth to the realm of love, affection and purity. I beseech and supplicate the Truth, exalted be His glory, to preserve the honored master and your honor under His protection and shelter, and to bring near the days of reunion. This supplication is easy to fulfill before the Generous Lord and is accompanied by acceptance.</p>
<p>God is witness that during the nights and days I await meeting them, and I seek help from the Truth and desire His response. I remember all other masters and loved ones, offer them greetings, and beseech His grace and protection for all. Verily our Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Responding. Peace, remembrance and glory be upon your honor and upon those who are with you, who love you and who hearken unto your words for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>

<p>As for what you wrote concerning Ahmad-i-Kirmani – upon him be what he deserves – by God, the mind is bewildered and astonished by such imaginary, unknown and fraudulent souls. Several times now acceptance and rejection have been manifested from him. The evanescent one testifies that he has not believed in anyone who speaks without consciousness and understanding. Glory be to God! Through these words to which he has clung and through which he has sought to prove the truth of the dawning-place of conjectures - several years ago in the Land of Ta he confessed to it just as he confessed to it in these days, then repudiated it. Praise be to God that your honor observed the fraudulent words - would that you had seen him in person, for then the unconsciousness of the people would have become even more evident to your honor. Would that the expressions in those infernal pages had coherence, or that some meaning could be derived from them! Praise be to God, they are devoid and bereft of all that is beloved. Some time ago, in the Tablets of one of the friends of God, these decisive words were revealed:</p>
<p>“Behold, O chosen ones of God, what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: ‘Do these men imagine that they will be raised again on a Great Day - the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds?’ Nay! Verily the record of the wicked is in Sijjin. And what shall make thee know what Sijjin is? It is a written record. Woe on that day unto those who deny the truth! The croaking of a croaker shall be raised, and the book of Sijjin shall be spread abroad. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto the Most Great Steadfastness, and woe unto every lying doubter!”</p>
<p>Likewise in the Tablets of Iraq and the Land of Sirr, these passages were revealed from the heaven of divine Will. The writings of such fraudulent souls serve as their own exposure, and every person of understanding and insight perceives the degrees thereof. And when this detailed account was presented before the Most Holy Court, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these words:</p>
<p>“Souls who have been nourished by the fruits of the Supreme Pen behold themselves free from vain imaginings, confused dreams and fancies, and are so steadfast in the Cause that all the books of the world cannot turn them away from the Ancient Beauty, much less such delirious utterances.”</p>
<p>May the spirit of the world be a sacrifice unto His utterance! It is most regrettable that on such occasions mention should be made of these utterances which have shone forth from the Dayspring of verses, yet since it is mentioned to that beloved of the soul, it hath been and shall ever be beloved. Another request is that you convey greetings from this evanescent one to his honor Aqa Mirza Ata’u’llah, upon him be the Glory of God. Praise be to God that the lights of steadfastness have shone forth from him. Whosoever today hath drunk from the living waters will surely not turn to the stagnant pool. Would that you had written to Ahmad himself: “We know not upon which path thou standest, nor which way thou walkest. At times we find thee repentant, penitent and remorseful, and at other times we see thee an unbeliever, a rejecter, a hypocrite and doubter. Setting all else aside, where has thy fairness gone that thou hast sent these fabricated words? This servant says, purely for the sake of God: Open thine eyes that thou mayest see, and give ear that thou mayest hear. What has happened that thou canst not distinguish between the melodies of the nightingale and the croaking of the raven? Return unto God Who created thee and sustained thee; perchance He may forgive thy misdeeds, though thou hast committed that which caused the dwellers of Paradise to lament. Our All-Knowing, All-Informed Lord beareth witness to this.”</p>
<p>Likewise I send greetings to his honor Aqa Mirza Ashraf, upon him be the Glory of God, and I beseech and implore God that He may aid him to serve the Cause, that there may appear from him that which will gladden the hearts of those near unto God. I likewise beseech God to adorn all the friends in that land with the ornament of steadfastness. Would that people would comprehend the Day of God! Whosoever attaineth unto this station beholdeth all save God, exalted be His glory, as non-existent and as naught. In one of the Tablets this exalted Word was revealed, glorified be His grandeur:</p>
<p>“In the first year, from the scratching of the Supreme Pen this blessed word was heard: Blessed are those souls who have recognized the new Cause and have turned towards the new Beauty, and this lofty and most exalted station is not attained except through the effacement of all that was before and the hearkening of attentive ears.”</p>
<p>Those who took the calf as their god instead of God were several degrees more conscious than this croaker, for they at least had found something to cling to. Woe unto the heedless! Woe unto the losers! Woe unto those who lead others astray!</p>

<p>He is the Manifest One, the Speaker in the Kingdom of Creation!</p>
<p>O My Name Mehdi! Upon thee be My glory! Yesterday We departed from the known place, and another land became the scene of the Most Glorious Beauty. After arrival, the servant appeared with tablet and pen before His countenance. We said: “O servant, is it possible for a word to descend from the heaven of divine will that would remove the odors of hatred and rancor from the world, so that perfect fellowship may be manifested among all parties?” He said: “Verily, Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.”</p>
<p>O Mehdi! Petitions have been sent from the land of ? and other lands, and in most of them mention was made of the arrival of the Name of God, Jamal, and the upheavals of that land. The Supreme Pen hath commanded all to wisdom and counseled consultation. They must, in all conditions, be mindful of that which God hath ordained. For the souls that are strong, assured and content, there hath been and is no harm, but the weak are observed to be disturbed by the slightest upheaval.</p>
<p>O Mehdi! When the Sun of inner meanings of the Qur’an shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the All-Merciful’s wisdom upon the mirror of knowledge, this verse became manifest and evident: “Nothing shall befall us save what God hath prescribed for us.” Today all must hold fast unto wisdom and cling to that which hath been revealed from the Divine Pen. They must associate with the people of the world with the utmost joy and fragrance, act purely for the sake of God and with their gaze fixed upon Him in whatsoever they have been commanded. In such case, should any matter occur, by the life of the Beloved, it is beloved in the sight of the Beloved of the worlds. This world, which is observed to be less than nothing, hath not been and is not worthy of mention. Ask thou of God that He may make all aware of that which profiteth them and is befitting for them. Verily thy Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Some time ago thou didst mention Jinab-i-Afnan Abu’l-Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God, and sent his letter which was addressed to thee. The servant present submitted all of it before the Wronged One. God willing, he hath ever drunk and will ever drink from the Kawthar of divine favor and will remain focused on the Most Exalted Horizon. We have revealed for him a Tablet and mentioned him in such wise as will preserve his turning and devotion to God, the Peerless, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Mehdi! The mention of My Afnan, their turning to My horizon, their orientation toward My countenance, their hearkening to My call, their holding fast to My cord, and their clinging to My hallowed and luminous robe, brings Me joy. Were but a drop from the oceans of divine favors or an atom from the lights of the Sun of heavenly grace to become manifest, all would be observed to be bewildered, nay thunderstruck, save whom God willeth. Due to the lack of capacity in the earth, most matters are hidden from eyes and vision until the time cometh; then will it be manifested in truth and the tongues of the world will speak: “Blessed be God, the Most Generous of the most generous, the Most Powerful of the most powerful, and the One Who holdeth dominion over all in the heavens and the earths.”</p>
<p>One word that appeareth from the Dawning-Place of divine verses cannot be equaled by all that is visible and invisible. The Primal Point–may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake–hath said that all existence is for the purpose of being mentioned but once in His presence. Blessed are they that turn unto Him, and joy be to them that have attained!</p>
<p>God willing, may they who are related to the Truth, exalted be His glory, attain unto the most great steadfastness, for both the croaking of the raven and the cooing of the dove are raised. We previously informed all of hidden and concealed matters. No event hath occurred on earth except that We mentioned it beforehand from Our Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is he who hath read and understood and was among those who have attained.</p>
<p>Today the first requirement is the recognition of God, and then steadfastness in His Cause, for the treacherous and the thieves have been and are lying in ambush. Verily, We have sent down all things in the Book. Thy Lord is, in truth, the Mighty, the Bestower. All matters have been revealed clearly and evidently, without interpretation, in God’s Book. Say: Read ye, that ye may become aware of God’s power, His sovereignty, His knowledge, His might, and His grace which hath encompassed those who are in the heavens and on earth. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!</p>
<p>Glory be upon thee and upon him and upon those whom neither the doubts of the divines, nor the hints of the jurisprudents, nor the clamor of the rulers have kept back from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>And at the end of Our utterance, We counsel all to observe the wisdom which We have revealed in the Scriptures and Tablets, lest the feet of the weak slip from this Path which hath appeared through the Name of God, the Lord of Names, on this glorious and wondrous Day.</p>

<p>O My handmaiden! My glory be upon thee! At this hour the gate of utterance hath been opened, turning unto thee, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O My leaf! The Divine Lote-Tree desireth to speak that which it spoke on the Mount of Knowledge unto the Son of Imran, that it may draw thee to the Dayspring of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned towards My horizon! Verily, the heaven desireth to send unto thee a manifestation from among the manifestations of its sun, and a light from among the lights of its moon. Say: My spirit be a sacrifice for Thy tender mercy, O Lord of all being, Creator of all things, Sovereign of all names, Who gazeth upon all men and women, and Who speaketh that which draweth them nigh unto God, the Lord of all worlds!</p>
<p>O My handmaiden! Behold, behold the pearls which We have sent unto thee from this Most Great Sea, as a mercy from Us upon thee and upon those who have heard the Call and have said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Beloved of all in the heavens and on earth!” O thou who art present before the throne! Hear My call time and again, repeatedly. Verily it is the water of life for the people of creation and the light of the All-Merciful amidst the followers of all religions. Blessed is he who hath heard, witnessed and seen, and woe unto the heedless! The wine of My choice nectar hath intoxicated the Concourse on High and the Supreme Paradise. They cry “Glory!” and “God is Most Great!” to this Name, at Whose appearance the limbs of the idolaters who violated God’s Covenant and Testament trembled, and who denied that which was sent down from the heaven of His utterance in this mighty, exalted station.</p>
<p>Give thanks, give thanks and say: “Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me with verses that have attracted the hearts of those near unto Thee!” Glorify, glorify and say: “All praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Sovereign of the Kingdom of Names, for having turned toward Thy handmaiden and revealed unto her that which hath brought solace to the eyes of those endued with knowledge!” Thus hath the Most Great Sea spoken forth in a station which God hath sanctified beyond the understanding of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>O My leaf! We have been encompassed by sorrows from all directions through that which the hands of those whom God created to aid My Cause have wrought, for they have instead aided Mine enemies who have pronounced judgment against Me with such injustice as hath caused the Holy Spirit to lament.</p>
<p>In the Persian tongue, hearken unto the call of the Wronged One: Though outwardly His Majesty the King and the Minister remain silent and have even shown some measure of kindness toward this community, inwardly they persist in and act according to their own desires. By My life! Their power and might shall not prevent Me. We have arisen before all faces and have cast upon all that which God hath taught Me, with a sovereignty that hath encompassed the whole earth. Every truthful and faithful one beareth witness unto this. Ere long the signs of God shall become manifest and resplendent from all directions. Neither the might of the oppressors nor the power of the heedless can prevent it. The divine signs penetrate all things and His Will is supreme. Can anyone prevent Him from exercising His sovereignty? Nay, by His own Self, the Truth! We have revealed that which was hidden from eyes and treasured in the knowledge of God, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to all the handmaidens in that land. Say: O handmaidens of God! This is the day of supreme joy. With spirit and fragrance, occupy yourselves with the remembrance of the Beloved of all worlds. However, do not let go of wisdom, for adherence to it hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in numerous Tablets, lest there appear that which would grieve the hearts of those of My handmaidens who have heard My call, who have won victory through My traces, who have witnessed that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My grace, and who have responded when the Call was raised between earth and heaven. Thus hath the tongue of the Wronged One spoken at this precious and beloved hour.</p>
<p>Take a cup of tea in defiance of My turbaned enemies, then drink from it once for My love and again in remembrance of Me, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>The divines of Iran who for years have claimed knowledge, excellence and wisdom are found to be the most lost, most lying and most ignorant of the world, save whom God willeth. We beseech God to protect His servants and handmaidens.

<p>That which was revealed for the loved ones of God in the village. In the name of the peerless Lord! O ye that are wise! The glances of the favor of the Lord of Names have been directed towards you from the Mountain of Akka, and He maketh mention of you through verses whose fragrance hath perfumed the world. Blessed are they who today have inhaled this sweet fragrance and have turned towards the supreme horizon. The whole world hath been created for the Day of God, that all may partake of the outpourings of the True Bestower and receive their portion. Yet they are seen to be deprived, for their past disobedience hath debarred them from the most great bounty and the most luminous prospect. Among the people are those who have committed that which hath caused the denizens of the most exalted Paradise to lament, and among them are those who have hastened unto the Countenance and stood before the Door and testified to that which God had testified before the creation of the heavens: “Verily there is no God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>The divines of the earth, who are accounted as ignorant in the sight of God, are the greatest veil for mankind. Blessed is the one whom this veil hath not withheld, who through the power and ascendancy of the Most Great Name hath rent it asunder and turned towards the horizon of God’s Cause.</p>
<p>O friends! Know ye your station and recognize your worth. I swear by the Sun of proof which hath shone forth from the heaven of utterance that all things are turned towards you and are engaged in your remembrance. Soon shall every ear hear that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken. Verily your Lord, the All-Knowing, is the Explicator, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Be not grieved at what hath befallen you in the path of the Desired One of the world. Death shall overtake all, and its agony shall encompass all. Blessed is the state of one who hath harmed no one and who endureth harm from these base people in God’s path, and who holdeth fast to the cord of patience and resignation.</p>
<p>O My loved ones! We left the palace and with Us were certain souls, among them the Most Great Branch, and behind him the two Branches, and My brother, and My other nephew, and behind them Muhammad-Quli, and Abdul-Baha who attained the presence of God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting, and he who was named Hasan, then Mustafa whose father was martyred in the land of Ta, he being among those who showed forth great steadfastness in the Cause of God, the Lord of creation. And among those present was Abdul-Ghani, who had migrated from Hadba after the Sun of Permission had risen from the horizon of his Lord’s command, the Most Glorious. We entrusted to him the matter of food during this luminous journey. And Ja’far would carry God’s bounty from the city to the land, and from the land to the palace, and thence to the mountain. When We arrived and entered the tent of glory pitched upon the mountain, the servant who was present brought a letter from one of My loved ones who was named Hussein, and presented its contents before the Face. When it was completed, the ocean of the mercy of the All-Merciful surged, and there was revealed for him and for every name that was in his letter that which caused the river of life to flow upon all possibility. Exalted is He Who hath appeared through His Most Great Name and hath spoken among the nations that which was hidden in God’s knowledge and inscribed in His Books and Scriptures. He is verily the Explicator, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thus have We recounted unto you what appeared on this mountain as a bounty from Us, and I am verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Give thanks unto God for this supreme favor. He is with you under all conditions. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>O friends! All that hath appeared in these days hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen that all may attain unto the sweetness of divine utterance and hold fast unto that which is the cause of the exaltation of the Cause. Strive that ye may attain unto that from which the fragrance of eternity can be inhaled. Let not what hath befallen you cause you grief. The whole world shall return to extinction, and that which hath endured and shall endure is a word that proceedeth from the Tongue of Grandeur concerning a soul. Verily it shall endure as long as the kingdom and the realm endure, and it shall be a brilliant lamp unto him in every world of the worlds of his Lord. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken as a command from Us, and I am verily the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>The Glory be upon you and upon those who love you and upon those who have attained unto this wondrous Cause. And praise be to God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>

<p>O leaves of My Tree! Upon you be the Glory of God, the Lord of the worlds. O fruits of My Tree of loving-kindness! Upon you be the Light of God, the radiant, the dawning, the luminous. O remnants of My Holy Family! The Divine Lote-Tree remembereth you from the Most Exalted Horizon, and desireth to console its leaves, its branches, its boughs and its fruits in all that hath come upon them through God’s irrevocable decree and His destined ordinance, inscribed by His mighty and wondrous Pen. By God’s life! Your affliction hath grieved Me and that which hath befallen you, and likewise those who have circled round Me and have clung to the cord of My bounty and My mercy which have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>Unceasingly have you been remembered in the Most Holy and Exalted Court, and the glances of loving-kindness have been directed toward that quarter. Although this supreme affliction hath befallen you, yet since its source and return are from God and unto God, there is no harm in it. We beseech God - exalted be His glory - to transform the fire of sorrow into the light of joy, and to sanctify the hem of trust and detachment from the dust of worldly events and the grime of the imaginings of the peoples.</p>
<p>In the path of God there hath befallen you the greatest of the world’s afflictions. How many nights and days have you been sorrowful due to the oppression of the servants, and the greatest of afflictions is separation, which hath appeared, and the obstacles that have intervened. Know with absolute certitude that a station hath been ordained for you, whereof were a needle’s eye worth to be unveiled, all the world would turn from what they possess unto what God possesseth, and would circle round it. The oppressors and heedless ones of the world imagine they can frustrate the Cause, but that which appeareth hath been and shall be the cause of the exaltation of the Word. The power of the world cannot withhold its might, nor can the calumnies of the nations weaken its power.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the Cause until now, We have rendered assistance through the Pen alone, until the Cause hath reached such a station as hath truly become the cause of reflection and wonderment to the peoples of the world. Sublime utterances have been revealed in both eloquent Arabic and radiant Persian. Their recitation is beloved and is the cause of the solace of hearts and minds.</p>
<p>We have desired at this time to make mention of My two most exalted leaves among the handmaidens with a mention whereby the hearts of the Concourse on High and the Most Exalted Paradise have been attracted, such that its fragrance shall never cease to endure through the permanence of His most beautiful names and His most exalted attributes.</p>
<p>O first light that shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the loving-kindness of the Lord of all beings, and first word uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur, and first fragrance that wafted from the garment of My Most Great Name amongst the nations! Upon thee, O dawning-place of fidelity and thou who art mentioned by the Most Glorious Tongue in the prison of Akka! I testify that thou didst hear the Call in the earliest days and didst turn to God, the Lord of all beings, and didst take the cup of recognition and drink thereof from the hands of bounty and bestowal. Thou art she whom neither the derision of the wicked nor the doubts of the perfidious deterred. Thou didst forsake the religion of the people and turn to God, the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust below, the Possessor of the hereafter and this world.</p>
<p>O first light that shone forth and gleamed from the horizon of the heaven of bounty! Upon thee, O luminous leaf! I testify that thou didst turn and acknowledge that which the Tongue of Grandeur uttered in the kingdom of creation, then didst take His sealed nectar in His self-subsisting Name and drink before the faces of the handmaidens of God and His leaves. Thou art she whom neither the ranks of the divines, nor their clamor, nor the croaking of the people of tyranny and indecency, nor their doubts deterred. Thou hast rent asunder the veils through the name of thy Lord, the Bestower, and hast acknowledged God’s compelling Word and held fast unto it in days wherein the handmaidens of the earth abandoned it and its men cast it behind them, save those whom God, the Lord of the Exalted Throne, willed.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, O My leaf, and blessed is he who seeketh thy resting place, visiteth thy dust, draweth nigh through thee unto God, thy Lord, and mentioneth that which the Supreme Pen hath uttered concerning thy tribulations and afflictions.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God, God of the Kingdom and the Realm, and Sovereign of grandeur and might! I beseech Thee by the branches of the Tree of Thy singleness and Thy chosen ones who have been set ablaze with the fire of Thy love and have spent their substance and their spirits in Thy path, to forgive me and those who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty that hath encompassed existence and by Thy mercy that hath preceded the seen and the unseen, to fulfill my needs and ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and be as a light before my face in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Generous, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who sent the Messengers and revealed the Book. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. The ocean of generosity has surged among the world, and its greatest, most manifest, most evident, and mightiest wave was named Muhammad in the Kingdom of Names. Through him God’s bounty and generosity were perfected for all who are in the heavens and earth. Blessings and peace be upon him and his family, whose lights shone forth from the horizons of the heavens of names. Exalted is the Creator of Heaven Who created them, established them in His Cause, caused them to speak forth His commandments, and made them appear to exalt His Word - and upon all who follow them, all who cling to them, and all who turn toward them.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O Thou through the ‘H’ of Whose Beloved’s name the beings were attracted and the atoms testified to Thy oneness and singleness! O Lord, I beseech Thee by the light of Thy countenance and the fire of Thy Sacred Tree to assist all to remain steadfast in Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Strong, the Mighty.</p>
<p>And now, O my beloved, your letter was indeed a delicate mirror reflecting your sincerity, acceptance and orientation toward God, our Lord, your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne. Praise be to God that you are confirmed in remembrance, praise and service. What you wrote concerning the beloved friends and gentlemen was indeed an inlet branching from the ocean of joy, bringing complete gladness and boundless delight. After presenting [this], perfect outward favor was manifested - may my spirit be a sacrifice for His favor.</p>
<p>The new tidings are that the travelers have arrived, praise be to God - two from the land of Kha and two from the land of Qaf, as you had written. This servant and you must beseech God, exalted be His glory, to protect all in the fortress of His care from the evil of the commanding self and to aid them in that which He loves and is pleased with. Letters have also arrived from every direction. Praise be to God that despite the intensity of oppression, the burning of the fire of transgression and corruption, and the coldness of those in existence, the sincere ones who have turned to Him remain warm and enkindled. Indeed, those who have drunk from the true Kawthar have ever been and will ever be seated upon the throne of joy in the gathering of the world. Blessed are they and theirs shall be a goodly beginning and end.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote regarding the honored master Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be the glory of God, and likewise the sum that was transferred to him - this matter occurred some time ago and is as you have written. This servant has not yet met the travelers; after meeting them, details will be mentioned.</p>
<p>Regarding the mention of Aqa ’Azizu’llah and Aqa Is?aq, upon them be the glory of God, what you wrote - the receipt of arrival was sent, and later what will cause the greatest joy and illumination of heart will also be sent to Aqa ’Azizu’llah and the friends of that land, upon them be the glory of God. At this moment while engaged in writing these words, I was summoned and He commanded: “Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the Afnan, upon them be My glory. Each one is mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. God willing, may they be engaged in the remembrance of the Goal of the worlds with utmost joy and fragrance.” End.</p>
<p>This lowly servant likewise extends greetings and self-effacement to the presence of the Most Great Master and the Most Great Lord and the Twin Stars, upon them be all the most glorious Glory of God, and may this be accepted, God willing. And likewise to the spiritual beloved, his honor Aqa Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and his honor Haji ’Abbas, upon him be [the Glory of God], and likewise to the spiritual beloved, his honor Aqa Ahmad, upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness. It is hoped that a letter will be sent to them as well. And to the other two beloved ones, upon them be the Glory of God, who stand in service to the Afnan of the Sacred Tree, I send greetings. Praise be to God that they have attained and are mentioned in this station. This is a great bounty, by the Lord of all worlds. Peace be upon you and upon them and upon those who have intended the House and have attained and acted according to what they were commanded in the Book of God, the Exalted, the Mighty. And praise be to God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the Wise.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the One, and blessings and peace be upon Him after Whom there shall be no Prophet. Praise be to God Who sent down the Book and guided all thereby to the straight path, and made the Kaaba the circling-place of the world that His remembrance might endure among the nations, and that all might know who follows God’s command and who follows his own desires without clear proof or Book. And blessings and peace be upon Him from Whose garment every monotheist in creation found the fragrance of the All-Merciful, and through Whom was raised the standard of unity among religions - He Who was named with the Most Beautiful Names in the Kingdom of Names and as Muhammad in the realm of creation - and upon those who followed Him in what God, the Revealer of verses, commanded them.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice for your steadfastness! I detected the fragrance of your expression from letters you sent to the loved ones. When I found them, I reflected within myself and became aware of my negligence, for days and nights had passed without my outwardly mentioning what would bring me to your remembrance. Yet God knows that this servant lost opportunities and times, as though they had become like patience in the hearts of lovers or like the phoenix in distant lands. Therefore my excuse is acceptable to the noble ones. This servant asks his Lord to prescribe for your honor what befits His loftiness, greatness and glory.</p>
<p>I presented what you sent regarding Abdullah, upon him be the glory of his Lord, before my Master’s face. He mentioned you and spoke concerning you that from which I found the fragrances of grace and favors, and commanded me to write to your honor what I heard. He said - and His words are the sweetest - “Praise be to God Who made him steadfast in goodness and sanctified from the people of hesitation by whom the standard of Islam was reversed and through whom covenants were broken. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist us and him in His remembrance and praise, and in steadfastness in His Cause and in arising to what He has commanded us in His perspicuous Book.” Thus did it end.</p>
<p>As for what you mentioned regarding Jasim, upon him be the glory of God, this servant gives him glad tidings of his Lord and Master’s grace. When I presented it, He said - and His words are the beloved ones - “O Jasim! We make mention of you and remember your days and your presence with Us, and We beseech Him, exalted be He, to strengthen you and assist you and send down upon you from the heaven of His bounty a blessing from His presence. Verily He ordains and answers, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous. Be assured of God’s grace and care, for nothing escapes His knowledge. He does what He wishes and ordains what He desires, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. And We remember Nasir and Abbas and pray for their success and support from the presence of the Helper, the Wise. We send greetings upon him and upon Abdul-Karim and upon those with you. Upon you be the peace of God and His mercy and His care.” Thus did it end.</p>
<p>This servant sends greetings to them and shows them his humility and submissiveness for the sake of God, Lord of the worlds. Remember the beloved Jasim and remember when he turned toward your presence and wept - God knows he is before my eyes. I ask God to unite his gathering and to open before his face the gates of blessings and goodness. Verily He is the Guardian of the doers of good. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>This servant hopes that you will convey to my heart’s beloved, the Observer, upon him be the glory of God, the degrees of my sincerity and humility, and present to him what he sent. And this servant sends greetings to Mahdi, upon him be the glory of God, who is in His service. I ask God, exalted be He, to open the gates of joy and delight upon the faces of His friends, chosen ones and loved ones who left their homes to circumambulate His House and to traverse between Safa and Marwa. Verily He is the Lord of creation and the Maker of light and darkness. There is no God but He, the Single, the One, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>Peace and praise be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon those who held fast to goodness and upon every steadfast, upright believer. And praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The servant, on the 23rd of Muharram the Sacred, year 1299</p>
<p>Then I present to your honor that Mirza Maqsud, upon him be success and support, has mentioned your honor during his presence and showed to you his love, affection and sincerity, and wrote to you on the day of his return what indicates his state regarding love and affection. The servant at that time sent to your honor that you might witness it and remember him and pray for him and for me and for all what is best for us in the beginning and the end.</p>

<p>In His Name through Whom God hath turned absolute evil into definitive good! Praise be to God Who hath transformed wrath and anger into mercy and triumph, and hath ordained that from every drop of His martyrs’ blood there should be created beings to aid His firm and wise Cause. And praise be to God Who hath raised aloft the standard of might, at one time through His trusted ones and chosen ones, and at another through His enemies. Verily, He is the Omnipotent One Whom the intentions of His creation cannot deter from that which He desireth, and He is the Ordainer, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, there hath befallen the loved ones in the Land of Ya that which causeth the manifestations of victory and triumph to appear. Were this station and what is concealed therein to flow from the Pen, all the peoples of the world would behold themselves circumambulating round about it. O thou who art mentioned before the Throne! This day is the day of triumph. Praise be to God, the hem of His Majesty the Sultan hath been and is sanctified, holy and pure from the abominable deeds and reprehensible acts of the oppressors. In truth, all the loved ones should, as in the past, beseech God, glorified be His majesty, for his protection.</p>
<p>My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy most great signs, and the manifestations of Thy grandeur in the kingdom of creation, and by the pearls hidden in the mines of Thy servants, and by the fruits of the trees of Thy bounty in all lands, to protect His Majesty the Sultan through Thy power and sovereignty. Then aid him to manifest justice, that the horizons may be illumined by its light. Then open before his face, O my God, the door of Thy grace, Thy riches, Thy generosity and Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Thy letter mentioning certain unseemly matters from the treacherous ones was read before My face. Blessed art thou, and well is it with thee, for thou art at all times looking toward the truth and speaking in praise of goodness. Courtesy is a characteristic of man and is acceptable before God. Beseech ye God not to deprive His servants of this blessed and luminous adorning. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Today the loved ones and chosen ones must arise with complete determination to aid the Cause of God, albeit through wisdom and utterance. This Wronged One, in the nights and days, counseleth those who are near to the gate of grace and bounty regarding that reformation which is the cause of the world’s prosperity and the refinement of the souls of nations. They must shun and in no wise enter into matters from which the odor of corruption is wafted. Now it hath become clear and evident to most of the rulers of the earth that this community hath never looked to aught save that which promoteth the advancement of the government and the people, and His Majesty the Sultan himself is aware of this matter, as is His Majesty the Viceroy, may God assist him, though they have not deemed it expedient to declare it.</p>
<p>O thou who standest before the Face and circlest round the Throne! In these days, special mention was made three times of the martyrs of the Land of Ya. That which was revealed was such that its fragrance shall endure throughout the duration of the kingdom and the heavenly kingdom. There befell those sanctified souls that which caused the Spirit of Faith and the angels drawn nigh to lament. Blessed are they and well is it with them. Such steadfastness was manifested by those sanctified souls as to astonish the Concourse on High. One portion of those three portions was sent, and afterward the other two portions shall be sent. However, the reports that arrived each contradicted the other regarding some of the oppressions inflicted, and from the Most Exalted Pen there flowed and was revealed that which corresponded to what they had mentioned, the signs and fruits of which have appeared and shall appear every day. By the life of God! The enemies have rendered such assistance as hath no likeness or equal. Glory be to God! They have counted the supreme loss as the supreme gain. Beseech ye God for consciousness, that perchance they may become aware of their deeds.</p>
<p>Make mention of all the friends of God on behalf of the Wronged One, that all may be illumined and mindful through the light of divine remembrance. A Tablet hath also been revealed especially for the Afnan, upon them be the glory of God, His mercy and His loving-kindness, and the other peoples of the world. God willing, it shall be sent. At all times ye should be occupied with spreading the divine verses and making the gatherings and meetings fragrant with the musk-like perfume of utterance. Verily, He will aid thee and make thee successful, and He is the Kind, the Generous.</p>
<p>The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who hearken to thy words concerning this News at which the limbs of every stubborn infidel have quaked. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful!</p>
<p>Praise be to God, Who is sanctified above all names and exalted above whatsoever is mentioned in creation, Who when He speaketh, all things speak, and when He is silent, the Concourse on High falls silent. He is indeed the One Who when He moveth, all created things become still, and when He is still, all contingent things move. He is indeed the Meaning that no names can contain, and the Root that hath no branch in creation. In one station neither name nor meaning is mentioned in His presence, and all that the steed of the Pen may gallop through in the arena of utterance reacheth only to the station of the Word that appeareth from His Most Exalted Pen. Exalted, exalted is the station of this Word, whereby tongues are rendered mute and eyes are intoxicated, except as thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Choosing, may will.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant hath been transported by your melodies and stirred by your warbling. God knoweth that it was as though I heard all the birds upon the branches, and as though from every word of your letter I discovered the fragrance of the love of God, and from every letter thereof that which gladdeneth hearts and moveth bodies. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to make me in all conditions among those who are occupied with the remembrance and praise of the loved ones of God, whom no hindrance can hinder, no blame of the blamer can deter, and no scorn of the scorner can dismay–those who act according to His command and bid people to observe that which He hath revealed in His wondrous Book.</p>
<p>My soul be a sacrifice for your remembrance. After perusing your letter and becoming acquainted with its contents, I truly submit that it was as though this servant at that moment drank from the springs of joy and gladness, and was seized with such delight that he immediately proceeded to the Most Great Goal. From beginning to end it was presented in the Most Holy Court.</p>
<p>This is what the Beloved uttered: “O My physician, O My physician! Thy call was raised until it was honored to reach the ear of thy Lord, the All-Knowing. The servant present appeared and laid before the Countenance that wherewith thou didst call upon God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed be thy tongue for having spoken the truth, and thine eye for having beheld My luminous horizon. Blessed art thou for having been seized with grief when thou didst learn what hath befallen the Wronged One in this manifest prison. Blessed is the eye that weepeth for My tribulations and the hearts that are touched by My supreme affliction.</p>
<p>“O My physician! By My life, were I to lift the veil, the lamentation of weeping would be raised between the heavens and the earth. How many deeds have melted My heart, yet I concealed them through My name, the Concealer, the All-Bountiful. How many acts have caused My heart and My Pen to lament, yet I preserved them in such wise that none among the peoples of the world gained knowledge thereof. How many afflictions have seized Me and how many tribulations have encompassed Me in this mighty prison, yet My name, the All-Forgiving, prevented Me from mentioning them, and My name, the All-Merciful, seized My hem and said: ‘Verily, Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful ones.’ Thus did My tongue speak that thou mightest know what hath befallen the Wronged One in this remote station.</p>
<p>“Know thou that We at this time make mention of the loved ones of God who have adorned the land of ?adba, that they may hear My sweetest call and be of them that are thankful. From this station We send Our greetings upon their faces and upon the faces of those who have turned toward the Most Sublime Horizon and have drunk the wine of steadfastness from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. Glory be upon thee and upon them from God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>“We make mention in this station of thy son who was named Jalal, that he may rejoice in My gracious remembrance. We beseech God to ordain for him that which beseemeth His bounty. He, verily, is the All-Loving, the All-Merciful. Convey My greetings unto him and say: ‘Blessed art thou for having heard and turned toward God, the Peerless, the All-Informed.’ Glory be upon him, upon his mother, and upon those whom God hath related unto thee. He, verily, is the All-Seeing Witness.”</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the remainder of the estate of Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God, if it were to be deposited in the House of God in the name of those two children, it would be closer to righteousness, for it may be that their mother might not spend it on the children, as she has set her heart upon another husband. We beseech God not to deprive those children of the living waters of His bounty and to assign them a station beneath the canopy of His grace. Verily, He is their Guardian, their Creator, their Provider, their Helper, their Educator, and the Educator of all the worlds.</p>
<p>Glory be upon your honor and upon those who love you, have turned toward you, and have drunk the choice wine of your utterance in remembrance of God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath adorned the world through the manifestation of His Most Great Name–Who was the Dayspring of the lights of eternity amidst all peoples–Who cannot be indicated by any sign nor mentioned by any utterance, for signs and utterances are attributes of His creation and were created by His command. The essences of all mention cannot ascend to the heaven of His holiness, and the quintessence of all descriptions cannot return to the court of His glory. If He is mentioned by the letters “He” and “Hu,” this is among the wondrous favors He hath bestowed upon His creation, having permitted them this as a token of His generosity and grace. Otherwise, how can mere verbal expressions compare with that station which transcendeth all meaning and utterance? Exalted is the All-Merciful above the mention of every mentioner, the description of every describer, and the praise of every praiser. He is the One Who hath manifested the Point, and from it detailed the knowledge of what was and what will be, though it was itself created by the Will that proceeded from Him and was brought into being by a stroke of His Pen. How great, then, is the greatness of His creation!</p>

<p>O Fath-’Ali, upon him be the mercy of God, He the Mighty, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting! O beloved one, hear what God calleth thee to from this Tree which hath been raised up in truth, and sing that verily He is God, the Mighty, the Beauteous. Bear thou witness within thyself that He is God, there is none other God but Him, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Exalted. Then know thou that the Beauty of the Nine hath appeared in truth while all were heedless thereof. Say: This is what ye were promised in the year Eighty, if ye be of them that know. Say: This is He Whom no one’s knowledge hath preceded and Whom the minds of the unity-professing ones have failed to comprehend. Say: We were among the servants for months and years, and We veiled Our face lest every deceitful wretch should recognize Us, until God’s appointed time was fulfilled and the days were accomplished and the Promise came, and God’s Cause appeared from this brilliant, luminous Dayspring. Say: By God, He hath appeared through a Word whereby all who are in the heavens and earth would be rent asunder, save whom thy Lord willeth, and this is indeed a great trial. None hath any escape, refuge or shelter save by entering beneath this shade or by acknowledging within himself that he hath departed from God’s shelter in the primal eternity of eternities.</p>
<p>Say: O people, this is in truth the Husayn Whom ye were promised in all the Tablets, if ye be of them that perceive. He hath come to you with verses whereof a single letter cannot be equaled by all who are in the heavens and earth. Say: O people, behold ye God’s Balance in these days, for it hath appeared in truth upon a straight and just measure. And thou, be thou assured in thyself, then stand firm in thy love; thereupon the earth would quake from this firm and mighty Cause. Say: O people, fear ye God and transgress not what hath been ordained in the Bayan by One mighty and all-knowing. Beware lest ye follow your desires; rather look with the Most Great Vision upon this most evident and ancient Beauty.</p>
<p>Say: Fear ye God and deal not with Him as ye dealt with His Lord when He came in the name of ’Ali with truth, bearing a manifest Book. He said: “O people, these are God’s verses which have been sent down in truth from One All-Knowing, All-Wise. Beware lest ye deny them and cast them behind your backs, lest your works be rendered vain and ye be among the losers.” They said: “We see thee not possessed of any truth from God; this is naught but tales of the ancients.” Thus did they speak before, and before that, and they will speak likewise thereafter - such is the way of the idolaters who believe in part of the Book and deny part thereof. Say: Woe unto you for what your hands have wrought, O company of the heedless!</p>
<p>And thou, seek refuge in God throughout thy days lest thou break God’s Covenant within thyself, and lest thy feet slip from this exalted and luminous Path. Then know that the people were in veils and delusions, but when the Promise came, We rent asunder the veils and burned away delusions with this ancient and blazing Fire. Therefore gird up thy loins to aid God’s Cause and fear no one, but put thy trust in God, thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. He will verily help thee in truth as He helped thee before, and He is the Best of helpers.</p>
<p>Say: By God, the trial hath come, and the thunderbolt hath appeared, and the Youth hath come with a manifest serpent that swalloweth up all that the idolaters have wrought and consumeth the works of the opposers. Thus have We explained the truth unto thee and sent down upon thee the verses and showed thee that whereby thy soul might find assurance and thou mightest be of them that give thanks unto God, unto Whom is thy return and abode, and unto Whom return the deeds of all created things together.</p>
<p>Then know that when the idolaters brought Us to the prison, We therefore revealed Our face and removed the veil, in spite of them and those who turned away from this manifest, pure, mighty and wondrous Light. We have indeed sent thee some of what hath been revealed in this prison that thine eyes and the eyes of the unity-professing ones might be consoled thereby. And when it reacheth thee, share it with those in whose hearts thou findest the sweet fragrance of holy and generous love. Then convey Our greetings to all who are in thy land, every small one and great one, from among those who have been guided by the lights of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Powerful. The Spirit, the Glory, and the Great Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee among the believers.</p>

<p>In the name of the All-Knowing, the All-Informed Expounder! O seeker of the utterance, hearken unto the Purpose in the Persian tongue, that thou mayest attain unto the wondrous tokens of the All-Merciful’s favors, unto the infinite outpourings that lie hidden and treasured within these words. Thy letter was presented before the Countenance, and that which was inscribed therein was heard and understood before its arrival. This is not difficult for God. With Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and the knowledge of what was and what shall be. As to what thou didst write concerning the unveiling of the names and attributes - by God! We have rent asunder the veils and torn away the shrouds on the Day when We manifested Ourselves with all names unto all things. Blessed are they that behold! Blessed are they that know!</p>
<p>O seeking servant! Strange it is that thou didst not witness this station and recognize it. No veil remained, except that it was rent asunder by the finger of might, and no mystery remained, except that it was made manifest and evident through the revelation of Truth. The hidden treasure cannot be known, and the concealed secret cannot be described. Now it calleth unto thee from the midmost heart and summoneth thee unto the Truth. No question is permitted at this station, for the One questioned is manifest, and no words are befitting, for the meaning is evident and clear. All knowledge hath been specifically meant for the recognition of the Known One, and all remembrances are but steps for attaining the Remembered One. Now the Known One Himself hath appeared by His Name, the Self-Subsisting. Beseech God, exalted be His glory, that thou mayest attain unto this most great bounty and recognize the Truth in this wondrous garment.</p>
<p>When thou art present before the Countenance, behold God with the eye of thy heart. Then shalt thou witness His grandeur and His sovereignty, and become acquainted, according to thy capacity, with the Dawning-Place of mysteries. Verily thy Lord is the Expounder, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Be not as the fish that, though in water, asketh about it. Thus doth He Who possesseth a Preserved Tablet teach thee.</p>
<p>I swear by the Sun of the horizon of inner meanings that creation hath been specifically created for this Day, and ears have been brought into being to hearken unto this most sweet utterance, and sight hath come into existence for this Most Great Vision. Strive that thou mayest attain unto it. Verily, He is the Manifest, the Near One.</p>
<p>As to thy seeking and mentioning the recognition of reality, and saying “Will not my will unite with Thy will?” - the tongue should seek forgiveness of God for this utterance, for this station is one whereunto the recognition of the mystics, the knowledge of the learned, and the realities of those in earth and heaven cannot attain. He hath ever been, in the heights of inaccessibility, sanctified above all else but Himself, and will forever remain, in the summit of His exaltation, hallowed above all that is besides Him. No one hath known Him as He should be known, and no soul hath comprehended Him as He should be comprehended, for this station hath been and shall ever be sanctified and exalted. The Books and Scriptures have testified to His sanctification and transcendence.</p>
<p>Whosoever today beholdeth and recognizeth the hidden treasure through the concealed Name, hath attained unto his own Paradise and Kingdom, and this is the utmost station of the servant’s recognition within the realm of possibility. Beyond this the path is barred and seeking is rejected. His proof is His Revelation, and His evidence is His being established upon His mighty Throne.</p>
<p>We hope, God willing, that thou wilt drink from the Salsabil of this utterance and quaff the wine of “Am I not?” from the hand of the Friend, and become intoxicated, speaking His praise and glorification amongst the servants. This is the crown of deeds and the essence of actions and the ultimate earthly home.</p>
<p>Furthermore, no one’s will hath ever been or shall ever be united with God’s will, for the will of all hath been and shall ever be as nothingness before His will. The glory of existence is for one to make his own will fade away in God’s will - that is, to have no will, thought or imagination of his own, but to move by God’s will and act accordingly. Deem not this matter imaginary. Whosoever today hath drunk of the sealed wine and acted according to that which hath proceeded from the Source of Command, hath attained unto God’s will, and he is of the people of truth. And whosoever remaineth veiled from this station is accounted among the dead, even should he manifest the knowledge and recognition of the ancients.</p>
<p>Strive that thou mayest attain, through divine grace, unto God’s good-pleasure and move according to His will. This is the ultimate station - whosoever attaineth unto it hath attained unto the furthermost goal and the most exalted summit. And peace be upon him who followeth guidance!</p>

Are ye silent and still, or have other causes prevented the people of the Most Great Vision from mention and praise? The Manifestation of Truth is evident and visible like unto the sun. By the Most Great Luminary! His utterance transcendeth the utterance of the peoples of the world, His mention surpasseth the mention of all nations, and His movement and stillness are distinct from all else. To those possessed of vision and the companions of the Most Great Vision, no doubt hath arisen nor ever shall arise concerning Him.</p>
<p>O people of Faran! This is your penetrating vision, your subtle thoughts, the light of your horizons, the radiance of your hearts, the lamp in your breasts, and your keen sight. By the life of God! This day is your day. Be ye strong in the Cause of your Lord, the Lord of Names, in such wise that neither the power of princes nor the whisperings of divines may weaken you. O people of Faran! Unceasingly hath your mention been recorded by the Pen of the Most Merciful and your names inscribed. Ye should aid the Cause of God through the hosts of remembrance and utterance, and through deeds and conduct befitting the Day of God. Blessed is the soul that moveth for the love of God and occupieth itself with the guidance of His servants. Today, all rising and sitting, movement and rest, should be manifested for the sake of God.</p>
<p>Every sovereign hath his army and every cause its helper. The hosts of the Lord of Horizons have ever been righteous deeds and conduct, remembrance and utterance, and the commander and director of these hosts is the fear of God. God willing, may the people of Faran be set ablaze with the fire of love for the Beloved of all possibility, and may they witness, in most times, the pearls of knowledge and wisdom which have been manifested from the treasuries of the Supreme Pen by the command of the Lord of Names, that hearts may be adorned with the ornament of certitude and detachment. The dawning-places of idle fancies and the rising-points of vain imaginings are circulating in cities and regions to lead people astray. This is that news which was formerly uttered by the Dawning-Place of verses and the Day-Spring of knowledge. Vain imaginings deprived the Shi’ih sect from the Lord of mankind and consigned them to hell. Ye are those souls who, from the beginning of days, have turned to the supreme horizon and have soared in the atmosphere of the love of the Lord of creation with the wings of detachment. The station of this most exalted rank hath been and is great in the sight of God. We beseech God to make you the ensigns of His remembrance in His lands and the standards of His guidance among His servants. Verily, He is the Powerful over what He willeth, and He is the Mighty, the Dominant, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>Out of wisdom, the names of the loved ones - those souls who have quaffed from the sealed wine and are illumined by the lights of the Kingdom - have not been mentioned. His honor ’Ali-Muhammad, son of My Most Truthful Name, upon both of whom rest My glory and loving-kindness, was present in the Most Holy Court and made mention of each one, and all have attained to the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of true divine unity. We beseech the Truth to assist His people in such deeds and matters from which the fragrance of His good-pleasure may be wafted. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The carpet of the love of God, exalted be His glory, is spread and unfurled. Blessed are the souls who have attained unto that for which they were created, and woe unto the heedless! We convey greetings to the handmaidens of God and give them the glad-tidings of God’s favors. The Wronged One asketh that He may grant them success and ordain for them the good of the hereafter and of this world, and adorn them with that which beseemeth them in the days of their Lord, the Lord of the Kingdom and the Realm, the Possessor of Glory and Might. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of bounty be upon you, upon them, and upon those whom the conditions of the world and its allusions, manifestations, ornaments, adornments, might, and ranks have not withheld from God, their Creator and Fashioner.</p>

<p>In the name of our Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted!</p>
<p>Consider the mercy of thy Lord unto all who dwell in the world, and how He hath clothed all existence with the raiment of grace, that His mercy might precede all who are in the worlds. Verily, they who answered not the Call of God and turned away from the Beauty of the Most High, the Best-Beloved - these have disbelieved in God and have lost their souls in this world and in the next. Sufficient unto them is their remorse in having deprived their souls of this grace.</p>
<p>Say: O people! This is of the grace which all who are in the heavens and earth do seek, yet none have attained it save a few sanctified souls. Thus do We ordain all things in the holy Tablets from God, the Most High, according to a fixed decree.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear your Lord, the All-Compelling, and be ye afraid of Him Whose might over the worlds is severe. Should He seize you, none could deliver you, even if all who are on earth were to gather to aid you - ye would find yourselves without help.</p>
<p>Know then, O servant, that thy letter hath come before the Servant, and We have understood all that was contained therein, and have become aware of what was inscribed therein concerning the trials that have befallen thee, and all that lay concealed within the pavilion of thy heart. Whereupon We have answered thee with this reply, that thou mayest read it at all times and place it before thine eyes, that the vision of joy might return to thee. This is of the promise that was promised in the Mother Book, which God hath decreed for whomsoever He willeth among His creation, and His promise hath ever been truly fulfilled.</p>
<p>Grieve thou not over anything, neither be thou distressed by poverty, for thou possessest that which nothing in the heavens and earth can equal, and this is from a command that hath been witnessed by thee and all creation. For in thy heart is the love of God and His chosen ones, and this is of the treasure that all in the kingdom collectively need. Nothing can compare with it, nothing can equal it, nor can it be purchased with all the treasuries of the heavens and earth. Thus do We acquaint thee with what thou possessest, that thou mayest see thyself enriched with the riches of thy Lord, and not be saddened in the kingdom by the lack of gold. Rejoice then in thy spirit and be gladdened in thy being, until rapture seizeth thee from every direction and bringeth thee to a praiseworthy station of holiness.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Know ye what God hath given you of His grace, in that He hath deposited in the shells of your hearts the pearls of His love, and honored you with that which is more precious in His presence than red sulphur - this is what hath been inscribed on the preserved Tablets of glory.</p>
<p>Say: O people! This is of the wealth that nothing created on earth can equal, and this is of the truth that hath been known to the worlds. For gold leadeth men astray and rendereth its possessor the poorest of servants through the greed that God causeth to overcome him, which hath no bound. Moreover, this wealth impoverisheth him from all that hath worth before God, for it occupieth him in the world to such an extent that the remembrance of the Beloved is not mentioned in his heart. Apart from this, it shall not endure on earth and shall perish in less than a moment - this hath been witnessed by the worlds.</p>
<p>Therefore, it behooveth thee to abandon all this and trust in God, thy Lord, that thou mayest be preserved in His shadow from all that distracteth thee from Him. Then seek from Him that which will enrich thee beyond gold and what exceedeth it, that thou mayest soar in the highest concourse on wings of ruby. For all that thou beholdest shall not endure, while that which is with God shall remain - this is of the matter that hath been symbolized in the Tablets.</p>
<p>Hear My words and My counsel, and grieve not over what hath passed thee by of the ornaments of the kingdom. Rather, rejoice in the treasures that God hath made hidden in thy heart. Then beseech God that He may make thee steadfast in His love and in the love of those who call thee to God in the evenings and mornings. When thou attainest unto this, know that all things have been created for thee, and all that thou knowest or knowest not is for thee and within thee, and hath been created for thy sake.</p>
<p>Thus have We cast upon thee the mysteries of guidance, that thou mayest follow the guidance of God and not turn back upon thy heels. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who have ascended unto God and who have been raised in the atmosphere of glory, and the Fire be upon those who have disbelieved and turned away, and who have become like a vanishing shadow.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great!</p>
<p>All praise befitteth the Lord of creation, glorified be His majesty, Who through the sending forth of His Messengers made clear the paths, and through the revelation of His Tablets distinguished the people of prosperity. His sovereignty transcendeth all sovereignties and His power surpasseth all powers. In the sending of Messengers and the revelation of Books, His purpose hath been none other than to manifest His grace and shed the light of His justice, until the Messengers were sealed with the Seal, whom God made the Dawning-place of His ancient Names and the Ruler of nations. Upon Him be God’s blessings, peace, mercy and bounty, and upon His family and companions whom God made the dawning-places of His power amongst His creation and the daysprings of His signs amongst His servants. Through them the fountains of wisdom gushed forth among all creatures and the mysteries of creation were revealed. These are servants to whom the Books of God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting, have borne witness.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the petition which thou didst dispatch to the Most Holy Court arrived on the blessed night of Rabi’u’l-Avval. It was read, and after being reviewed, was brought to the Holy Presence and attained the honor of being heard. The Lord - may the spirits of all the worlds be sacrificed for Him - spoke thus:</p>
<p>He is God, blessed and exalted be He!</p>
<p>O Taqi! Upon thee be My peace. This Wronged One hath ever loved and continueth to love the friends of God, namely the sincere ones. Every person of insight hath testified and every person of understanding hath borne witness that God is aware that We have ever desired and continue to desire to meet with friends and kindred. However, when anyone arriveth here, the heedless people attribute it to other purposes. Justice is like the phoenix, and fairness like the philosopher’s stone - rare to find. For this reason We have not given and do not give permission save to a few souls, and this too for the sake of wisdom. In the previous year and this year, the governor of this land hath been aflame with the fire of hatred. At every moment the fire of his tyranny becometh manifest. Deprived of good, he rideth upon the mount of evil. He hath committed that which hath caused the people of the cities of justice to lament. In brief, it is not fitting to mention details. Whatever hath come to pass or may come to pass in the path of God is and hath been beloved. We are thankful, not complaining. Praise be to God, thou art mentioned in the presence of this Wronged One. We beseech God to aid thee to perform goodly deeds and to manifest praiseworthy conduct, and to that which its fragrance shall never cease to endure throughout the kingdom of His glorious and wondrous Cause. God willing, thou shalt be assisted and with these hosts thou shalt conquer the cities of hearts. Whenever wisdom requireth, We shall summon thee; otherwise, We beseech God to bestow upon thee the reward of pilgrimage. Verily He is the Generous, the Bountiful, and worthy to answer prayers. Beseech God to protect the monotheists from the evil of the polytheists. The realm of unity is encompassed, while the realm of polytheism encompasseth. Each day they seize and take away from the lands of the people of unity, and until now the cause and reason remain unknown. All must cleanse their hearts through true repentance and seek deliverance from God, glorified be His majesty. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that thy letter arrived and attained the honor of being heard, and the answer was immediately bestowed. Know ye the worth and station of this supreme bounty and be assured. On one occasion the tongue of the Lord spoke these words: “How many who were far We behold standing before Our face, and how many who were near were deprived of what they desired. Verily the Cause is in the grasp of God, the Lord of the mighty throne.”</p>
<p>I beseech God to assist thee in that which pleaseth Him, and likewise that permission be granted when appropriate, that we may together undertake the pilgrimage to the House and attain that which hath been revealed in the Book. Convey greetings, praise and mention to all the friends in that land. It is hoped that all the monotheists, through the attraction of the blessed verse “Pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto God for mankind,” may set forth toward the ultimate goal, namely the House of God, the Lord of all beings, and attain the honor of circumambulation. This is not difficult for God.</p>
<p>Peace and praise be upon thee and upon those who have acknowledged the oneness of God and His singleness, and His Prophets and Messengers, and that which was sent down unto them from the heaven of His grace, the Sovereign over all who are in the heavens and the earth. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>His honor Aqa Mirza Haydar-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God</p>
<p>On 9 Safar 1305</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>Praise befitteth the most impregnable, most holy court of the Desired One, Who deriveth neither benefit nor harm from the acceptance of them that turn towards Him or the rejection of them that turn away. He hath ever been the Wronged One, and for this reason the outward means of power have been withheld. Justice hath in most days been concealed by the transgressions of tyranny. The delay of chastisement hath emboldened the wolves. Glory be unto Thee, O my Lord, my God, and my Master! I beseech Thee by Thy greatest signs and the manifestations of Thy power in the kingdom of creation to protect Thy loved ones and chosen ones from the oppression of Thy servants, the evil of Thy bondsmen, and the tyranny of them that are in Thy lands. O Lord! Thou seest them between the fangs of wolves, inasmuch as they have taken to themselves no helper other than Thee and no protector besides Thee. Ordain for them that which shall render them among those who know no fear and on whom no sorrow shall fall.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the numerous letters which your honor sent to the friends in the Prison Land arrived and were presented before the countenance of the Lord of the worlds. Praise be to God that your deeds are accepted and each letter was honored to be heard, with expressions of favor shining forth from all directions. Praise be to God that they have attained to a station adorned with the good-pleasure of God, exalted be His glory.</p>
<p>The first matter is that, as commanded, moderation must be shown towards his honor M.Q. and his like. If he is faithful, he hath held fast and continueth to hold fast to the cord of divine love. For a time he dwelt in the vicinity, and countless favors were shown unto him. Thereafter, the heart is in God’s hand; He turneth it how He willeth.</p>
<p>This servant is greatly perplexed regarding S., whom may God assist. This servant believeth that in all conditions they are helpers of the oppressed and breakers of the might of the aggressors. Now, due to the friends’ rejection of corruption, they have become disturbed and may support the enemies to take revenge upon you and alert you. O ’Ali-Qabl-i-Ha, a thousand swords falling upon the Wronged One would be more beloved and preferable than the slightest harm befalling the friends. We beseech God to assist His loved ones in that which He loveth and is pleased with.</p>
<p>End. Keep these words concealed, for should he see them, he would become utterly hopeless, and this would be contrary to wisdom. If it were possible without corruption for his honor S. to become satisfied through some means, this would be beloved. God is my witness, and the heaven and all within it bear testimony that from the beginning of the Cause until now, boundless love hath been shown towards them. Even now I hope that God will make them aware so they may arise to render assistance - that is, protect the friends from the evil of the antagonists and deniers.</p>
<p>If his honor S. is not in agreement with you, your presence in the designated place with the Writings is not permitted. Regarding his honor A.B. about whom you wrote, the condition of this land is different from before and hath changed. Heavenly blessings have been withheld. His honor Aqa Muhammad-’Ali hath not had and doth not have this much, but as commanded, speak with his honor Amin; perchance he may be able to do what is necessary.</p>
<p>Another submission: Some copies of the Most Holy, Most Glorious Tablet of Javad were sent in the revealed handwriting without names. They may write the name of whomever they deem advisable and give it to them. However, were it mentioned that new names have been written, this would surely cause extinction and grief; therefore its mention is not permitted. The omission of names in this land hath been for two reasons, which shall be mentioned later - that is, God willing, and if respite is found.</p>
<p>Due to the profusion of writing, there hath not been and is not opportunity to submit more than this. I cling to the cord of your honor’s forgiveness. Convey greetings and salutations on my behalf to the friends of that land. I beseech God to make them steadfast with such steadfastness that they may see all else but God as non-existent. Tell them that if an apparatus like that of the previous party is established, its fruit will surely be like the fruit of the Day of Requital, when all engaged in cursing and execrating the Truth. Lo! The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people.</p>
<p>Salutations, remembrance, and glory be upon your honor and upon them that hearken unto your words and love you for the sake of our Lord, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise be befitting and worthy of the Lord of eternity Who illumined the world through the lights of His Most Great Name. His proof hath ever been conclusive and the light of His evidence resplendent. His verses have brought the world of existence into being, and His clear tokens have encompassed both the unseen and the visible. His is the grace and the bounty, and His is the grandeur and the majesty.</p>
<p>The essence of blessing and peace be upon the Point of existence and the Mirror of the unseen and the visible, namely the Beloved of the Prophets and the King of the chosen ones, through Whom the fragrances of revelation were diffused throughout the world and the luminary of divine unity shone forth amidst all peoples, and upon His family and companions - those who sacrificed their lives and possessions in the path of God and strove with the utmost diligence to aid His Cause, and who arose to manifest the truth with such arising that the peoples of the world were powerless to prevent it, until in all directions the banner of “Verily He is God” was raised and the lights of His verses became manifest and evident. They are the ones whom God hath described in His Books, both before and after. We beseech God through them to assist us in manifesting the truth among His creatures with wisdom and utterance. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Thereafter, your letter brought joy and bestowed gladness, for the fragrance of acceptance and love was wafted from it. In all conditions we must be engaged in thanksgiving and praise, for He doth not deprive His servants. His bounty opened the door and His favor summoned all. Blessed are they who attain, and blessed are they who achieve.</p>
<p>After perusal, with wings of longing you sought the supreme horizon and were mentioned before His presence. The Lord saith: O Salih! Purify thy heart with the water of turning unto God and sanctify and cleanse it from the mention of all else save Him, and say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have sought the ultimate goal and the highest aim - the station wherein Thy signs and clear tokens have appeared. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and directing myself to Thy court, and I desire to drink the Kawthar of Thy knowledge from the hand of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of what lieth with Thee, nor to deprive me of what Thou hast ordained for those near unto Thee among Thy servants and the sincere ones among Thy creation. I ask Thee, O Creator of the heavens and King of the Kingdom of Names, by the hidden and treasured mysteries in Thy knowledge and by the verses that hold sway over Thy earth and heaven, to make me one of those who have attained unto the breezes of Thy revelation and inspiration, and who have arisen to serve Thy Cause in such wise that neither the doubts of the divines nor the power of rulers prevented them. They turned with their hearts to Thy most exalted horizon and answered Thy sweetest call. O my Lord! Thou seest me clinging to the cord of Thy bounty and hastening to the Kaaba of Thy good-pleasure. I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds, then grant me the heavenly table of knowledge which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the Powerful One Whom the might of the world weakeneth not, nor doth the clamor of the nations frustrate. Thou doest what Thou willest by Thy command, and decreest what Thou pleaseth through Thy power, might and sovereignty. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the Dominant, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the door of bounty is open and the sun of favor is shining and the river of mercy is flowing. And that which is now necessary is to seek from God, exalted be His glory, that which hath been and is success. Through His assistance the tongue speaketh, the ink floweth, the pen moveth, hearts are attracted, faces are turned, and eyes are directed. Should He withdraw His aid for but a moment, existence would return to nothingness. This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth God, exalted be His glory, to assist His loved ones in that which is pleasing to Him, and not to deprive man of His eternal gifts through these fleeting days. He is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Great.</p>
<p>When the letters arrived, the time had passed and this servant had no opportunity, therefore he wrote with utmost haste that it might cause joy or create renewed love. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is. Peace be upon you and upon God’s sincere servants.</p>

<p>Praise be sanctified above all mention and utterance, befitting the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence of that Beloved One Who, through the hosts of revelation, conquered the realm of meanings and utterance, and through the ranks of inspiration, consigned the dawning-places of vain imaginings to the depths of hell. Before the might of kings He spoke forth the blessed word “The King hath come,” and above the heads of the divines of Persia He proclaimed “The All-Merciful hath come.” The opposition of the factions did not prevent Him from revealing mysteries, nor did the oppression of the idolaters hold Him back from mentioning the Great News. Exalted be His glory and His power! There is none other God but Him.</p>
<p>O thou who drinkest My choice-sealed wine! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One which hath been raised from the prison fortress of Akka: “The King hath come, and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Lord of all beings, the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below.” Your other letter was received at the Most Holy Court through Haydar-’Ali, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness. Praise be to God that in all conditions you are gazing toward the Self-Sufficing One, arising to serve, and speaking forth praise. We beseech God to strengthen thee, preserve thee, and cause to appear from thee that which will draw the servants nigh unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. We ask of the Truth to aid thee and strengthen thee, that through the power of certitude thou mayest shatter the back of vain imaginings.</p>
<p>By the life of God! The Wronged One is in manifest grief, for it is observed that a few perfidious ones who betrayed the primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - are now leaders of the people. O thou who gazest toward the Most Exalted Horizon! This is the time for lamentation and weeping. Say: O people! Hear ye the testament of the Truth, exalted be His glory, and with pure hearts and clear vision, observe the signs of God. These will guide you to His straight path and His mighty announcement. Names will not profit you; that which will profit you hath been sent down from the Kingdom of utterance of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Say: Turn ye toward the Most Exalted Horizon and become detached from all else. Raise up your vision - the horizon of the Cause is manifest before all faces. Say: O people! The ocean surgeth by its very nature, and the Sun of Truth shineth and gloweth by its very essence. Speak ye with justice and fairness - would ye be content to be afflicted with vain imaginings like the former people? For twelve hundred years and more they clung to names and remained heedless of divine unity, and after beseeching and supplicating through nights and days, when the light of the Manifestation shone forth from the horizon of the Will of God, exalted be His glory, the divines reviled Him, and through the decree of those heedless souls, that Essence of Oneness was martyred.</p>
<p>The mention and praise of your honor, and your counsels and admonitions, have been and are for the sake of God, and will surely have their effect. A word spoken by the tongue for the Cause of God is like the Most Great Luminary - though clouds and mists may temporarily veil it, ere long it will emerge from behind the clouds and illumine the world with its effulgence. We beseech God to preserve thee, strengthen thee, set right thine affairs, and send down upon thee from the heaven of grace that which will make thee independent through His riches, a herald of His Name, one gazing toward His horizon, and one hearing His sweetest call in the morning and the evening. Verily, He is the Powerful over what He willeth, and the Single One, the Protector over what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>O Husayn, upon thee be My glory! Thy mention was in the letter. Those who are today kindled with the fire of hatred and are far from the light of the Cause were and are unaware of the root of the Cause. They follow their passions and obey their desires. They speak according to their fancies and perceive not. We beseech God to raise up there one who will take hold of the Book with power from Him and might from His presence, and assist His loved ones with an authority that armies cannot prevent nor ranks weaken. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer.</p>
<p>Those who have turned to God, praise be to Him, in whatever station and place they may be found, are holding fast to the Mother Book and clinging to the hem of divine mercy. We testify that they are among those near to God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon him who hath arisen to serve Me and hath spoken My praise, and upon thee and upon him who hath been named Husayn in this exalted station.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Most Great, the All-Powerful!</p>
<p>Praise be befitting and worthy of the Desired One of the world, whose grace has ever encompassed His loved ones in all conditions. Through a hundred thousand means He brought creation from nothingness into being, and confirmed it with all that leads to the elevation of its station and the exaltation of its rank. The path was made clear, the way was illumined, verses were revealed, and mercy rained down continually, that all might attain to that which benefits them and draws them near. He bestowed the warmth of bounty, from which the fire of love was set in motion and made manifest, and it became the cause of joining and connection. He bound the East to the West and united the West to the East. He guided the people of paradise to paradise and led the companions of heaven to heaven. This was the primary cause that brought the people of Sad [Isfahan] to ’Akka. The power of oppressors could not prevent His might, nor could all that exists in the realm of creation impede the operation of His Will. Glorified be His majesty, all-pervading be His bounty, and exalted be His station! And peace and blessings be upon the first standard that was raised in His name and the last banner that was hoisted in His remembrance, through whom the Word was completed, the favor appeared, and the heavenly table was sent down; and upon His family and companions, through whom the caller proclaimed “The Kingdom belongs to God, the Possessor of creation,” and through whom God’s verses and ordinances were spread abroad and His might and power were made manifest - blessings everlasting and eternal, which the passing of centuries and ages shall not alter.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter of that beloved of the heart arrived like a city of love and affection. The throne of joy had an illumined carpet, and the spread of delight had an adorned covering. Glory be to God! Though it was a letter, yet the effects of the celestial stream were manifest from it, for it was joy-inducing and grief-dispelling. In brief, what can I say of its effect and influence, for the letter was adorned with divine unity and the wholesome fruit of the blessed tree - upon it be God’s peace and praise, and God’s mercy and bounty. After its reading and perusal, having directed myself to the Holy Presence, I attained the honor of hearing [these words]. The Lord - may our souls be a sacrifice for Him - spoke: “O Asad! Upon thee be the peace of God, the Single, the One! Thy letter was presented before the face of the Wronged One. We heard thy call and turned toward thee from the prison. Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto that which is mentioned and acceptable before God. The hand of divine power brought you from distant lands to the precincts of glory and nearness, and caused you to attain the bounties of inner meanings, utterance and knowledge. His is the praise and the favor! You intended the ultimate goal and attained the visitation of the House of God. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid you and ordain for you the good of the hereafter and of this world. We make mention of the fruit of the Tree of Faithfulness. God is aware and bears witness that they have ever been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist him and the household in that which He loves and is pleased with, and to send down upon them at all times a bounty from His presence and a mercy from His own Self. Verily, He has power over all things. And We make mention of Badi’ and his mother that they may rejoice and be among the thankful. We beseech God to gather all beneath the shade of the Tree of His bounty and to protect them. He is the Powerful, the Able.” End.</p>
<p>To Him be praise and glory, and to Him be might and splendor. His favors are all-encompassing and His grace all-pervasive. At no time has His aid been or ever shall be cut off. Specifically for the members of the household do I beseech that which befitteth His grace. This letter from that loved one hath at this hour reached the Mansion of Bahji. A brief reply is offered, as time is short, for the messenger must arrive and deliver. At the close of this letter, with utmost humility and supplication, I beseech for the loved ones of God, exalted be His glory, whatsoever is the cause and source of glory and exaltation. I convey greetings to Qurratu’l-‘Ayn Badi’, and I implore from God health and well-being for him and his mother. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Helper, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Peace and remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord, the Lord of the mighty throne. The Branches of the Divine Lote-Tree, one and all, convey their greetings and express their kindness, as do the dwellers of the pavilion of glory.</p>

<p>O ’A! Thy letter which thou didst send to the Name of Bounty, upon him be My glory and My loving-kindness, hath come. We have read it and answer thee through this Tablet, whereby the horizons of meanings and utterance have shone forth, and the mysteries deposited in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Bestower, have been revealed.</p>
<p>O N! Verily the letter Nun swimmeth in the ocean of utterance and saith: “Blessed art thou, O ’Andalib, in that thou hast warbled upon the branches with diverse melodies!”</p>
<p>O D! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of creation. Hearken unto the Call which hath been raised from the Supreme Horizon, the Station wherein the Caller proclaimed: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the Beginning and the Return!”</p>
<p>O L! The Most High, the All-Sufficient, giveth thee glad tidings of that which God, the Lord of the Beginning and the End, hath ordained for His loved ones. Blessed is the ear that hath heard, the tongue that hath spoken, and the eye that hath seen and attained unto the days of God, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>We have found from thy letter the fragrance of the garment and have revealed for thee that whereby eyes and vision are gladdened. This day is the day of supreme joy. The loved ones must strive and guide the wayward to the divine path. Say: O friends! Today is the day of service. Transform the garment of fear, silence, and stillness into utterance, expression, assurance, and enthusiasm. All things are speaking in praise and glory. This is the Day of God and the springtime of the flowers and roses of wisdom and utterance. Blessed is the soul that hath recognized, and the tongues that have called out and said: “O people! The Day hath come with glory, power, majesty, and authority unto God, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving!”</p>
<p>Concerning what thou hast mentioned about certain souls who have attained unto the Kawthar of recognition and the Salsabil of faith - this is through God’s grace. He confirmeth whomsoever He willeth to turn towards the horizon of His Manifestation and to face the lights of His countenance. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful and the Illuminator of the hearts of those who turn to Him and are unified in Him.</p>
<p>Regarding what thou hast mentioned about confirming the teachers and those who have arisen in purity, detachment, trustworthiness, religiosity, and in speaking that which hath been revealed in the Tablets - these words of thine have been adorned before the Throne with the ornament of acceptance and good-pleasure. We beseech God, and are beseeching Him, to assist the people of Baha in preserving the verses that are the cause of the exaltation and advancement of the servants. For if the revealed verses are recited in gatherings at every station, ere long the world will turn from what they possess to what is with God.</p>
<p>The honored Name of God “J” hath also submitted a word in this regard which was favored with hearing and illumined with the light of acceptance. He wrote that the regions of Kurdistan are very receptive and need teachers, provided they keep in view only the exaltation of the Cause and do not spread their own carpet. In truth, some of the teachers should observe and be mindful of this word and thy word, and hold fast unto them, as a command from God, the Ordainer, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou hast mentioned about Nayyir and Sina, thou hast spoken with justice. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to exalt them through His Name and make them among the banners of His victory in His kingdom and the standards of His guidance among His creation. From the regions of the land of Kha, mention hath also been made of them. Happy are they, and blessed are they! We testify that they have taken the cups of utterance and drunk in the name of their Lord, the Most Merciful, and have succeeded in serving the Cause most of the time.</p>
<p>That which is necessary today is that the Hands of the Cause of God should guide the servants to the Dawning-Place of true divine unity and fix their gaze upon the horizon of the One Manifestation, and not, like the former people, take up a new idol each day. This is My counsel to them, and We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to confirm all in what He hath revealed in His perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the loved ones of that land on behalf of the Wronged One. Then recite unto them what We have revealed for thee in this Mighty Tablet. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who hearken to thy words concerning this Great News and who love thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the first and the last.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Wondrous! My mention of My servant is that he may detach himself from all else and draw nigh unto God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O loved ones of God, do ye rejoice or do ye lament? Verily, the Youth weepeth by reason of what hath befallen Him at the hands of them that have disbelieved in the All-Merciful and followed the Evil One. Say: He weepeth not for Himself, nor for that which hath befallen Him, but rather for what hath befallen the Cause of God, the Almighty, the All-Subduing, the Mighty, the Beloved. Would that I had been slain by the swords of the wicked ones, and that My brother, whom We reared, had not allied himself with them that have disbelieved in God for a paltry sum, after We had denied him nothing, and he possessed of the world’s vanities what would suffice him in his days until he should return to them that dwell in the graves. We had exalted his mention, yet he hath violated the sanctity of God amongst them that have disbelieved in the signs of God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>I have spent my soul for the sanctity of the Cause until the standards of guidance were raised in the East and the West of the earth, and none denieth this save he who hath disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the All-Loving. He hath arisen in opposition in such wise as to rend asunder the veils of glory by following his rejected self. By My life! He hath no station before God - his likeness is as that of a fly, did ye but know it. And though a fly hath no station, yet when it falleth into a cup of water, man abhorreth to drink thereof. Thus should ye know him and be of them that are certain.</p>
<p>Were We to impart unto you what he hath done and committed, by God, ye would strike your heads and weep and cry aloud. Say: O people! This is the Youth of God among you, calling you unto Him. Through Him the Cause of God hath become renowned throughout all lands, and the breezes of glory have wafted over them that are detached. They that have disbelieved have compromised the Cause in such wise that the hem of sanctity hath been soiled by their calumnies. Thus hath it befallen this Prisoner. Therefore do I lament and weep and say: “O my Beloved! Cause me to ascend unto the vicinity of Thy supreme mercy in the Most Exalted Companion, at the Manifestation of Thy Most Exalted, Most Glorious Self, that my soul may find peace and my body find rest. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest, and Thou art the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.”</p>
<p>O my Lord! Let me taste the heat of the sword in Thy path, then increase the misery of them who have disbelieved. Then sharpen the blade of their knives that they may cut me piece by piece in Thy path. This is my desire, O my Beloved! For by Thy might and Thy majesty, then by Thy greatness and Thy grandeur, I love not to remain among Thy creatures for less than an instant. Thou knowest what is within my soul, while I know not what is within Thine. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>O my Lord! Draw me nigh unto the Most Exalted Companion, then cut me off from those who speak naught except what their souls and desires command them, who are heedless of Thy Cause and Thy sovereignty in ways that cannot be described in words. Thou knowest what they have committed in Thy days, and with Thee is the knowledge of all things in a preserved tablet.</p>
<p>O my Lord! The lights of the Face have been altered by the slaps of them that have ascribed partners unto Thee, and the holy fragrances have been cut off from all creation by reason of what they have committed before Thy face, after Thou didst create them for Thyself and didst command them to appear before Thee. O my Lord! My distress hath reached such a point that the Supreme Pen is bewildered in mentioning it, and every witness and the witnessed are powerless to reckon it.</p>
<p>Then I beseech Thee, O my God, to send down upon Thy loved ones the signs of Thy victory, then gather them upon the shore of Thy oneness, then send down upon them what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and the best of Thy creation. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>And thou, O servant, give thanks unto God for having mentioned thy name from the Supreme Pen, and this is indeed a great bounty. Grieve not over anything, then aid thy Lord in these severe days. Beware lest the might of Our idolatrous servants frighten you. By My life! He who hath known God and loved Him would sacrifice his soul in His path and would pay no heed to the worlds, for beyond this world there exists a kingdom and a mighty sovereignty, and worlds which none can reckon save the Self of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Grieve not over your bodies, for We have desired that ye should possess the kingdoms of the spirit. And he who hath become aware of this station, by God, will care neither for himself nor for what he possesseth, and will hasten to the place of sacrifice in My Most Glorious Name, and will willingly sacrifice his soul for My mighty, invincible Self. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>Since this text is already in English and appears to be a complete prayer/meditation, I will return it as is:</p>
<p>LXV Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou knowest that my sole aim in revealing Thy Cause hath been to reveal Thee and not my self, and to manifest Thy glory rather than my glory. In Thy path, and to attain Thy pleasure, I have scorned rest, joy, delight. At all times and under all conditions my gaze hath been fixed on Thy precepts, and mine eyes bent upon the things Thou hast bidden me observe in Thy Tablets. I have wakened every morning to the light of Thy praise and Thy remembrance, and reached every evening inhaling the fragrances of Thy mercy. And when the entire creation was stirred up, and the whole earth was convulsed, and the sweet savors of Thy name, the All-Praised, had almost ceased to breathe over Thy realms, and the winds of Thy mercy had well-nigh been stilled throughout Thy dominions, Thou didst, through the power of Thy might, raise me up among Thy servants, and bid me to show forth Thy sovereignty amidst Thy people. Thereupon I arose before all Thy creatures, strengthened by Thy help and Thy power, and summoned all the multitudes unto Thee, and announced unto all Thy servants Thy favors and Thy gifts, and invited them to turn towards this Ocean, every drop of the waters of which crieth out, proclaiming unto all that are in heaven and on earth that He is, in truth, the Fountain of all life, and the Quickener of the entire creation, and the Object of the adoration of all worlds, and the Best-Beloved of every understanding heart, and the Desire of all them that are nigh unto Thee. Though the fierce winds of the hatred of the wicked doers blew and beat on this Lamp, He was, at no time, in His love for Thy beauty, hindered from shedding the fragrance of His light. As the transgressions committed against Thee waxed greater and greater, my eagerness to reveal Thy Cause correspondingly increased, and as the tribulations deepened – and to this Thy glory beareth me witness – a fuller measure of Thy sovereignty and of Thy power was vouchsafed by me unto Thy creatures.</p>
<p>And finally, I was cast by the transgressors into the prison-city of ’Akka, and my kindred were made captives in Ba?gh_dad. The power of Thy might beareth me witness, O my God! Every trouble that hath touched me in Thy path hath added to my joy and increased my gladness. I swear by Thee, O Thou Who art the King of Kings! None of the kings of the earth hath power to hinder me from remembering Thee or from extolling Thy virtues. Were they to be leagued – as they have been leagued – against me, and to brandish their sharpest swords and most afflictive spears against me, I would not hesitate to magnify Thy name before all them that are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth. Nay rather, I would cry out and say: “This, O my Beloved, is my face which I have offered up for Thy face, and this is my spirit which I have sacrificed for Thy spirit, and this is my blood that seetheth in my veins, in its longing to be shed for love of Thee and in Thy path.”</p>
<p>Though – as Thou beholdest me, O my God – I be dwelling in a place within whose walls no voice can be heard except the sound of the echo, though all the gates of ease and comfort be shut against us, and thick darkness appear to have compassed us on every side, yet my soul hath been so inflamed by its love for Thee, that nothing whatsoever can either quench the fire of its love or abate the consuming flame of its desire. Lifting up its voice, it crieth aloud amidst Thy servants, and calleth them, at all times and under all conditions, unto Thee.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, by Thy Most Great Name, to open the eyes of Thy servants, that they may behold Thee shining above the horizon of Thy majesty and glory, and that they may not be hindered by the croaking of the raven from hearkening to the voice of the Dove of Thy sublime oneness, nor be prevented by the corrupt waters from partaking of the pure wine of Thy bounty and the everlasting streams of Thy gifts.</p>
<p>Gather them, then, together around this Divine Law, the covenant of which Thou hast established with all Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers, and Whose ordinances Thou hast written down in Thy Tablets and Thy Scriptures. Raise them up, moreover, to such heights as will enable them to perceive Thy Call.</p>
<p>Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou art, verily, the Inaccessible, the All-Glorious.</p>

<p>Most mighty minister, most great and noble ambassador, May your prosperity continue,</p>
<p>I wish to say that my affairs have so fallen out that pen and tongue, writing and utterance are alike powerless to (describe them).</p>
<p>To give a brief account, we resided for six years in Edirne on the orders of the Ottoman government; nothing contrary to the laws (of the state) was ever manifested by me or my followers, as all the people of Edirne bear witness and confess. Nevertheless, three months ago, officials of the Ottoman state suddenly surrounded our house, seized all the belongings of my followers in the bazaar, and took them to the government building. After this, a man came from the governor and informed us that, on the orders of the Sultan, I had to go with (my wives?) and children to Gallipoli. They gave us no further notice than that. All the belongings of my followers were sold for a paltry price at the decree of the military commanders, but they did not even give us an opportunity to collect the money. After this, they brought me to Gallipoli, along with seventy men, women, and small children. Following our arrival, a special official, ’Umar Effendi Binbashi (= bigbashi; major), arrived from Istanbul with five sergeants. They issued a decree to the effect that orders had been given for six individuals to go to Acre (with us?), and for five to go to Cyprus; I had no claim on the rest – they were to be free to choose for themselves. It afterwards became apparent that he had arranged things, for he took the money for the steamer from everyone and brought all of us to Acre, which has the worst water and the worst air in the world – except for four individuals, who were taken to a ruined fortress in Cyprus.</p>
<p>No sooner had we arrived in Acre than they imprisoned us in a ruined barracks, even the women and six-month old children, and they forthwith shut the doors of entry and exit. We have now been imprisoned in the ruined barracks for fifty days, and, on account of the badness of the water and air, we have all been stricken by serious illnesses, such that, after two days, three people died without a physician or food or medicine. Up until now, we have not learnt the nature of our crime. There has been no enquiry. But neither wrongdoing nor acts contrary to the laws have ever been witnessed from us.</p>
<p>If it be supposed that our crime is that of being Babis, this was known from the start, and the Ottoman government officials were aware that we were Babis. It was not something that was kept concealed. Nevertheless, I was summoned by the government, and I came with a number of my followers from Baghdad to the court of his highness the Sultan, in the utmost sincerity. In spite of this, a new tribulation befell us every day, until things culminated in this mighty ordeal.</p>
<p>If they accuse us of some other crime, let them hold a tribunal and question us. When investigations have been held, it will be clear and apparent that we have not transgressed the laws. All the consuls resident in Edirne on behalf of the great powers are aware (of this) and all have borne witness that we have not committed any wrong. What we want is to know just what our crime has been, but they have not once mentioned it so that we might be informed. We beseech your excellency to turn your attention towards us, so that the breezes of the grace and bounty of his imperial highness the Sultan may blow upon us. Our fundamental aim is perchance to find shelter from these widespread tribulations in the shade of the protection of the most mighty, great, and noble Emperor, may his exalted shadow endure, and that we may occupy ourselves in prayer for his eternal rule.</p>
<p>Among the news which has reached us by way of the telegraph is that in Baghdad thirty of my well-known adherents have been sent to Jazira without (having committed) any crime or offence, and my property has all been impounded. I ask you to make enquiries of (your) consul in Baghdad, that it may be made known that all these things have happened without the slightest explanation. We all wait expectantly for the sun of bounty to rise up from the horizon of the grace and justice of the Monarch of the Age, the most great Emperor of the Era, through the attention of your excellency.</p>
<p>I remain obedient to your command.</p>

<p>Fat?abad. O Mirza Mahdi, upon him be the Glory of God. In My Name, the One Who dominates over what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>Excellent art thou, O Mahdi! Thy letter hath reached the Wronged One, and it acknowledged God’s bounty and grace, one after another. We perceived from it the fragrance of My contentment and thy contentment. By God’s life! No station in the world and its manifestations can equal this station. To this the Mother Book beareth witness in this exalted station. Say: verily the Book speaketh in the world and calleth all to the Most Great Name, yet We see the people among the dead.</p>
<p>O Mahdi, upon thee be My Glory! Praise the Object of all the world’s desire, that thou hast attained to His days, His recognition and His Revelation. Thy name is mentioned before the Throne, and thy remembrance is recorded in the Tablets by the Supreme Pen. God willing, thou shalt be confirmed in preserving this most exalted station, and in remaining steadfast in the remembrance, praise and service of the Cause of the Lord of Names. Verily, He is with thee and will strengthen thee as He strengthened thee before. He is, verily, the Mighty, the Dominant, the Powerful.</p>
<p>The world hath been encompassed by the dust of idle fancies and vain imaginings, to such extent that they remain heedless and deprived of the Dawning-Place of divine revelation and the Dayspring of heavenly knowledge. With utmost power and might they are occupied with extinguishing the light and quenching the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree. However, God hath prevented them through the hosts of the seen and the unseen, and seized them through His Command.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Observe how the Hand of Divine Power hath seized nearly one million souls in retribution for their deeds and consigned them to a most wretched destination. How many princes and ministers, together with their kings and rulers, were returned to the fire. Yet none hath become aware. The blessed Surih of Ra’is beareth witness to what hath been mentioned.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Glory, shining from the horizon of the heaven of My Most Great Book, be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who hearken to thy words concerning the Cause of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. We have mentioned every name that was in thy letter and have answered every petitioner whose letter reached the Wronged One in this noble station. All this is from My favor upon thee - know thou this and be of the thankful ones.</p>

<p>O Mirza Mustafa! In the Name of the Most Unapproachable, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>This is a Book from the presence of Baha unto Mustafa, that it may create within his soul that which will prevent his eyes from beholding aught save God, and will open them to His countenance, and cause him to voice His praise amongst those who have denied God’s favor after it was sent down in such wise that none would deny it except every rejected denier.</p>
<p>O servant! Drink from the Salsabil of life in the name of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, which floweth from the right hand of the Throne. A single drop thereof purifieth all created things from the defilement of allusions and draweth them nigh unto a station which none can enter save he who hath detached himself from all things, if thou be of them that know.</p>
<p>Dost thou find peace within thyself in these days when the swords of hatred have been drawn from their sheaths and the pack of wolves have emerged from their lairs, seeking to shed the blood of Him through Whose word their realities and essences were created, and all that was and shall be?</p>
<p>O servant! Adorn thy tongue with the mention of the Most Great One and say: “In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!” Then burn away the veils of fancy, fear no one, and doubt not this Remembrance, which is celebrated in every heaven by a different mention and name, in all worlds by a different token, and among the concourse of creation as: “There is no God but He, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>
<p>Verily, those who in these days have stood firm in this Cause are circumambulated by the denizens of the Supreme Paradise, and the maidens of Paradise would sacrifice themselves in their path–yet the people comprehend not.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Be fair within your own selves. If ye deny this grace, in what thing do ye rejoice and upon what seats do ye rest? By My life! None hath a protector this Day save him whom God hath protected from error and delivered from the depths of ignorance, establishing him beneath the shade of the exalted Lote-Tree.</p>
<p>Arise with supreme steadfastness, then remind the people of this News which hath ever been hidden within preserved tablets of glory. By God! All Books have been sent down for My blessed and praiseworthy Name, and all Pages have been inscribed by the finger of My power, would ye but understand. All Scriptures have been revealed by My command, yet the people perceive not.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Do ye follow what your desires command you, while setting aside Him by Whose command the heavens and earth were created, and through Whom the sacred, mighty, and hidden mystery of God was made manifest?</p>
<p>O people! This is God’s treasure among you, and these are His pearls manifested in the form of words. How excellent is he who possesseth these hidden pearls! This is God’s Most Great Sea, and these are its waves manifested in the form of letters, would ye but know. O people! This is God’s sanctuary among you, the Kaaba of your Lord within you, and the Beauty of the Beloved between the heavens and earth. Open your eyes that ye might behold!</p>
<p>Say: If ye turn not your eyes toward the words of God, God will soon raise up a people who will look upon them with Mine eyes, who will read My verses and weep for what hath befallen My Beauty, the Stranger, the Imprisoned, the Distressed. We have worlds beyond worlds, creation beyond creation, remembrance beyond remembrance, command beyond command, books beyond books, and sanctified, self-subsisting pages. We nurture every world by Our command and favor, for I am the Powerful over what I will, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Have mercy upon yourselves and upon the Soul of God that standeth over all things. If ye believe not, oppose Him not. Beware, O people! Fear ye God in His Cause, and cut not off the wafting of the breezes of grace from the right hand of glory and praise. Purify your ears that ye may hear what proceedeth from the mouth of God, your Lord, that perchance the breathings of the Spirit may transform you and draw you nigh unto the station of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Witnessed.</p>
<p>O servant! Open thy tongue in utterance, for the Holy Spirit will assist those who in these days convey unto the people the Cause of their Lord, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. This hath been decreed in truth within sealed tablets of glory. Thus have We taught thee and inspired thee, that thou mayest stand firm in the Cause at which the hearts of those who disbelieved and joined partners with God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting, were perturbed.</p>
<p>And glory be upon thee and upon him who hath detached himself from every direction and turned toward the direction of his Lord, and hath passed along this elevated and extended Path. Praise be to God, the King, the Single, the Mighty, the Transcendent, the Sovereign, the All-Loving.</p>

<p>O Nazir, upon him be the Glory of God! He is God, exalted be His station. Glory and power be unto Him, and peace and salutations be upon Him through Whom the Sun shone forth from the horizon of Hijaz and the valley of Mecca proclaimed: “He hath appeared Who hath adorned His head with a crown, yet He is the Messenger of God and the Seal of the Prophets,” and upon His children and companions and helpers and loved ones.</p>
<p>This servant’s petition to your honor is that multiple handwritten letters were received. Praise be to God, the Sun of divine love was manifest and shining from the horizon of every word. After their receipt, reading and perusal, they were presented before the Countenance of the Beloved. He said: “God willing, may they be engaged in mentioning the Goal of the world’s peoples with utmost joy and delight.” Then He said: “Pray that his honor Nazir, upon him be My Glory, may not be saddened by what hath appeared and what shall appear, and that he may truly recognize as being from God whatsoever he possessed and possesseth. For had he truly attained this station, he would not have expressed shame at God’s bounty. How much did he spend in Our path, and We accepted it. Yet it is observed that whatever is outwardly bestowed upon him generateth the dust of sorrow. This matter was not and is not beloved. He must in no wise fix his gaze upon the tongues of men - how they move and what they utter. In all conditions he must look to the divine Command and know it to be the cause of joy and gladness, and in truth be gladdened by it. This is the station of contentment that hath been recorded and inscribed in the books of old and of latter days.</p>
<p>The entire world is beheld as a handful of dust. Its taking and giving is not worthy of mention. How many matters that are pure good, yet man is saddened and grieved by them. How many hardships that became the cause of ease. How many instances of taking from which flowed the waters of giving. All hath been and shall be within God’s mighty grasp. We beseech Him to quicken all through the living waters of the Kawthar and adorn them with the ornament of joy.</p>
<p>This Wronged One conveyeth His greetings to the friends of that land. Convey greetings to Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah] the Most Glorious, and to Haji Abbas. God willing, may they be preserved. Praise be to God, they are adorned with the love and praise of God. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds, and the end belongeth to the God-fearing.</p>
<p>The correspondence arrived. God willing, a reply shall be submitted. Whatever needs to be sent to your honor shall be sent to that beloved one. The Command is in God’s hand, the Lord of the worlds. In these days signs of a cold have appeared in the blessed temperament. If this matter doth not cause delay, replies shall soon be sent. Several letters have also reached this servant from those parts, and have not yet been honored with replies. May that beloved one write replies to those parts and gladden them through the expression of kindness. God willing, the sun of attainment shall shine and God’s grace - exalted be His glory - shall encompass all. He is the All-Bountiful, He is the All-Merciful. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>They also said to convey greetings to Aqa Mahdi, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah]. Peace be upon him and upon thee and upon those with thee and upon all the loved ones of God.</p>
<p>Another petition is to convey the greetings of this evanescent servant to the true beloved, Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah] and His mercy. It is long since we have been deprived of the traces of his pen. That honored one and he and all true friends must never be vexed with this servant in any state, for this servant is at all times occupied, as your honor yourself can testify. Often it happens that numerous letters arrive and the opportunity to reply becomes like the phoenix - its mention extant but its reality non-existent. Therefore the friends of God and they who drink the choice wine of meanings and utterance, should they observe delay from this servant in showing sincerity, must not attribute it to neglect but count it as lack of opportunity. All are aware and conscious of this matter. Often it has happened that someone sent multiple letters to this ephemeral one and this servant was not enabled to reply. The purpose of these submissions is that they should not consider this ephemeral one remiss in all conditions, and even if remiss, they should adorn it with the ornament of forgiveness. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is indeed the All-Kind, the All-Forgiving.</p>

<p>This evanescent atom counsels you at a time when he is detached from all who are in the kingdom and relies solely upon the Sovereign of grace and justice, the King of glory and pure beauty. Therefore, hearken unto my call and accept my counsel. First, my flesh and skin and blood and bones and my inmost reality and being testify that the Sovereign of the Bayan is the mystery of manifestation and pure concealment. He it is Who raised up the heavens of creation through His perfect power and adorned them with the sun of beauty and the point of glory, and established therein brilliant stars and radiant orbs that they might serve as proofs of His oneness and as a way to manifest His power and dominion. He revealed His mighty Book and His supreme decree, and ordained for every soul a portion and share in His Book, and within every letter He ordained a creation such that were all the peoples of the earth to gather together to prevent even a single one of His creatures, they would be powerless. He breathed the spirits of all created things into the temples of words through the breath of power, and from them will be breathed forth unto infinity the mystery of possibility and existence and they shall be created, even though the idolaters be averse. Can anyone prevent a single letter thereof from reaching those for whom it is intended? Nay, by my Lord, even if all were possessed of power.</p>
<p>Therefore hasten, O people of the Bayan, that perchance ye may enter that garden and partake of the blessings ordained therein. I swear by the God Who caused this Tree of Sorrow to journey through all regions and corners, that were I to describe in detail but one level of the levels of the First Garden concealed in the Bayan, all who dwell on earth would be astounded, save whom my Lord willeth. And now ye say, by the Lord of the heavens and earth, this is naught but a mighty creation - whereas this lowly servant hath not enumerated even a single letter thereof as befitteth the sovereignty of His might and the kingdom of His glory. Therefore make haste, O people of the Bayan, that ye may warm yourselves with what God hath ordained for you, and deprive not yourselves if ye but know.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the outward and inward reality of this Point of Sorrow testifieth that today the Dayspring of Eternity is sovereign over all who are in the heavens and on earth. He is the Lord of all books and the Illuminator of all scriptures. Through Him are established the pillars of the Bayan, and through His name was set firm the throne of Paradise in the essence of creation, and through Him were raised the highest heavens, and through Him was the earth made stable upon the pillar of light. Whoso obeyeth Him is saved and whoso turneth away is lost. It is incumbent and obligatory upon all the peoples of the earth, from its east and its west, its lands and its seas, its plains and its mountains, to obey Him in whatsoever is His good-pleasure. God and His own Self, the Truth, suffice as witness to what I say.</p>
<p>Therefore, recognize the worth of this eternal Dayspring, though true recognition is impossible. Yet according to your capacity and ability, He bestoweth from the ocean of His bounty and maketh Himself known. Therefore, knowing the right of these days, do nothing whereby ye may be deprived of His universal and perfect mercy. Moreover, I beseech you that in these few remaining days of your life, ye live with one another in utmost kindness and mercy, but resting and reposing in the shade of His special favor, for that is the foundation throughout all cycles and the aim in every age. Hold fast to the glory of His loving-kindness and cling to the cord of His forgiveness. Thereafter, recline in perfect might and joy upon the cushions of glory and repose upon the thrones of loftiness. Never allow gloom to approach you, for it causeth heedlessness. Pass your days in perfect harmony. Remove entirely all causes of sorrow. I counsel you, O people of the household, to learn all that We have counseled you, and be not of those who spread corruption in the earth. And peace be upon you and upon God’s sincere servants.</p>

<p>He is the One Who gazeth from His Most Glorious Horizon</p>
<p>O son of My name! Hearken unto My call from around My throne. Verily it draweth thee to a station wherein the affairs of creation shall not grieve thee, nor shall the doubts of the doubters hinder thee. This is the call which the Interlocutor heard on Sinai when We revealed unto him from this Manifestation, whereby the Hand of Bounty appeared from the kingdom of creation and gave to drink the sealed wine, through His Name the Self-Subsisting, unto such servants as turned unto Him. Thus did the Luminary of grace shine forth from the horizon of this heaven, and the Tongue of Grandeur did speak: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the worlds. This is the day wherein the Dove of Knowledge warbled and the nightingales of utterance sang upon the highest branches. O people of the world! By our Lord, the All-Merciful! This is the day wherein the Hidden One hath revealed His beauty, and the Concealed One His mysteries, and the Ocean its waves, and the Divine Lote-Tree its fruits, and the Sun its effulgence, and the verses their sweet savors. Blessed is he who hath found and recognized, and woe unto every remote denier. Verily We withheld the Pen for a time. Thy Lord doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O beloved! Remember when thou didst seek the Ultimate Goal and the Supreme Summit. We aided thee with the hosts of love and affection until thou didst attain the presence of the Wronged One in His mighty prison, and beheld the Dawning-Place of thy Lord’s verses, and heard His sweetest call, and stood before a door which was opened unto all who are in earth and heaven. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. The iniquity of the world and the transgressions of the nations have not withheld His mercy. He ordaineth for whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He pleaseth. He is the Single One, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We counsel thee and those who have believed to be trustworthy and religious, and to that which elevateth the station of man. I am the Counselor, the All-Knowing. Say: Aid ye My Cause with these My hosts. Thus were ye commanded aforetime in diverse Tablets, as attesteth he who hath in his possession a perspicuous Book. Aid your Lord through wisdom and utterance, through deeds and character. By the life of God! Through these are manifested the sanctification of My Being and the purification of Mine Essence. Blessed is he who hath understood My purpose, and woe unto the heedless. Say: Adorn your temples with the ornament of fear of God. He is the Leader of My hosts and their Chief. Thus hath the All-Wise decreed while seated upon His exalted throne.</p>
<p>We make mention of My loved ones there. We have mentioned them before and given them glad tidings of My favor which hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. We beseech God to aid them and My loved ones in all lands to act in accordance with what He hath revealed in His Book. He is the Helper, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Praised. O beloved! Upon thee be My glory. We have desired at this time to make mention of My leaf and My handmaiden who hath ascended unto the Supreme Companion. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>The Light shining from My Most Exalted Horizon and the Fragrance wafting from the Supreme Perspective be upon thee, O handmaiden of God! I testify that thou didst hear the Call and answer thy Lord, and didst turn unto Him when the people were in manifest aversion, and thou didst win the days of thy Lord and didst hearken unto His verses when the handmaidens of the earth were heedless thereof. We beseech God to send down upon thee mercy from His presence and grace from His own Self, and to show thee in all times the manifestations of grace and bounty. He is verily powerful over what He willeth, and He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Blessed is the servant who hath remembered her through what hath been revealed from My Most Exalted Pen, and the handmaiden who hath turned unto her. He verily heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. O beloved! Give thanks unto God for what He hath revealed unto thee of verses while the Wronged One was imprisoned in the hands of the oppressors. Say: O my God, my God! Withhold not Thy servants from turning to the Most Great Ocean, nor deprive them of the effulgent rays of Thy luminous horizon. Through Thy bounty and generosity, ordain for them that which will draw them nigh unto Thee. Verily, Thou art He in Whose grasp are the reins of grace and munificence. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Generous. Thy generosity hath encompassed all creation and Thy grace hath pervaded all beings. Deliver Thy servants from the promptings of self and passion, that they may turn with their hearts unto Thee, hearken unto Thy call, and recognize that which Thou hast ordained for them through Thy bounty. There is no God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-Conquering, the Glorious, the All-Wise. Illumine, O my God, the faces of those who have turned to the light of Thy countenance, and their hearts with the light of Thy knowledge. Verily, Thou art the Most Wise of judges and the Most Merciful of the merciful. I testify that Thou hast manifested Thyself as a token of Thy bounty and an evidence of Thy loving-kindness. Close not, O my God, the door which Thou hast opened unto the world. Verily, Thou art the Strong, the Powerful. Glory be upon Thee and upon Thy loved ones there, and upon those who are with Thee. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>O friends of God and His party! Today the light of justice has become veiled, nay obliterated, by the oppression of the world’s oppressor, for grievous blows from the wicked ones have been inflicted upon His blessed body. In the land of Ya, clamor has been raised; pure and assured souls have been seized out of sheer wickedness and for the taking of money, bound with ropes in utmost humiliation, and the masses struck them with chains, stones and clubs, and brought them before the exalted deputies - the dawning-places of tyranny and vice, the daysprings of self and passion. After seizing whatever possessions they had, they martyred them with the most grievous torment. The Pharaoh of the age said to one of those blessed souls, “Come, recant.” In reply he said: “For forty years I have awaited this day, and praise be to God, today I have attained unto it.” Another, while passing before the faces of the oppressors, uttered these exalted words: “O people! The Lord of the Martyrs said ‘Is there any who will help me?’ and this servant says ‘Is there any who will behold me?’” His purpose was that that oppressed one yearned for the draught of martyrdom rather than awaiting a helper. At these blessed words, the tears of the denizens of Paradise descended and the sighs of the people of Paradise ascended.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! In these days two mighty things have appeared: from the right, the banquet of the friends, and from the left, the battle of the wicked ones. The Wronged One of the world would recite one verse befitting the pavilion of the feast, and reveal another verse in remembrance of the martyrs. And in these days the greatest glad-tidings was mentioned in the Most Great Scene, and that was the ascension of one of the friends to the Supreme Companion and the Most Glorious Horizon. Exalted be His grace that hath encompassed the world and all peoples, and exalted be His utterance whereby the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the seat of the throne have been enraptured.</p>
<p>He who was named ’Abdu’llah in the Book of Names - we testify that he turned to the Lord of mankind in the earliest days when most in the land turned away, and we testify that he acknowledged what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in the prison of ’Akka and before it, and recognized God, His sovereignty, His Manifestation, and His power amidst His world and His creation. He it is who endured hardships and tribulations out of love for God, the Lord of Names, and there befell him at the hands of the enemies that which caused the people of the pavilion of purity and chastity in the Most Exalted Paradise to weep.</p>
<p>We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon him in every moment mercy from His presence and loving-kindness from His own Self. Verily He is the Mighty, the Bestower. And we beseech Him, exalted be He, to establish his station in the shade of the Divine Lote-Tree and give him to drink of the Kawthar of immortality from the hands of grace and bounty. Verily He is the Powerful over what He willeth. There is no God but He, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Forgiver, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>The Wronged One testifieth that at his mention the ocean of forgiveness surged and the fragrance of his Lord’s loving-kindness was diffused, and the Herald called out from the Kingdom of Utterance: “O people of the earth! Hear, then know that through his ascension and rising, the lips of the Concourse on High and the people of the pavilion of glory in the Most Exalted Paradise have smiled.” Blessed is he who remembereth him with what hath been revealed from My Most Exalted Pen in this Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Station. We beseech God to comfort his sons, his family and his loved ones, and to adorn them with the ornament of patience and composure. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>We send greetings to the friends of that land and counsel them with that which will exalt their stations amongst the servants. O physician, upon thee be My salutation and My glory. We beseech God to aid thee in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to assist thee in that which will draw thee nigh unto Him in all conditions. Praise be to God! Mention of you hath been and is before the Wronged One. We hope that henceforth thou wilt hold fast unto that which will cause the world of utterance to testify to the loftiness of thy station and thy exalted rank. His honor Mirza Zaynu’l-Abidin, upon him be the peace of God and His loving-kindness, must in all conditions fix his gaze upon the Truth. Praise be to God! He hath spent all his days in the love of God and hath been occupied in offering praise unto Him. We beseech God to protect him and to open before his face the door of His loving-kindness. Verily, He is powerful over all things. All the friends are remembered in the presence of the Wronged One. For each one We ask that which is the cause of success and prosperity. The command is in the hand of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Verily, we are God’s, and to Him shall we return.</p>

<p>He is the One Who gazeth from His Most Glorious Horizon! O Zayn! Upon thee be My glory and the glory of the Concourse on High! We have seen and heard that which thou didst send, and it hath attained unto Our presence. Praise be to God! The fragrance of the love of His loved ones is diffused; they speak with their tongues and are turned with their hearts towards Him, and are steadfast in His service. Today one drop of deeds is as an ocean, and an atom like unto the sun, inasmuch as these are the days of the Most Great Manifestation. His pardon hath preceded, His bounty hath preceded, His mercy hath preceded, His generosity hath preceded. He concealeth that which is manifest and revealeth that which is hidden. All the books of old have held festivities in celebration of this blessed Day. In truth, today the realities of the world are adorned with the most great joy and the most great gladness. Blessed is he who hath recognized the value of this Day and hath acted as beseemeth it.</p>
<p>O Zayn! Thou didst make mention of Mulla Muhammad-Baqir, upon whom be My glory. Verily God hath forgiven his mother, then the one for whom she desired forgiveness, from the ocean of thy Lord’s loving kindness, the All-Merciful, the Generous. Blessed is she! We found from her the fragrance of faithfulness and have mentioned her with this clear mention. We make mention of ’Abdu’llah, son of him who was named with the Truth. We beseech God to forgive him and forgive his father and mother, as a token of His grace. He, verily, is the Most Merciful of the merciful. We make mention of Muhammad-i-Ja’far and bid him act according to what hath been revealed in My Great Book. We beseech God to assist him in that which He loveth and is pleased with. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. We make mention of him who was named Nasru’llah, son of Sadiq, and give him glad-tidings through this wise mention. And of him who was named Rajab-’Ali who hath believed in God, the Single, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Zayn! Give glad-tidings to Muhammad-’Ali whose name was present before the face of the Wronged One at this time. We have made mention of those who have cast away idle fancies and vain imaginings and have taken hold of that which they were bidden by an Ancient Commander. O Zayn! The glory be upon thee and upon thy sister and upon her son from God, the Lord of the worlds. We have mentioned those whom God hath related unto thee with a mention that cannot be equaled by the mentions of the world. To this beareth witness the Book of God that speaketh in this exalted station. We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-’Ali, son of him who was named Qurban, and We counsel him with that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My Will, and give him glad-tidings of that which hath been ordained for him by God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Give thanks unto God for having mentioned thee in His Most Great Prison and revealed for thee from His Most Exalted Pen that which the treasures of the world cannot equal. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Forgiving, the Compassionate. Beware lest the happenings of the world sadden thee. Take hold of the Book with the strength granted from Us. We shall verily aid thee and protect thee from those who have disbelieved in God and His signs, and turned away from Him when He came with manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Isma’il, whose letter was present before the Wronged One when He was in the garden named after Him, and who was honored by His presence and attained His meeting in the nights and days. Verily thy Lord is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. O Isma’il! He who loved Me sent thy letter; the Wronged One read it and answered thee with that which caused the hearts of those who have turned towards Him to be attracted.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having made me acknowledge Thy oneness and confess Thy singleness, and hold fast unto what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. I beseech Thee by Him through Whom the standard of Thy unity was raised in Thy lands and the banners of Thy remembrance among Thy servants, and by His family and His companions, to ordain for me through Thy bounty and generosity that which will solace mine eyes and gladden my heart. O Lord! The ignorant one hath sought the ocean of Thy knowledge, and the poor one the kingdom of Thy bestowal. Disappoint him not, by Thy bounty and generosity and Thy mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was mentioned in his letter, that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the All-Remembering, the All-Wise. O Muhammad! We have heard thy call and have answered thee with that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having made me one of the believers among Thy servants who have acknowledged that which the tongue of Thy power uttered before the creation of Thy earth and Thy heaven. Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful. O Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and holding fast unto Thy Book which Thou didst reveal unto Thy Beloved One. I beseech Thee by its verses and its mysteries and his station and his glory and his splendor, to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee in all conditions.

<p>O Samandar, upon thee be My glory! His honor ’Ali, who hath repeatedly circumambulated the House, hath sent thy mention to the Most Holy Court, and likewise that of the friends in that land. Praise be to God, he hath attained unto the effulgences of the lights of the Orb of nearness, and hath been blessed from the chalice of meeting. He constantly seeketh a portion for those who are related, assured, and detached. Therefore, at this moment, from the Most Exalted Pen floweth the Kawthar of remembrance and the Salsabil of utterance, that every possessor of love and detachment may drink thereof. We beseech God to aid all and adorn them with steadfastness. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O ’Ali, upon thee be My glory!

<p>Mention of His honor ’Abdu’l-Husayn, upon him be My glory, was revealed from the Most Exalted Pen some time ago. God willing, he shall attain unto it. O ’Ali, Qasim’s letter was seen.

<p>O Qasim! ’Ali sent thy letter to the Most Holy Court and repeatedly sought a reply, that thy mention might flow from the Most Exalted Pen. Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto this most great bounty, hast heard the call from before and after, and hast drunk from the cup of meeting. Preserve this station. The friends of that land must arise to serve, that is, to guide the people of the world to the horizon of the All-Merciful through wisdom and utterance. Blessed are they that act!</p>
<p>Mention was made of His honor Javad, upon him be My glory, in the letter. Verily, We have mentioned him and those with him in numerous Tablets. My Books, My Scrolls, and My Writings bear witness to this, and beyond them, I am the All-Knowing Witness. Divine favor hath encompassed them; from the beginning of the Cause until now they have been occupied in service and have attained unto grace. They have ever been and are beneath Our glance. Verily, He doth not suffer the reward of the doers of good to be lost.</p>
<p>O Javad! We have mentioned thee graciously, and thy son, and those with thee. Convey greetings to each one from the Wronged One, and after the greeting, utter these words: Blessed art thou, for the lights of the Face have turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison, and joy be unto thee for having attained unto the recognition of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Hear My call, that it may draw thee to God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

The Glory be upon thee, upon thy father and mother, and upon My handmaiden whom We named ’Azziyyih, and upon the handmaidens who have believed in the One, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>O beloved of my heart! In view of the multitude of letters requiring responses and correspondence from various quarters, there has not been, nor is there now, opportunity to mention to that beloved one all that is befitting. Therefore, I write briefly, and in this brevity, since the grace of God is concealed therein and the sweet fragrance of His bounty wafts therefrom, it is accounted as lengthy. Tonight, being the ninth night of the blessed month of Shawwal, I mention, as commanded, that which stirs the cord of love and brings to remembrance the days of attainment to His presence.</p>
<p>His exalted Word: All that was previously sent has arrived, and the items sent by the Afnan M.H.–upon him be all the most glorious Glory–and the Leaf of the Tree (S.)–upon her be my Glory and loving-kindness–have all arrived, and specifically for each of the Leaves of the Tree a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed and sent. End quote. The servant beseeches his Lord to strengthen them and aid them to achieve that which He loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p>The arrival of the Leaves, and likewise the Holy and Impregnable Tablets which some have specifically requested–some are being sent in this instance and the remainder will be sent in the next. Praise be to God, the bounty of the All-Bountiful is manifest and evident at all times, and specifically revealed for that beloved one is that of which every letter testifies to the loving-kindness, compassion, and mercy of the Goal of all the worlds.</p>
<p>Another matter you wrote about: Aqa Jalil of Rasht has stayed in Kirmanshah and is occupied with writing verses and teaching. Although he was not commanded to teach, yet according to a letter he wrote to the bearer of the Name of Generosity–upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God–he has arisen of his own accord to serve. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant him divine confirmation and success. Some time ago, a letter was also sent addressed to him, but his name is Aqa Rasul while you wrote Aqa Jalil. In the matter of mentioning names, great care and attention must be observed.</p>
<p>Two years ago, one of the friends besought Tablets from the heaven of divine favor and wrote several names, but four names were written incorrectly–for example, writing Muhammad instead of Hassan, and Hussein instead of Ahmad. This causes delay and confusion. Although these servants write the names at the head of the Tablets according to how the friends mention them, in any case this matter requires attention and consideration so that names are written correctly.</p>
<p>Regarding the two sums of money about which you wrote in these days–one from the Land of Ha and another from ’Aliyyih–news of their arrival has come; God willing, they will arrive. As commanded, the sum of one hundred tumans must reach Jinab-i-Samandar–upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God–as it was assigned to him to give to two persons, which he has done and sent the receipt. That honored one must pay the debt of God, exalted be His glory. Likewise, deliver fifty tumans to the honored wife of him who ascended unto God (the late Mirza Ahmad Khan) and send the receipt.</p>
<p>And He said: We must impose a fine upon Jinab-i-Amin! We have one treasurer and he is bankrupt! Gracious God, there is one treasury belonging to God, and that is empty of funds. Indeed, by virtue of its exalted station, such a treasury ought to be freed and sanctified from earthly things and not be confused with the treasuries of the world.</p>
<p>Convey greetings and praise on behalf of this evanescent one to the friends of God in every place. At all times I beseech and implore from the heaven of the Lord of the Worlds’ grace that He may increase their fire of love and illumine the hearts of all with the light of knowledge and whatever is befitting. Verily, He has power over all things.</p>
<p>A Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was also revealed and sent specifically for the spiritual beloved, Jinab-i-Bayk–upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness. We beseech God, exalted be He, to strengthen him, assist him, and open before his face a door of His grace. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who love you and hear your word concerning this mighty Cause. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O Mahmud! The Lord of the unseen and the seen makes mention of thee from this praiseworthy station, and gives thee glad tidings of God’s loving-kindness and mercy. He hath revealed for thee that whose fragrance shall never cease to endure throughout the eternity of thy Lord’s names, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thy letter hath gained audience in this Most Exalted Horizon, a station round which circle the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the most sublime Paradise. Thy Lord, verily, is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>The servant who is present brought thy letter and laid it before the Wronged One, Who hath called all to God, the Lord of the worlds. We found it purified from vain imaginings and adorned with the praise of thy Lord, the Lord of all men, at Whose appearance all things proclaimed: “The Promise is fulfilled, and He Who was promised hath appeared with a sovereignty before which all in the heavens and earth stand powerless.” Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Countenance when it appeared, and woe betide him who hath turned away from Him Whom God had announced through the tongue of every Prophet and trusted Messenger.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the earth! This is the Day of attainment, did ye but know it, and this is the Day of meeting, did ye but recognize it. The gates of grace have been opened by the finger of your Lord’s will, the Lord of all existence. By God! The verses have been sent down, the evidences have appeared, and the river hath flowed from the right hand of the throne of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Say: O concourse of divines! Cast aside your learning and what ye possess of vain imaginings. By God! He Who is the Self-Subsisting hath appeared and giveth the near ones to drink of the sealed wine. Say: Beware lest your knowledge prevent you from the knowledge of God, or your books from the Book, at whose revelation every book sent down by God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting, hath bowed down. Say: O company of the heedless! The horizon of the world hath been illumined by the Most Great Light, and all things have proclaimed with their loudest voice: “The Hidden Secret hath appeared!”</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath ascended unto God and was named Muhammad in the Kingdom of Names, that servants honored may remember him. Blessed art thou, O Muhammad, for having turned unto and believed in Him Who is the Goal when all on earth turned away, save those whom God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, did will. I bear witness that thou didst hear the Call and didst fulfill God’s Covenant, the Lord of all beings, and didst act as thou wert commanded on a day whereon trembling seized the dwellers of earth and heaven, save those whom God, the Lord of this promised Day, did will. The glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon thee, O thou who gazest toward the Most Exalted Horizon and speaketh in the name of thy Most Glorious Lord, through Whom the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing was raised up in the Kingdom of creation. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>We bear witness that thou didst behold My horizon and didst speak My praise and didst shatter the idols of vain imaginings in My Name, casting behind thee the sources of conjecture, turning unto the Supreme Summit, the Station which is illumined by the lights of the face of thy Lord, the Lord of Kings. Thou art he whom the greatest veil did not prevent from the Lord of Destiny. Thou didst forsake what the people possessed, hoping for what is with God, thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Kind. We bear witness that thou didst hold fast to the Most Great Handle when the Lord of earth was established upon the throne of His Most Great Name, and the Kingdom proclaimed to Him Who appeared with the truth: “Verily, He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.”</p>
<p>O Muhammad! We make mention of him who made mention of thee and turned toward thy resting place and visited thee, by virtue of what the Most Exalted Pen spoke when the Wronged One was imprisoned by the hands of those who were heedless of the One Who remembers and is remembered. Thus did the heaven of utterance shine forth with the light of thy Lord’s mention, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O Mahmud! The Most Ancient Pen speaketh in Persian that all the friends might drink of the living waters descending from the heaven of the utterance of the All-Merciful and attain unto the most great steadfastness. Convey greetings from the True One to all those related to him who hath ascended and been elevated. The names of all are mentioned before the Face and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Book of Names. God willing, may they all engage in praising the Beloved of the worlds with the utmost joy and fragrance, with wisdom and utterance. We have remembered all the friends of that land. They must give thanks to God for this great bounty, for nothing that is seen or that is hidden can compare with a single mention from among the divine mentions. Know ye the value of this divine Day, count His favors as great, and preserve the pearls of His love in the treasuries of your hearts in His Name, for the slanderers and the treacherous have been and are lying in wait. Thus have We informed you before and in this wondrous Tablet. Glory be upon you and upon My handmaidens who have heard the Call from the direction of grandeur, and have believed in the One, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>My spiritual friend, his honor Varqa, upon him be the Glory of God, may take note.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, to Him belong greatness and majesty! This evanescent servant testifies that there is none other God but Him. He was forever hidden and concealed in the treasury of the Unseen until the appointed time came, when He appeared from the horizon of creation with grandeur and glory. Then the trumpet was blown, the graves arose, the herald called out, the spirit was breathed, and the world was adorned with the ornament of knowledge. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who manifested Himself amidst all created things, Who speaks in the kingdom of utterance, and Whose Most Exalted Pen moves at every moment - the Pen through which He has detailed every matter with truth, revealed every mystery with justice, explained every wisdom with grace, and established every decree in His mighty Book. Glory be to the All-Bountiful Who made Himself known to us, taught us His Cause, and guided us to His straight path.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! The fragrant breezes of your love - for our Beloved, your Beloved, and the Beloved of all worlds - have stirred me, and the winds of your utterance have moved me, through which your acceptance, sincerity, steadfastness, love, affection, and arising in the Cause of God, the Beloved of all worlds, have become manifest. When your mention took hold of me, I ascended to a station that cannot be indicated by my indication, nor comprehended by my comprehension, nor known by my descriptions, nor expressed by my pen and ink. When I attained His presence, the Lord of all worlds and the Master of eternity asked me what was in my hand. Then, with permission, I opened it and presented what the nightingales of your love had sung upon the branches of the Lote-Tree of sincerity.</p>
<p>When it was concluded, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which I am unable to mention, until He said: “O servant present before Me! Convey My glorification to those who have attained to My recognition and My presence, who have immersed themselves in the ocean of My proof, who soar in the atmosphere of My love, who drink the choice wine of My remembrance and praise, who have turned toward My face, and who stand before My gate. Say: Blessed art thou, O Varqa, for My verses have attracted thee, caused thee to speak in My days, and drawn thee to My dwelling place, until thou didst stand before My throne, hear My call, and attain to the hearing of My utterance. Know thou with certainty that We have mentioned thee and do mention thee as a favor from Us. Verily, thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Bountiful. Be thou assured by thy Lord’s grace, then make mention of Him with wisdom and utterance. He will assist thee at all times. To this bear witness the dwellers of My realms, the guardians of My mysteries, the recipients of My revelation, the dawning-places of My attributes, and this mighty and wondrous Tongue. Make mention from Me to thy brother who attained in My days and circumambulated My mighty throne, and to those who have turned to the Supreme Horizon and held fast to the Most Great Name, whereby the limbs of all names have trembled, and give them the glad-tidings of My gracious remembrance.”</p>
<p>In brief, it is submitted that the travelers, upon them be the Glory of God, were present before the throne at the castle where the Greatest Scene is situated, when suddenly the Ancient Beauty gave permission for their return, and they were set to depart the next day. Therefore, this servant had no time or opportunity to express in detail the degrees of sincerity and love. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that the opportunity may be granted hereafter. In any case, after learning of the travelers’ departure, these few words were submitted in brief so that they might rejoice in the divine favors and infinite bounties. The Tablets they had requested were sent, numbering five, corresponding to the blessed letter “Ha”. As commanded, they should be distributed by lot - that is, after ablutions, place them under a cloth, then draw one Tablet in each person’s name and give them to whomever they were intended for. Since the mention of names is not permitted in these days, the names were not written at the top of the Tablets.</p>
<p>Another submission: Convey this evanescent servant’s glorification to his honor, my brother, upon him be the Glory of God and His praise, and mention that what was promised was fulfilled, but did not reach you - God willing, it will reach you. There is no opportunity now to mention details. And another submission: Convey to all the friends in that land, on behalf of this evanescent servant, remembrance, praise, and the Most Wondrous, Most Exalted, Most Holy, Most Glorious glorification. Glory and praise be upon you and upon God’s loved ones there.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who sent forth the Messengers, revealed the Books, made manifest the proof and evidence, and sealed Messengership and Prophethood with Him Who was named Muhammad in the Kingdom of Creation, Ahmad in the Concourse on High, and the All-Praised One in the tabernacle of grandeur and glory. He is the One through Whom truth was distinguished from falsehood. There is none other God but Him, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the Help in Peril.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the ships of Thy wisdom sailed upon the ocean of Thy knowledge, and the spheres of the heaven of Thy decree revolved by the Pen of Thy ordainment, to assist Thy loved ones and Thy friends even as Thou didst assist those who are nigh unto Thee among Thy creation and the sincere ones among Thy creatures. Then inscribe for them that which shall profit them in every world of Thy worlds. O my Lord! Thou beholdest them soaring in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and sailing upon the sea of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee not to disappoint them at the door of Thy mercy. Verily, Thou art the Ordainer, the Giver, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the melodies of the birds of your knowledge upon the branches of the tree of your certitude in the Cause of God–our Beloved and your Beloved, our God and your God, our Goal and your Goal, and the Goal of all who are on earth–attracted me. When I read and presented it, and after my supplications were complete, the Tongue of Grace spoke, God willing, that which God loveth and is pleased with. May they attain! Praise be to God, they have drunk from the cup of bounty and have been and are circumambulating around the will of the Lord of Names. In these days, the tyranny of oppressors is evident from all directions. The standard of Islam lieth prostrate upon the earth due to the transgressions of the transgressors, and its throne is shattered. All the friends must, in the nights and days, beseech the Exalted Truth, glorified be His majesty, for the exaltation of the Cause, that perchance all may attain to the Cause of God and His religion.</p>
<p>That which you had written was heard. God willing, the waters of the world shall not prevent you from the Kawthar of God, and gold shall not make you heedless of the divine path. We beseech God, the Lord of the Throne and earth, the Master of the hereafter and the former times, to assist His loved ones, His friends, and His chosen ones in that whereby the standards of guidance may be raised among all creation and the banners of proof and evidence upon the hills of contingent being. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth. All things are captive in His grasp, and this is indeed easy for Him. There is none other God but Him, the Omnipotent, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about Haji Muhammad Husayn and Aqa Mirza Mahdi, upon them be the Glory of God, it was presented. He said that if they wish to remain in the land of A and S, there is and was no objection. Let them occupy themselves, trusting in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Verily, He sendeth down from the heaven of grace whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Commander, the All-Wise. God willing, may they walk and conduct themselves with perfect joy and fragrance and with complete wisdom.</p>
<p>The sent envelopes arrived. God willing, may the Truth, exalted be His glory, assist this evanescent one to present the response. And regarding what you had written about Haji ’Abdu’llah and the land of Kha, that was and is the expedient course, conforming to and associated with wisdom. Furthermore, the honored beloved Aqa Siyyid ’Abdu’l-Baha, upon him be the Glory of God, has written a letter to this evanescent one and sent supplications. From some conditions, I present glorification and greetings to his service, and afterward his response, along with the response to the supplications, God, the All-Merciful willing, will be sent. At present there is no more opportunity than this.</p>
<p>To the spiritual beloved, Aqa Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God, and other friends and gentlemen, mention of evanescence and nothingness is presented. God willing, as long as the horizon of the world is illumined by the Most Great Luminary, may they pass their days in perfect joy and gladness and spirit and fragrance, and be occupied with the mention of the Peerless Friend. I testify that you have profited in your trade and attained the fruits of your existence. The servant beseeches his Lord to protect you and grant you the good of this world and the next. There is none other God but Him, the Omnipotent, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Beautiful. The Glory, perfumed with the fragrance of the Beloved, be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who love you in God, the Lord of the worlds. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs and sent forth the Messengers and made them guides of the ways from His presence to His creation, and through them He opened the gates of His grace and bounty unto His servants and revealed His path and His balance in His lands, until the Manifestations culminated in the Most Great Manifestation, Whom God established as His Own Self among the nations. Through Him appeared the seal of fulfillment and the Dove of Utterance warbled upon the highest branches. By God! He hath come through Whose advent the heavens were adorned, and through Whose name the Kingdom of Names, and through Whose manifestation the dominion of utterance in the heaven of religions. Through Him was raised the banner of unity and the standard of detachment, and the ocean of divine knowledge surged, and the fragrance of the All-Merciful was diffused.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou seest one of Thy servants who hath turned unto Him Who was imprisoned in Thy path and accepted tribulations for love of Thee. Thou knowest that he hath acknowledged Thy unity and oneness and held fast unto the cord of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by Thy chosen ones through whose light the earth and heaven were illumined, and whom Thou didst make the keys of Thy knowledge amongst mankind and the emblems of Thy guidance in the realm of creation, to assist him in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all men and the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below. There is none other God but Thee, the Guardian over all things.</p>
<p>Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One and We have learned its contents. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to open before thy face the gate of grace and to send down upon thee from the clouds of His mercy a blessing from His presence, and to make thee rich through His riches, and speaking in His remembrance, and steadfast in serving His loved ones. Verily, He is the All-Seeing, the All-Bountiful, the All-Hearing, the Most Generous. There is none other God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>We make mention at this time of him who is named Abdul-Karim - upon him be the peace of God and His loving-kindness. He hath attained unto the mention of the Wronged One before and after thy request. We beseech the All-Bountiful to assist him in that whereby his remembrance and his name shall endure in the cities and lands of God. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>And We make mention of Our loved ones in Ta and of him who hath loved Me and arisen to serve Me, who was named Varqa in the Book of Names. We beseech God to aid all to act in accordance with what He hath revealed in His perspicuous Book, whereby He distinguished between truth and falsehood until the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Adorn the heads of Thy servants with the crown of trustworthiness and their temples with the raiment of righteousness. Then preserve them, O my God, from the hosts of tyranny and wickedness and from that which Thou hast forbidden them through the tongue of Thy Messengers and chosen ones. O Lord! Illumine their hearts with the lights of Thy knowledge. Verily, Thou art He to Whose grace and bounty all created things have testified, and to Whose generosity and gifts all beings have borne witness. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst desire concerning service, know that it dependeth upon goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. By Him Who holdeth my soul in His hands! Deeds are more potent than words. It behooveth the people of unity to counsel others through their deeds and their character. We counsel thee and them with that whereby their stations and ranks may be elevated in the world, and We beseech God to grant thee success in all conditions. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>O thou who holdest fast to the Sure Handle! Thou seest the unitarians among enemies, and there hath befallen them each day that which hath caused their hearts to melt, their tears to flow, and their hearts to lament. We implore God to aid them to patience and forbearance, to tranquility and dignity. Verily, He is the Powerful, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>When thou seest any of My loved ones, remind him on My behalf, then recite unto him what the tongue of My counsel and exhortation hath uttered. Say: By God! The world and its ornaments, its possessions, its bounties and blessings shall pass away. Where is Chosroes, and where is Caesar? Where is he who turned away and denied? Where are the Pharaohs of the lands and the tyrants among the servants? And where are their ranks and their armies? Where are their lofty palaces and their adorned houses? Where is their might and their power, and where is their wrath and anger? They have returned to dust with great remorse. They cry for help but are not helped; they ask but are not answered. Blessed is the servant who hath cast away vain desire and taken unto himself the fear of God, and hath purified his heart from all rancor and hatred, and who associateth with all people in a spirit of fragrant joy. We beseech God to attract all through His call and to preserve them through His grace and His hosts, and to ordain for them every good thing that He hath sent down in His Book. Verily, He hath power over all things and is ready to answer.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath revealed the verses and manifested the proofs, Who hath spoken the supreme Word and caused all things to speak it. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. And the resplendent and luminous prayers from the heaven of the will of the Lord of Names be upon Him by Whom the vale of Ba??a was stirred, and through Whom the Dove of Unity warbled upon the branch of eternity, and through Whom the Light shone forth from the supreme horizon, and through Whom the banners of detachment were raised in the kingdom of creation. And upon His family and companions, through whom the ocean of utterance surged and the breezes of the All-Merciful wafted, and through whom was manifested that which the All-Merciful revealed in the Furqan. These are honored servants who speak not until He hath spoken, and who do as He commandeth.</p>
<p>O Shukru’llah! God willing, mayest thou be blessed in all conditions with the outpourings of the True Bestower and be ever gazing upon the lights of His countenance after the passing of all things. The world hath been encompassed by suppositions and idle fancies, and all have been deprived of the splendors of the Sun of certitude, save whom God, exalted be His glory, hath willed. God hath ever desired the best for His servants, yet most, through excessive ignorance, have not heeded divine counsels and admonitions, remaining lost in the wilderness of confusion and ignorance. We beseech God to awaken all from the slumber of heedlessness and make them aware. This is not difficult for Him.</p>
<p>At all times hath this Wronged One remembered and continueth to remember His loved ones, that the remembrance may draw them to a station wherein the conditions of human limitations shall not prevent them from the Lord of destiny, nor shall the clamor of the ignorant keep them from the Creator of heaven. All that hath befallen the blessed community hath been the fruit of their deeds. We counsel all to observe trustworthiness and godliness, truthfulness and sincerity, mercy and kindness, unity and concord, patience and forbearance. We beseech God to enable all who are on earth to act in accordance with what hath been ordained in His Perspicuous Book. Blessed are they who have attained unto His good-pleasure and are detached from all else.</p>
<p>The Wronged One remembereth in this place him who was named Ghulam-Husayn, and We beseech for him divine confirmation and assistance from God, the Lord of the worlds. O friends! Every created thing and every earthly blessing shall be seized by extinction and shall soon return to nothingness. Strive ye that perchance ye may achieve such deeds as shall endure as long as the divine names and attributes endure. We make mention of thee and thy brother, and counsel you both to steadfastness and to that which beseemeth man. He, verily, is the Helper, the Gracious.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Siyyid-’Ali and remind him of that which will draw him nigh unto the supreme horizon, that he may be among those who are firmly established. The Wronged One hath perceived the fragrance of thy love and remembereth thee at this time when sorrows have encompassed Him from all directions through that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. We make mention of ’Abdu’l-Husayn and counsel him with that which beseemeth him. Blessed is he who acteth in accordance with what hath been revealed in the Book of God, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
<p>We beseech God to assist and enable all to that wherein lieth His good-pleasure. O Pen! Make mention of them who have loved thee, that they may rejoice and be among the thankful. Unto him who was named Muhammad-Baqir say: Let not the oppression of those whom the world hath deluded, who have forgotten the Luminary of justice and have risen with manifest tyranny, grieve thee. Hold thou fast unto the Sure Handle and in all conditions cling to the hem of the grace of God, the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>O Letter Shin! Thou hast borne hardships and endured adversity and tribulation in His path until thou didst attain the presence of the Wronged One. We beseech God to ordain for thee from His Most Exalted Pen the good of the hereafter and of this world, and to grant thee every good thing He hath ordained in His Book. Verily, He is powerful over all things. We make mention of thy son and the leaf who hath turned unto the Self-Sufficing, the Most High, and We beseech God to write down for them both the reward of those who have made pilgrimage in His path and visited His blessed, luminous, mighty, and glorious House.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who sent thee. Verily, he was with Me in the early days, and the Wronged One hath mentioned him in various Tablets. We beseech God to exalt him to such a station wherein every tongue shall utter his praise and every discerning one shall bear witness unto him. The mention shining forth from the horizon of My heart be upon him and upon thee and upon those who are with thee, and upon those who remember God in the morning and in the evening.</p>

Exalted is the All-Merciful Who, in sending forth His Messengers and revealing His Books, intended naught except to manifest His grace and exalt His bounty upon His servants.

And blessings and peace be upon the Lord of mankind, through whom every hidden mystery was revealed, through whom the Sun of divine knowledge shone forth and the Light blazed forth among all peoples, and upon His family and companions, through whom God revealed the pearls of His wisdom and His commandments among His creation. He is, verily, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>And then, the letter from that beloved of the heart arrived. A thousand thanks to the Lord of creation that news of the health of the honored Afnans and your honor reached us and caused boundless joy and delight. In truth, news of the loved ones is the cause of joy and the source of happiness and gladness. To give thanks for this bounty would require ages and centuries. I beseech Him, blessed and exalted be He, to keep this door open through His might, His grandeur and His sovereignty. He is, verily, the Powerful, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>After viewing, reading and becoming informed, He proceeded to the Most Holy Shrine. After making supplication, He said: “We beseech God to assist him with the hosts of His verses and His evidences, to grant him that which befits His generosity and bounty, to aid him in serving His loved ones, and to make him a helper unto them, a supporter of them, and a witness for them. He is, verily, the Powerful, the All-Bounteous.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God, you have repeatedly visited the Shrine and have attained to that which is conducive to the reformation of the world and the refinement of the souls of nations. The honored Afnans have ever been and continue to be remembered. We beseech for them divine assistance and confirmation, and that which shall endure as long as God’s sovereignty, His Kingdom and His Dominion endure.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, through the grace of the True One and His favors, you have attained unto the good of both this world and the next. Praise be unto Him, again praise be unto Him! Thanks be unto Him, again thanks be unto Him! Now the matters must be mentioned, for time is like an elixir, that is to say, rare. The letter of receipt for the honored Iskooi, upon him be the Glory of God, and the reply to the letter of Ibn-i-Jenab-i-Alif and Ha, upon them be the Glory of God, were sent to them. What was sent with the honored beloved, the esteemed Haji Siyyid Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God and His favor, has arrived, and whatever they wrote will, God willing, all be sent to the honored Ali-Haydar, upon him be the Glory of God. Regarding the souls in Ishqabad, their trusts will be sent. The honored beloved, the esteemed Nazir, upon him be the Glory of God, wrote a letter to that beloved one which was sent. I beseech the True One to prepare means for them that they may engage in their work with joy and fragrance, with delight and assurance, and find rest.</p>
<p>The letter of receipt for the honored Ali-Haydar, upon him be the Glory of God and His favor, was sent for them to forward. In truth, they know valor. The servant beseeches his Lord to make him a standard of piety among the people and a banner of His Name among all names. Praise be to God, they are mentioned at the threshold of grace and are recipients of His favor. Whatever was besought for them, they have truly attained unto it. This is such a station that however much it increases, it is still insufficient, for the bounty of the All-Bountiful is unlimited and the mercy of the All-Merciful is boundless.</p>
<p>To the honored Afnans, his honor Alif and Ha, and his honor Haji Siyyid A, upon them both be every remembrance and glory, I convey my utter servitude and nothingness. To the honored beloved, his honor Haji, and the beloved of the heart, his honor Muhammad Mustafa, upon them both be the Glory of God, I send greetings and praise. I mention each of the loved ones with the utmost humility and beseech God, exalted be His glory, for that which shall never pass away nor change. The servant asks and the Lord answers. Verily, He is the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below. Peace and mercy be upon you and upon God’s righteous servants. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, the Most Splendid</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath sent down from the heaven of eternity the rains of generosity that the hearts of the people of the world might be verdant thereby, that they might arise from the graves of nothingness and speak forth the Most Great Name, whereby the horizon of utterance hath shone forth and that which was hidden and concealed from the eyes of all creation hath been made manifest. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who hath sent down the Book and commanded all to show humility, submissiveness and supplication. He, verily, is the Ruler from time immemorial. There is none other God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. And praise be to God Who hath chosen for Himself glory and grandeur and hath forbidden all from drawing nigh unto this most exalted station. Blessed is he who hath acted according to that which God, the Lord of Names, hath commanded, and woe betide him who hath followed his desires and turned away from that which God, the Source of power and majesty, hath ordained.</p>
<p>And now, thy letter was received and thy lamentation was heard from its words. This servant, the attendant, was greatly astonished by such unseemly matters, for today all are commanded to show humility, submissiveness, love, fellowship, affection and unity. It is strange that Jinab-i-Nabil should have become the cause of thy sorrow. This much I say: that the Truth hath loved and continues to love His loved ones, and whosoever today acteth according to that which hath been revealed in the Tablets shall surely receive an even greater measure of His favoring grace, both now and in the future. And know ye this much: this servant was greatly saddened by thy letter. This is a day wherein all must fix their gaze upon the horizon of God’s Cause and partake of the wine of inner meanings which hath been prepared in the special wine-cellar of the Lord, drinking and offering it to others in the Most Great Name, the All-Glorious. It is a pity that in these days, souls who have accepted the Cause and who gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon should be occupied with themselves. In all conditions they must speak such words and perform such deeds as will cause the exaltation of God’s Cause and bring assurance to the hearts and souls. The Truth, exalted and glorified be He, hath never been and will never be pleased with such matters. Be thou assured of the grace of our Lord, the All-Merciful, then beseech Him to enable me and thee to remember and praise Him, and to cleanse us from that which beseemeth us not, and to protect us from those who have wronged during the days of God and believed not in God even after He came with manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>In any case, be not grieved by such matters. If anger appeareth from one of the loved ones, fix thy gaze upon the Sun of loving-kindness of the Truth which dawneth from the horizon of grace, and if withdrawal is observed from one of the friends, be not saddened thereby but look to the expansiveness of the Truth. I swear by His holy Being that were the entire world to appear before Him, He would regard all with the glance of favor and adorn them all with the ornament of His grace. And as for Jinab-i-Nabil, forgive him from thy heart, for man is prone to error. We all fix our eyes upon God’s pardon, grace and forgiveness. Though from Jinab-i-Nabil an undesirable action occurred regarding thee, yet he had formerly endured numerous afflictions in the path of the Beloved of the world. Therefore we must pray for one another and seek forgiveness. Today the heaven of grace is raised high and the ocean of mercy is surging. We must all beseech the peerless King to adorn all with the garment of forgiveness. Know ye this much: the Truth Himself knoweth and is aware of all that transpireth. Be thou assured and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>At one time this servant attained the presence of His Most Holy Court and outwardly presented the contents of the letter. He showed favor and this blessed word shone forth and appeared from the Source of the Lord’s Command. His exalted Word: “We have commanded all to act with goodliness. Blessed is he who holdeth fast unto it and is of them that act.” Though harm befell thee, yet that harm became the cause of divine favor, even as thy mention was made at the Throne and the expression of favor shone forth and appeared from the Dayspring of mercy and loving-kindness. We thank our Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, and we praise Him in all conditions. He, verily, is the Compassionate, the Generous. Convey greetings on behalf of this evanescent one to all the friends in that land, and the Glory be upon you, O loved ones of God.</p>

Praise be to God Who hath guided us to the Dawning-Place of His signs, the Dayspring of His evidences, the Manifestation of His names, the Source of His attributes, and the Fountainhead of His commandments and ordinances - He through Whose appearance the law of unity was established, the standards of detachment were raised, the Dove of Utterance warbled, and the Tree of Knowledge spoke forth. Sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Lord of all worlds. I pray and offer salutations upon Him and upon His family and companions, whom God made the dawning-places of His power amidst His creation and the daysprings of His glory amongst His servants. Through them appeared God’s might, His sovereignty, His power and His grandeur, and through them the tongues of all creation spoke forth in recognition of His unity and the sanctification of His Being. He is the All-Powerful, the All-Bountiful, in the beginning and in the end.</p>
<p>The letter from that spiritual beloved arrived like the light of true love, illumining the court of the heart and adorning the carpet of existence with fresh joy and delight. Glorified be He Who strengtheneth thee, assisteth thee, inspireth thee, preserveth thee and aideth thee. After reading it, I proceeded to the Holy Presence where it was presented. He said: “O Ali, upon thee be My peace and My remembrance.” Praise be to God that the invisible confirmations enabled you to attain His presence and meeting, and to dwell in His vicinity. We beseech His exalted Self to send down upon thee that which will set thy affairs aright and gather what is scattered, and to ordain for thee that which will make thee detached from all else save Him, at rest beneath His shade, and speaking forth His praise with wisdom and utterance. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Repeatedly have we beseeched and continue to beseech protection, victory, triumph and that which will gladden thy heart from the True One. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. At this moment, this servant is present and attaining in thy stead, and the Wronged One’s tongue attesteth to its acceptance. Well is it with thee, and may it be wholesome for thee. We beseech God to make the end of all affairs good through His grace and a mercy from His presence. Verily, He is the Commander, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant clings to the hem of divine grace and bounty, that He may assist, grant success, deliver that spiritual beloved, and free him from all that saddeneth him. Since this entreaty and supplication hath been and is for the sake of God, it shall be answered. Verily our Lord is the All-Bountiful, possessed of great bounty, the Ever-Flowing, possessed of manifest grace.</p>
<p>I convey greetings and praise to the loved ones if they are present, especially to the sapling of the divine garden and the crystal spring of eternal life, the beloved of heart and soul, His Honor Aqa Mirza Alireza, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah] the Most Glorious. In truth, his existence is blessed and adorned with the aforementioned attributes that are pleasing before God, exalted be His glory. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist his honor in preserving his most exalted station. Verily, He doeth whatsoever He willeth.</p>
<p>They are remembered in the heart and the heart of hearts. Their mention bringeth complete joy and true gladness. In all conditions, I beseech and hope from God, exalted be His glory, for their protection, health and well-being. Verily, He is the Answerer of prayers.</p>
<p>The circular items sent, each representing the globe, arrived - nay, the tongue is silent from comparison and limitation, for they were offerings from the dawning-place of love and the dayspring of humility and submissiveness unto God, our Lord, the Lord of the mighty throne and the Possessor of the manifest Message. Therefore they arrived and were presented, and at that time, as commanded, one was presented to His presence and some was partaken of. All this appeared and was evident due to the care shown to that spiritual beloved.</p>
<p>Now again I beseech the True One to bring near the days of presence and meeting, and to ordain the blessing of nearness. Verily, He hath power over all things and is worthy to answer.</p>
<p>The Most Pure and Most Luminous Branches - may my spirit be a sacrifice unto the dust of their footsteps - and the people of the pavilion of infallibility and grandeur remember that spiritual beloved with a mention sanctified above the mention of any tongue, and they beseech God, exalted be His glory, for blessing, wealth, glory, loftiness and exaltation.</p>
<p>Peace, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon God’s righteous servants.</p>

<p>O Zabih, upon thee be the Glory of God!</p>
<p>In His Name, the All-Merciful!</p>
<p>We have forewarned men of the days of tribulation and of what would come to pass therein, in a Tablet of exalted glory wherein was inscribed that which was ordained by the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, lest any should be perturbed when that which was destined should be made manifest - a token of Our grace unto the sincere ones. Yet when the sun of tribulation dawned from the horizon of divine decree, We found the sincere ones in grave peril. Say: Be fair, O people! Death shall overtake you - this is a truth in which there is no doubt - and shall seize both young and old. Since this is so, would you choose to sacrifice in the path of God, or death in your beds? Ponder on this, O ye fair-minded ones! Say: The spirit was created for sacrifice, were ye but to know it. Say: This do We ask of God, even though ye be averse to it. By God! Were it not contrary to what hath been revealed in the Tablets, I would have kissed the hand of him who would shed My blood in the path of the Beloved of the worlds, and would have bequeathed unto him all that God hath given Me as an inheritance, though by this act he would deserve God’s vengeance and wrath, His domination and anger, for as long as God, the Just, the Wise, shall endure.</p>
<p>They who were slain but slew not are now in the highest paradise with the Prophets and Messengers. Were God to remove the veil from the eyes of those who are heedless, they would all sacrifice their souls for love of that station. But it hath been concealed from them and revealed unto another people, as a grace from Him to His detached servants. O Zabih! When thou desirest the scene of sacrifice, consent not to alteration. Sacrifice thy body in love for the Supreme Concourse - a station that cannot be described in words. By thy Lord, the All-Merciful! God hath made mention of it virgin-pure; though all the tongues of the world should mention it, it would remain forever unmentioned, for hearing, sight and heart can only perceive what hath been created in this world, and beyond it the birds of the hearts of the mystics cannot soar, save those whose vision God hath made as His own vision. He witnesseth and veileth, in accordance with the wisdom of the All-Knowing, the Wise.</p>
<p>He who hath believed in this Revelation hath sacrificed in God’s path, and We are witness to this. Be thou assured that God hath ordained for thee the reward of one martyred in His path, and will protect thee from the edge of the sword if thou remainest steadfast in His Cause and conveyest His message with such wisdom as is within thy power. Indeed, He doth not burden any soul beyond its capacity. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. I complain unto thee of those who shed blood, after thou knowest that We have forbidden the people from this in all the Tablets - and God is Witness and Well-Informed. Say: O people! God hath raised Me up for fellowship and unity. Fear God, and commit not that which would harm the root of the Cause - this indeed is a grievous wrong.</p>
<p>Those who cast God’s Cause behind their backs and commit what they were forbidden - these are in manifest error. Say: If ye love striving in God’s path, strive with your own selves - this indeed is the greater striving. Hearken thou unto My words: Purify thy heart and the hearts of the people from all the allusions of the idolaters, then stand firm upon the throne of certitude beneath the shadow of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. He shall suffice thee against the veiled ones. We know that the letter “H” was overwhelmed by the veils of fancy, and names prevented him from entering God’s Kingdom, and he became as one asleep. The reminder profiteth him not; it increaseth naught for the wrongdoers save manifest loss. He sucketh at the breast of fancy; the time of weaning came, yet how far from maturity! Therefore was he denied what was promised in the Book and became deprived of the breezes of God, the All-Knowing, the Wise. Soon shall he say: “Woe unto me for what I neglected in regard to God!” and he shall be among the heedless ones.</p>
<p>Say: After turning away from these verses, dost thou consider thyself among those who believed in what was revealed in the Bayan? By God! Then would all things laugh at thee, and all the worlds would disown thee. Blessed is he who beholdeth them in the sea of heedlessness and saith: “Praise be to God Who preserved me by His grace and delivered me from the depths of fancy and numbered me with the victorious ones!” Thus have We imparted unto thee that which shall profit thee, as a mercy from Us unto thee and unto those possessed of certitude. Glory be upon thee and upon thy son. We beseech God to grant unto him and thee the best of what He hath ordained for those near unto Him. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the name of the one, peerless, single, unique God. O Salamander! Sing thou the praise of My Name, the All-Compelling, for whosoever today becometh assured of this Name shall be accounted before God among the most exalted of beings. I swear by My Beauty that these people have not recognized the All-Compelling as He should be recognized, for if they acknowledge this Name, why then do they raise these objections at all times before the King of names and attributes? If God is the All-Compelling, then to utter “why” and “wherefore” in that most holy Presence is utterly vain. For instance, should He decree water to be fire, or fire to be water, or heaven to be earth, or earth to be heaven - He was and ever will be the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>Say: O servants! Have ye not witnessed God’s power through My mighty hand, and have ye not heard the holy utterances of the eternal Sovereign from My most pure and sacred tongue, and have ye not observed the all-embracing divine mercy from My boundless cloud of grace, and have ye not discovered the radiance of the Sun of inner meanings from the holy horizon of My Beauty? By God, the True One! If ye were to observe with the eye of insight, ye would find inscribed upon My luminous brow, by the most ancient Pen with musk-scented ink from the fingers of My power, in the most glorious script: “By God, this is the Most Exalted Perspective, this is the Most Great Beauty, this is He through one glance of Whose eyes were created the kingdoms of eternity, the cities of names, and the manifestations of oneness in the realm of creation. This, verily, is He through Whom the eyes of grandeur were solaced behind the pavilion of the unseen. This, verily, is He in Whose recognition, then in Whose power, then in Whose grandeur, then in Whose sovereignty, all who have been clothed with the garment of existence have been bewildered, were ye of them that know.”</p>
<p>O Salamander! Behold thou the pure essence of My nature, that if all the tongues of creation were to make mention of My Lordship and Divinity, He would surely find His luminous heart grieved thereby. Nevertheless, His tribulation hath reached such a pass that a handful of dust which He took up with His merciful grasp, into which He breathed the spirit of grace, and which He nurtured with the hands of His favor, hath risen up to war against His very Self. Yet he counteth himself among the oppressed. Shouldst thou observe well, no oppression in all creation hath ever appeared or been manifested greater than this. Cursed be he and those who follow him!</p>
<p>In any case, thy letter of arguments hath been presented and observed before Me. Blessed art thou for having taken from the virgin gardens of inner meanings. Would that thou hadst been aware from the beginning of the Cause. By Him Who is unique in His grandeur! None was aware of His Cause from its beginning. We concealed it through a wisdom from Our presence. In these days, croaking and braying have been raised, and they have sent tablets of falsehood in all directions, and surely they will reach thee also. Thou must, by God’s might and power, take up thy pen and write in response whatsoever the breaths of the Spirit of Baha cast upon thy heart. Rejoice within thyself for what God hath ordained for thee in the Most Exalted Station, a station of sublime glory.</p>
<p>Therefore, strive thou at all times to guide people from the paths of fire to the straight path of the All-Compelling Beauty. This is the counsel of thy Lord, which hath been inscribed by the Pen of mercy. Some time ago, an exalted Tablet was sent especially for thee, and now again this wondrous Tablet. Verily, He is the Bestower, the Munificent, the Generous. May the radiance that hath shone forth from the horizon of holiness be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, who have turned toward the direction of God’s mercy, and upon the devout men and women, and upon all, young and old.</p>
<p>Take thou by the hand him who was named ’Ali-Akbar, who was formerly with you, for he is drowned in the seas of idle fancies. Write thou to him what God hath cast upon thy heart, then teach him the way of truth, that he may become of those who are assured. Say: O servant! Be not proud before Me, and let not what thou possessest of mere allusions deceive thee. Hearken unto what this Youth casteth upon thee from thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, that perchance the fire of his resistance may be changed to the light of acceptance, and he may cross over the Bridge and be of those who advance. Then convey Our greetings to all in thy city who have believed in God and turned toward the holy and noble Perspective.</p>

<p>O Haji Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, from Him Who is God, exalted be His glory, majesty and power!</p>
<p>The essence of praise and its quintessence belong exclusively to the court of the One, the Single, the Unique, Who through the goodly deeds and pleasing conduct of His loved ones has caused the banners of guidance to be raised in His realm. He is the Powerful, the Almighty, Who with a single word can conquer the citadels of the hearts of all the peoples of the world. The unseen hosts, in the first degree and station, have been and are the commanding Word of God, and in the second station, the deeds and character of His chosen ones. ?an?alah was but one of His servants, adorned and illumined by the lights of the Manifestation of Christ. Through one goodly deed that appeared from him, an entire kingdom–from its king and ministers and princes and others–became illumined with the lights of faith. Now consider what power, might and influence a single deed hath wrought and manifested. This is reckoned among the hosts of Truth, not the wielders of swords and spears. Exalted be His power and sublime be His grandeur!</p>
<p>Blessings and peace be upon the King of the Messengers, through Whom the sun of unity shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of knowledge, and the nightingale sang upon the branches of the tree of oneness–verily there is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise–and upon His family and companions, through whom God aided His Faith and manifested His Cause, despite every distant polytheist and every stubborn infidel. O what servants were they, whom neither the circumstances of tyrants nor the might of pharaohs deterred! They arose to serve the Cause and strove with utmost striving until they conquered lands in the name of their Creator, the Lord of creation. Through them God’s commandments were spread among His servants and His laws among His creation, and through them the Faith appeared, though the polytheists were averse.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the second letter of that spiritual friend arrived, bestowing that which spring bestows upon the world, for the pen of love and the ink of certitude were speaking and discoursing in praise of the Beloved of the worlds. That which was mentioned therein was of truthfulness and reality. After presentation, they stated: “With God are treasures for thee which none save He hath known. O Husayn, upon thee be My peace and My glory! Praise be to God that thou hast attained to that which causeth the exaltation of the Word. Ere long thy mention shall be raised throughout the regions of the world. Verily, He wasteth not the reward of the doers of good.” God willing, thou shalt be confirmed and assisted in all conditions. Know thou with certainty that the hand of God’s grace hath been and is with thee. He shall confirm thee outwardly and inwardly. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for thee the reward of what thou hast wrought in His path. Verily, He is the Guardian of His sincere servants.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that thou art adorned with the ornament of grace and art known among the friends for thy goodliness. Thou shouldst render thanks for this station with a hundred thousand tongues, for they singled thee out for this bounty in the first days of imprisonment. Well is it with thee and pleasant it is unto thee! Thy trustworthiness, religiosity, deeds and actions have been and are remembered. Each of these attributes is counted among the highest ornaments. Praise and gratitude be unto God that He granted such success to that spiritual friend that he attained unto the word of contentment. God willing, may he ever dwell and find rest beneath the canopies of divine grace, and be engaged in His remembrance. If thou shouldst meet any of the friends and masters who have quaffed from the wine of love and are gazing toward the horizon of grace, convey greetings and glorification from this lowly poor one. I beseech God to make each one of these masters appear as a banner upon the highest heights. This is a garment most great, most mighty, holy and sanctified above the fabrics of the world. A hundred thousand ornaments and garments of silk and brocade cannot equal a single one of the goodly attributes of man, for through one divine attribute and one heavenly characteristic he becometh manifest and renowned throughout all the world. The warp of this garment is trustworthiness and its weft is religiosity. How excellent is this ornament, sanctified, blessed, beloved! This evanescent servant beseecheth the eternal Truth to adorn all His loved ones with this wondrous, exalted, blessed garment. Verily, He hath power over all things and is worthy to answer prayers. Peace be upon you, and the mercy of God, and His blessings.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, to Whom belong grandeur and majesty!</p>
<p>Praise be to the One Who is worthy and deserving, Who in His grace ordained in the words of His Afnan that which captivates the heart and bestows fresh lustre to the eyes. And blessings and peace be upon the Seal of the Prophets, through whom the fragrance of divine unity was diffused throughout the world and the banner of power was raised amidst the nations, and upon His family and companions, through whom God transformed disbelief into faith, vain imaginings into certitude, darkness into light, ignorance into knowledge, and discord into harmony, and through whom the hearts of those who turned to Him found peace while the limbs of those who turned away trembled.</p>
<p>May my spirit be a sacrifice for you! Your distinguished letter, which is beyond description and characterization–for in truth it was an utterance sanctified above expression and a mention purified from all mention, transcending the limitations of the human world–by the life of our Lord, from it was inhaled the pure, pure, pure, pure fragrance unto the endless end–pure in divine love and immersion in the ocean of heavenly affection. In brief, it arrived in such wise that were it to reach barren soil it would cause it to flourish, and were it to pass over a pool it would transform it into a sweet ocean. When this servant partook of the wine of your utterance, he soared on the wings of trust and resignation until he attained the presence of his Lord and presented what was in the letter. He–may our souls be a sacrifice for Him–said:</p>
<p>The servant, while intoxicated with the wine of love for the Afnan, was present before the Face and presented that which bore clear witness to the Afnan’s adherence to and grasp of the Strong Cord of God and His Luminous Hem. After the completion of the letter, the servant said: “That which was befitting to be mentioned in numbered days has been written, or we shall write for him–that is, in explanation of what was uttered before the Face in known months.” Blessed be you, and your turning to God, and your mention, and your utterance. He beseecheth God to assist you and strengthen you as He hath strengthened you. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayer.</p>
<p>What can this servant say or mention? The All-Seeing is aware and present as witness. This evanescent one drank the wine of joy, nay, consumed the ocean of delight from the spirit of your mention of the Truth, exalted be His glory, and of utter powerlessness and nothingness. I beseech God at every moment to rain down upon His Afnan from the heaven of grace the waters of mercy and to send down the verses of His loving-kindness. When the letter was presented in the presence while some of the denizens of the pavilion of infallibility were present, all expressed special favor. Blessed be its writer and sender, and happy be its reader. All the circling men and women send their praise, glorification and greetings. For this servant, silence is more fitting at this point, as no scope remains for pen or tongue.</p>
<p>Another submission: Since the numerical value of the name of Haji Muhammad ’Alaqih-band–upon him be the Glory of God–corresponds with the value of the previous name, it was not accepted. They said patience is preferable, that the matter may be made manifest later. And They said regarding these deeds and such matters, We ordain that which serves to educate the servants, that all may look to what is most excellent and befitting.</p>
<p>To the honored master, His Holiness the Afnan Haji Siyyid ’Ali–upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God–I convey greetings and praise, and likewise to the honored master Haji Muhammad-Rida and the dear brother Aqa Mirza Husayn–upon them both be the Glory of God. I remember each one; praise be to God, they have been and are remembered, and are distinguished by special favors. I beseech and hope from God that He may ordain what befits His grace and bounty. Bounty is in His hand and generosity is in the grasp of His power. He doeth what He willeth and decreeth what He desireth, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Praise and glory be upon your honor and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds. Peace and blessings be upon His Prophets and His chosen ones and upon His sincere servants, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>All praise that befitteth the most holy, most glorious, most sublime court of the King of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen realms is praise that hath been manifested from His most holy, most glorious, most pure tongue. Should all created things and all contingent beings, from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end, arise to extol Him and open their lips in praise of Him, it would assuredly be but as the description of a gnat attempting to praise the Lord of Oneness, as it hath ever been and shall ever be. Sanctified is the court of His mention above the mention of all things, and holy is the presence of His glory above the description of all who dwell on earth and in heaven. Every possessor of knowledge hath confessed his ignorance, and every possessor of wisdom hath acknowledged his shortcoming, and this confession and acknowledgment are reckoned among the most excellent of deeds before the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Blessed is the soul that hath manifested pure servitude unto God, the Lord of creation, and acted according to what was commanded in the Book. He is among those who have fulfilled the Covenant on the Day of the Testament.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou by Whose Name hearts are attracted and souls take flight! I beseech Thee by him who hath clung to Thy cord and arisen to serve Thee amidst Thy creatures, to draw Thy loved ones nigh unto the ocean of Thy bounty and to provide them with what Thou hast ordained for Thy trusted ones and chosen ones. Then write down for them, through Thy grace, that which shall protect them from Thine enemies. O my Lord! Thou seest their humility in Thy Cause, their submissiveness at the appearance of Thy sovereignty, their turning toward Thy most exalted horizon, and their orientation toward Thy countenance after the passing away of all things. I beseech Thee by the power that hath encompassed all created things to ordain for them the good of every world of Thy worlds and the care which hath no likeness in Thy knowledge. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp is the Kingdom of Names. There is none other God but Thee, the Dominant, the Most High, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter was received, and as it contained mention and praise of God, glorified be His majesty, it brought the utmost joy. God willing, may you drink, throughout the duration of His most beautiful Names, from the choice wine of the bounty of the Sovereign Who doeth what He willeth, and may you remain articulate in His praise. He is the Guide, He is the Helper, He is the Succourer, He is the Witness, He is the Vigilant, He is the Powerful and Mighty, and He is the All-Knowing and All-Wise.</p>
<p>After perusing thy letter, at a certain time it was presented in the Most Holy Court. This is what the Tongue of the All-Merciful uttered in the Kingdom of Utterance: “God willing, may he ever be blessed through the bounty of the Beloved of the Immortal, and act according to what beseemeth His days. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid him and those who have believed to remain steadfast. O friends! Steadfastness is a matter of tremendous significance, and whoso attaineth unto it hath attained unto all good. O Hassan! Give thanks unto thy Lord for having remembered thee before and at this moment. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. And We make mention of thy wife who hath turned to God and believed in God, the One, the All-Informed. O My handmaiden! Rejoice in that the Lord of Eternity remembereth thee from the direction of His Most Great Prison. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Great. We hear and We see, and unto Us belong the latter and the former ends. Blessed is he who hath recognized and was among the firmly established.”</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about the sister of thy wife, that she desired to be a guest of the Ancient Beauty, exalted be His glory, this was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court and was graced with acceptance. Blessed is she in having attained unto this mighty bounty. The favor of God hath transformed this small portion into a great one. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst write regarding Aqa Muhammad-Rida, it was presented before Him from Whose knowledge nothing is hidden. One Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath been revealed for him from the heaven of the Divine Will. Deliver it unto him that he may drink the water of life from the utterance of the Beloved of all possibility. Verily, He is the Bestower, He is the Bountiful, the Ancient.</p>
<p>God willing, may you be blessed in all conditions with the love of God and His bounty, and be mentioned in the presence of His countenance. This evanescent servant is at all times occupied with and gladdened by the mention of the friends. God, exalted be His glory, is the Witness and the Bearer. Verily, He is the Witness, the All-Knowing, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>Glory and radiance be upon thee and upon every believer who hath believed in God on the day of His manifestation and remained steadfast in His mighty Cause.</p>

Say: O people, believe in God and in that which hath been sent down in truth unto ’Ali, and in Him Who shall come in the impregnable clouds. O people, fabricate not lies against God, nor exceed the bounds in His Cause. Then walk ye upon a straight and holy path.</p>
<p>O peoples of the heavens and the earth! Hearken unto the call of God from this Tree that hath grown and risen up, this blessed, eternal, and unique Tree which hath been raised up on the Mount of Glory by God’s leave. Say: Verily the Tree of the Cause speaketh within My breast, if ye would hear with the hearing of God. Say: By God! The Spirit of the Cause hath rent asunder from Me the veil of concealment and hath made Me manifest in truth - this was decreed by One mighty and powerful. Say: The Faithful Spirit speaketh in this Ridvan and calleth all to a holy and mighty Beauty, and giveth the people glad tidings of the meeting with God in this Spirit that gleameth from the horizon of grace. Hearken ye on the Day when the Herald calleth from the direction of the Most Exalted Name. Then shall ye find the true Cry between heaven and earth, and God shall come in holy clouds surrounded by hosts of angels.</p>
<p>O people of the Bayan! When ye attain unto the presence of that Day, hasten ye unto Him and question not concerning Him any lying sinner or one possessed of knowledge. Say: Beware lest ye deal with Him as ye dealt with the Point when He appeared with a manifest Book. Fear ye God and spread not corruption in His Cause, nor visit upon Him what ye visited upon this servant, for this was indeed a grievous error in the Mother Book.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Would ye do as the people of the Furqan did before? Woe unto you for having chosen oppression as your path. Say: The people of the Furqan declared “We believe in God and in what was revealed to Muhammad, the Messenger of God” until the test came to them from a direction near to glory. When ’Ali appeared in truth with a preserved and holy Book, they then disbelieved in God, associated partners with His Self, and turned away from the grace that was sent down bountifully from a holy heaven. Even so have these people dealt with this servant in this time, after He came to them with a proof from God and luminous tablets.</p>
<p>Say: By God! This Day shall no one’s faith profit him unless he entereth upon this Shore whereon is heard the call of God from beyond the veils, and wherein the Nightingale warbleth with every wondrous melody. Know then that thy letter hath come before Us, and We have taken it with the fingers of grace, and thus have We bestowed Our favor upon thee that thou mightest be among the thankful and the well-pleased with thy Lord. Remind the people of that wherewith We have reminded thee in truth, that thou mayest stand firm in the religion of God.</p>
<p>Say: By God! This holy Mountain shall not be moved by the tempests of rancor nor the storms of hatred. The Tree proclaimeth therefrom: “I am God, there is none other God but Him, and He is indeed the Witness unto all things.” Step forth from the veils of fancy and desire, and turn thy face toward the direction of eternity in this decree. Put thy trust in God, thy Lord, and He shall suffice thee against all the worlds. And if grief touch thee for My sake, grieve not, but stand firm in thy love and be steadfast in truth within thyself.</p>
<p>Say: By God! The heavens of conjecture shall be cleft asunder by a trial that shall seize both small and great, and the mountains of idle fancy shall crumble at this Youth Who hath appeared from the horizon of God with a mighty proof. As for thee, conceal this pearl within the shell of thy heart, though We have commanded thee to mention it, and in this there is an impregnable wisdom. Speak of it to those in whom thou perceivest the fragrance of the spirit, then conceal it from those who have taken their vain desires as their god and who are blind to true vision. Thus have We commanded thee, then forbidden thee, then taught thee, that thou mightest walk upon a mighty and straight path.</p>
<p>Say: By God! This is indeed the path of God for all who are in the heavens and on earth, and His light for all who are in the dominions of Command and Creation, and His proof unto all the worlds. Say: When the idolaters transgressed their bounds, We made manifest Our true Self that the proof might be fulfilled against them with eloquence. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who have turned unto God with their souls and their wealth, and who have remained steadfast in the Cause.</p>

<p>All that is in the heavens and on earth glorifieth God in wisdom, and all are His worshippers. All things glorify Him, but people do not understand. How many servants remember Him at eventide and at dawn, yet remain heedless of His beauty, turning towards various directions out of longing for Him and seeking His good-pleasure, while turning away from His presence. They spend their wealth in His path, yet remain veiled from His Self.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Know your Creator, then do what ye have been commanded in the preserved Tablet of glory. Before recognition, no soul’s deeds are accepted, even should they perform all the deeds of the past and future. I testify that these creatures are worshippers of idle fancies, save those whose hands have been seized by the hands of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, and whom He hath protected through His grace. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>They who claim belief in God have opposed Him and denied His sovereignty, yet they perceive it not. They recite the verses We sent down aforetime upon ’Ali, and before him upon Muhammad the Apostle of God, and before him upon the Spirit, yet they deny Him Who sent them in truth. Thus do they act, and know not.</p>
<p>Say: Today, should anyone weep to such extent that from his eyes flow tears equal to all the seas of the heavens and earth out of fear of God, and worship God at every spot of earth for seventy thousand years, it would profit him not except after My leave and command, and after turning towards this Sanctuary wherein the Sun of thy Lord’s remembrance hath been established upon the throne of might and power. Thus hath it been sent down from the Pen of Command, yet the people remain veiled within the veils of their own selves.</p>
<p>When thou receivest God’s Tablet and His tokens, arise from thy place, then turn thy face towards the Throne and say: O my God! Praise be to Thee for having caused me to hear Thy call from the direction of Thy prison and for having remembered me after I was heedless of Thee. Send down, then, upon me from the clouds of Thy mercy that which will purify me from all except Thee and draw me near unto Thy Most Exalted Self in this Revelation which hath appeared through Thy Most Glorious Name amongst the hosts of creation. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>At that time thou shalt find thy Lord’s fragrant breezes from every direction and find thyself detached from all allusions and tokens, and thou shalt hear thy Lord’s call with thine inner ear from all things, that there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Beloved.</p>
<p>Beware lest thou be heedless of thy Lord’s Cause. Seek thy Creator’s grace, then detach thyself from those who join partners with God. When the breezes of thy Lord’s Command encompass thee from all directions and thou findest the sweet savors of the musk of inner meanings from the ink of the words of the King of Names and Attributes, arise amongst the servants to His remembrance and praise, and fear not those who act unjustly.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear your Lord, the All-Merciful, and dispute not with Him Who hath dawned from the horizon of the Cause with manifest sovereignty. O people! Fear God and deny not Him around Whom circle the proof and the evidence, Who came in the shadows of the clouds when the matter was decreed by God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Loving.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Ponder this Cause - this is greater than all great things, could ye but perceive it. Then reflect on what was revealed in the Bayan concerning Him, that ye might become aware. This is He but for Whose mention the Most Exalted Pen moved not between the fingers of the Primal Point, Who gave you glad tidings of His presence, were ye but fair-minded.</p>
<p>Read what hath been sent down from the heaven of your Lord, the All-Merciful, upon the Point of the Bayan, that ye may arise from the slumber of passion and turn towards the holy precincts, and be not of those who disbelieve. O people! He desireth naught from you, and His reward is with Him Who sent Him with the truth and caused Him to speak in praise of His Self among His servants. Be fair in His Cause and be not of those who act unjustly.</p>
<p>If thou findest one who is receptive, impart unto him what thou art commanded; otherwise, turn away from him and turn unto God, thy Lord. He, verily, shall suffice thee in truth against all that hath been created in the heavens and on earth. Nothing escapeth His knowledge, and all things are recorded with Him in a clear tablet.</p>
<p>And glory be upon thee and upon those who, when they heard God’s call, responded to it and cast behind them the allusions of every rejected opponent.</p>

<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him and that the Point of the Bayan is His servant and His Glory. This is what was revealed concerning the previous Manifestation Who was named ’Ali-before-Nabil, and those who followed the Bayan, according to their claim, bore witness to that which God had testified in this blessed, mighty and glorious verse. However, God did not accept their testimony, for they bore witness only until they reached the Servant, but when they came unto His Glory, their feet slipped and they were among the losers. Say: Today no one’s testimony will be accepted except through this Name, by which all who are in the heavens and earth were thunderstruck, save those who have detached themselves from names and their kingdom, and have tasted the sweetness of the fruits from the Lote-Tree of their Chosen Lord in this exalted and lofty Tree. Say: This is the Name whereby God distinguisheth between truth and falsehood. At its mention, the faces of the people of eternity shine forth while the faces of the idolaters are darkened. Verily, it is God’s wrath upon those who have disbelieved, and His mercy upon those who have drawn nigh.</p>
<p>Among the idolaters is one who said that a stone progresseth until it attaineth the station of ruby, and having reached this station, how could it descend from its rank? By this he seeketh to prove to himself that which his passion commandeth him, taking it as a friend and protector besides God. Say: Verily thy Lord hath power over all things. He changeth whatsoever He willeth by His word, if thou be of those who understand. Say: O thou who associateth partners with God, dost thou imagine that He is powerless over anything, or that any matter among all that hath been created between the heavens and the earths can defeat Him? Say: Hast thou not witnessed that He created all things from dust and unto it shall He return them - a promise from His presence? And verily He hath power over all things. By God the Truth! There issueth from the mouths of these people that which causeth the hearts of all created things to be consumed, yet they perceive it not and are numbered among those who sport with their own selves.</p>
<p>Say: O people! This is ’Ali Who hath come unto you with all the signs and a wise remembrance. After the Manifestation of God, doth it beseem anyone to cling to a single letter of the Book after the Mother of Tablets hath been sent down from the holy and luminous Finger? After the appearance and shining forth of the Sun, would it be fitting for anyone to ask a blind man whether it hath risen? Nay, by Him Who hath caused the tongues of all created things to speak forth in praise of His mighty and exalted Self! By God the Truth! The Primal Point in the Supreme Horizon is bewildered, and weepeth and lamenteth over that which the hands of those who claimed faith within themselves yet disbelieved in God have wrought, and were counted among the idolaters.</p>
<p>O Hasan! Wert thou to become aware of what hath befallen My Soul, thou wouldst weep for months and years. O Hasan! Be beneficent in the Cause of God, thy Lord, and grieve not over anything. Cast behind thee the kingdom of blind imitation, then speak forth in remembrance of thy Lord among the worlds. Arise to promote the Cause of God and to aid it, and pay no heed to those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God. Unite with those who seek the Countenance at eventide and at dawn, and who call upon God between the heavens and the earths. Do good unto thyself and unto those from whom thou perceivest the fragrance of the love of thy Lord, the Most Merciful. Thus do We command thee in truth, that thou mayest be among those who act.</p>
<p>Purify thy heart from allusions, and be not among the doubtful concerning this Cause, whereat all feet have slipped save those whom God hath preserved through His grace. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Say: O people! Fear God and associate not partners with Him through Whom the Dove hath warbled in the pole of eternity, and the Cock of the Throne hath crowed upon the Lote-Tree of the uttermost boundary, and the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken forth in the pavilion of supreme majesty. Fear God, O people, and be among the God-fearing.</p>
<p>Do that for which thou hast sought permission from God, thy Lord. The beauty of permission hath now shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Verily, thy Lord loveth that His handmaidens be joined in marriage to His monotheistic servants. Thus have We cast upon thee the word of truth as a bounty from Our presence, that thou mayest be among the thankful. Know thou moreover that God hath forgiven the handmaiden whom thou didst mention in thy letter. The breezes of forgiveness have wafted upon her from the direction of thy Lord, the Most Merciful. Verily, He forgiveth whom He willeth by His command, and He is indeed the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. And the radiance which hath shone forth from the right hand of eternity be upon thee and upon those with thee, and upon God’s assured servants.</p>

<p>His Holiness, the Master of the Mystics, His Holiness the Noble One, upon him be 669 [Baha’u’llah], the King, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Beautiful, may He regard with His blessed glance.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Grandeur</p>
<p>I have drunk from the Kawthar of Life from cups passed round by the attraction of utterance. Blessed is he who gave me to drink! It was as though these cups were circling round the love of God, and in their nature was the nature of iron. When I saw them soaring in the atmosphere of remembrance and utterance without any intention of their own, it was as if they were drawn by the magnet of our Lord’s will, the Bestower, the Generous. Were we to expound to your holiness what this evanescent servant drank from each of these cups, this page and others would not suffice, for they spoke of the love of our Glorious and Most Glorious Lord, pointed to the Dawning Place of Manifestation and Names, and bore the water of recognition of the Lord of all worlds. Exalted is our Eternal Lord Who made it sanctified above allusions and above what is mentioned in creation of natures and elements. Blessed is he who honored me with these cups and gave me to drink from them what delighted my thoughts and brought joy to my heart and soul. We beseech God to make the cupbearer of these cups the magnet of utterance in the contingent world, that the hearts of the followers of religions might be drawn to it. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Helper.</p>
<p>May my spirit be a sacrifice for your attraction! The blessed letter of your holiness was a delight to eyes and heart, and from the cups of remembrance inscribed therein was drunk the wine of love, fellowship, mercy and unity. How excellent is the bestower and the giver! In truth, the sweet fragrance of divine love was wafting from all its letters and words, refreshing heart and soul. After its perusal, on the blessed night of the eleventh of the month of Pilgrimage, it was presented in its entirety in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. This is what was revealed in reply:</p>
<p>O Nabil! Blessed art thou for having turned to the One to Whom the world hath turned. This is indeed a manifest bounty. We have heard what befell thee and what thou didst speak when thou didst encounter the letter Ha of the abyss in the land of Qaf with the proof of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. By My life! We desired thee as thou didst desire Us, and We desire thee as thou dost desire, and We love thy presence in the precincts of the Throne and thy nearness to the courtyard of this exalted Gate. Grieve not over anything that hath befallen thee. Verily, thou art with Us and thy affairs return unto Us. He verily improveth through His sovereignty what He willeth, the sovereignty that prevaileth over the worlds.</p>
<p>That which hath befallen your honor hath been mentioned before the Throne. The heedless souls have acted and will continue to act according to their own inclinations. Your honor should not be grieved by any matter. And concerning what you wrote about proceeding to the land of Ha, this too is most beloved and acceptable, for it behooveth one such as your honor to arise with utmost power and might to serve the Cause. The foundation of all matters has been and shall ever be the teaching of the Cause. In any case, proceed in whatever way you deem advisable. You are permitted in all circumstances to proceed to the Most Holy Court and other lands. The reason We have not summoned you now is due to the cold weather. And God speaketh the truth and guideth to the Way.</p>
<p>May I be thy sacrifice! Regarding what you wrote about the Tablets arriving in the company of the beloved one, His Holiness the Name of God, upon him be the Most Glorious of all Glory, and likewise Mulla Muhammad-’Ali - other Tablets have also been revealed specifically for your honor which have not yet arrived, including one great Tablet in the revealed script and numerous exalted Tablets sent in the company of His Holiness the Trustee, upon him be the Glory of God, the True King, the Manifest. And another Tablet as well. Praise be to God, your honor has always been and will continue to be mentioned before the Throne. Furthermore, be not grieved in any way about those left behind. News about your beloved one will be sent from the direction of Ha. God willing, all have been and will continue to be under the protection and shelter of the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted. The Most Mighty Branch and the Greater Branch - may my spirit be sacrificed for the dust of their most pure footsteps - especially convey magnificent, exalted greetings to that beloved one. Likewise, those who circle round the Throne are all engaged in remembering your honor and are occupied in expressing pure sincerity. We praise God for this mighty bounty. May the Most Glorious Glory, the Most Splendid Light, and the Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of grandeur be upon your honor and upon those who love you.</p>

<p>The Book of the All-Merciful speaketh amidst all religions and summoneth the peoples unto their Lord, the All-Merciful. Blessed is the heart that hath turned unto Him and the countenance that hath been directed towards Him, and woe unto him who hath denied and turned away when he heard the Call from the Supreme Horizon. Thus hath the Pen spoken when the Lord of Eternity was in this noble station.</p>
<p>Carmel hath smiled at the appearance of God, and Zion hath cried out: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of all worlds!” This is the Day wherein the City of God hath descended from the heaven of His command, yet most of the people are in manifest obscurity.</p>
<p>Say: O Concourse of the Spirit! He Who was promised hath come, and He Who was hidden hath appeared, and he who was silent hath spoken, through the grace of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. O Concourse of the Spirit! He speaketh among you, yet ye hear not, and He walketh before your faces, yet ye know not. Your eyes have been dazed and your ears prevented. Fear ye God and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who was promised in the Books and mentioned in the hearts and minds.</p>
<p>O Concourse of the Spirit! He hath come from heaven as He ascended unto it the first time. Hasten unto Him and be not of the heedless.</p>
<p>O thou who hast emigrated unto God! Hear My call from this luminous Spot. He remembereth thee and commandeth thee to that which attracteth the hearts of them who are nigh unto God. Say: O Land of ?a! Thou hast come from the direction of grandeur and glory with the tidings of God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Praiseworthy. The fragrance of the All-Merciful hath been wafted throughout all contingent being. Draw nigh with illumined hearts and be not of them that hesitate.</p>
<p>Thou art he whom God hath made the Dawning-Place of His Revelation, the Dayspring of His signs, the Mine of His wisdom and the Treasury of the pearls of His wondrous utterance. Blessed art thou, and blessed is he that dwelleth in thee, and joy be unto thee and unto him who hath attained thy presence and established for himself a seat within thee. We beseech God to illumine all through the light of recognition and draw them nigh unto His sacred and luminous Presence.</p>
<p>O Baqir! Hear My call. Verily it hath been raised from a station whereunto cannot attain the mention of the mystics, nor the praise of the chosen ones, nor the clamor of the seekers. Remind in My name the Hands of My Cause there and give them glad-tidings of My acceptance of them. Say: Grieve not for that which hath befallen you from those at whose tyranny the dwellers of the highest Paradise and the Manifestations of the most exalted Heaven have lamented. God shall soon exalt those who have believed and abase every heedless remote one.</p>
<p>We send Our greetings unto you, O My loved ones, and Our salutations unto you, O My chosen ones. We have remembered you before and at this time with a remembrance whereby the Holy Spirit hath been attracted. Pass like the spring breezes over the lands that their countenances may smile and they may perceive from thee the fragrance of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>When thou arrivest in the Land of ?ad, visit My loved ones and chosen ones who were not prevented by the riches of the world from holding fast unto the Most Great Name. They have cast aside all else but God with a might that hath amazed the Concourse on High. These are the people of Baha whose appearance, arising and advancement in the service of His mighty and exalted Cause God hath promised His servants.</p>

Where are God’s trusts within thee, and where are thy light and thy radiance, and where are those through whom the gate of heaven was opened and that which was in God’s knowledge, the Lord of the exalted Throne, was made manifest?</p>
<p>And when thou arrivest in the Land of Nun and Jim, give them glad-tidings from the Wronged One, then recite unto them what hath been sent down from the heaven of the bounty of thy Lord, the Speaking, the All-Knowing. Say: O loved ones of God and His party! The realities of all things have lamented due to your grief, to this testifieth the Lord of all beings in this exalted station. By God! There hath been ordained for you that which no eye hath seen the like thereof, to this doth testify the Book of God, the Mighty, the Wondrous. We bear witness that ye have attained unto acceptance when most men turned away, and ye have drunk the choice wine of immortality from the hand of the bounty of your Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous, and ye have heard that which ears were prevented from hearing, and ye have seen that which eyes have not seen, to this testifieth He Who calleth with the most exalted call between earth and heaven: “Verily there is no God but Me, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty.”</p>
<p>We bear witness at the end of the Book that thou hast attained unto that which was recorded in God’s Books and treasured in the hearts of His Messengers.

<p>O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! When thou hearest My call from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance, say: My God, my God! My very being beareth witness to Thy unity and that Thou art God; there is none other God but Thee. Nothing is like unto Thee. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy sovereignty and ordainest what Thou desirest through Thy command. The veils of the heedless ones, the glory of the oppressors, and the clamor of those who have disbelieved in Thee and Thy signs cannot hinder Thee.</p>

I beseech Thee by Thy power which hath encompassed all created things, and by Thy sovereignty which hath surrounded all existence, to protect them with the hosts of the unseen and the visible, and to guard them with the manifestations of might and power.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Glory be unto Thee, O my Beloved! Glory be unto Thee, O my Worshipped One! I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge, by the splendors of the Day-Star of Thy wisdom, and by Thy Name through which Thou hast guided the servants to the shore of Thy Most Great Ocean and illumined their hearts with the lights of Thy countenance, O Lord of eternity, to ordain for me that which shall adorn me with the raiment of godliness among all people and crown me with the diadem of detachment throughout creation, that I may be worthy to arise among Thy servants and be fitted to mention and praise Thee in Thy land.</p>
<p>By Thy glory, O Beloved of hearts and Sovereign of existence! My tears shall not be stilled save by entering Thy most great prospect and arriving at Thy most holy, mighty, and luminous station. My heart shall not find peace save by hearkening to Thy call before Thy face and beholding Thy horizon before Thy throne.</p>
<p>Thou seest, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, that the supplicant hath hastened to the gate of Thy bounty, and the seeker hath aimed at the heaven of Thy generosity and mercy. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him of what lieth with Thee and what Thou hast ordained for those near unto Thee among Thy servants and the sincere ones among Thy creation.</p>
<p>I know not, O my God, by what remembrance to remember Thee or by what praise to praise Thee. Whenever my mention increaseth, my grief increaseth. By Thy glory, O my Beloved! From my utterances flow my tears, and from the traces of my pen come my sorrow, anguish and pain. I find no joy for myself save in circumambulating Thy Sacred House, nor any happiness save in being present before Thy face and arising to serve Thy loved ones.</p>
<p>If Thy destined decree preventeth me from Thy sealed wine, ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen the reward of those who hastened unto Thee by Thy leave, who circled round Thy Cause, who stood before the gate of Thy grandeur, who heard the call from the tongue of Thy wisdom, and who drank the choice wine of revelation before Thy throne.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O my God! Alas, alas, O my Beloved! Alas, alas, O my Worshipped One! For what hath befallen Thee at the hands of the oppressors among Thy creation and the rebellious among Thy servants. Would that I had been prevented from hearing and seeing, that I might not have heard of Thy grief and tribulation, nor witnessed Thy imprisonment and ordeal!</p>
<p>Thou didst create Thy servants to know Thee in Thy days and to arise to serve Thee amidst Thy creation, yet they denied Thee and Thy signs, drew their swords of hatred against Thee, and there befell Thee from them that which the Most Exalted Pen is powerless to recount. O my God! Thou didst desire for them the greatest glory, yet they desired for Thee the greatest abasement. Thou didst call them to the cushions of nearness and the luminous pillows, yet they desired for Thee the dark pit and the lowest station.</p>
<p>O Lord! Aid Thy servants to be fair in Thy Cause and just concerning that which hath appeared from Thee. Thou art the Generous, possessed of great bounty. The oppression of Thy creation cannot withhold Thy generosity, nor can the desires of Thy servants prevent Thy will. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O Lord! Forgive me and those with me, those who have held fast to Thy firm handles and clung to the hem of Thy luminous robe. Then draw the hearts of Thy creation to the horizon of the heaven of Thy manifestation. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Ever-Flowing, the Most Generous, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>

He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty. There is none other God but He, the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens.</p>
<p>The pearls and jewels of the world have no luster compared to these precious pearls which have appeared from the Treasury of the Pen of Knowledge of the Lord. Praise be to God! They have attracted hearts and souls and drawn them to the highest horizon. The fragrance of everything is its identifier; it showeth the way and giveth tidings, especially tidings that are mingled with the light of love and mixed with the musk of affection. Its diffusions are straight paths. From it floweth that which is the polish of spirits and bodies. It bringeth bodies to the station of spirits, and draweth spirits to a station that transcendeth mention and utterance. Well is it with them that behold, and well is it with them that hear!</p>
<p>The petition of that beloved of the heart hath in truth produced a mighty effect, and evident fruits have appeared therefrom. The passage of time shall not alter these fruits, nor change their freshness. All this is from the grace of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the heavens and earths. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to unite us with you and ordain for us that which will aid us in acting according to what He hath revealed in His perspicuous Book. We beseech Him by the Sovereign of Names, by Whom the valley was made to flow, to make us in all conditions turned toward Him, holding fast unto Him, and clinging to His luminous hem. Verily, He is All-Knowing and All-Seeing of His servants.</p>
<p>I mention the loved ones of that land from the depths of my heart, and I beseech God, glorified be His majesty, to adorn all with deeds whose light may shine forth in the world and encompass it. This is not difficult for our Lord. Peace, remembrance, and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>

<p>O son of Ashraf! Upon thee be the glory of God, His grace, His bounty and His radiance! There hath come upon Us from the oppressors that which hath caused My heart to cry out, My Pen to lament, and the eye of My loving-kindness to weep when We beheld the sheep of God amidst the wolves of the earth and the She-Camel of God in the hands of the oppressors. Verily, the oppressor hath issued a decree to slay My She-Camel and sink My Ark. Therefore hath the Herald cried out from the right hand of the Throne of My majesty: “O the pity of it! The servants have broken God’s Covenant and His Testament, violated the sanctity of His Cause, slain His chosen ones and His loved ones, and plundered their possessions with manifest tyranny!”</p>
<p>O Husayn! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Hearken unto the Call from the direction of ’Akka. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Blessed is thy father, and blessed is he who loveth him, and who standeth before his resting-place and remembereth him with what hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen at this manifest time.</p>
<p>Glory and remembrance and praise be upon thee, O Ashraf! I testify that thou didst witness the waves of the ocean of thy Lord’s utterance and the effulgences of the Day-Star of His Cause, and thou didst attain unto that which most of mankind hath failed to attain. Thou art he who turned towards God in the earliest days when the Call was raised between earth and heaven, in such wise that neither the happenings of the world nor the clamor of the ignorant could deter thee. Throughout thy days thou didst speak in praise of thy Lord, didst hold fast unto the cord of His grace, didst arise to serve Him, and didst guide His servants. Blessed art thou, and joy be unto thee, and unto him who remembereth thee and loveth thee and presenteth himself before thy grave and calleth to mind thy days and what befell thee from the dawning-places of oppression and the day-springs of tyranny. Thou art he whom the might of the people did not weaken, nor did the hosts and ranks frighten. Thou didst acknowledge God and His signs, and didst attain His good-pleasure in His days. I testify that through thy ascension the ocean of forgiveness surged and the fragrance of the mercy of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, was diffused. The hands of grace and favor have caused thee to enter the Most Exalted Paradise, the description of which the pens are powerless to set forth and the tongues unable to express.</p>
<p>We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon thee, at all times, mercy from His presence and light from His nearness and loving-kindness from His side. Verily, He is the Forgiver, the Bountiful. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>And for him who presenteth himself before the tomb, it behooveth him to say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! I beseech Thee by this martyr who gave up his spirit in Thy path and deposited his body in Thy love between the hands of Thine enemies, and who denied not Thy Manifestation and Thy Revelation and Thy Cause that hath encompassed Thy earth and Thy heaven, to forgive me and my father and my mother and my kinsmen. Then ordain for me the good of the world to come and of this world. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all men, the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below. There is no God but Thee, the Ancient Commander.”</p>
<p>O Husayn! I hope that thou wilt walk in the footsteps of thy father and appear amongst the servants in utmost sanctity and detachment. In truth I say, pure deeds and praiseworthy character have been and continue to be the helpers of God’s Cause in this Most Great Revelation. Blessed is he who renounceth his desires and holdeth fast unto the fear of God. He is assuredly among those who are nigh unto God in My perspicuous Book. All the souls mentioned in thy letter have attained unto divine favors, and mention of each one hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur. We have remembered them before and do remember them at this time, and We give them the glad-tidings of God’s bounty, His bestowal, His mercy and His favor. Verily, He is the Manifest, the All-Knowing. At this moment the ocean of Mine utterance hath surged and the fragrance of My remembrance hath been diffused. Blessed are they and joy be unto them. We beseech God to aid them and assist them to serve the Cause, and to ordain for them the good of this world and of the world to come. Verily, He is the Generous, the Lord of great bounty. Convey My greetings to each of the relatives of the martyred departed one who have attained to recognition, and give them the glad-tidings of the favors of God, exalted be His glory. Likewise, make mention of the believing handmaidens on behalf of the Wronged One. We beseech God to ordain for them that which He hath ordained for His devoted handmaidens. Verily, He is the Most Powerful of the powerful ones and the Most Merciful of the merciful ones. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who have quaffed the wine of steadfastness from the hands of My bounty, and upon every steadfast and firm one, and every faithful and trusted one.</p>

<p>O Name of Bounty! Upon thee be my Baha!</p>
<p>The letters of Samandar - upon him be my Baha - which he sent to thee were perused. Praise be to God, they are adorned with the light of recognition and are aflame with the fire of love. Through the tracing of the Most Exalted Pen they have found and attained unto the fruits of the Lote-Tree of the uttermost boundary. And that which was written concerning Aqa Mirza Husayn was observed and became the cause of joy and gladness. Verily We make mention of him through Our bounty, remind him through Our verses, and give him the glad-tidings of Our mercy. We beseech God to assist him in that which will profit him in all the worlds of His worlds. Verily He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>At all times We beseech the Goal of all existence to aid His people to attain unto chastity, virtue, trustworthiness and godliness. O Samandar! Time and again hath this exalted Word flowed from the Most Exalted Pen: We have said and continue to say that the hosts which today assist the Truth have ever been and shall ever be goodly character and deeds that are well-pleasing. The comfort, glory and wealth of the people of God have been and shall be under the shadow of the banner of these hosts, and the commander, leader and sovereign of these hosts is the fear of God. Repeatedly have these sublime words dawned and shone forth from the horizon of the mouth of the Will of the Manifestation of clear signs. By the life of God! Each word thereof is a rising sun and a manifest light. Blessed is he who hath recognized and attained.</p>
<p>Husayn and Kazim - upon them be the glory of God - have been and are mentioned in the Most Holy Court. Beseech ye God that He may aid all the friends to achieve that which will cause the exaltation of the Word of God. We make mention of the people of God in that land and in the Land of ?a and other countries, and We counsel them with that which will lead to their elevation and ascendancy. Today the deeds of the friends of the Self-Sufficing, the Exalted, distinguish them from the people of the earth. O My loved ones! Hold fast unto sanctity and detachment. Your deeds must be so holy and pure that they will be even as the sun amidst the works of creation.</p>
<p>O Samandar! Today is the day of unity and concord, and the day of pure deeds. Beseech God that He may assist His loved ones and sanctify them from whatsoever causeth hesitation and perturbation. A pure deed is itself a herald - its fragrance guideth men to the most exalted horizon and directeth them thither. The Trustee - upon him be God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds - hath arrived. He repeatedly made mention in the Most Holy Court of the friends in the lands of Ya, Kaf and ?a and other regions, and all have been honored with the mention and loving-kindness of Him Who is the Ever-Living. He likewise made mention of that land and of thee and of Javad - upon him be my Baha. He also detailed the feasts of you all, and of Javad, and Nuru’llah, and the service of Ru?u’llah and others. He repeatedly presented the service and endeavors of each of the friends. Praise be to God that the saplings of the divine garden have yielded fruit; their signs and fruits have become manifest and evident.</p>
<p>O Samandar! Convey My greetings to Yahya and give him the glad-tidings of the effulgences of the Sun of Truth. That which hath befallen him in the path of God is clear and evident before the Wronged One. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to strengthen him and assist him with steadfastness from His presence, to draw him nigh unto Him, and to send down upon him from the heaven of His grace mercy and loving-kindness. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>We make mention of the friends in that land and We beseech for each one that which will cause enkindlement, attraction and attention. Convey greetings to the handmaidens of God and give them the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness. We conclude Our words with the mention of Khalil - upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness - and those who are with him. Their letters have been honored with hearing. O Khalil! Upon thee be My Baha and My loving-kindness. We have heard thy call time and again, and We have answered thee with that which none can reckon save God, the Lord of all worlds. Remember thou the days when thou wert beneath the canopies of thy Lord’s grandeur, when in the morning the breath of loving-kindness wafted over thee, and in the evening the fragrances of revelation were diffused before thy face, and at dawn the gentle breeze of God, the Kind, the Gracious. Blessed are the days when thou didst stand at the door, hearing His verses, beholding His horizon, and speaking His beauteous praise. The Glory be upon thee, and upon thy nephew, and upon those who are with thee among thy kindred, and upon all who are steadfast and firm.</p>

<p>O Jalil! Upon thee be My glory! Today, which is the third day of the Feast of Ramadan, the Most Great Branch attained the presence and visitation on thy behalf. We beseech God to make this deed a treasure for thee with Him. Verily, He is the Trusted One, the All-Knowing. Each of the mentioned loved ones hath been remembered by the Most Exalted Pen. They have indeed attained unto the choice wine of My utterance, the Kawthar of My remembrance, the Salsabil of My favors, and the ocean of My bounty, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Convey to each one the greetings from the tongue of the Wronged One. Say: O My loved ones! This is the Day of remembrance and praise, would that ye might know, and the Day of steadfastness and faithfulness, would that ye might understand. Your names were presented before the Wronged One, and We have revealed for you that which hath perfumed the world of being with the fragrance of the utterance of the All-Merciful. Blessed are ye and blessed is he who hath drunk My choice wine, sealed with My Name, the Self-Subsisting. We beseech God to aid you with the hosts of utterance and draw you nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>We have desired to make mention of him who was named ’Abdu’llah, that he may rejoice and be of those who are thankful. O ’Abdu’llah! Shatter the idols of the people’s vain imaginings with the arm of certitude, by the command of God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee, make thee successful, and exalt thee in this Cause, that thy name may be inscribed in His Book, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Hear the call from the direction of God, the Lord of the worlds. He hath appeared and manifested what He desired as a grace from Him, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. We counsel thee and those who have believed in that which will exalt the Cause of God amongst His servants. Blessed is he who hath heard and responded, and woe unto the deniers.</p>
<p>O Ghaffar! The All-Forgiving remembers thee in this perspicuous Tablet. Say: My God, my God! I testify that Thou hast manifested Thyself and sent down Thy Book and revealed Thy clear tokens and called the multitudes, without any veil, to the Dayspring of Thy mighty signs and the Manifestation of Thy most beautiful names. I beseech Thee to assist me in Thy remembrance and Thy service. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Rida! Hear the call of the Wronged One from the direction of His Name, the Self-Subsisting, on this Day wherein that which was hidden in knowledge and inscribed in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, hath appeared. Take hold of the Book of God with such strength that the might of the oppressors shall not deter thee.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Husayn! The Wronged One makes mention of thee and calls thee, that He may draw thee nigh unto the One, the All-Informed. Cast aside vain imaginings, in defiance of every ignorant remote one. Say: The Day hath come, yet the people are in thick veils. They hear, yet deny. Indeed, they are among the most lost in the Book of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-’Ali! The promise hath been fulfilled and the Promised One hath descended from the heaven of bounty and revealed that which was concealed from sight. Beware lest the veil of the divines prevent thee from God, the Lord of all beings. Say: O concourse of men! Be fair in your judgment, by God, concerning that which hath truthfully appeared. He created you for His days. Turn with radiant faces toward the supreme horizon, the station wherein the tongue of utterance proclaims: “God, there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Bountiful.” Blessed is he who hath heard and turned toward Him, and woe unto every denying infidel.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-’Ali! The ocean of utterance hath surged, and the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath wafted, and the mysteries have been revealed, and the rivers have flowed, yet most of the people are in doubt and discord. They have denied God’s proof and His evidence, and have rejected His favor. Indeed, they are among the people of error. Blessed art thou for having turned toward Him, and woe unto every turning and deceitful one. Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee and revealed that which was treasured in God’s knowledge, the Lord of lords.</p>
<p>O Jabbar! The All-Compelling hath heard thy call and hath answered thee with decisive utterance. The Hour hath appeared with its signs, and the Light hath shone forth from the horizon of power. Blessed is he who hath fulfilled his covenant and hath not broken God’s testament when He came with power and sovereignty.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Read what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.” The Hidden hath been manifested and hath revealed what He desired as a mercy from Him, yet most of the people are among the turning ones. Say: Fear God and follow not every remote oppressor. Cast aside the books of the people and take hold of the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>We make mention of the handmaidens of God in that place and beseech God to ordain for them what He hath ordained for the devoted ones. Verily, He hath power over all things. The glory from Us be upon you, O concourse of loved ones, and upon every one steadfast in the Cause and every one firm and upright.</p>

<p>O Pen! Turn thy face towards him who hath been named ‘Believer’, then make mention of him in such wise that the fragrance thereof shall never be cut off throughout the duration of the Kingdom and the Realm. He Who was hidden hath appeared, and He Who was concealed from sight and eyes hath come. Blessed is the soul that hath heard the Call and turned towards the Supreme Horizon, and woe unto every heedless and veiled one. This is the Day whereon the Herald hath called out from every direction: “Fear ye God, O people, and follow not every forbidden idolator.” This is the Day that hath gladdened the eyes of the Concourse on High, and all things have proclaimed: “The Truth hath come with manifest sovereignty.” Say: O people! Nothing shall profit you this Day, neither any matter save through this irrevocable Cause. Turn with radiant faces unto God, the Lord of Names, then aid Him with the hosts of goodly deeds and conduct, as commanded by the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen raised its shrill voice, as a bounty from God, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>O [name]! Upon thee be My Glory! Thou hast been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One, and there hath been revealed that which hath no peer or likeness. Say: My God, my God! I testify to Thy greatness and bounty and glory and splendor. Thou art that Sovereign Whom the clamor of the people of the realm of possibilities did not prevent from unity, and the conditions of the daysprings of conjecture and idle fancy did not hold back from Thy will. The power of the world did not weaken Thee, and the unbelief of nations did not prevent Thee from the mention of Thy oneness. The opposition of servants did not conceal Thy bounty, and the discord of the people of dissension did not prevent Thee from shining forth. O Generous One! All bear witness to Thy generosity. Deprive not Thy poor ones from the ocean of Thy wealth, and forbid not the needy from the Kingdom of Thy riches. Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Mahdi Sadiq, that the attraction of the breaths of remembrance may seize him and draw him nigh unto a station wherein naught is heard save the mention of God and His praise, and wherein naught is seen save the manifestations of the lights of the Luminary of His Cause, the Mighty, the Wondrous. This is a Book that speaketh the truth and summoneth all unto God, the Lord of the worlds. They who have turned away this Day from God and His sovereignty are in manifest error. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist His servants unto that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to ordain for them that which will draw them nigh unto Him at all times.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! The weak one hath clung to the cord of Thy strength, and the abased one hath held fast to the hem of the robe of Thy might, and the poor one hath stood before the door of Thy bounty, and the heedless one before the ocean of Thy knowledge and the heaven of Thy wisdom. I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which will gladden my heart and solace mine eyes. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, both male and female. Remember them on My behalf and gladden them with My verses and illumine them with the light of My mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. We seal the Book with the two names who were named Nabil before B and Mahdi, and We beseech God to assist them through His power and sovereignty and to teach them that which beseemeth His days, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Repeatedly have they been mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen. Some time ago when the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed specifically for them and sent, and they attained unto its perusal - such bounty hath encompassed them.</p>
<p>The grace has encompassed and mercy has taken precedence. The Supreme Pen has been moved in nights and days towards the friends and has been directed heavenward. All must be illumined by the light of certitude and attain unto the most great steadfastness. From the time of the dawning of the Day-Star of the horizons from the horizon of Iraq until now, all have been informed. In one of the Tablets, this exalted word was revealed: “In all cities and regions the cawing of the ravens shall be raised. Blessed is he who, steadfast, has cast behind him all else, holding fast to the cord of God, the Firm, the Strong.” The pretenders to the Cause and the liars of the world have appeared and will appear to such an extent that in all cities and villages the cawing of ravens will be raised. Thus has spoken the tongue of the All-Knowing in this Clear Tablet. Perhaps in Akka too the cawing of a raven has been raised. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist you to achieve the most great steadfastness and to protect you from the calumnies of the godless ones and the slanderers. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

The blessed handwriting of His exalted station has directed this evanescent one to undertake reconstruction of what is in ruins and to bestow the bounty of spring upon the world. After it was read and understood, it was presented before His presence, whereupon He said that whatever had been mentioned should be answered, that it may reach him who was intended.

<p>As to the letter of the honored beloved, his eminence Nabil-Ibn-Nabil, upon him be the peace and bounty of God - it was read and presented. Praise be to God, he has been blessed with special favors. God the All-Knowing is witness that this servant remembers him at special times and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to grant and ordain that which will cause his station to be elevated, exalted and uplifted. Verily, He has power over all things.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about Haji Muhammad Ibrahim, upon him be the peace of God, and his petition - it was presented, whereupon He said: “We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect and guard him with the hosts of the invisible and the visible realms, and to ordain for him that which will benefit him in this world and the next. Verily, He has power over all things.”</p>
<p>The possessions of those who trust in God and are sincere have been and always will be under the protection and guardianship of God, exalted be His glory. He said: “O Nabil-Ibn-Nabil, upon you be My peace. There are two kinds of possessions: One comprises the pearls of divine love, praiseworthy character, and pleasing attributes, which have always been and will remain preserved, for the hand of the thief and traitor falls short in this station. In previous years, there was a sum in the keeping of a trustee, and a thief stole it. We wrote: We beseech God to assist you in acquiring that which thieves and traitors cannot lay hands upon. The other kind of possessions thieves may plunder if they gain access to them, but whatever belongs to the people of truth will surely be compensated and bestowed upon them ere long.”</p>
<p>O Nabil-Ibn-Nabil! We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect you and preserve whatever is associated with you, and to ordain for you the best of what He has revealed in His Ancient Book, whereby He distinguished between truth and falsehood and made those who believe in His unity to be among those who are brought near. Blessed is he who has acknowledged the unity and oneness of God and acted according to what the All-Merciful has revealed in the Furqan.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about partnership and commerce, the details were presented, whereupon He said: “God willing, it is blessed. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to send down upon you a blessing from His presence and to ordain for you and your children every good thing that was in His Book.”</p>
<p>As for the onion and white poplar cutting that were mentioned and sent, God willing, from the former may colorful flowers appear, and from the latter, refined, wondrous, and sublime shadows, for it exists in the shade. God willing, shade too shall be bestowed upon it, that the friends of God may rest in its shadow and be appropriately gladdened, attaining to the greatest joy, which is the station of nearness to God, exalted be His glory, and may hearken to the divine glorification and sanctification in its rustling.</p>
<p>This evanescent one conveys greetings to him, upon him be the peace of the All-Merciful. He has always been and continues to be remembered by this evanescent one. God is witness to these words and this petition. I extend greetings to him and to his blessed offspring, namely his honor Ahmad, upon him be God’s bounty and grace, and I beseech God for favor and mercy. Regarding what was written that “Ahmad stands firm” - this firmness is evidence of steadfastness, that through him every seated one may arise to serve God and obey Him, and every weary one to His remembrance and praise.</p>
<p>Mention was made of his honor Aqa Ghulam-Husayn, upon him be the peace of God. Praise be to God, he has been and continues to be remembered.

<p>Praise be to God Who hath revealed Himself unto all things through His Name that was sanctified from all words and names. He, verily, is the Most Great Trump, when it was blown amidst the nations, all hearts and souls were shaken, save whom God, the Creator of heaven, did will. He, verily, is the Greatest Sign unto all creation and the Ark of God in the kingdom of creation. Whoso holdeth fast unto it hath attained salvation, and whoso turneth away from it is of them who have disbelieved and transgressed and been deprived of that which was created for them in the hereafter and in this world. Praise be to God Who hath aided whom He willeth unto the Most Sublime Horizon, and brought him nigh unto the Ultimate End, and given him to drink of the Kawthar of immortality from the hand of bounty. He, verily, is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth. Neither the hosts of the world nor the might of nations can prevent Him. He is the One to Whose sovereignty every possessor of knowledge hath testified, and to Whose grandeur and majesty every possessor of power hath submitted, and before Whose loftiness and glory every possessor of greatness hath bowed down, and every possessor of exaltation before His manifestation and majesty. I testify that He hath ever been sanctified beyond all else and glorified above all others, and will continue to be as He hath ever been. There is none other God but Him, the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this evanescent servant hath received your letter from which wafted the fragrance of your love for the Lord of the worlds and the Object of them that are endued with insight, and I understood what was contained therein regarding your being set ablaze with the fire of love and affection, and your turning unto God, the Lord of creation, on the Day of the Mutual Summons. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to give you to drink, at all times, from the Kawthar of everlasting life and to make you among those on whom no fear shall come, nor shall they grieve.</p>
<p>It is submitted that Mulla Muhammad-’Ali arrived and this servant was honored with the trace of the Supreme Pen. Praise be to God that through the infinite bounties and the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of Oneness you have turned your face toward the Beloved of the worlds and the Object of all who dwell within the realm of possibility, and you have drunk from the ocean of recognition from which most people are deprived today. Through divine grace, two honors are present and evident in your person, for you are of the light and have attained unto the Light before Whose dawning radiant suns and shining moons were eclipsed. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that you may, in all divine worlds, circle round the Sun of Truth and attain unto His service. He, verily, is the Hearing, the Answering.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about conveying expressions of sincerity on your behalf to the service of the Branches of the Divine Lote-Tree - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of their feet - this was done according to your request, and countless favors and bounties were manifested by each one toward you. Well is it with you! And concerning what you wrote about Mashhadi ?adiq, that he had become sanctified from delusion and turned toward the known Sovereign - I beseech God to keep him steadfast in this most exalted and sublime station. Previously, a Tablet was specifically revealed for him from the heaven of grace, along with some other Tablets, which were sent. God willing, may all attain unto the utterance of the All-Merciful and become enkindled with the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree - an enkindlement that the doubts and imaginings of the people of uncertainty and suspicion shall be powerless to extinguish. Blessed is he who is assured of God’s Manifestation and of meeting Him in His days. As for those who doubt, they are the losers, they are the ruined, they are the polytheists.</p>
<p>Another submission is that whatever was sent with Mulla Muhammad-’Ali has arrived, and previously it was written to Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin - upon him be the glory of God - to begin transcribing the verses of God, and likewise some here were also told and are engaged in transcription. However, since no designated swift-penned scribe can be found here, if it takes somewhat longer there is no harm. The people of the pavilion of chastity have said that this servant should convey their greetings to your honored ladies. God willing, they are occupied beneath the divine shade with wondrous mention and praise.</p>
<p>The glory be upon you and upon those who are with you among the loved ones of God, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

Hearken unto the call of Ali from the Supreme Kingdom, then unto the call of Muhammad from the Divine Lote-Tree, then unto the call of the Spirit from the ultimate station, then unto the call of Moses from the Sinai of Grandeur, that verily there is no God but Him, and He Who is named Baha in the Kingdom of Names is indeed the Manifestation of God between earth and heaven, and the Most Great Word in the Concourse on High, and the Mighty Announcement in the cities of eternity, and the Preserved Tablet concealed from the eyes of the heedless.</p>
<p>O servant! Hesitate not in this Cause wherein, should anyone hesitate, he must needs deny all the Manifestations of Unity throughout all ages, and all the Dawning-Places of Divinity throughout all dispensations, and all the Daysprings of the Command from the first to the last. Cast behind thee all that thou findest among men, then soar with the wings of holiness in this atmosphere which God hath sanctified from mention of aught else, that thou mayest attain the station of sanctity and nearness and beauty, and witness the lights of thy Lord’s countenance, the Mighty, the Most High, with the vision which God hath deposited within thee, detached from the sight of all men.</p>
<p>Arise to remember God and praise Him. By God, the Truth! All that thou hast heard concerning him who warred against God hath appeared from Us for a wisdom which none knoweth save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And those who deny today the grace of God - these have not recognized him whom they have taken as their protector besides God, and whosoever maketh such a claim is a lying impostor. To this testifieth the tongue of all creation, if thou be of them that hear.</p>
<p>Beware lest thou be veiled by these from God Who created thee by a command from Him and made thee of the beneficent ones. Fear God and hesitate not in the Cause which hath appeared with manifest sovereignty. Trust in God in all matters, and take this Tablet, then enter the abode of the polytheists. Say: O people! By God, I have come to you from the Orient of the Command with God’s momentous announcement, the Mighty, the Most High, the Great. Then recite unto them God’s Tablet and chant it with the melodies of them that are detached.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Be fair unto yourselves. If ye possess that which can equal these fragrances sent forth by the Mighty, the Wondrous One, or a proof greater than what We have, then bring it forth and tarry not, O people, and be not of them that slumber. Say: Think ye that the Most Great Ocean can be prevented from its waves, or the Cloud of Grace from its rain, or the Tree of Holiness from its fruits? Nay, by the Lord of the worlds! Nothing can prevent it from what ye possess, and it speaketh the truth from the heaven of eternity in the Most Glorious melody, celebrating His Most Exalted Self, and it feareth no one even if all the peoples of the heavens and earth should oppose it.</p>
<p>Say: Verily, He hath sought help from no one and will aid the Cause of God by Himself, even as He aided it in truth when ye were beneath the veil of women and concealed your faces in fear for yourselves in those days when your feet were shaken by the might of the Cause, and ye were among the fearful ones. And He stood alone between the heavens until the pavilion of remembrance was raised at the heart of all possibility. Then came ye forth from behind the veils and opposed the Beauty of the Chosen One, and were among the opposers.</p>
<p>Say: Be fair, by God! If ye deny this Cause, by what proof was your faith in God, the Mighty, the Wise, established? Say: Do ye occupy yourselves with My mention instead of that which hath descended from My Pen aforetime, and seek to slay My Self? Woe unto you, O company of polytheists!</p>
<p>And thou, O Ahmad, say: In the Name of God and by God! Then pass over the Bridge as the clouds pass, in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing, and be not of the patient ones. Stand between earth and heaven and call out to the whole creation with this firm, mighty, and wondrous remembrance. Sanctify thyself from all allusions and compromise not in the Cause of thy Lord with those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, and be of those who have recognized God through God, then detached themselves from all the worlds.</p>
<p>Thus have We cast upon thee the Word of Truth, for My love for thee, that thou mayest remember thy Lord among His servants with the melodies of them that are attracted. The Spirit, glory and splendor be upon thee if thou hearest the call of God and art of those who have purified their vision from the veils of human limitations and turned unto the Most Great Prospect, this hallowed, illumined Station.</p>

<p>He is the One Who has power over whatsoever He willeth, Who manifesteth as He pleaseth through His command. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, from the direction of the Throne, that it may draw thee to the sacred and beauteous court and detach thee to such degree that thy body may be freed from the allusions of the concourse of creation, and thou mayest speak between earth and heaven in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Compelling.</p>
<p>Say: O people! By the True One! There hath appeared from the horizon of glory a Sun, upon which hath been inscribed by the Pen of God, the Most Exalted: “The Kingdom on that day shall be God’s, the One, the Single, the All-Powerful, the Most Glorious.” This is a sword which, were it to strike the back of Satan, would cause him and his hosts to flee to the nethermost fire. Thus hath the decree shone forth from the dayspring of glory, if ye be of them that are endowed with insight.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is He Who chooseth whatsoever He pleaseth, and naught in the heavens or earth can prevent Him from that which He hath created. He hath manifested through the power of might that which hath rent asunder the heavens of knowledge, split the veils of understanding, and caused the hearts of the righteous to tremble.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Where are the unitarians among the people of the Bayan who claimed they had known God through God? Say: The test from your Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful, hath come unto you. The Bird of Paradise singeth with sweetest melodies upon the branches of the Lote-Tree that hath been raised in the celestial garden, and its leaves proclaim: “There is none other God but I, the One with power over all things, the Mighty, the Transcendent, the All-Forgiving.”</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Purify the hearts of those who are veiled by a name among names from this Living Water, that the holy fragrances may draw them to the realm of nearness and sever them from all directions.</p>
<p>Say: O people! By the True One! The Cause of God shall not be obscure to anyone, for it is manifest above all things and shineth like the sun in the heaven of eternity. None deny it save those who have turned away from God throughout all ages. Among the people are those who acknowledge that He is the Chooser in His Cause, doing as He willeth, yet when that which contradicteth their own desires appeareth, they become agitated and perceive not. Thus hath God set veils of fire upon their hearts.</p>
<p>Say: By God, O people! All that ye have heard regarding him who warred against God hath appeared from Our presence, as every discerning one whom veils and coverings have not withheld doth testify. Place yourselves, O people, in the presence of God. If ye deny that which hath appeared and shone forth from the horizon of His Cause, by what proof do ye uphold that which ye possess? Be fair, then, O ye who are endowed with vision.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear God and dispute not with Him Who hath endured that which no one in all lands hath endured, Who hath suffered the arrows of the polytheists for twenty years, and Who hath arisen to establish the Cause with sovereignty and power. By God, O people! My heart hath melted, my liver hath been consumed, and my vitals have been torn asunder. Have mercy on Me, O company of the righteous!</p>
<p>Beware lest ye differ regarding the Cause of God. Reflect upon the proofs of God that ye possess, and upon former ages, and that which hath appeared from the realm of eternity. Then be fair, O ye who are endowed with understanding.</p>
<p>Say: If My crime be My appearance among you, by God, this was not of Mine own accord but by God’s command, the Mighty, the Compelling. O people! By God, I have stood between heaven and earth in days when souls were shaken by the onslaught of the wicked ones. By God, had any other than I arisen to champion the Cause, God would not have sent Me forth nor commissioned Me. This sufficeth you, did ye but know the mysteries.</p>
<p>Say: O people! I have sacrificed My soul in days when ye preserved yourselves behind veils. When the Cause was made manifest and the Temple of the Remembrance was established upon the throne of independence, he whom We had nurtured and taught, morning and evening, rose up against Me.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Do ye doubt God, or His power which hath encompassed all created things, or His signs which have filled the East and West of the earth? Be fair then, O company of divines!</p>
<p>Thus have We informed thee and mentioned thee, that thou mayest be apprised of the Cause and remember thy Lord in the night season and at dawn. And glory be upon thee and upon those who have rent asunder the veils of idle fancy through the name of their Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>

<p>He is the Mighty One! O Ancient Pen! Set down upon the Tablet that which God hath cast upon thee in the world of eternity, ere the letter “K” was joined unto its sister, and ere the mysteries of the Cause were revealed in preserved tablets of glory. Beware lest thou fear anyone; then detach thyself from all that hath been created between the heavens and the earth, and hold fast unto this purified and beloved hem. Say: By God, the True One! When the days of sorrow had passed and were sealed by the Day of the Festival, there appeared therein a matter which caused all who dwell in the heaven of Command and Creation to swoon, save the number that correspondeth to Our Most Glorious Name in the heaven of eternity, did ye but know.</p>
<p>Say: The Ancient Being hath appeared in truth, and the Essence of Pre-existence hath dawned from this holy, exalted, mighty and manifest horizon. Thereby hath the Beauty of the Adored One been revealed with all names and attributes, would that ye might perceive. Say: This is a Day wherein God hath transcended all Manifestations, and wherein the Holy Spirit ascendeth at every moment, would that ye might be assured.</p>
<p>Say: By God! No good thing remaineth but it hath appeared on this Day, no matter but it hath been fulfilled, no bounty but it hath been completed, no word but it hath been confirmed, no secret but it hath been revealed, no sovereignty but it hath risen, no power but it hath emerged. Thus do We cast upon you the word of truth from the Pen of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O ye dwellers of the Throne! O ye Concourse of Holiness in the Most Exalted Paradise! O ye dwellers of the precincts of intimacy in the most glorious heaven! O ye denizens of the Supreme Concourse in the pavilions of names! Hearken unto the call of God from this enkindled, blazing Fire within this lofty, upraised, blessed, unique, eternal, everlasting Tree upon this visible Mount in this blessed, transcendent Valley, that “Verily, I am God; there is none other God but Me. In truth, I have ever encompassed all worlds. I created all things in the world of the newly-created Will at a station which was sanctified and purified from all limitations and allusions to unity, in truth and by the truth.” O concourse of earth! Deprive not yourselves, nor your spirits, nor your eyes from the beauty of this unique, eternal, self-subsisting Youth. Hasten ye unto Him! This indeed is a grace from God unto all the worlds.</p>
<p>Say: By God! Flight shall profit you not on that Day from this Youth, Who hath been named the Great Announcement in the heaven of eternity, the Inscribed Mystery in the most exalted heaven, the Ancient Life in the kingdom of names, and the Ancient Light in this Paradise which hath been raised in truth above the pavilions of glory and grandeur.</p>
<p>Say: By God! At times I behold Him as the sun in the temple of holiness, and at times I witness that He surgeth within His Own Self, by His Own Self, for His Own Self, like the ocean that encompasseth all worlds. At times I behold that He hath risen like the heaven, and all created things dwell beneath His shadow, nay, beneath the shadow of His shadow, inhabited in justice. At times He appeareth with light, then radiance, then effulgence, then manifestation and gleaming that seizeth the eyes of all who are in the heavens and earth from turning to His countenance or gazing upon His beauty.</p>
<p>Thus have We revealed unto you from the mysteries of this Youth, and explained unto you less than the eye of a needle, nay, less than can be numbered, of the wondrous matters of the Command which had been preserved behind the veils of eternity by God’s protection in the holy Tablet. O concourse of earth and heaven! Deny not the grace of God and His favor, then the mercy of God and His honor, then the proof of God and His evidence. Distance not yourselves from drawing nigh unto this Garden which hath been spread in the atmosphere of this Spirit by the name of God.</p>
<p>Say: By God! We have bestowed upon all things, then upon all possibilities, from that mercy which hath encompassed all created things, that this bounty might be dispensed from this justice unto all worlds. Whoso willeth, let him hearken unto the melodies of the birds of the Throne upon this Branch which hath been raised in truth and hath encompassed all existence with an authority that was known in truth. And now We say at the end of Our utterance: All praise be to God, my Lord and the Lord of all the worlds together.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted!</p>
<p>These are the verses of God, the King, the manifest Justice, unto him who hath believed in God and His Most Great Sign on the day whereon all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck, when the hypocrites were debarred from the Kawthar of grace, and the lovers attained unto the Law of impregnable glory. Say: Blessed is he who hath attained unto that which hath flowed from the right hand of the Throne. Woe unto them that doubt, whom self and desire have withheld from turning unto God, the Most High, the Most Great. They shall drink of boiling water and be unaware thereof.</p>
<p>Say: O people! We have ordained all good in this Shadow that hath encompassed the worlds. Thus did We send it down aforetime upon ’Ali, and he delivered the messages of his Lord until he was suspended in the air in the presence of the oppressors and offered up his spirit unto God, my Lord and the Lord of all created things. And verily this is ’Ali who in truth calleth you once again unto that whereunto he called you before, and God is witness and well-informed of this. He awaiteth that which befell ’Ali aforetime, if ye be of them that know.</p>
<p>Say: He yearned to meet Me, and I verily yearn to meet him, and he is with Me now, would ye but see with clear vision. I desire to sacrifice Myself in his path, though this is but a trifle compared with His bounties that have encompassed the worlds. Say: O people! Fear ye God, then be ashamed before His Beauty, and shed not the blood of His Beloved and the Beloved of God, the Sovereign, the Almighty, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
<p>Say: The Beauty of the Unseen hath appeared through grace, and the Tongue of the Unseen speaketh the truth. Blessed be God, the Best of Manifestors. Whosoever perceiveth any difference hath indeed strayed from the paradise of divine unity and departed from the stronghold of uniqueness, and is counted among the idolaters.</p>
<p>O people! Behold ye My Beauty in His Beauty, then His signs in My signs, then His Manifestation in My Manifestation, then His dawning in My dawning, then His effulgence from this manifest horizon. Say: He hath enjoined upon you in all the Tablets to make mention of Me and to praise My Self, yet the people have denied My Self, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Exalted, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>By My life! He desired naught but what I desire, and I desire naught but what He desired. My Self beareth witness to this, and My testimony in itself sufficeth those who know, for no testimony besides Mine existeth before God’s testimony, and none denieth this save he who hath disbelieved in God and joined the company of Satan.</p>
<p>O servant! Give thanks unto God for having raised thee up and given thee life after We caused thee to die, and made thee vibrate with the breaths of My glorious and wondrous remembrance. Were all the kingdoms of the seen and the unseen in thy possession, and were thou to expend them in thy Lord’s path to attain that which thou hast attained, it would still be but little compared with the grace that hath encompassed thee from the presence of One mighty and powerful.</p>
<p>They who today stand firm in this Cause in this Manifestation are indeed more exalted than all who dwell on earth, and this is a manifest truth. Give thanks unto thy Lord, then rejoice that My Self maketh mention of thee, and be glad that My radiant and luminous Beauty praiseth thee.</p>
<p>Say: Praise be to God Who through His power hath preserved me and through truth hath guarded me from turning to any but Him, and hath delivered me from the depths of self and passion. He is verily the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Beware lest the murk of the world prevent thee from ascending to the stations of Names and Attributes. Remember thy Lord and proclaim His Cause, for this is better than all that hath been created between the heavens and earth. His victory is not achieved through disputation and conflict, but through utterance, yet most people are heedless of this, have caused corruption in the Cause, and are among the mischief-makers. Through their actions harm hath returned to the very root of the Tree, yet they remain in profound heedlessness.</p>
<p>Stand thou firm in the Cause in such wise that shouldst thou find thyself alone in God’s Cause, thy being shall not be troubled and thou shalt be among the steadfast. For thereby every base one is exalted, every mighty one is abased, and every tongue is made eloquent. Thus have We ordained the matter in preserved tablets of glory.</p>
<p>Beware lest thou be veiled by the veils of the people of the Bayan, for they cite My verses of aforetime, yet turn away from My Self and are unaware. Thus have We imparted unto thee the word of truth that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Powerful, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Generous. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon Our sincere servants.</p>

<p>O Mirza Mahdi! In the House - He is the Most Holy, the Most Pure, the Most Exalted, the Most High, the Self-Subsisting!</p>
<p>These are the verses of God, the King, the Most High, the Powerful, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Beloved. He remindeth mankind of all wherein they have transgressed against God, that perchance they may return with their souls and hearts unto the seat of holiness, the station of glorious might, and that they may recognize their Lord and witness this exalted and inaccessible bounty.</p>
<p>Hearken, O people, unto the call of God from this Blessed Branch which hath been planted in the Garden of Eternity by the hand of God, the Sovereign, the Prevailing, the Manifest, the Hidden, the Witnessed - that there is none other God but I, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. I have created all possibilities through My generosity, and all existence through My grace, and I am the Almighty over whatsoever I will, and I am the King, the Worshipped One.</p>
<p>I have sent unto them Messengers with the truth to convey unto them the messages of God and guide them to the hallowed and blessed court. Among the people are those who have remained heedless and turned away from the melodies of God, denied His verses and fled from His presence like frightened wild asses fleeing from a lion - God, the Most High, the Exalted, the Gracious, the Desired One. And among them are those who have turned unto God, detached themselves from all else, and attained in nearness unto an exalted and wondrous station, and have drunk from the Kawthar of grace from the Cup-Bearer of the Spirit, and entered in the name of God into the depths of a surging ocean.</p>
<p>Thus passed the centuries and ages until time reached the days wherein the dawn of eternity broke forth and the Sun of the Ancient of Days rose without name or description, beyond every attribute described. When creation witnessed its blindness, He took for Himself a name from among names that this limited people might know Him by it, else He, exalted be He, is sanctified from being known by any name or described by any attribute. All names are but creation in His kingdom and all attributes are but signs of that which is created.</p>
<p>Therefore did He appear with the name of Ali between the heavens and the earth and said: “O people! I have come to you from the Sinai of the Spirit with the tidings of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. O people! Fear God and deny not the signs of God, the King, the Mighty, the Dreaded One.” But none heard His call and none among those on earth responded save a few numbered souls.</p>
<p>When He returned unto God, We testify that some people claimed to love Him with lying tongues that were witnessed. Say: O people! If ye believed in Him and His verses, how do ye deny these revealed and sent down verses? When ye denied these, it is proven that ye believed neither in their like, nor in God’s Book in any age, nor in His Cause in its time, nor in God’s Messengers, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>Thus do We cast upon you from the verses of the Cause and counsel you with the most excellent counsel and remind you with the most wondrous remembrance, that ye may not go astray in your days and that none may be able to cut off your path to God, and that ye may be as firmly-fixed mountains, and that no ignorant rabble may lead you astray in My absence. This is a bounty that hath been inscribed by the hands of power.</p>
<p>Spirit, light and glory be upon those who turn toward this beloved quarter, whom no hindrance of any hinderer, nor the denial of any denier, nor the turning away of any who turneth away can repel, even should they be hindered by those who claim authority for themselves and are filled with pride and vainglory. He is the Mighty One.</p>
<p>Although these are days of perplexity, to such an extent that it hath encompassed and will encompass all who are on earth, yet your honor must move with the utmost protection and wisdom, that no opposition or conflict may arise from that House and its inhabitants, for the harm thereof would return upon the Tree. Seclusion in these days is more beloved than can be imagined. Assembly and association with these people hath never yielded and will never yield any fruit for oneself or others. Commit the matter unto God, then suffice thyself with Him above all else. The actions of the people are a truthful witness, as ye have seen. After the breaking of the respect for the House, what expectation remaineth from anyone? If that door be closed, it is better in the view of this servant, for perchance another matter might arise. In any case, remaining in that place hath conditions - I know not whether they will be fulfilled or not. Until now they have not been. Therefore, remain ye most concealed; pass by these faithless people. And peace be upon him who followeth guidance.</p>

<p>The essence of praise, assuming the form of servants, calleth out in the wilderness of longing: “O God of the unseen and the seen, and Educator of existence! I beseech Thee by Thy Name that standeth over all things, and is the Ever-Living over all names, and speaketh in the heaven of beginning, and appeareth in the kingdom of creation, and shineth from the horizon of eternity, and is supreme over all who are in earth and heaven, that Thou protect Thy Afnan who have arisen to serve Thee, and have acknowledged Thy oneness, and confessed Thy singleness, and have submitted to the manifestations of Thy Cause, and have hastened to the horizon of Thy knowledge, and have turned to Thy countenance, and have cried out in the desert of Thy sovereignty: ‘Thou, verily Thou, O Lord of the worlds! Thou, verily Thou, O God of the mystics! Thou, verily Thou, O Goal of all who seek! Thou, verily Thou, O Thou by Whose Name the heavens and earths were established!’ Even as the call of Thy chosen ones hath been raised in this wilderness which hath been illumined by the sun of Thy remembrance and hath gleamed with the light of Thy countenance. Those whom Thou didst send to herald Thy Manifestation have spoken and cried out, saying: ‘Here am I, here am I, O God of the world! Here am I, here am I, O Light of eternity and Sovereign of nations!’ We praise Thee for having fulfilled what Thou didst reveal in Thy Tablets and adorned therewith the pages of Thy glory. Thou art He Who hath ever been powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing. My spirit be a sacrifice for the essence of Thy love!”</p>
<p>The autograph of his honor Aqa Siyyid Mirza - upon him be all the most glorious Glory - was received, and they had enclosed your honor’s letter within it. Its contents were submitted to the Most Holy Court. An answer hath been revealed from the heaven of divine Will to both him and you. His mighty and glorious Word:</p>
<p>“O My Afnan! Thy call hath attained to the hearing of thy Lord, and thy letter hath been honored in the Most Great Scene, this Castle which God hath made the seat of His mighty Throne. This is a place where the sea is seen on its right, and the mountain and land on its left, and before it are gardens wherein are trees bearing citrus fruits blazing like spheres of fire, and flowers like the stars of heaven. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen make mention that thou mayest be of those who rejoice. What thou didst send to My Afnan in the land of Ha hath been presented before the Face, and the servant present before the Throne hath read it. We have revealed these verses unto thee as a favor from Our presence. Rejoice thou and be of the thankful. We have mentioned thee and do mention thee in truth. Be thou assured of thy Lord’s favor. He will assist thee in that which shall profit thee in the Hereafter and in this world. There is no God but He, the Powerful, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have commanded you to observe wisdom. Blessed is he who holdeth fast unto it and acteth according to what hath been ordained by One Who is All-Knowing. O My Afnan! Grieve not over anything. He is with thee and knoweth thy condition and will send down for thee that which shall gladden thy heart. He, verily, is the True One, the Faithful. By thy life! Were the kingdom receptive, We would have manifested that which would cause kings to arise at the door like fearful, penitent servants. Convey My greetings to the Most Exalted Leaf and say: Rejoice! He is with thee under all conditions. Thy Lord, verily, is the Near, the Hearing One. Dwell thou in a house that doth not compromise your station. By My life! The people are in manifest error. Be patient until the time cometh unto thee. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen counsel thee from this exalted station. Glory be upon you and upon those who have believed, and upon those women who have believed in the Single One, the All-Informed.”</p>
<p>God willing, after perusing this you shall attain infinite joy. If today the dwelling of the Most Pure Consort - upon Her be all glory and exaltation - in the true house would cause clamor among the servants and become the cause of rancor and hatred, residence therein is not permitted, according to the wisdom which God hath revealed in the Book, until God bringeth about His appointed time. In any case, observance of wisdom is necessary and obligatory, and if in these days, due to wisdom and expediency, the residence of the Consort and Afnan in that house is not feasible, its door must remain closed and no one is permitted to dwell therein. Glory be upon you in the beginning and the end.</p>

<p>To be perused by his honored servant, Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be the Glory of his Lord.</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Mighty, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>The essence of praise and glorification befitteth the Lord of all mankind Who illumined the world through His blessed word “Verily I am God,” and though this Most Exalted Word, this Primal Pearl, and Most Great Sign stood contrary to all the opinions of the peoples of the earth, He raised it aloft through the sovereignty of His Will and planted the banner of “Verily He is I” upon the highest mountains by His mighty hand. Soon shall the sincere ones and those drawn nigh behold it above all other standards. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Thereafter, I submit that your letter, which was the greatest healing medicine, transformed into joy the sorrows that are inherent to imprisonment, for it was adorned with love for the Ancient Beauty and the Goal of all peoples. Praise be to God that you have attained the outpourings of the divine days and caught the fragrance of the celestial garment. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of the Face that even if we were to occupy ourselves with praise, thanksgiving, remembrance and glorification of the Beloved until a day whose end cannot be reckoned, it would still be insufficient - nay, non-existent and void.</p>
<p>After this servant gained admittance to the Most Holy Court and presented the entire letter, two Most Great, Most Holy Tablets were revealed from the sacred heaven - one specifically for you and another specifically for Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Hassan, upon him be the Glory of God. God willing, you will attain to their perusal. Your letter arrived in late Rabi’u’l-Avval and the response descended from the heaven of grace, though it was sent in late Rabi’u’th-Thani.</p>
<p>I further submit that you should convey utter evanescence and nothingness on behalf of this ephemeral one to all the friends who have drunk from the Kawthar of certitude and transcended the contingent world. Tell them not to let time slip away and to hold fast to the cord of unity and harmony. O my beloved! In these days, one day when this ephemeral one attained the Most Holy Court, he observed the Beloved of the world to be saddened, and in view of “they speak not until He hath spoken,” this servant remained silent, bewildered and thoughtful. Then the Ancient Beauty turned to me and said that the odors of discord among the divine loved ones had wafted and continue to waft. Although the exact blessed words are not before me, their purport was thus: I submitted that I beseech God, glorified and exalted be He, to transform this discord through the endeavors of the friends into harmony, that all may turn their gaze away from aught else but God and from that which prevents them from unity, and fix their gaze upon the horizon of unity which is in truth the cause of the exaltation of the Cause. Would that some souls might be confirmed in this great service! I beseech Him, exalted be He, and I cling to the hem of His generosity and hold fast to the cords of His grace, that He may assist His loved ones in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and whereby His Cause may be exalted in the kingdom of creation. Verily He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I submit that a petition was sent from the direction of the Land of Qaf in response to the letter of Jinab-i-J.M., upon him be all His most glorious Glory. God willing, it will reach them. If there has been any negligence, this servant begs to be excused and hopes for their pardon, now and always. The Glory be upon you and upon those who have drunk the wine of steadfastness and the Kawthar of servitude in this mighty and wondrous Day.</p>
<p>Some time ago, this servant sent a detailed letter in response to your numerous letters, together with the blessed Most Holy Tablet of Proof which was sent according to the command of the Lord of all possibility. God willing, you have attained and will attain to its perusal and reading. Likewise, mention was made of Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Abu-Turab, upon him be the Glory of God, in the Most Holy Court, and a Tablet was revealed from the heaven of grace and bounty and was sent. God willing, he will attain to it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I submit that the responses to some of the gentlemen will also be sent later, God willing. This servant presents his pure devotion and most glorious, most mighty, most splendid greetings to each one. May God, glorified and mighty be He, assist all in that which is for the good and welfare of all.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful</p>
<p>Praise be to the Desired One, Who deserveth all praise, for every day, nay every moment, He hath increased and continueth to increase the unity of His loved ones. They remained ever-speaking words of praise and thanksgiving, even as they witnessed tribulations and calamities. Such hath ever been the way of the righteous throughout all ages and centuries. Blessed is the soul that is at peace, content and well-pleasing, that hath not been held back by veils and doubts from turning unto Him, nor been prevented from drawing nigh unto Him. Glorified be His majesty, our Lord and the Lord of all who are in earth and heaven. And blessings and peace be upon the Primal Light through Whom the First Ornament was made manifest, through Whom every tongue spoke forth and every prostrate one arose, and every blind one saw, and through Whom the Sun of Knowledge dawned from the horizon of possibility, revealing what lay hidden in the treasury of the Furqan, through Whom His proof was perfected and His favor completed and His grace encompassed all, and upon His family and companions who were the dawning-places of God’s attributes and characteristics and might and glory and power.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Thy letter was received and became the cause of joy and gladness, adorning the realm of the heart with the ornament of joy and love. Praise be to God Who assisted thee and confirmed thee. He, verily, is the Illuminator, the Near One, the Holy, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>After reading it, I proceeded to the Most Exalted Station and presented it before His countenance. He said: “O ’Ali-before-Akbar! Upon thee be the peace of God, the Lord of Power. Thy letter which thou didst send to this servant attained to Our presence and hearing. Praise be to Him Who assisted thee and confirmed thee and guided thee to His straight path. Thou hast ever been and continueth to be remembered. In these days the two Branches have turned towards that region at the invitation of the Shaykh, may God assist him. Special instruction was given to send Abu-’Inayat. From the beginning his affairs, both commercial and otherwise, have been entrusted to thee. Due to lack of time to attend to the requirements of the patient regarding physician, medicine and nourishment, We have decided that he should return to ’Akka and rest there. We beseech God to adorn it with the ornament of healing and to change his illness into health. Verily, He hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Peace and glory be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon the emigrants and neighbors.” Thus endeth His words.</p>
<p>Immediately upon receipt of thy spiritual letter and learning of the difficulties, He commanded that the aforementioned one be sent to ’Akka. We beseech the Healer to deliver him from every ailment, sickness and disease. Verily, God is the Healer, the Sufficient, the All-Bountiful. The beloved of the heart, his eminence the Most Great Name, upon him be the glory and bounty of God, must, according to the command, attend to the affairs of the aforementioned one. All must strive to convey him to ’Akka. We beseech God to assist every doer of good and helper of all who show mercy, compassion and kindness. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, to Whose grace and generosity, mercy and loving-kindness, which have encompassed all existence both seen and unseen, all created things bear witness.</p>
<p>Mention that causeth joy and gladness hath ever been and shall ever be beloved before God - firstly, mention of the Sovereign of Eternity, and secondly, mention of the Hands of the Cause and His loved ones. Praise be to God that His loved ones are sustained thereby and have attained unto it. At this moment, while engaged in penning this leaf, I remembered his eminence the beloved of the heart, the Most Great Name, before the Beloved One, and rising in his stead and behalf, accomplished what was intended, attaining unto the honor of acceptance. In brief, mention of the loved ones causeth the heart to rejoice and existence to be gladdened. Happy is he who hath attained thereunto, and woe unto the heedless. The leaf and her mother and what was sent from your direction - all are remembered and adorned with the ornament of acceptance and good-pleasure. Praise be to God Who hath assisted us all and granted us victory through the hosts of His wondrous utterance.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great!</p>
<p>Praise be to the Lord of all desire, Who is worthy and deserving, for His glance of loving-kindness hath ever been and shall ever be directed towards His loved ones. He it is Whose tongue of grace hath ever proclaimed these words: “My mercy hath preceded the world and My bounty hath encompassed those who are in the heavens and on earth.” He it is Whose blessed gaze hath ever been and remaineth fixed upon goodly deeds. This servant testifieth that there is none other God but Him. He hath proven His Own Self by His Own Self. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter arrived and gave strength to the heart and joy to the soul, for it was adorned with the mention of God, glorified be His majesty. After perusing it, We turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon and presented it before His presence. He said: “O Abdullah! For successive years We summoned the people, purely for the sake of God, to the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness, and forbade them from corruption, conflict, the causes of grief and sorrow, discord and dissension. The purpose of all this was the tranquility of the world and its peoples. Thou hast witnessed and continueth to witness how each day a city among the cities of Islam falleth under the bombardment of cannons, and a faction among its factions faceth the bullets. That which hath appeared on earth hath caused the dwellers of the celestial realm to lament. Yet until now, none hath awakened or arisen to find a remedy. The heedless one moveth and journeyeth in the wilderness of negligence, led by ignorance. This is a day wherein all must, with utmost humility and supplication, seek forgiveness and pardon from the Self-Sufficing Lord, that perchance the sweet-scented breeze of divine bestowal and forgiveness may waft, and the Law of God and the Religion of the Lord may be protected from the oppression of the oppressors. What can awaken the heedless ones and rouse those who slumber? Beseech ye God that He deprive not His servants and grant them a drop from the ocean of knowledge, that the people of the earth might become aware and show mercy unto themselves.</p>
<p>We make mention at the end of this letter of thy son who attained Our presence in the prison. Remember him on My behalf. We beseech God to strengthen him, to prosper him, and to grant him the good of this world and the next. He must remain steadfast in that which he hath been commanded, and God will send down upon him from the heaven of bounty that which will gladden his heart. Verily, He is the Protector of those who turn unto Him.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God, His grace and favor are evident and manifest. The command to depart was given in view of circumstances. Some mentioned that certain ones intended to move and sought permission, while others spoke of chaos, saying that children showed no obedience whatsoever to their fathers and showed them no respect. Likewise, they mentioned matters far removed from justice, fairness, love and unity. Since no fruit was apparent from gathering in that land, and indeed there was fear of harm due to prejudices and ignorant fanaticism, therefore the command was given as they heard. If they act in accordance with that which God loveth and that which exalteth the station of man, there hath been and is no objection to remaining. This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth the True One, exalted be His glory, to strengthen the youth. How lovely it would be for the youth to be adorned with the ornament of proper conduct, character, love and unity, and to abide in peace beneath the shade of the divine Tree. However, this servant was most pleased with thy son. He was truly found to be capable and worthy. God willing, may he strive diligently to acquire perfections and likewise to learn a craft. Convey my greetings to him. I ever pray for his strengthening and success. I send greetings to the friends of that land, one and all, and I beseech God to adorn them all with the ornament of steadfastness, love and fellowship. The prayer that was offered on behalf of this evanescent servant will, God willing, be answered. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Praise be to Him, for He is the Lord of all the worlds.</p>

<p>O Andalib, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>He is the One Who speaketh before kings and subjects. We have today left one place, intending for another, and We have spoken that whereby the hearts of the people were attracted, and all things spoke even as the Tongue hath spoken, and the Dove of the Cause hath called out in the Most Exalted Paradise: “He Who was hidden hath appeared, and He Who was promised hath come! Rejoice, O peoples of the earth, and respond to Him Who hath called you to His most exalted horizon and His most glorious station, which hath been the object of circumambulation of the Concourse on High throughout ages and centuries.”</p>
<p>We passed by trees and rivers, and heard the rustling of the former in remembrance of the Lord of all beings, and the murmuring of the latter in remembrance of this Eternal Remembrance and Everlasting Light, whereby the ocean of oneness surged and the fragrance of God, the Lord of lords, was diffused. Blessed is he who hath dealt equitably in this Cause, and he who hath turned to the Dayspring of lights. This is the Day whereon the Temple of the Manifestation was established upon the throne of utterance, and spoke that whereby the sincere ones and they who are detached hastened unto God, the Revealer of verses.</p>
<p>O Andalib! Upon thee be the Glory of God and His favors. Thy letter hath come before Us. We perceived from it the fragrance of thy love, thy sincerity, thy steadfastness, thy remembrance, and thy wisdom for God and for His Face that shineth from the horizon of horizons. Say: O people! By God, He hath appeared Who was the object of the pure ones’ desire, and through Him the sun of wisdom and proof hath shone forth in the realm of possibility. Exalted is the Most Merciful Who gave glad tidings to the servants of the mention of Him Who conversed with the Sinai, through Whom existence smiled and atoms spoke: “The kingdom, the dominion, the glory and the might belong to God, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning!”</p>
<p>O Andalib! By the life of God, the deeds of those who have cast godliness behind their backs, clinging to tyranny and wickedness while attributing themselves to the Dayspring of sanctity and holiness, have grieved Me. By this the Pen of God hath lamented in the most exalted station. We have revealed in the Tablets that which draweth the servants nigh unto the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Among them are those who claimed My love and entry into the stronghold of My grace, yet committed that which caused My heart and My Pen to lament, and the eye of My inner being to weep in the nights and days.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear God and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who hath come from the heaven of Command with power and sovereignty. We have enjoined upon you the fear of God and have revealed that which draweth you nigh unto Him. Beware lest ye forsake what ye have been commanded in the Mother Book. We desire from you no recompense, and We have desired for you in the Most Exalted Paradise a station whose description pens are powerless to render. Cast away what ye possess and take what ye have been given from the Lord of all men.</p>
<p>We have, in this Revelation, forbidden the servants from conflict and corruption and that which troubleth men of understanding, and We have commanded them to conquer the citadels of hearts with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, beareth witness unto this. O My loved ones! Hold fast unto the cord of deeds and character, that there may appear from you that which shall attract the hearts of those in all lands. Know ye that the hosts of good character are the mightiest hosts in the world. Consider this, O ye who are endowed with insight! Through these shall your stations and ranks be elevated among the parties.</p>
<p>O Andalib! We have created souls for the victory of Our Cause, yet most of them have supported Mine enemies through deeds whereby the hosts of revelation and inspiration have lamented. This is what hath been sent down from My Most Exalted Pen, a command from Our presence, and I am the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Remind the people of My verses and what hath been sent down from the kingdom of My utterance, that they might take for themselves a path to the Truth.</p>
<p>Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord, my Beloved, and my Purpose! I beseech Thee by the light of Thy Cause, whereby earth and heaven were illumined, and whereby all things were stirred when they recognized it, to assist Thy servants to return unto Thee, to turn repentant to the gate of Thy grace, and to hold fast unto the cord of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Generous, and verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! Sanctify Thy loved ones from the promptings of self and passion, and adorn them with the ornament of holiness among Thy servants, O Lord of all being and Sovereign of the hereafter and the former times! O Lord! Illumine their outward and inward beings with the light of Thy knowledge, then ordain for them every good thing Thou hast sent down in Thy Books, Thy Scrolls, Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. I testify that Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Bountiful, the All-Bestowing, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>

<p>Yesterday the Shaykh wandered the city, lamp in hand,</p>
<p>Crying: “Weary am I of demon and beast; human company I desire!”</p>
<p>Beloved kind friend, praise be to God that well-being is somewhat attained and the pure mirror of the heart reflects the promptings and attractions of the heart. God willing, this desire shall be fulfilled and that aim shall be achieved. Though it would be sweeter to cleanse the tablet of light, which is of the pages of illumined hearts, from the intimations of this one and that, and to gallop naked in the vast arena of the spirit. As the divine sage says:</p>
<p>None seeks that Beloved with desire,</p>
<p>None sleeps with such a rose-cheeked one while clothed.</p>
<p>With two qiblihs one cannot walk straight on the path of unity,</p>
<p>Either the good pleasure of the Friend or one’s own must be chosen.</p>
<p>What place is there for garments when existence itself becomes a veil and otherness itself becomes a mask? The literary master of Shiraz says: “Thou thyself art thine own veil, O Hafiz; arise from between!” Just as Jacob’s love, had he cleansed the identity of heart and soul from the turbidity of water and clay, would surely not have needed the shirt from Egypt to bring him glad tidings, nor a messenger to remind him. Rather, he would have perceived the holy, fragrant breezes from the north wind of the spirit, and would have found repose with the Beloved in the very state of union. He would have tasted the longing for the meeting and the sweetness of the fountain of eternity from the spring of purity, would have arisen to eternal life and everlasting continuance, would have become immortalized in the Paradise of eternity after the gathering of the spirit, would have seen a thousand like unto Joseph circling round without the cry of “O my grief!”, and would have received the subtle essence of the Egypt of fidelity from the city of the annihilation of the One.</p>
<p>Yea, until the turbidities of the world of multiplicity, whose end is destruction, vanish and perish, the eternal Countenance will not raise its unveiled face from behind the veil, and the meaning of “All things shall perish save His Face” will not become evident from the manifest brow. What shall I write? The fragrance of the soul must be inhaled from the camel’s wool which belonged to Uwais, as the author of the Mathnavi says:</p>
<p>The fragrance of the soul comes from the camel’s wool,</p>
<p>This camel from the host of Sultan Uwais.</p>
<p>But the musk-fragrance of the soul and the breezes of the All-Merciful from the Yemen of the Beloved are cut off and forbidden. Yes, the casket of white pearls has become treasured in the shell of the sea, for its unpierced state is more acceptable and more pleasing, as it gives perfect power to the forces of the heart and increases the worthy light of sight. And perhaps this concealment may be the cause of manifestation, and this veiling may lead to an unveiling, or this allusion may be made explicit by a child, or this seal may be opened by a power.</p>
<p>When the seed is hidden in the earth,</p>
<p>The secret of the garden’s verdure it becomes.</p>
<p>Until what the power of the Friend’s arm may do! O companion, thy friend says that the comfort of existence needs a stroll free from the contamination of limitations, so that like the Phoenix of the West it may raise its head from the East of the soul and soar in the holy air of the spirit which is the city of the soul. I swear by God that if the armies of death were to gallop on horseback, they would not catch up with this rider, and Azrael would gird himself like a servant at the door and be indebted to the one bound for the sanctuary, that perchance he might become intimate in the sacred precincts and might circle and become aware in that subtle carpet which is more delicate than the pearls of light.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! The breeze of love arose and perfumed the assembly of intimacy. The spirit played a wondrous melody. The lovers in the wilderness of consciousness became unconscious from the secret whisper of the unseen. Such longing and rapture, such taste and joy have encompassed all that the breath of the Holy Spirit began to blow upon the decayed bones, and the Faithful Spirit came flying with the wing of success. The Israfil of life became bewildered as to which melody might bring these companions back to consciousness, and shows inability that perchance he might take a share and portion from this unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Enough! The Beloved has begun to speak;</p>
<p>Listen! And God knows best what is right.</p>
<p>At this moment my soul has left my body,</p>
<p>Saying to me: “Verily, unto Him do we return.”</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most Ancient, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Glorified is He Who hath revealed the Word with authority from His presence. Verily it speaketh amongst the people of creation that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Gracious. Should anyone turn unto it with the ear of his true nature, he would soar, with spirit and sweet fragrance, into the atmosphere of his Lord’s love, the All-Merciful. Say: It is a fire unto him who hath turned away from the One Who is Chosen, and a light unto the righteous. Through it are distinguished the one who accepteth from him who turneth away. Verily it is the Balance of deeds, and verily it is the Path of the Cause for all who are in the heavens and on earth, and the Fountain of Life for all who dwell in the realm of possibility. Blessed is he who hath turned unto it and laid hold on this Name which God hath made to exercise dominion over all regions.</p>
<p>The wretchedness of those who denied the Days of God, wherein the Cause dawned from the horizon of mysteries, hath prevailed. We have seized those who disbelieved in God and wronged the Dawning-Places of Revelation. Verily thy Lord is severe in punishment. Among them were those whom We seized with might from Our presence, those whom We destroyed with a single cry, those whom We drowned in the sea, those whom We caused the earth to swallow, those whom We burned with the flames of fire, and those upon whom We rained stones. Thus have We sent down their stories in the Tablets. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Soon shall We seize those who have wronged, even as We seized the transgressors in those regions who drove Us from the Land of Mystery when they opposed God, the Lord of all men. We seized them all with authority from Our presence. Thus was it sent down in the Tablet of the Heart. Blessed are they who possess insight.</p>
<p>We seized the first one as We had promised him in the Book, and We seized the second one and those with him with such might as caused the hearts of the wicked to tremble. They arose, and naught could be heard from their dwellings save the echo and the croaking of ravens.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of when We sent the Wondrous One with clear signs unto him who was heedless and in schism. He committed that which caused the denizens of Paradise and the realities of the Concourse on High to lament. We then left the wrongdoer to himself in wisdom and seized those in the lands. Soon shall We seize him by Our command, for verily We are powerful over what We desire.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who hath read God’s Tablet which We sent unto him, that he might be assured that We were not deterred by what befell Us. The Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken with pure truth, that all might testify that He is the Mighty, the Chosen One. Thy Lord’s proof hath been completed against them, and the evidence hath shone forth from the horizon of certitude. Those who read God’s verses find the sweetness of their Lord’s utterance, the Mighty, the Bestower, and turn with pure hearts toward the direction wherein appeared the Luminary of creation.</p>
<p>There hath come before the Throne a letter from him who, upon hearing the Call, said: “Yea, yea, O Render of veils!” Therefore have We sent down unto thee this Tablet through which the fragrance of the Garment hath been wafted throughout all worlds. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord for having directed toward thee the gaze of the Wronged One while imprisoned in the most remote of lands.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Hearken unto the call of Husayn. Stand firm in such wise that the limbs of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all men, may quake. Say: O concourse of divines! The Most Exalted Pen doth move in the fields of Tablets. Is there any among you who can race with the Horseman of might in this arena? Nay, by My Self! They are like the lame one, having halted in the mire of idle fancies. Say: This is the Sun of knowledge which hath dawned from the horizon of utterance, despite you, O company of the wicked! Leave these people be; sufficient unto them is thy Lord’s punishment, the Mighty, the Compelling.</p>
<p>Be thou observant in all circumstances with the eye of wisdom. Thus have We commanded creation in most of Our Tablets. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath caused thee to hear the cooing of the Dove upon the branches and the flowing of the River of Utterance in these days. By My life! He is the One mentioned before the Throne and the One Who remembereth with this remembrance whereby the idols have been reduced to naught.</p>
<p>Say: O Friend! Hearken unto the call of the Glorious One Who calleth thee from the tongue of this Afflicted One Who hath been tried among the people of dissension. Amidst darkness the light hath shone, and in tribulation this Man hath remained steadfast in such wise that the mountains cannot rival Him. Blessed art thou for having become the cup-bearer of the All-Merciful, giving the wine of life unto those who have turned to God, the Help in Peril. Clear verses have been sent down unto thee and We sent them aforetime. Verily He is the Mover of the cord of love.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou beholdest me oppressed among the wayward ones of Thy creation, and a stranger in Thy realm. Whenever I dwelt in a city by Thy command and leave, the tyrannous among Thy creatures and they who denied Thy bounty, which Thou didst send down from the heaven of Thy grace and the clouds of Thy will, drove us forth therefrom–though in its horizon there was naught but the sun of Thy loving-kindness, and in its gardens naught but the breezes of the spring of Thy mercy, and in its fields naught but the rains of Thy generosity and favors, and in its darkness naught but the lamp of Thy Cause and the light of Thy guidance. Whenever a face turned unto the countenance of Thy oneness, Thou didst deliver it from the depths of heedlessness and raised it to the heights of Thy unity’s glory, and gave it to drink from the wine of Thy revelation and inspiration. And whenever Thou didst behold one turning toward the sanctuary of Thy might and the Kaaba of Thy bounty, Thou didst turn toward him out of love for Thyself and his orientation to Thy face, and Thou didst descend to such a degree that he might draw near to the Tree of Thy Cause, and Thou didst lower Thyself to a station wherein Thou didst commune with him and comfort him as though Thou wert one like unto him–though Thou hadst placed all things within the grasp of my power by Thy power, and all winds were dispatched by my will through Thy will.</p>
<p>And in every city wherein we raised Thy remembrance and Thy name, there gathered against us those servants who denied Thy Self and turned away from Thy presence and arose in hypocrisy, until they expelled us therefrom and caused us to wander from city to city, until they unjustly brought us into this fortress built of solid rock, and this city wherefrom naught can be heard save the echo’s voice. And upon our first entry, they barred from us the goods of the world and shut in our faces the gates of comfort. By Thy glory, O Beloved of Baha! I find tribulations in Thy love as the rains of the clouds of Thy bounty and grace, whereby the heart of Baha and the liver of Baha were made verdant, and from them grew the ears of Thy wisdom, O Thou in Whose hand is the dominion of all things!</p>
<p>By Thy glory, O Beloved of the worlds and Goal of them that know! Whoso hath inhaled the fragrance of the garment of Thy mercy, and been seized by Thy fragrance and favors–tribulations cannot hold him back from Thy will, nor can ordeals deter him from Thy love and good-pleasure. Thou knowest, O my Beloved and my Purpose, that I call upon Thee with the tongue of Thy loved ones, and whatsoever floweth from this Most Exalted Pen hath no purpose save that I might call upon Thee with the tongue of Thy loved ones and commune with Thee on their behalf, that Thy melodies might seize them from their own selves and draw them to Thy Most Glorious Face, and strengthen them to turn toward the Most Exalted Horizon. Otherwise, my calling upon Thy Self is but as Thy calling upon my self, and none can comprehend it save those whom Thou hast caused to be detached from all else but Thee and to hasten along the paths of Thy Cause and Thy good-pleasure.</p>
<p>The nights and days have passed us by, O my God, in this Most Great Prison, until this night arrived wherein he who loveth Thee and desireth Thy face–the Manifestation of Thy Self, the Repository of Thine Essence, and the Source of Thy Cause–hath called, and hath spread the feast of bounty for the brethren out of love for Thy Self. Thou knowest, O my God, that he seeketh Thy face and gazeth toward the direction of Thy gifts, and desireth naught thereby save Thy good-pleasure and Thy love, yet he hath been prevented from entering this gathering wherein the verses of Thy Divine Unity’s glory are being revealed and inscribed by Thy servant who is present before the throne of Thy grandeur. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the faces of the Prophets among Thy chosen ones and those nigh unto Thee among the people of Thy holy dominion were illumined, and whereby they subdued the people of Thy realm and brought them into the kingdom of Thy glory–to rend asunder, with the fingers of Thy power, the veil that hath come between him and Thy beauty. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest, and Thou art the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Then ordain, O my God, for him and those with him, to attain Thy presence and to stand before Thee in the visible realm, and deprive him not of that which is with Thee. There is no God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Cause Thy seeking servants to soar in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and Thy majesty, and raise them at all times to the kingdom of Thy holiness and detachment. Then open before the face of him who desireth Thee the gates of Thy mercy and loving-kindness, and bestow upon him the good of this world and the next through the wonders of Thy beneficence. Then send upon him, at all times, the sweet-scented breezes of the mercy of Thy Name, the All-Merciful. Then make, O my God, the fire of his separation into light, and his sighs of remoteness into mercy. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the Sovereign, the All-Effectual.</p>

<p>In His Name, Who abideth after the passing of all things!</p>
<p>I was silent in remembrance and lay sleeping upon my couch when the breeze of the All-Glorious awakened me and the breath of the All-Merciful roused me from my slumber. When I awoke and arose, He caused me to speak by His sovereignty and commanded me to raise the call amidst His creation, that I might convey unto them that which I was bidden by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Therefore do I impart unto thee that which the Spirit hath imparted unto me, that I may fulfill some measure of what is incumbent upon me by God’s command and His proof, that thou mayest turn unto the supreme horizon, the station wherein hath dawned the Sun of thy Lord’s Beauty, the Mighty, the Gracious.</p>
<p>Hearken unto the Call from the precincts of ’Akka, from the Divine Lote-Tree: He is, verily, none other than God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Leave the people and what they possess, and turn with thy purest heart unto the Most Great Vision. This is what thou hast been commanded in the Tablets of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>This is the Day whereon Sinai proclaimeth: “The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Possessor of Names,” and the Mount calleth out: “The Lord of Revelation is come,” and the Spirit walketh before Him, and the proof circleth round His mighty, His unshakeable Command. Beware lest the veils of the people prevent thee from the countenance of Truth. Arise to make mention and utterance amongst the concourse of creation. Say: O people! By God, the Promise hath been fulfilled and the Promised One hath come with manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>When We found thee stirred by the breezes of the days of God, We revealed unto thee this exalted Tablet, that thou mayest take it with strength from Us and speak it amongst the servants, that they might cast away their vain imaginings and turn unto the Dayspring of certitude. Say: O people! This is a Day wherein there is no refuge for anyone and no escape for any soul save unto God. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of that for which ye were created, or veil yourselves from Him Who hath come with the truth with mighty sovereignty.</p>
<p>Say: Abandon the pond and turn ye unto the Most Great Ocean which surgeth in the name of God, the Lord of eternity. Then drink therefrom in His Name, Who hath dominion over all who are in the heavens and on earth. Say: He remembereth you for the sake of God - to this beareth witness the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Cities of Names, were ye of those who know.</p>
<p>The Tree of Knowledge hath been raised up by the command of the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who hath hastened to its shade, turning away from the deluded ones. How many a mystic hath been barred from the Known One, how many a scholar kept far from the One known, and how many a heedless one hath turned unto God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>The bounty is in God’s hand - He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth by His command. He is, verily, the Powerful, the Mighty. Observe, then remember when Muhammad, the Messenger of God, came with God’s signs and His proof: the learned ones turned away from Him, the scholars objected to Him, yet those who had no renown among the people believed in Him. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>And before Him, when the Spirit came with God’s sovereignty and His command, the Jewish scholars turned away from Him, yet today all kings and sovereigns pride themselves in His Name. Such hath been God’s way in the past and in the future, when the Manifestation of the Cause appeared from this luminous horizon.</p>
<p>How many a worshipper hath worshipped God through nights and days, yet when the Lord of all men appeared, denied Him and followed every ignorant remote one. And how many of the learned and the mystics discoursed of knowledge and wisdom, yet when the All-Merciful came, turned away from Him - these are indeed among the heedless ones.</p>
<p>Draw nigh unto the Most Great Ocean, detached from the nations and what they possess of Satan’s whisperings. Say: That which ye possess of knowledge and wisdom profiteth you not today. The Dayspring of all knowledge hath appeared with His Name, the Self-Subsisting, calling all unto God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>Arise from the horizon of detachment in the name of thy Lord, the Creator, then give glad tidings unto the people with wisdom and utterance through this Cause whereby the faces of those near unto God have been illumined. Do that which will profit thee today and thereby establish thy remembrance forever in the Tablets of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing.</p>
<p>Grieve not over anything. Trust in Him; He will verily support thee with the truth and will open upon thy heart the gates of knowledge. He is, verily, the Ancient Bestower. Take the cup of life, detached from all existence, then drink therefrom in thy Lord’s Name and fear not the idolaters.</p>
<p>Thus hath shone forth the Sun of Knowledge from the horizon of wisdom and utterance. Turn unto it with thy whole being and say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds, for having remembered me through the tongue of the Manifestation of Thyself, while He was imprisoned in the most desolate of lands, in the hands of the oppressors.</p>

<p>I am He Who warbleth upon the twigs and calleth out in the heart of contingent being. In this hour hath descended the firm and mighty Command of God. O Land! Be thou gladdened, inasmuch as God hath adorned thee with the footsteps of His loved ones and honored thee through them in all conditions.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Upon thee be My glory! The letter of Varqa, who circled round Me and soared in the atmosphere of My love and arose to serve My Cause, hath been received with the glances of loving-kindness. He mentioned Mirza ’Ata’u’llah, upon him be the glory of God, and likewise made mention of his household and the souls gathered therein. Blessed art thou, O ’Ata, and upon thee be glory from God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Names, and upon thy father, whom God made one of the horsemen in the arena of love and fellowship.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! The house wherein is raised the call of the loved ones and wherein they are occupied with the remembrance of God is, in the sight of God, the circling-place of the near angels. Blessed is the house wherein are diffused the fragrances of Revelation and wherein is raised the remembrance of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the Wise.</p>
<p>His honor the Hakim, upon him be the grace of God, the Lord of the worlds, hath been and is mentioned. Repeatedly hath the Trustee, upon him be My glory, made mention of him. We have revealed for him that which hath diffused the fragrance of God’s loving-kindness, the Goal of the mystics, and there hath flowed in his name from My Most Exalted Pen the Kawthar of immortality. Say: Take it in My Name, then drink thereof in spite of those who have denied Baha and His sovereignty and His power and His might, whereby slumber hath fled from the eyes of the deniers.</p>
<p>O Hakim! This day is thy day. Arise from the horizon of silence, then speak forth My remembrance, whereby the call hath been raised from every direction. God hath come from the horizon of power with manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>O Hakim! Upon thee be My glory! The doubters and transgressors have forbidden the servants from reciting the dawn prayer whose preface is adorned with this Most Exalted Name. With utmost clarity hath been mentioned that which causeth the hearts of the polytheists and the opposers to be consumed, for He saith that the Most Great Name is present and mentioned therein. Nevertheless, they have deprived the people of the outpourings of the True Bestower that lie hidden in those remembrances.</p>
<p>Say: O heedless one, O Shaykh, O son of Baqir! I speak truly and for the sake of God I speak - thou too listen for the sake of God. The blessed, luminous word “but He is the Apostle of God and the Seal of the Prophets” was concluded by the blessed word “the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.” Arise from thy slumber and behold the Kingdom of utterance circling round.</p>
<p>O Asad! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Single, the One! We desired to make mention of him whom thou didst mention, who was named Nuru’llah in the Book of Names, that he might thank his Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist him in that which beseemeth His days and guide him to His path, whereon he walketh and speaketh in every condition. Verily, He is God; there is none other God but Me, the Single, the All-Informed. Blessed is he and his father and his mother. We beseech God, exalted be He, to send down upon them from the clouds of His grace the rains of His mercy and draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy! O Pen! Turn thy face toward him who hath loved Me, who was named Mirza before Aqa, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God. O Mahmud! The All-Praised One hath mentioned thee in this praiseworthy station. I testify that thou didst hear My call and didst attain unto My verses and didst turn toward My horizon when the servants turned away, save him whom the arm of My power did rescue. Thus was the matter decreed from before God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>We make mention too of the loved ones of that land who were present in that house. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to give them to drink of the Kawthar of steadfastness whereby neither the might of tyrants nor the ascendancy of pharaohs shall deter them. Today the essence of steadfastness is observed to be more precious and valuable than all the jewels of the world. This precious pearl must be preserved through the bounty of the blessed Word, for thieves and traitors lie in wait.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who hath cast away the dawning-places of idle fancies and taken that which he was bidden by God, the Goal of the sincere ones. My God, my God! Strengthen the hearts of Thy loved ones lest the opposers prevent them from turning to the court of Thy might and the carpet of Thy bounty. O Lord! Aid Thy loved ones to hold fast to the cord of Thy grace and to detach themselves from all else besides Thee. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the All-Choosing.</p>

<p>Thus We call unto thee from beyond the sea of grandeur, upon the crimson land, above the horizon of tribulation. Verily, no God is there save Him, the Almighty, the Most Generous. Walk thou steadfastly in My Cause and follow not the ways of those who, upon attaining unto the object of their desire, denied God, the Lord of Lords. Erelong shall He lay hold upon them in His wrath, and He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the All-Subduing.</p>
<p>Know thou that, through the power of His sovereign might, God hath seized him who was the foremost amongst them that passed judgement against Us. When he saw his torment approaching, he fled to Paris to seek recourse to physicians.</p>
<p>“Is there none to help me?” he asked.</p>
<p>He was smitten upon the mouth and told: “There is no escape!”</p>
<p>And when he turned towards the angel of wrath, he well-nigh expired from fear. “I have a house full of riches,” he pleaded. “I have a palace on the Bosphorus, beneath which the rivers flow.”</p>
<p>The angel replied: “No ransom shall be accepted from thee on this day, even shouldst thou offer up all things visible and invisible. Hearest thou not the sighs of the kindred of God, whom thou didst cast into prison without proof or testimony? Thy deed hath provoked the lamentation of the inmates of Paradise, and of those who circle morn and eve round the Throne on high. The wrath of thy Lord hath descended upon thee, and stern is He in His chastisement!”</p>
<p>He made reply: “I held command over the people, and here is the mandate of my authority.”</p>
<p>“Hold thy peace, O denier of the Day of Judgement!”</p>
<p>He implored: “Is no respite possible so that I may send for my family?”</p>
<p>“Far from it, O disbeliever in the verses of God!”</p>
<p>Thereupon the keepers of the fathomless abyss called unto him: “The gates of Hell have opened wide to receive thee, O thou who hast turned away from thy Lord, the Unconstrained! Repair unto its fire, for it yearneth after thee. Hast thou forgotten, O rejected one, when thou wert the Nimrod of the age, how thy tyranny eclipsed the very cruelties of Pharaoh, the Lord of the Stakes? By God! Thine iniquity hath rent asunder the veil of sanctity and caused the pillars of heaven to tremble. Where canst thou find refuge now? Who shall protect thee from the dreadful scourge of thy Lord, the All-Compelling? There is no haven for thee in this Day, O ungodly doubter!” Whereupon the agony of death seized him and he saw no more. Thus did We lay hold on him in Our wrathful anger, and severe is thy Lord in His punishment.</p>
<p>Then an angel from the right hand of the Throne summoned him: “Behold the angel of affliction. Is there any place to flee to save hell, wherein the heart boileth?” And the angel of chastisement received his spirit, and a voice proclaimed: “Enter the bottomless pit which hath been promised in the Book, and whose existence thou didst day and night deny!”</p>
<p>Soon will We dismiss the one who was like unto him, and will lay hold on their Chief who ruleth the land, and I, verily, am the Almighty, the All-Compelling. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of God and extol thy Lord morn and eve. Suffer not the light of thy soul to be quenched by the calumnies of the one who was so blinded by Our bestowals as to turn away from God, the Lord of all names. He inspireth his devoted followers even as the Evil One prompteth his own. Erelong shalt thou behold him in evident loss both in this world and in the world to come. He, indeed, is among those whom an afflictive torment doth await. He dispatched an epistle to someone in that land, a writ of the workers of iniquity, in which he mocked God and recorded that which filled all created things with dismay. Say: Canst thou find anyone to protect thee when the wrath of God, the All-Powerful, the Unconstrained, is visited upon thee?</p>
<p>Thus have We informed thee of that which lieth concealed within the hearts of men. Verily, thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Knowing. Arise for the triumph of this Cause, and gather together My loved ones. Help them to see the truth in this Day when the feet of men have slipped. Say: It behoveth every true believer to assist his Lord. He, verily, is your helper, while the people have no one to turn to in this Day.</p>
<p>Then We seized Mihdi, to whom We had promised divine chastisement in Our Books and Scriptures. When Our awful majesty encompassed him, he entreated: “May I not retrace my steps?”</p>
<p>A voice exclaimed: “Woe betide thee, O disbeliever in the Day of Resurrection! This is the nethermost fire, and its flames have been made to blaze for thee. Thou didst forsake all righteous deeds in thy vain and futile life, and now thou hast none to shield thee from God. Thou art indeed he who caused all hearts to be consumed and the Holy Spirit to lament.”</p>
<p>He pleaded: “Is there yet no refuge for me?”</p>
<p>“Nay, by my Lord, even shouldst thou seek recourse to every possible means!”</p>
<p>Thereupon he cried out in such distress as to cause the people of the graves to tremble, and was seized by the Hand of invincible power. A voice then proclaimed: “Return unto the seat of wrath in the fire of hell; wretched and evil be thine abode!”</p>
<p>Thus did We lay hold on him as We laid hold on those who preceded him. Behold their houses which We have left to the spiders, and take heed, O ye who are endued with understanding! He it is who opposed God, and for whom the verses of wrath were revealed in the Book. Blessed is he who readeth it and pondereth its contents, for a goodly end doth in truth await him.</p>
<p>Thus have We recounted unto thee the tale of the evil-doers, that thine eyes may be solaced. As for thee, there lieth in store naught but a blissful end.</p>

<p>This is the Day whereon the Book speaketh, wherein the Sun discourseth, and wherein the Moon proclaimeth: “Dominion belongeth unto God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust! Glory be to God, the Lord of all creation! And sovereignty is God’s, the Lord of both the past and future!” Blessed is he who hath turned unto Him, and joy be unto him who hath hearkened, and woe betide every heedless doubter and every remote ignorant one.</p>
<p>O peoples of the earth! Hearken unto the Call from the Most Exalted Horizon. Verily, it draweth you unto a station whereon the Throne of God, the Lord of all worlds, hath been established. We have sent down the verses and manifested the evidences, yet most of the people are wandering distraught.</p>
<p>O concourse of loved ones in Rustaq and its surroundings! Hear ye the Call from the Prison of Akka. Verily, it hath been raised between earth and heaven, and it is the Sealed Wine which hath appeared and flowed forth through My Name, the Self-Subsisting, and it is the Salsabil of divine knowledge for all creation, and the Symbol of Oneness amidst humanity. Blessed is he who hath turned and partaken and drunk through this Name, whereby the limbs of the heedless have trembled.</p>
<p>O My loved ones there! Cast aside vain imaginings and their manifestations, idols and their likes, and conjectures and their sources. Thus have We revealed the Cause and sent down that which hath attracted the hearts of those who are nigh unto God.</p>
<p>O concourse of loved ones! Can any among you cast behind him all names and set aside all that the people possess, turning unto the Kaaba of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy? Say: Nay, by Thy very Self, except through Thy might and power and sovereignty which have encompassed the first and the last.</p>
<p>O thou who art present before the Face and who drinketh the wine of revelation! Give glad tidings unto My loved ones of My remembrance, My loving-kindness, and My mercy which have preceded all things. Verily their Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Compassionate, the Generous One. He loveth His loved ones and remembereth them with that which shall cause their names, deeds, and remembrances to endure in the Books of God, the Goal of all who know.</p>
<p>O Mas?ud! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Mighty, the Loving. We bear witness that thou hast attained the ultimate goal and hast appeared before the Face, and hast witnessed the signs from their Dawning-Place and their Revealer, and the evidences from their Source. Know thou the station of this testimony which hath descended from the heaven of bounty as a favor from Him unto thee. Blessed is he who hath attained unto that which hath been revealed from the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>This is a Book that guideth mankind unto the Most Great Path and draweth them nigh unto the All-Knowing, the One. Say: O people! Take hold of the Book of God with His strength in such wise that neither all worldly things prevent you, nor the cawing of the cawers who have cast the Most Great Sea behind them, clinging to their own vain imaginings. Verily, they are among the most lost.</p>
<p>In this Book which speaketh before the faces of the servants, manifestation belongeth unto God, the Powerful, the Mighty. Read thou the Tablet unto My loved ones, then send it unto him who hath soared in My atmosphere and drunk the wine of reunion from the hand of My bounty, whom We have named in the Book as Javan-i-Ru?ani. Upon him be the everlasting Glory of God, that his eyes may be solaced by witnessing the traces of his Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Ru?ani! Sorrows have encompassed Us, and there hath appeared from those who claimed to love Me and to hold fast unto My cord that which hath caused the Most Exalted Paradise to lament, and every fair-minded, clear-sighted one. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One and hath attained the glances of favor, as attesteth that which hath flowed from My mighty and wondrous Pen. Thy remembrance hath not ceased from My Most Great Prison. We have mentioned thee and have revealed for thee in the Tablets that which hath attracted the hearts of the sincere ones. We recall the days when thou wert present before the Face and didst hear the Call of God, the Lord of the worlds. The Wronged One, under the swords of the enemies, calleth thee and remembereth thee. Know thou the station of this bounty and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>We have been with thee in all conditions when thou wert speaking this wise Remembrance whereby the limbs of every remote polytheist have trembled. Say: O people! By God! Through His remembrance the world hath been perfumed, and through His arising the people have arisen to serve God, the All-Knowing, the Wise. Grieve not over anything, but trust in God, the Almighty, the Powerful. Blessed is the house wherein My remembrance is raised, and the place honored by the hearkening of My verses, and the heart that hath turned unto this luminous horizon. We have mentioned those with thee, both before and after, and We mention them at this time with verses that equal not the books of the people nor the treasuries of kings and rulers. Blessed is the ear that hath heard thy mention in this Great Announcement. Convey My remembrance, then deliver unto them what hath been sent down from the heaven of thy Lord, the Ancient Sender.</p>

<p>He is the Expositor, the All-Knowing!</p>
<p>O Name of Bounty! Upon thee be the Glory of God! That which His honour Haydar-’Ali - upon him be My Glory and loving-kindness and mercy - hath sent, hath been received. Blessed is he! In these days, fear hath so seized the people of that land that even in the darkness of night they inquire not about the Truth nor speak of Him - how much less in the day, and in the presence of the people. Therefore silence is preferable until such time as God shall open the gates of utterance unto all who dwell within the realm of possibilities. Should ye perceive from any quarter the fragrance of acceptance and love, entrust unto them the blessed Word; otherwise, God hath never been, nor is He now, in need of such souls. Their denial harmeth Him not, even as their faith profiteth Him not. The people of the world have, with their own hands, fashioned idols out of their vain imaginings and have named them “the learned.” These manifestations of rancor and hatred, these dawning-places of tyranny and iniquity have, throughout the ages and centuries, visited upon the daysprings and fountainheads of knowledge that which hath caused the denizens of the cities of names and the Concourse on high to descend from the throne of glory to the dust of abasement. I speak the truth when I say that creation hath never been, nor is it now, worthy of these days, save for a few.</p>
<p>O Haydar! O thou who gazest upon the Most Great Scene! Faces are altered, hearts veiled, eyes inflamed, and ears stopped up. O people of Baha! The day is your day. The fewer the witnesses, the better. Despite those who have disbelieved and turned away, drink ye of that choice wine of utterance which is mingled with the tribulation of the Best-Beloved of all creation. Today the ocean of bounty and grace hath desired eternal life for all peoples, yet they accepted it not; nay rather, they have arisen to extinguish the divine light. They have transformed gratitude into complaint, and acceptance into cruelty. By the glory of Baha! They are among the most lost in the perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>O Haydar! Upon thee be the glory of God, and the glory of the heaven of My mercy, and the sun of My favors. The heedlessness of the people hath reached such a pass that the Kingdom of Utterance hath been bidden to silence. Several years before the Most Great Announcement, this binding command was revealed: “Be thou pulsating like an artery in the body of the contingent world,” yet now it commandeth stillness. That which hath been and will be revealed from His presence is the truth, about which there is no doubt. He is, verily, the All-Bountiful, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>The command for promotion hath been firmly revealed, and wisdom hath necessitated the prohibition of proceeding to the land of ?a. The second hath not abrogated the first. If ye act with wisdom and carry out that which hath been revealed by the Supreme Pen in the Divine Book, it will assuredly be accepted and confirmed before the Wronged One. Blessed is he who acteth according to that which hath been revealed in the Book of his Lord, the Commander, the All-Knowing. However, proceeding to that land must be undertaken with wisdom, for should some become aware of it, it might cause commotion. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to protect thee even as He hath protected thee, for He is the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Trusted One.</p>
<p>The friends whom thou didst mention - the name of each hath been heard, and at this moment the glance of loving-kindness is directed towards each one. May the True One, exalted be His glory, assist them. By My life! They have attained unto My mention, which nothing in existence can equal, not even all the treasures of the earth. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Give them glad tidings from the Wronged One and remind them of My days, My verses, My evidences, that which hath flowed from My Pen, that which the tongue of My wisdom hath spoken, that which the mouth of My knowledge hath uttered, and that which hath befallen My Person for the exaltation of My Word and the manifestation of My straight Path.</p>
<p>Permission hath previously been granted to construct whatever buildings and stores they wish in the place mentioned, and likewise to engage in commerce, but discussion of this matter is not now permitted. Silence is preferable. Should any word be uttered, whatsoever they mention regarding persecution would be acceptable in the sight of God; otherwise, patience is preferable until such time as God shall open the gate of remembrance and utterance. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Supreme, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>As to their intention to proceed to the direction of their goal, there is no objection if wisdom so requireth. The matter is in His hands. He doeth what He willeth, and He is the Mighty, the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>The Glory shining from the horizon of the Divine Countenance be upon thee and upon those who have arisen and have said: “God is our Lord and the Lord of the heavens and earths.”</p>

<p>He is God! O thou who art a penetrating and sincere seeker! Ascend unto the heights of divine wisdom, then enter the paradise of heavenly spirituality and seek shelter beneath the shade of the Blessed Tree which hath been planted in the midst of paradise, that its spiritual and mystical fruits may shower upon thee and thou mayest witness the signs of thy Lord in this blessed garden, wherein God hath ordained that which no eye hath seen nor ear heard, for it was veiled from sight and hidden from vision, save from him whom God hath shown the Kingdom of the Spirit and caused to stand firm upon the straight path.</p>
<p>Know thou that the question thou hast asked hath explanations and interpretations that cannot be set forth today, nor can ears bear to hear them, for souls are veiled by veils of darkness and eyes are covered by a veil of fire. How can these birds, wounded by the arrows of hatred, soar in the atmosphere of inner meanings and explanation, or warble their wondrous melodies upon the branches? Yet, as I found thy honour thirsting for the waters of divine knowledge and yearning for the pure and flowing spring in the garden of oneness, my heart was moved to mention to thee a word of that which God hath cast into the hearts of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>Know thou that spirits are divided into the animal spirit, the human spirit, the divine spirit, and the heavenly spirit. As for the animal spirit, which is shared between man and animal, it is perishable in itself and becomes non-existent when bodies perish and forms dissolve, for it is of material elements. Since its substance is subject to non-existence and changeable through the passage of time, it must inevitably perish.</p>
<p>The human spirit, which is the rational soul that distinguishes man from animal, is not of the physical elements but rather of spiritual substance that is not subject to corruption. It is tormented when veiled from God, its Lord, and prevented from beholding its Creator and perceiving His signs in the worlds of souls and horizons. It has the power to comprehend all things and encompasses the realities of all contingent beings as they are, should it turn to the center of guidance among the concourse of creation; otherwise it descends into the depths of ignorance and blindness and falls to the lowest levels of error and misguidance.</p>
<p>The divine spirit, which is of God’s command, represents the holy power, divine confirmations, heavenly assistance, divine knowledge, and celestial sciences with which God aids whomsoever He willeth among His righteous servants. Through it they attain mystic revelations and undoubted visions, win the complete preceding mercy and abundant grace, enter the garden of oneness and the divine paradise, and rejoice and delight in what God hath given them of His bounty, thanking Him for His favors and blessings.</p>
<p>As for the heavenly spirit, it is a holy essence, a perfect word, a complete sign, the mystery of existence, and the reality hidden from the eyes of all beings. It is the Supreme Pen, the Most Merciful Soul, and the manifestation of Truth from the dawning-place of creation and its sun at the point of invention. This is specifically for the Prophets in the worlds of creation.</p>
<p>Besides these spirits which I have explained and mentioned to thee, God hath created spirits beyond count or reckoning, including the vegetable spirit, the celestial spirit, the spirit of might, and the intellectual spirit. Likewise, among the Prophets there are shared spirits and specific spirits, such as the Faithful Spirit which is specific to the Most Exalted Word and the Supreme Pen, Muhammad, the Messenger of God, peace be upon Him, as God the Exalted said: “The Faithful Spirit descended upon thy heart.” However, were we to explain this, pages would not suffice nor could ears bear to hear it, therefore we conclude our words at this point and consider it sufficient.</p>
<p>O noble seeker! By My life, if thou didst inhale the fragrance of faithfulness, I would cast upon thee a word which, shouldst thou hear it, would cause thee to soar in an atmosphere wherein thou wouldst hear from the rustling of its winds that there is no God but Him. But at this time the tongues of the nightingales of truth have grown weary of uttering wondrous melodies. Rather, divine wisdom flows from hearts to breasts as the spirit flows through souls. Well said the poet: “I have been alone with the Beloved, and between us was a secret more subtle than the breeze when it flows.”</p>

<p>In the name of the One Who is the Manifest, the Speaking, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing! O thou who speaketh in praise, making mention of God, the Lord of all names! That which thou didst compose hath come before the Wronged One, and the servant present hath recited it. We heard it and responded to thee at that time with an utterance that illumined the horizon of the heaven of understanding, as a token of grace from God, the Lord of the worlds. Clear proofs have appeared, verses have been sent down, and that which was recorded in the Books of God hath come to pass, and yet most of the people remain heedless. Blessed is he who, being strong, hath cast away vain imaginings and aided the Cause of his Lord with wisdom and utterance. He is indeed of the people of the Crimson Ark, whose decree hath been sent down from the Supreme Pen in a preserved tablet. Blessed is he who hath turned towards it, whom neither the opposition of the divines nor of the rulers hath kept back from this Straight Path.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of servants! Be fair before God - if ye deny God’s proof and testimony in this Revelation, by what evidence can your own faith be established? Bring it forth, and be not of them that deny. This is a Day wherein the proof calleth aloud and the evidence crieth out. By God! The horizon of knowledge hath been illumined by the dawning-light of the appearance of your Lord, the Most Merciful. Fear God, and be not of them that hesitate. The cry hath been raised, the rock hath cried out, and the Divine Lote-Tree hath called, yet the people remain in strange slumber. The world hath so deluded them that they have been kept back from the Lord of all beings. By the life of God! Soon shall all they behold today perish, and there shall endure that which hath been sent down to thee from the heaven of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the Gracious.</p>
<p>The whole world hath been, and still is, awaiting the days of His manifestation, and in the nights and days they have been seeking and yearning to attain His presence and to comprehend the Day mentioned in the divine Books. Yet when the horizon of the world was illumined with the lights of the dawn of His Revelation, all were found heedless and veiled, save whom thy Lord, the Lord of the heavens and earth, did please.</p>
<p>Today all things are stirred and in motion through the breaths of the divine days. The tongue of the winds proclaimeth “The Messenger hath come,” and the tongue of the morning declareth “The Cleaver of the Dawn hath appeared,” and the Mount calleth out and saith: “By God! The Speaker hath appeared with a command before which none on earth can stand.” To this testifieth every hearing and seeing one. All bear witness to the transience of the world and behold its vicissitudes and transformations at all times. Yet they are so occupied with it that they have not hearkened to the cry and the call. Ere long shall all return to their graves with the utmost regret and remorse, and they shall find for themselves neither helper nor supporter.</p>
<p>God willing, may the friends of Truth who have drunk of the choice-sealed wine and are illumined by the lights of the Sun of certitude, enlighten the people with wisdom, that perchance they may not remain deprived of the heaven of grace and the ocean of loving-kindness. Whosoever is today nourished by the fruits of the tree of the Supreme Pen is reckoned among the people of the right hand and of certitude in the perspicuous Book. The cawing and croaking of the world’s people shall not keep him back from the Most Great Name and the Lord of Eternity. Beseech ye God that He may cause all to attain unto this most exalted and sublime station. He is, verily, the Munificent, the Gracious.</p>
<p>That which hath appeared from thy realm of attention in praise of the Truth, the servant present hath mentioned, and it hath attained the honor of being heard and accepted. In truth, these words are from the imperishable treasures preserved for thee with God. This is naught but a mighty favor. Give thanks unto God and say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the world and Purpose of the nations, for having created me and manifested me and caused me to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy inspiration, the Dayspring of Thy Revelation, and the Repository of Thy knowledge, and for having caused me to speak His praise in days wherein every learned one denied Him, every judge pronounced sentence against Him, and every ruler turned away from Him, save those whom the hand of Thy power and might did rescue. I beseech Thee to assist me to be steadfast in Thy Cause and to arise to celebrate Thy praise and glory amongst Thy creatures. Thou art, verily, powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O my Lord! Ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for the chosen ones among Thy servants who did not break Thy covenant and Thy testament, and who arose to serve Thee in such wise that the hosts could not prevent them from drawing nigh unto Thee, O Lord of all existence.

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Most Great, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>O Samandar! That which thou didst write in the name of Jud, upon him be My glory, was presented before the Countenance. God willing, may all the friends of God be blessed with his remembrance. One word of his words is more beloved in the sight of God than whatsoever is on earth. Blessed are those souls who have attained unto it and been enabled to preserve it. Many matters today remain veiled due to the lack of capacity of the servants, and for this reason they remain deprived of recognizing the Sun of Truth. Soon will the one who has turned towards Him behold himself in the most exalted station, and the one who has turned away in the lowest depths. That which is beloved today is steadfastness in the Cause of God, and none shall attain unto the supreme steadfastness save through the complete obliteration of idle fancies. Blessed is the one who hath broken their idols! Today no matter, no mention, no description, and no book sufficeth anyone save the Preserved Book and the Inscribed Tablet which speaketh before all faces: “Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>
<p>Though the True One, exalted be His glory and magnificence, hath rent asunder the veils of creation with the finger of His Will, yet it is observed that they have become entangled in other veils. The people of the Bayan, those souls who have turned away from the Water of Life, are seen to be more veiled than the people of the Furqan. They have desired to extinguish the light of the All-Merciful with the winds of fancy and vain imaginings. Fie upon them and upon those who have led them astray! By the life of God! The entirety of the Bayan was revealed for this Manifestation, and were this not the intended purpose, not a single word of it would have been revealed. Blessed is the soul that hath heard the cooing of the Dove of the Cause upon the branches.</p>
<p>Be vigilant regarding the Cause at all times and be mindful of wisdom in all matters. This is a firm command sent down from the Kingdom of the Ancient King. It is the supreme cause and the means of elevation. Blessed is he who hath held fast unto it and acted according to that which hath been commanded by God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about the ascension of the uncle of Muhammad-Qabil-i-Rahim, We make mention of him as a bounty from Our presence, and We are the All-Knowing Remembrancer. O Samandar! The Lord of Destiny beareth witness that he believed in God and turned with his heart toward the Most Great Scene, this glorious and impregnable station. He is among those who heard the call of God and turned unto Him when every learned one turned away. The Glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon thee, O thou who hast turned toward the Supreme Horizon and turned away from those who denied God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Rejoice thou in My testimony for thee, for it shall be with thee in every world of the worlds of thy Lord, the Gracious. Blessed art thou for having discovered the fragrance of the garment and for having acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath acknowledged: that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the All-Informed. Verily, thou art in the Supreme Companion, and the Lord of all creation maketh mention of thee in such wise that its fragrance hath wafted between the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>O Samandar! We console thee and his family with verses that have brought joy to the eyes of those near unto God. We have mentioned all the souls mentioned in thy letter with the most wondrous remembrances, and those mentioned in the letter of Kadkhuda, upon him be the glory of God, written in the name of Mahdi - all have been honored with the adorning mention of the All-Merciful. Blessed are they, again blessed are they! Happy are they, again happy are they! God willing, may all be seen in perfect unity and concord. This is the cause of glory, loftiness, and exaltation of the friends of God. Convey greetings to all from the True One. God willing, may all act in accordance with what He loveth and approveth. The reward of no one hath been nor shall be lost. All that hath flowed from the Divine Pen in the Book shall come to pass, as most already hath, and all have witnessed. Be assured, O My loved ones, of My grace, My mercy, and My loving-kindness. Verily, He is with you in all conditions and commandeth you to that which will manifest your stations among His servants. Verily, He is the Possessor of Creation. His is the creation and the command, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>We make mention at the end of this Tablet of Our servant Javad and give him the glad-tidings of Our attention to him and Our remembrance of him, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. The Glory be upon thee and upon him who was named Muhammad-Qabil-’Ali and upon those who have attained unto this mighty station.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Desire of the worlds!</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Praise be to God that on a Day which is illumined by the lights of His countenance and which is known in the divine Books as the Day of God, thou hast attained the presence of the Wronged One. This is a station which all the Concourse on High, the denizens of Paradise and the dwellers of the holy precincts have sought after. By the life of God! The Pen of all possibility is powerless and inadequate to make mention of it. Preserve thy station through the Name of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, inasmuch as those who circle round must at all times be observant of the divine Command and Will. These are they of whom He saith: “They speak not until He hath spoken.” Their hearing awaiteth the word “Listen,” their eyes await the blessed word “Behold,” and their tongues stand ready for the manifestation of the word “Speak,” for such souls are extinct in themselves, in what they possess, in their will and desire, and are focused upon, speak of, utter and stand firm in that which God hath willed.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Give thanks unto God for having aided thee, drawn thee nigh, caused thee to hear and to speak on a Day whereon the servants have turned away, save those whom He wished and desired. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. The numerous letters which the friends of God addressed to thee were presented by this servant in the presence of the Wronged One. God willing, may all attain unto the eternal bounty which in one instance hath been interpreted as the Divine Word. This exalted Word hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book: “Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto the Word of God in His days,” for whosoever attaineth unto divine mention, that mention appeareth as a lamp before his face, manifest, evident, bright and visible in all the worlds. Consider now the greatness of this station. Blessed are they that attain! All the souls who were mentioned in the letters have attained unto the divine mention and been honored by His Word. Verily thy Lord, the All-Merciful, is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He pleaseth through His word “Be” and it is.</p>
<p>Specifically for each one hath a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet been sent down from the heaven of Will. Beseech and implore God that He may enable all to preserve this station whose greatness the Most Exalted Pen hath acknowledged. His honor Mirza and his honor Siyyid, upon them be the Glory of God, made mention of the presence of holy, assured souls. Blessed are they, their gathering, and the place which hath been honored by their presence and hath heard their voices in the remembrance of God, their Beloved and their Goal. God willing, may the fragrance of unity continually waft from them, and may they exert their utmost endeavor with perfect wisdom to promote the Cause in both the night season and the day.</p>
<p>Whatsoever hath come to pass and become manifest in these days had already been revealed and sent down from the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is he who hath recognized and is of the assured ones. Today the assured and mighty souls must bestow upon all the living waters of the Cause of the Lord of creation. The people are heedless and debarred from the ocean of knowledge. Consider the followers of the Qur’an, how they were veiled and kept far removed by the vain sayings of the ancients. The Sun of certitude is shining and the ocean of knowledge is surging, yet they still cling to the people of conjecture and hold fast to the hem of idle fancies. This is the Day whereon the books of the first and the last depend upon the recognition of this Most Great Revelation. All things are known through Him, while He is self-subsisting, manifest and known of Himself. Blessed is the servant who hath recognized, and woe unto every sinful denier.</p>
<p>In all the previous Books this station is specifically reserved for this Revelation. If eyes were to be found and ears were to be seen, thou wouldst hear and witness that which God hath testified to, and wouldst acknowledge that which the Most Exalted Pen hath acknowledged. O Muhammad! Know thou what We have imparted unto thee as a favor from Our presence, then give thanks unto thy Lord, the Speaker, the All-Seeing. From this spot We send Our greetings unto thee and unto those whose letters were presented before the Wronged One and who have shown steadfastness in this Most Great, Most Wondrous, Most Glorious and Most Wise Cause.</p>
<p>O thou who circlest round the Prison! Give glad-tidings unto the friends of God concerning that which hath been revealed, that all may rejoice through divine bounty and arise to do that which beseemeth the Days of God. Verily thy Lord doeth what He willeth and ordaineth as He desireth. There is no God but Him, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Glory be upon thee and upon them from the presence of One Who is Bountiful and Generous.</p>

<p>He is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting!</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Mahdi! Hearken unto the call of God which hath been raised from the precincts of the Prison, summoning all to a station which God hath sanctified from the idle fancies of the polytheists and the insinuations of the doubters, who have cast the Covenant of God and His Testament behind their backs and have uttered that which hath caused every fair-minded soul to lament and the tears to flow from the eyes of them that circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali! The Wronged One hath ascended the throne of Sinai and hath proclaimed unto all who are in the heavens and on earth that which draweth them nigh unto the Most Sublime Horizon and preserveth them from such as have reclined upon the cushions of tyranny and whom the ornaments of the world have deluded, until they denied the Lord of all beings, Who came from the heaven of bounty with the standards of His signs.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Kazim! Say: O God of Names and Creator of heaven! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name, Who desireth naught but the reformation of the world and the edification of the nations, to illumine my face with the lights of Thy countenance and my heart with the light of Thy knowledge. Adorn my head with the crown of detachment and my temple with the robe of godliness. Thou art, verily, the Possessor of all things, and within Thy grasp lie the reins of all who dwell in the kingdom of creation. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy power and ordainest what Thou pleasest through Thy sovereignty. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Taqi! Upon thee be the everlasting glory of God. Say: O people, fear ye this Day! By God, that which was treasured in God’s knowledge and concealed in His Books and Scrolls, and hidden from eyes and sight, hath been made manifest.</p>
<p>O Hasan-Qabli-’Ali! This is the Day whereon the ocean of oneness hath surged and whereon the Ark of God, the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below, hath sailed. Blessed is he who hath cast away the world and its ornaments and all that is therein, and hath held fast unto it and clung to the hem of the robe of his Lord’s mercy, the Lord of the Final Return.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Sanctify thine ear from the tales of bygone ages that thou mayest hear that which hath been raised from the Most Exalted Summit, the station which God hath made the circling-point of Sinai and the dawning-places of Revelation. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen revealed that which was treasured within it, as a command from God, the Lord of all men.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Hasan! Upon thee and upon My loved ones be My glory and My loving-kindness. Dost thou hear the call from the Most Sublime Horizon? This is the call whereby the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise have been enraptured. Well is it with him who hath turned and attained, and woe betide every heedless doubter.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Hear My call from the precincts of My prison. Verily, it will draw thee nigh unto My Kingdom and acquaint thee with My Message and My Path, and will aid thee to soar in My atmosphere and enable thee to serve My Cause, whereby the pillars of the people and all in the land were shaken, save those whom God, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection, did preserve.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! The Light hath shone forth and the Temple of Revelation hath been established upon the throne of Sinai. Thus hath the call been raised from every direction: “The Kingdom is God’s, then the Power is His, then the Greatness is His.” Blessed is he who hath turned with a luminous face and an illumined heart to the Most Sublime Station.</p>
<p>O Javad! The helpless servants in these days are bewildered in the wilderness of doubts and idle fancies, and Hadi-i-Dawlatabadi, like the people of old, is nurturing this party. Say: Fear thou God, glorified be His majesty, and follow not the ways of them that are lost in fancy. Say: O Hadi! Present thyself before the Face that thou mayest hear what the world’s ear hath not heard since the beginning that hath no beginning. Present thyself that thou mayest behold that which hath no likeness or parallel. By the life of God! Baha counseleth thee for the sake of God, and desireth from thee and from the world neither recompense nor thanks.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Isma’il! Hear the call from the precincts of ’Akka. Verily, it attracteth thee to the Most Sublime Horizon and draweth thee nigh unto Him Whom the power of princes hath not weakened, nor the might of divines frightened, nor the dominion of any oppressor deterred, nor the opposition of any rejecter hindered, nor the cawing of any crow impeded, nor the denial of those whose deeds have prevented them from acknowledging and testifying.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Hear thou the counsel of God and act according to that which thou hast been commanded. Beware lest the veils of the wicked prevent thee, or the clouds of them who heard the call and denied it, and who witnessed the signs and rejected them, enshroud thee. They are indeed servants who have cast the Truth behind their backs and have embraced that which they were forbidden in the Mother Book.</p>

<p>O Thou at Whose most sweet call the spirits of the pure ones were attracted, and through Whose spiritual melodies the hearts of those who dwell in the Eternal Realm were filled with rapture! Through the manifestation of Thy Most Great Name the peoples were divided: the essences ascended to the loftiest heights, while the accidents remained in the nethermost earth. At the appearance of the mention of Thy Hidden Name, the faces of the lovers are set ablaze, the hearts of those attracted are enkindled, the hearts of those who love are moved, and the eyes of the yearning ones overflow with longing. Then blackened are the faces of those who turned away from Thy Most High, Most Great Beauty. Through the revelation of Thy Name, the All-Forgiving, the dawn of manifestation broke forth and the breeze of forgiveness wafted over all things hidden and manifest. Through the removal of the veils of glory from the face of the Divine Exemplar and the rising of the Luminary of Beauty from the horizon of majesty, the people of Baha drank of the Kawthar of meeting, then the purest nectar, then the crimson wine, then the water of life, then the stream of grace and bounty, then the fountain of eternity, then the crystal-clear waters from the hands of bestowal, then the subtle darkness from the cup of healing, then the hidden milk from the pearl of Thy Most Hidden, Most Concealed Name.</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the Throne and the Cloud, for having caused these subtle, delicate, sweet, compelling, penetrating, flowing rivers to stream forth from the direction of the throne of Thy oneness and the ocean of Thy Self-Subsistence for Thy loved ones and the people of Thy Cause, who have purified their eyes from gazing upon aught else but Thee and have freed their hearts, their souls and their spirits for the revelations of the Sun of Thy knowledge. Then praise be unto Thee, above all praise, O my God, for having enabled them to be steadfast in Thy Cause, firm in Thy love, and submissive to all that proceeded from Thee. This one, O my God, who at Thy glorious throne was named Nabil ibn Nabil - upon him be the waves of Thy favors and whatsoever beseemeth the billows of Thy generosity and bounty - hastened with his whole being to the court of Thy mercy until he attained all the good Thou hadst ordained in Thy Book. Therefore, O my God, I beseech Thee by Thy two Most Great, Most Mighty Names, since Thou hast honored him with arrival at the city of Thy presence and the Ka’bih of Thy meeting twice, to distinguish him with a third time as a favor from Thee, that the word concerning him may be fulfilled and Thy blessing upon him perfected, though Thou hadst already fulfilled Thy word to him and completed Thy blessing upon him. Yet this is grace upon grace, and favor upon favor. And if that be not ordained due to outward impediments, then send down from the heaven of Thy Will that which would establish its reward for him in Thy mighty tablets, for verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou pleasest, and Thou art the Protector, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>O my God! Among Thy near ones who love Thee were those who numbered there according to the letters of Thy Most High Name. One of them departed and two remained. Therefore, strengthen them with their third, O my Lord, the Most Merciful, that the encompassing lights of Thy Word, which Thou didst send down through the tongue of Thy Beloved before all things, may take their station. Verily, Thou art the Ruler over what Thou willest and the Doer of what Thou desirest. My soul be a sacrifice for Thy love!</p>
<p>The letter adorned with mention of the Lord of Eternity, which was inscribed by the firm, steadfast pen of certitude and assurance, arrived and was beheld. And whatsoever was recorded therein of the melodies of the birds of Paradise and the doves of the celestial garden in praise and supplication to the Beloved was presented and mentioned in the Most Holy Presence. The blessed Word, which was the source, spring and mine of infinite bounties, appeared from the horizon of the Mouth of Will, gazed with the glance of favor, and was directed toward thee. Blessed is the letter that was read before the Throne and whose praise of His mighty, beauteous Self was heard by the Divine Ear. O my spirit be a sacrifice for thee, O beloved one, for the Tongue of Grandeur spoke concerning thee that which perfumed all existence, both seen and unseen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whatsoever was expressed regarding the stations of powerlessness and nothingness in the presence of the Branches, Leaves and Twigs of the Divine Lote-Tree was presented at their holy, glorious feet. They showed perfect favor and spoke with wondrous, sublime mention and most high, exalted glorification, which this servant is to convey from their blessed tongue. Verily, He is the Bearer of mercy and the Sender down of blessing to whomsoever He willeth among His near servants. Verily, the Glory be upon you, O people of Baha, and upon those who love you in truth and certitude.</p>

And peace and blessings be upon the Dawning-Place of His names, the Dayspring of His attributes, the Source of His knowledge, the Wellspring of His Cause, and the Manifestation of His commandments and ordinances, through Whom the law of unity was established in the world and the mystery of oneness among the nations. Through Him God opened the door of hope to all in earth and heaven, through Him the light appeared and the mystery of the Mount was revealed. Were it not for Him the mysteries of eternity would not have been unveiled nor would the station of nations have been exalted - He Who was named Muhammad in the kingdom of names - and upon His family and companions whom God made the lamps of His guidance, the banners of His victory, the signs of His Cause, the manifestations of His power and the evidences of His might. Through them God conquered the world and His Cause flowed among the nations. And upon those who entered beneath their shadow, drank the choice wine of their love, tasted the sweetness of their utterance, and circled round their Cause in support of God’s religion and the exaltation of His Word.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the servant hath received your letter, and before it your other letter, and every letter therein spoke of your mention and praise. Our purpose and your purpose and the purpose of all in the heavens and earth… [prayer section already translated above]</p>
<p>I ask God the Exalted to assist me and your honors in what He loves and is pleased with. Verily He is the Lord of all creation, there is no God but He, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. By thy life, O my beloved, thy mention brings me joy as though it were a herald bearing me glad tidings. The servant asks his Lord to enable him to manifest what is in his heart and reveal what was hidden in his inner being regarding the degrees of his love and affection for you. Verily He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>As for what you mentioned regarding Darvish Ghulam-Husayn, upon him be God’s peace, We have sent him that which diffuses the fragrance of grace and favors. And regarding what you mentioned about Aqa Ahmad, upon him be God’s grace and bounty - excellent is what you intended regarding separation and detail lest there appear what is not befitting. The matter is known, uncovered, evident, requiring no mention or proof. The servant asks his Lord to preserve His servants and assist them in virtuous conduct. Verily He is the Creator, there is no God but He, the Ruler over what He wills, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful. I send greetings to the beloved ones and ask God the Mighty, the Praiseworthy for their protection and success. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon your honors and upon our brothers and beloved ones and upon God’s righteous servants. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>To his honor, the beloved of the heart, Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be 69 [Baha’u’llah] and His care. I convey greetings. At this time his letter was received and became a crown of joy. As there was no new matter, the response will be offered, God willing, at the time of meeting. As commanded, his honor the Afnan Aqa Siyyid Mu?sin, upon him be God’s most exalted peace, is preparing in detail - they are departing and they are arriving.

<p>Praise be to God Who hath manifested Himself in the horizons, at one time through His Name, the Best-Beloved, whereupon the hearts of His lovers were set ablaze with longing for His presence, and at another time through His Name, the Self-Subsisting, whereupon the veils of fancy were consumed and knowledge was confounded. Through Him the near ones arose to celebrate His praise and remembrance, and through Him every one that standeth hath stood firm, every speaker hath spoken, and every seeker hath turned unto Him. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who hath manifested Himself unto all creation through all His names, as a token of His grace. He is verily the Omnipotent Who hath ever been in the heights of glory, might, and majesty, and will ever continue to be what He hath been. There is none other God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>O beloved! I have received thy letter, and this evanescent servant became aware of it at a time when my heart was burning, mine eyes were weeping, and my tongue was crying out at seeing the people heedless of the Living Waters and turning away from the remembrance of the All-Merciful, through Whom the Hidden was revealed and the Treasured Secret was disclosed. I know not by what countenance they who have turned away from the Face of God, after all else hath perished, can yet turn, and how long they shall wait. Woe and destruction be upon them for what they have earned for themselves on this Day which God hath sanctified above all other days.</p>
<p>In truth, it is a source of a hundred thousand wonderments that while the ocean of divine favors is surging, the Sun of inner meanings is shining, and the heaven of bounty is raised high, all remain veiled, occupied with their own idle fancies and rejoicing therein. They have cast aside the Most Pure Wine and have taken the murky dregs. They drink thereof and perceive not.</p>
<p>In such a state as hath been mentioned, this evanescent servant attained unto thy luminous letter. Verily, the sweet fragrances of divine love were inhaled therefrom, perfuming the nostrils of the soul. I beseech God, exalted and glorified be He, to confirm thee at all times that thou mayest be engaged in the service of the Cause of God.</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst write concerning the deputy of the maternal uncle of his honor the Emigrant - upon them both be the Glory of God - it brought the utmost joy and delight. God willing, may they ever drink from the ocean of divine bounty and be engaged in His remembrance, that the ears of true divine knowledge may sprout forth from their hearts. Convey my greetings unto them on behalf of this evanescent one. Likewise, regarding his honor Aqa ’Ali-Akbar, God willing, he will soon turn with the utmost devotion.</p>
<p>O beloved of my soul! There hath never been and will never be any refuge, shelter, protector or asylum for anyone. Ere long thou shalt witness how all will turn toward the horizon of divine bounty. Most people are unaware and know not what matter hath appeared in the world. How many of the divines and worshippers who were in complete rejection last year, and this year their petitions of return, supplication and repentance have reached the Most Holy Court! Were all who are on earth to gather together in the hour when verses are sent down from the heaven of the Will of our Lord, the All-Bountiful, they would surely confess their impotence, shortcoming, and ignorance, and the power of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting - let alone any other station.</p>
<p>In any case, at an appropriate time this evanescent servant attained the Most Holy Presence and presented thy spiritual letter and its contents. From the horizon of grace, bounties were observed in person concerning thee and the souls mentioned therein. Previously also, a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed specifically for thee and sent through his honor the Trustee - upon him be the Glory of God. God willing, thou wilt attain unto it. Likewise, thy other letter which thou hadst written through his honor the Khan - upon him be the Glory of God - arrived and brought the utmost joy. The response thou hadst mentioned therein was also presented. The lips of the Beloved smiled, and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, saying: “Blessed is he for what he hath attained. It behooveth him to thank his Lord, the Bestower, the Generous, at all times.” His honor the Name of God M.H. - upon him be the Glory of God - mentioned thee in the Most Holy Presence. Blessed art thou for this supreme attainment.</p>
